2.370917901736573," Best Buy to lay off some store workers: WSJ (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc has notified employees that it would cut some jobs at its stores, the Wall Street Journal reported here on Wednesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic forces retailers to become more dependent than ever on online shopping. A Best Buy spokesman said the company does not comment on specific personnel matters, but added that its workforce would need to evolve to meet evolving needs of customers. “Customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital,” he said. Best Buy in April last year furloughed about 51,000 hourly employees as it closed stores due to COVID-19 lockdowns, although it brought some of them back after reopening to meet a surge in demand for home computer equipment and game consoles. The retailer has nearly 125,000 workers, according to its last annual filing."
-10.413170349475557," Pandemic fears, online deals thin U.S. Black Friday crowds NEW YORK (Reuters) - Masked shoppers turned up in smaller numbers at major U.S. retailers including Macy’s Inc, Walmart Inc and Best Buy Co Inc on Black Friday as early online deals and worry about the spike in COVID-19 cases dulled enthusiasm for trips to the mall. Retailers overhauled the traditionally busy shopping day that comes the day after Thanksgiving. Walmart opened stores at 5 a.m. on Friday, directing shoppers to turn right upon entering and proceed along main aisles to shop deals before paying at registers surrounded by plastic barriers. Best Buy opened at 5 a.m., employing workers in can’t miss orange vests to serve as traffic cops. Others offered temperature checks and “grab-and-go” merchandise, including toys, bikes and kitchen appliances to discourage lingering in store aisles. Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, estimated traffic at the King of Prussia mall outside of Philadelphia was down about 20-30% compared to last year. “I’m surprised at the traffic. It’s down a little bit but heavier than I thought,” he said but noted shoppers were not loaded down with packages. Elsewhere, shoppers with empty carts lined up a socially-distant six feet apart before the Walmart in LaGrange, Kentucky opened, but crowds appeared down overall. Stores selling popular computer game consoles had some of the longest lines as gamers tried to land Sony Corp’s PlayStation 5. Brothers-in-law Gabriel Rojas, 24 and Juan Cabrera, 24 were waiting in line at GameStop in New York’s Bronx borough, since 2 a.m. on Friday, hopeful to snatch up a PS5. They were unsuccessful as there were some 20 people ahead of them and the retailer only had two left in stock, they said. “We’re bummed” said Rojas. “But that’s ok.” Some had better luck. Roger Mustafa, 37, walked out of a Manhattan GameStop with a PS5 in a plastic bag and a huge smile on his face. It cost him $544 and a lot of sleep. “I’ve been waiting outside of GameStop for two days,” said Bronx resident Mustafa. “Now I’m going to go home and get some sleep.” At Macy’s New York flagship, Asuncion Peralta, 77, said she was not afraid to shop because she had COVID-19 antibodies. “I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time to buy towels and sheets, everything else that I need,” said Peralta. “These prices are not Black Friday prices. I came here two days ago and the deals were better.” During this pandemic-ridden year, retailers from Target Corp to Kohl’s Corp and Walmart  rolled out online winter holiday promotions in October to capture any holiday-related spending as early as possible. Upscale department store operator Nordstrom, which has seen its sales tumble in the pandemic, offered customers a $15 gift card if they picked up packages curbside at their stores. Overall, the National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts U.S. holiday retail sales will increase between 3.6% and 5.2% over 2019, for a total of $755.3 billion to $766.7 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 2.5% over the past five years. On Nov. 19, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deemed “going shopping in crowded stores just before, on, or after Thanksgiving” as a high-risk activity. Target employee Seth Schaffer, 22, from Lufkin, Texas, said shoppers in his store appeared less concerned about taking precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Deep east Texas isn’t the type of place where you’ll see everyone respecting mask policies or avoiding close contact.” Adobe Analytics expects Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2020 to still become the two largest online sales days in history, with Black Friday online sales between $8.9 billion and $10.6 billion. Melissa Bloss, who works at a bank in Rapid City, South Dakota, said she plans to do all her shopping online this year. “Most companies have been having sales throughout the month. I really don’t have a need to rush out when I can get the same deal a week later,” she said."
0.47887619433009926," Best Buy will exit Mexico as it scales back during COVID-19 crisis MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc will close all its stores in Mexico, the company said on Tuesday, as it anticipates weaker Christmas-season sales amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. The electronics retailer operated as many as 49 stores this year in Mexico, its smallest market. The vast majority of Best Buy stores are located in the United States, with more than 170 in Canada, according to a tally on its website. “During the quarter, we made the difficult decision to exit our operations in Mexico,” Best Buy Chief Executive Corie Sue Barry said in a call with analysts to discuss third-quarter results. “I want to thank the teams in Mexico for their tremendous work over the past several years. They should all be incredibly proud of their accomplishments.” She said the decision came as the company examined its business “from top to bottom,” including areas where it could cut back. “We viewed it as critical that the outcome of this analysis would ensure our focus and resources are closely aligned with the opportunities we see in front of us,” Barry said. She did not specify how many jobs would be lost. Mexican newspaper El Financiero reported that Best Buy will shutter its Mexican stores beginning Dec. 31, citing comments from Fernando Silva, president of the company’s Mexico unit. According to El Financiero, Best Buy already closed eight stores in Mexico this year, leaving it with 41 locations. “The effects of the pandemic have been deep, and it’s not viable to keep our business in Mexico,” Silva said in the El Financiero report. Best Buy’s third-quarter sales and profit beat market expectations, yet the company warned that growth looked uncertain for the remainder of the year."
0.47887619433009926," Best Buy expects holiday sales to slow as pandemic rages (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc held back its holiday-quarter view and warned on Tuesday that a boom in work-from-home purchases was likely to lose steam as rising COVID-19 infections in the United States threaten to eat into pre-Christmas consumer confidence. The electronic retailer, whose third-quarter sales and profit beat market expectations, said it does not expect quarterly revenue growth of more than 20% to continue into the holiday season, sending its shares down 6% in early trading. “It continues to be difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. We are seeing COVID cases surge throughout the U.S. and Canada at a time of significant holiday volume through our stores,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said, pointing to high unemployment. At least 20 million Americans were on unemployment benefits at the end of October and about 12 million of them will lose benefits when two government-funded programs expire a day after Christmas. Another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed is unlikely before then. CFO Bilunas said fourth-quarter sales for one of the few retail winners in the health crisis have been strong so far, but that was due to new game consoles from Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp as well as an earlier than ever start to holiday promotions. “We don’t expect sales trends to remain at the levels we experienced during Q3,” he said on a call with analysts. Meanwhile, Chief Operating Officer Mike Mohan said supplies of the hot new consoles will be limited through the holiday season. Best Buy’s comparable sales jumped 23% in the quarter ended Oct. 31, beating expectations of a 14.7% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It plans on resuming share buybacks this month. Total revenue rose 21.4% to $11.85 billion, while the company earned $2.06 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.70 per share."

-1.4842249651706014," In pandemic Christmas, U.S. rivals aim to challenge Amazon under the tree OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N, Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N and hundreds of smaller retailers are bolstering their online gift features, hoping to challenge Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O dominance as a seller of holiday gifts to homebound shoppers. The new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift’s price. Amazon’s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving. Consumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share. “This is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,” said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon’s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient. Walmart.com on Oct. 28 added a “gift eligible” label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging. With gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time. BestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered. Estee Lauder Companies Inc EL.N this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping. Americans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research. Adobe Inc's ADBE.O e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship gifts to 18% more recipients than a year ago as travel gets curbed. But Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019. Amazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon’s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1/2 times the rate over the same period last year. It pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon’s largest ever. The company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts and messages for some items, with links to let recipients initiate a return and send a thank you note. But some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card. “The gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,” said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked. Amazon said its gift features remain popular. Jeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper. Though Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he “learned his lesson.”"
-3.2875324324361763," Walmart, Best Buy extend Black Friday deals as spending habits change NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eager to capture any holiday-related spending as early as possible this year, Walmart Inc WMT.N, ASOS ASOS.L, Best Buy BBY.N and other major retailers are turning Black Friday into a multi-day promotion. Black Friday, held the day after the Thanksgiving public holiday, has long been one of the biggest shopping days of the year in the United States. Retailers count on customers opening up their wallets to score door-buster deals on gifts. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced retailers to drastically rethink how they do business as consumer spending habits prove unpredictable, and while Black Friday remains a major marketing event for retailers, its relevance had already been fading greatly in recent years due to early online promotions. “Amazon’s Prime Day (in October) marks the earliest start of the full assortment holiday shopping season in 50 years, as COVID permanently reshapes the holiday calendar,” said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at consulting firm Publicis Sapient. “Black Friday may not exist as a recognizable form this year.” That has forced many retailers to match and discount much earlier in the season to remain competitive. A slew of retailers including Walmart, Target TGT.N, Best Buy, and Kohl's KSS.N, have announced plans to roll out their winter holiday promotions in October too. Consumers getting a head start on holiday purchases could give retailers a better shot at increasing sales and improving revenue after “an incredibly challenging year,” Anderson added. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said on Wednesday it would offer Walmart shoppers reduced prices on everything from TVs to bath towels and blenders during three separate promotions across a handful of days in November, which will help reduce crowds. The promos will begin online at Walmart.com and continue in Walmart stores, the company said. On Tuesday, Best Buy sent an email to shoppers advertising deeply discounted laptops, tablets, printers and other items for their two-day ""Black Friday Prices Guaranteed Sale"" coinciding with Amazon's AMZN.O Prime Day. A Best Buy spokesperson said on Wednesday it would give shoppers more opportunities to bag deep discounts on electronics in the run-up to the holiday in November. ASOS Chief Executive Nick Beighton told Reuters on Wednesday the British online clothing retailer would also stretch its Black Friday promotions across several weeks."
1.6405215688198138," Best Buy warns of slowing sales after work-from-home boom (Reuters) - Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N warned of a slowdown in sales in the third quarter as it faces risks from the coronavirus pandemic including unemployment, lower government stimulus and potential product shortages. The company’s shares fell as much as 7.4% on Tuesday after it said sales growth, driven by record online demand for computers and electronic accessories since March, would ease from current levels of around 20%. Retailers like Best Buy have benefited from the trillions of dollars in unemployment checks and other aid pumped into households during the crisis, but consumer spending is expected to slow as job losses become permanent and recession sets in. “The stimulus provided confidence and a backdrop against which customers felt like they had purchasing and spending power,” Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said. “Going forward a lack of that stimulus may only underscore the heightened levels of unemployment.” In the second quarter, Best Buy's comparable sales rose 5.8%, beating the average expectation of a 3.7% increase, according to Refinitiv data, but far short of big-box retailer Target Corp's TGT.N 24% increase. The company said it was seeing shortages of some gaming products, where sales have been surging, thanks to kids shut at home by school closures. The availability of Sony Corp's 6758.T upcoming PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox Series X, would be clear only closer to their holiday season launches, Barry said. The company’s overall revenue rose nearly 4% to $9.91 billion and the company earned $1.71 per share on an adjusted basis, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.08 per share."

32.147328879706095," Best Buy sales get online boost, shares rise (Reuters) - Best Buy Inc BBY.N said on Tuesday its quarter-to-date sales rose about 2.5%, driven by a surge in online shopping for electronic devices and appliances, sending its shares up 4% in extended trading. The company, like other retailers, has been spending more on expanding its delivery network as more customers shop online due to the coronavirus crisis. Best Buy said its online sales jumped more than three-fold in the current quarter through July 18, while overall sales rose about 15% since it started reopening stores on June 15. The company, which had almost all its stores open as of June 22, has brought back about half of the 51,000 hourly employees it had furloughed in April. “Best Buy’s preliminary Q2 sales results, with stores only open for a relatively brief period, reflect the importance of its products and the effectiveness of its multi-channel model,” Moody’s retail analyst Charlie O’Shea said. Best Buy also said it would raise hourly wages for its employees by 4%, replacing its short-term incentive pay it introduced during the pandemic, from Aug. 2. It added it would raise the starting wage to $15 per hour. The company in May projected a hit to profit margins from investments in digital sales in the second quarter after reporting a 5.3% fall in first-quarter same-store sales. Earlier on Tuesday, Walmart Inc WMT.N said it would spend another $428 million on bonuses this year, to compensate its U.S. employees for catering to a surge in demand for essential goods during the pandemic."
47.183133302278755," Best Buy sees margin pressure as online demand raises delivery spend (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N said on Thursday it expects profit margins to be under pressure in the second quarter, as it spends more on expanding delivery services to support a surge in online shopping from people staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s shares, which have gained nearly 60% in the last two months, fell 3.5%. The electronics retailer was forced to shutter stores across the United States for weeks to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, but its outlets continued to provide curbside delivery for online sales, which surged over 155% on a comparable basis. Best Buy said it was also ramping up its same-day delivery services, as people stuck at home under lockdown restrictions shop more for monitors, printers and other work-from-home equipment, as well as gaming consoles. Online sales made up about 42% of Best Buy’s first-quarter domestic revenue of $7.92 billion, compared with just a 15% share a year earlier. “We expect that our online sales will continue to be high as a percentage of overall sales in the second quarter, which will continue to pressure the gross profit rate,” Chief Financial Officer Matthew Bilunas said on a call with analysts. Best Buy’s overall revenue fell 6.3% to $8.56 billion in the quarter ended May 2, but beat analysts’ expectations of $8.16 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Quarterly same-store sales fell 5.3%. The company, which furloughed 51,000 hourly U.S. store employees last month, said net earnings fell 40% to $159 million. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 67 cents per share, more than analysts’ average estimate of 44 cents per share.

The company said that starting next week, some corporate employees would also participate in voluntary reduced work weeks and furloughs, while its top management and board would take a pay cut. Best Buy, however, would retain about 82% of its full-time store and field employees. The company said sales grew about 25% during an 8-day period ended March 20, a day before the company announced its decision to switch to a curbside delivery model, as people shopped for work-from-home equipment, gaming-related products as well as products needed to freeze food. Best Buy added that domestic online sales surged over 250% from a year earlier, with half the sales coming from customers who picked-up their products from stores. However, store closures and decreased footfall have dented demand, and sales dropped 30% from March 21 through April 11, Best Buy said. “The situation remains very fluid and there is still a great deal of uncertainty, particularly as it relates to depth and duration of store closures and consumer confidence over time,” Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said. The company has already withdrawn all financial forecasts for fiscal 2021 and drawn down the full amount of its $1.25 billion revolving credit facility.

1.9125121236854508," Best Buy warns of profit, sales hit on coronavirus fallout (Reuters) - Retailer Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N forecast largely lower-than-expected annual profit and sales on Thursday as electronics makers curb manufacturing due the coronavirus epidemic, sending the shares down 4%. The tepid forecast overshadowed robust online demand for smartphones and tablets during the crucial holiday season that helped the company beat quarterly profit and sales estimates. In mainland China, electronics manufacturers are grappling with a logistical nightmare as many of the workers they depend on cannot return to work, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions. Earlier this month, Apple Inc AAPL.O said manufacturing facilities in China that produce its electronics were ramping up more slowly than expected, after the virus outbreak forced them to temporarily shut down operations. “This is a very fluid situation, which makes it difficult to determine exact financial impacts from disruptions in supply chain,” Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said. The company forecast fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $6.10 to $6.30, largely below expectations of $6.25. It expects same-store sales growth of flat to 2%, compared with expectations of a 1.9% rise, and said this reflects its best estimate of the coronavirus impact. In the fourth quarter, Best Buy’s overall same-store sales rose 3.2%, beating analysts’ average estimate of a 1.9% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company has proved to be an outlier among big retail names such as Walmart WMT.N and Target TGT.N as investments to beef up its e-commerce business helped it benefit from a record online shopping during the holiday season. The consumer electronics retailer has tweaked the appearance and features of its app and added next-day delivery and pick-up-in-store services. The company’s domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.7% to $3.52 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 1. “Given that Target called out electronics as a weak area, the Best Buy results come as something of a relief,” Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group said. “The company’s investments in online and mobile commerce clearly bore fruit in the quarter.” Revenue rose 2.7% to $15.20 billion, beating the estimate of $15.05 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.90 per share, ahead of expectations of $2.75 per share. Net profit rose 1.4% to $745 million in the quarter."

Investment platforms came under scrutiny in June when the flagship equities fund of then star stockpicker Neil Woodford was suspended after failing to meet redemption requests from investors. “Firms operating Best Buy lists must construct them impartially and manage conflicts, for example preference for funds offering discounts over formal and objective criteria, lack of independence of research teams and associated governance,” the FCA said in a letter to investment platforms. “Processes for clear selection, monitoring and deselection of funds on lists should be documented, understood and followed.”"

Walt Disney Co was the top boost to the Dow Jones with a 1.8% rise, after a report its streaming service was averaging nearly a million new subscribers a day. The stock also propped up the benchmark S&P 500. Rising hopes of a U.S.-China trade truce, upbeat domestic economic data and a third-quarter corporate earnings season that has largely topped lowered expectations have put the market back on an upward track after a torrid summer. Beijing said on Tuesday negotiators had reached a consensus on “resolving relevant problems”. Hours later, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Washington was getting “really close” to a deal, but sticking points remained. “They keep talking about the ‘phase one’ deal being done possibly soon, but every day is sort of a ping pong back-and-forth of will they or won’t they,” said Everett Millman, precious metals expert with Gainesville Coins in Tampa, Florida. A third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year has also played a role in boosting risk appetite, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday monetary policy was “well positioned” to support the strong labor market. However, doubts over the strength of the U.S. consumer linger and data on Tuesday showed the Conference Board’s U.S. consumer confidence index missed analysts’ projections. At 10:31 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.16 points, or 0.07%, at 28,086.63, while the S&P 500 was up 2.10 points, or 0.07%, at 3,135.74. The Nasdaq Composite was up 11.59 points, or 0.13%, at 8,644.08. Best Buy Co Inc jumped 7.4% as it forecast strong holiday-quarter earnings, while discount store operator Dollar Tree Inc tumbled 15% after the company projected holiday-quarter profit below expectations, signaling the fallout from the trade dispute. The stock was the biggest on the S&P and the Nasdaq. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co fell 7.9% as the enterprise software maker missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.50-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

1.3454605960931403," Best Buy signals robust holiday shopping demand with upbeat forecast (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N signaled it expected a strong holiday shopping season by forecasting fourth-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, sending shares of the biggest U.S. consumer electronics retailer up over 8%. Target Corp TGT.N and Walmart Inc WMT.N have already predicted strong sales in the crucial period between Thanksgiving and Christmas that can account for as much as 40% of annual sales for U.S. retailers faced with a slowing economy. U.S. consumer spending is slowing faster than economists had expected and the latest data has showed pockets of weakness, including in electrical appliances, which are Best Buy’s main market. However, Best Buy's investment in subscription-based repair and tech support services where online retailers like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O still lag has helped it stay out of the retail gloom by pulling in more customers to its stores. Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said the company was well prepared for the holidays with new products, strong inventory levels and faster delivery for online purchases. “The typical Best Buy customer is at or slightly above median income, and this group is currently thriving,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. “At the same time, there are an increasing number of new consumer electronics products that have captured interest, including items in the mobile, smart home and wearables categories, all of which Best Buy excels at.” Best Buy expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, largely above Wall Street expectation of $2.65, and also forecast upbeat same-store sales growth. The company also raised its full-year outlook, in contrast to discount store operator Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O that cut its forecast, citing tariffs on Chinese imports. In the third quarter, overall same-store sales rose 1.7%, beating analysts’ average estimate of a 1.3% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

27.947112883413833," Best Buy's sales forecast falls short as tariffs loom (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N blamed planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports and uncertainty about future consumer behavior for a lower annual sales forecast, becoming the latest company to air concerns about President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing. Best Buy’s shares, which have lost more than 10% of their value so far this month, fell 9% to $62.80 as the consumer electronics retailer’s same-store sales outlook fell short of analysts’ expectations even as it lifted its earnings forecast. Strong July retail sales showed U.S. consumer demand so far has remained resilient to signs of a cooling economy and an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. However, investors are increasingly focusing on how the sector will cope with new rounds of tariffs with retailers, such as Macy's Inc M.N and Abercrombie & Fitch Co ANF.N warning that their profits this year would take a hit. Best Buy said it expected its full-year same-store sales to rise 0.7% to 1.7%, narrowing the range from a prior forecast of 0.5% to 2.5% and below the 2% growth target analysts had expected. Last Friday, Trump said tariffs would rise to 15% from 10% on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting some of Best Buy’s best selling goods including smart watches, flat panel TVs, mobile phones and video game consoles. The levies are set to go into effect in two phases on Sept. 1. and Dec. 15. Newly appointed Chief Executive Office Corie Barry said the company was still working out if and how to raise prices on products as it works with suppliers on new sourcing strategies. “It’s the most difficult place for us to make projections... We don’t exactly have a precedent for the quantity of moving pieces that we have in place right now,” Barry told analysts. Barry estimated all the proposed and implemented tariffs affected about 60% of Best Buy’s cost of goods sold but said the company was working on lowering that to 40% next year. Best Buy’s overall same-store sales rose 1.6% in the second quarter ended Aug. 3, missing analysts estimates of a 2.15% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Earnings per share excluding one-off items came at $1.08, beating analysts’ estimates of 99 cents per share and prompted Best Buy to raise its annual adjusted profit forecast to $5.60 to $5.75 per share from previous $5.45 to $5.65$. The company’s profit benefited from better expense control and more subscribers signing up for its high-margin services such as “Geek Squad”, which provides general tech support and advice on setting up smart homes. Revenue in the reported quarter rose 1.7% to $9.54 billion, a touch below expectations of $9.56 billion, largely due to lower demand for video game consoles, which the company said would also pressure its sales for the rest of the year. The lower demand is largely due to consumers postponing their purchases in anticipation of the next versions of Sony Corp's 6758.T PlayStation and Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox. Best Buy also forecast third quarter same-store sales below estimates, but said tariffs would not have much of an impact on the quarter."

0.6914583720607647," Apple says iPhones can now be fixed at all U.S. Best Buy stores (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Best Buy Co Inc said on Wednesday that they have extended a partnership that will allow the Minneapolis-based retailer’s technicians fix iPhones at any Best Buy store in the United States. The deal between the two companies will cover all 992 U.S. Best Buy stores, up from about 225 stores previously. In addition, 7,600 of Best Buy’s so-called Geek Squad technicians now certified to carry out the repairs and using parts directly from Apple. Apple also carries out repairs at its stores, but there are several U.S. states - including Vermont, West Virginia, both Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming - with no Apple Store. Apple said that it now has 1,800 third-party repair providers in its U.S. network, three times as many as three years ago and enough to put eight out of 10 of its customers in the United States within a 20-minute drive of an authorized repair center. Apple has faced criticism in the past from groups who say the iPhone maker has made its devices too difficult to repair by refusing to make genuine Apple parts available to independent repair shops. Apple has also lobbied against attempts to pass so-called right-to-repair laws in several states, which would require the company to provided the necessary parts and information to do so. Apple executives have told Reuters the company is seeking to ensure the quality of repairs. ""We endeavor to make it right at the same standard as when the customer bought the product,"" Brian Naumann, senior director of service operations at Apple, told Reuters here in 2017, when Apple made Best Buy the first entity outside of Apple to receive a secret machine for repairing cracked iPhone screens. Keeping the 900 million iPhones worldwide in service has become more important to Apple than ever as it shifts toward a services-based business of trying to persuade its customers to sign up for paid offerings such as Apple Music and iCloud. The past two years of updates for the iPhone's operating system have focused on making it run faster on older devices. Last February, Chief Executive Tim Cook surprised Wall Street analysts here by saying he viewed the booming iPhone resale market as ""incredibly positive."""
1.366090882221185," Best Buy keeps full-year view, warns of higher prices from more tariffs (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc on Thursday stuck to its full-year forecast due to the impact of the latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports and warned any new levies would increase prices for U.S. shoppers, sending its shares down as much as 5.4%. The consumer electronics retailer’s commentary on the impact of tariffs overshadowed its better-than-expected profit in the first quarter and solid second-quarter forecast. “The impact of tariffs at 25% (proposed to be enacted) will result in price increases and will be felt by U.S. consumers,” outgoing Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said in a conference call with analysts. The world’s largest retailer Walmart Inc last week warned that its prices would increase due to higher tariffs, while Macy’s Inc said higher levies were already hurting its furniture business. The proposed new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of goods from China includes higher levies on imports like smartphones and laptops and would likely result in higher retail prices. “In a maturing category like smartphones, which lacks a compelling reason for consumers to upgrade in the near-term, we expect to see volumes decline in response to higher prices,” said Jason Benowitz, fund manager at Roosevelt Investment Group. Gross profit margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 23.7%, as high margin services, such as “Geek Squad” that provides general tech support and advice on setting up smart homes resonate with customers. An increasing share of Best Buy’s sales also comes from online, where it has been investing more to beef up delivery and its “click and collect” business that helps shoppers buy products online and collect them later from the stores. Domestic comparable online sales rose 14.5% to $1.31 billion, making up for 15.4% of total revenue in the quarter. Excluding one-time items, Best Buy earned $1.02 per share in the first quarter ended May 4, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 86 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Best Buy forecast adjusted profit for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.95 to $1 per share, above Wall Street expectations of $0.96 per share. Its current quarter forecast for same-store sales too was largely above estimates. (The story corrects CEO’s name to “Hubert” from “Huber” in paragraph three.)"

3.878467230048046," Best Buy replaces turnaround chief Joly with longtime CFO (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc on Monday named Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry as the company’s chief executive officer, the first woman to lead the consumer electronics retailer in its 53-year history. Barry, who joined Best Buy in 1999 and went on to become its finance chief in 2016, will become the company’s fifth CEO when she takes over from Hubert Joly, who will step aside to become executive chairman in June. Barry along with Joly, a restructuring expert, turned around the struggling retailer that had been dogged by falling same-store sales and a takeover battle with founder Richard Schulze. She has also held several operational roles in her tenure, including heading the integration of health services provider GreatCall Inc, which Best Buy bought last year for $800 million. But much credit goes to Joly who, despite lacking a retail background, was instrumental in beefing up the company’s website, delivery options and tech support services making it a formidable force in a world increasingly dominated by Amazon.com. Under Joly, the company has also placed emphasis on membership services like its “Geek Squad” tech support to boost margins as the importance of matching prices with online competition becomes ever more essential to keep customers visiting its stores and website. In Joly’s near 7-year tenure as CEO, Best Buy’s same store sales have risen for the past five years, while its shares have grown four-fold. However, after announcing the move, Best Buy’s shares fell as much as 1.2 percent in morning trading. “Investors appreciate the amazing job Hubert has done for the last eight years and the downtick reflects some fear of change,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. Incoming CEO Barry, on a call with the media, said she would continue Best Buy’s business strategy without any major shifts or leadership changes. Joly on the call said he would continue to advise Barry on key matters such as mergers and acquisitions, as he sits right across the hall from Barry’s office in Richfield, Minnesota. Telsey Advisory Group’s analyst Joseph Feldman said, “She is a strategic thinker who helped develop the turnaround strategy with current CEO Hubert Joly and has been at his side laying the plan for the future.” “If ever there was a CFO suited to be CEO, it is Ms. Barry.”"

Judge Frank’s ruling is obviously great news for Best Buy and its lawyers at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who changed the course of the case when the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals -- in the first appellate interpretation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Halliburton v.

There’s a lesson for other securities class action defendants from Best Buy’s tenacity: It’s expensive to litigate shareholder class actions to the circuit courts and back but sometimes the cost-benefit analysis cuts against settling when you first lose a class certification decision. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. The more important message from the Best Buy case, though, may be the relatively limited impact of the 8th Circuit’s analysis of Halliburton. As you know, the Supreme Court held in Halliburton that although shareholders are entitled to a presumption that investors relied on corporate misstatements, defendants can rebut that presumption. In practice, the Supreme Court’s ruling meant that securities class action defendants could attempt to block class certification by showing that alleged misrepresentations didn’t impact the price of shares. The justices left considerable ambiguity about the burden and standard of proof to show a lack of price impact. The 8th Circuit’s ruling in Best Buy, which said defendants need only to show some evidence in order to shift the burden to shareholders to prove price impact, buoyed defense hopes that Halliburton would turn out to be a powerful weapon. But the ruling hasn’t gotten much traction. Based on Westlaw’s tally of decisions citing the 8th Circuit’s Best Buy decision, only a couple of trial courts have adopted the appellate court’s reasoning on how defendants can rebut the presumption. Other trial courts have disagreed with the 8th Circuit’s view of which side bears the burden of proof. Most significantly, in a pair of 2017 rulings in class actions against Petrobras and Barclays, the 2nd Circuit adopted a much tougher rebuttal standard, shunting aside the 8th Circuit’s Best Buy analysis as dicta. The 8th Circuit’s ruling, in other words, meant everything for Best Buy but not much for anyone else. That said, Judge Frank’s handling of the Best Buy case after remand from the 8th Circuit is worth recounting because future securities defendants will surely try to replicate arguments that worked so well for Simpson Thacher and its client. Based on the docket, shareholders’ lawyers from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd did not consider the 8th Circuit’s class decertification decision to be a death blow for their case. In 2017, citing Judge Frank’s previous class certification decision, they asked for leave to file a renewed motion for class certification. Their key argument was that although the 8th Circuit had held that Best Buy’s share price did not rise in response to that 2010 conference call with analysts, the appeals court did not address shareholders’ “price maintenance” theory. Robbins Geller said it had engaged an expert witness who would testify that the alleged conference call misrepresentations kept Best Buy shares trading at an artificially inflated price. Judge Frank, however, read the 8th Circuit decision as the final word on price impact. In June 2017, he refused (2017 WL 2728399) even to allow Robbins Geller to file its renewed motion for class certification. Shareholders’ own original expert witness, Judge Frank said, opined that the conference call statement didn’t impact Best Buy share prices, as the 8th Circuit noted in its decertification decision. So price maintenance arguments by a new expert, the judge said, are foreclosed by the conclusions of shareholders’ previous expert. “The 8th Circuit was clear that plaintiffs had failed to show price impact,” Frank wrote. “The court is bound by that determination.” The case still wasn’t over, though: Robbins Geller moved to amend the shareholders’ complaint, arguing for the revival of previously dismissed claims that Best Buy issued a misleading press release two hours before the allegedly misleading conference call. The company’s share price did rise significantly between the press release and the analyst call, so if shareholders were permitted to bring claims based on the public announcement, they’d have a better shot at establishing price impact and winning class certification. But Judge Frank adopted a magistrate judge’s recommendation against allowing shareholders to file an amended complaint, paving the way for Best Buy’s motion for summary judgment on claims by the individual named plaintiff. Simpson Thacher argued that the lead shareholder testified he did not rely on, or even listen to, the conference call in which corporate officials allegedly misrepresented the company’s prospects. Robbins Geller countered that Judge Frank had effectively prevented shareholders from litigating as a class, but did not contest that the lead investor didn’t rely on the alleged misrepresentations. Judge Frank said in Friday’s ruling that without reliance, the case is over. It’s hard to imagine another case with precisely parallel facts but not so hard to foresee defendants arguing, especially in trial courts in the 8th Circuit, that under Best Buy, they need only provide some evidence casting doubt on price impact to block class certification irreversibly. Shareholders’ lawyer Shawn Williams of Robbins Geller said investors are weighing their options after Friday’s decision."
-4.2881602105471845," Best Buy shares surge 16 percent on upbeat profit view, robust holiday quarter (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc shares surged 16 percent on Wednesday after it gave an upbeat profit forecast for the year and reported better-than-expected holiday-quarter sales. The company, which cited the frenzy for battle royale game “Fortnite” for a boost in sales of gaming gear, also announced an 11 percent boost to its quarterly dividend and a plan to buy back $3 billion of stock. Best Buy’s report comes after a largely disappointing holiday season for retailers, which have struggled to compete with online sellers such as Amazon.com Inc. Best Buy has managed to ward off pressure from Amazon by focusing on customer services that has helped drive both store and online sales. Investments in its online business and expansion of services that encourage customers to set up smart homes and provide advice on purchase of televisions and appliances have resonated with consumers and boosted sales. A $199-per-year “Total Tech Support” program launched in May, which includes unlimited support online and in stores, saw 1 million members sign up by the end of the year, the company said. “We continued to drive efficiencies and reduced cost in order to find investments and offset pressure,” Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said on a post-earnings call. During fiscal 2019, the company achieved $255 million in cost reductions, adding to its fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million in savings. “The key is that Best Buy has matched its operating expenses with its revenues, has focused on share repurchases, and is managing to grow same-store sales through increases in appliance sales and the offering of value added services,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. The company also benefited from the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings Corp and J.C. Penney Co Inc’s exit from the appliance business. Best Buy’s domestic online revenue surged 9.3 percent to $2.96 billion in the fourth quarter on a comparable basis. Domestic comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3 percent in the three months ended Feb. 2, with growth across wearables, appliances, smart home and gaming, being partially offset by a decline in sales of mobile phones. Best Buy forecast fiscal 2020 adjusted profit of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, the mid-point of which was above analysts’ expectations of $5.49. Excluding items, it earned $2.72 per share, while analysts expected $2.57. Revenue fell 3.7 percent to $14.80 billion, as the year-ago quarter had an extra week, but still came above expectations of $14.70 billion."

-4.342162654452682," Best Buy boosts profit forecast, cautious on holiday earnings (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N raised its full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday, as the largest U.S. consumer tech retailer sold more mobile phones and home theater systems, but stayed cautious on its outlook for the holiday shopping season. Shares in Best Buy bounced back by midday and rose some 4 percent following a rocky start in premarket trading after its holiday-quarter earnings forecast fell largely short of Wall Street estimates. Besides introducing features on its website and mobile app geared to younger customers, Best Buy is touting its tech support and advice to win shoppers deserting malls for Amazon AMZN.O and other online stores. The company began a $199-per-year “Total Tech Support” program in May, which includes unlimited “Geek Squad” support online and in stores. Best Buy’s U.S. same-store sales climbed 4.3 percent in the third quarter ended Nov. 3, topping analysts’ expectations of a 3.7 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its overall earnings and revenue also topped Wall Street expectations. “Senior management (at Best Buy) deserves significant credit for successfully reconfiguring the company’s business model, so as to compete effectively in an increasingly online and omni-channel retail landscape,” Oppenheimer & Co analyst Brian Nagel said in a report. Minnesota-headquartered Best Buy also said the latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports affects about 7 percent, or $2.3 billion, of its cost of goods sold, and that it was working with vendors to mitigate the impact on its business. ‘APPROPRIATELY CONSERVATIVE’ Best Buy predicted tepid holiday-quarter earnings, raising fears that weak demand for Apple Inc's AAPL.O newest iPhones was already starting to show up in the results of major retailers. Recent reports of lower demand for new iPhones make it likely that Best Buy expects weak smartphone sales, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. A year earlier, Best Buy said the delayed launch of the iPhone X cost the company more than $100 million in sales in the third quarter. The company, which gets nearly half its U.S. revenue from mobile phones and computers, said it expects adjusted earnings of between $2.48 and $2.58 per share for the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.58. The forecast may be “appropriately conservative,” said Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group, as Best Buy prepares for a competitive holiday season. Profits could also be pressured as Best Buy spends heavily on new tech support services, faster delivery and distribution centers that have greater capacity to house fast-selling products."

-14.955899393109357," Slowing online sales hurt Best Buy's second quarter, shares drop (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N on Tuesday reported a drop in quarterly online sales growth and offered a profit forecast for the current quarter that fell short of analyst estimates, sending its shares down more than 5 percent in afternoon trading. Chief Executive Hubert Joly in a conference call cited a maturing online consumer electronics business for declining web sales growth and said rising transportation costs may pressure current quarter earnings. Best Buy shares, which have risen over 20 percent since the start of the year, fell as much as 8.4 percent on Tuesday. The stock price decline was fueled by a combination of factors like a slowdown in online sales, the impact of future expense plans and investor fears the recent strength in performance may not be sustainable, Jason Benowitz, analyst and senior portfolio manager at The Roosevelt Investment Group said. “Investors fear that (Best Buy) could be vulnerable to further digital disruption or any signs of a peak as the tax cut stimulus fades and the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy late in the economic cycle,” he said. The U.S. consumer electronics retailer said in a statement that domestic online sales rose 10.1 percent in its second quarter ended Aug. 4. That compared with 12 percent in the first quarter and 31.2 percent in the same period a year ago. Best Buy’s third-quarter profit forecast also disappointed some investors. The retailer said it expects adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents to 84 cents, lower than analyst estimates of 92 cents per share. Joly said on the conference call that consumer electronics is a more mature category online, in discussing the slow uptick in online sales in the second quarter. “Consumer (electronics) is one of the first categories that started to move online. So the overall penetration is higher than in other categories,” Joly said. The company’s investments in making its stores more competitive are bringing more shoppers to its brick-and-mortar locations for products like appliances and large screen televisions, he added. Joly said higher transportation costs could pressure profits in the third quarter. However, he added investors should find comfort after the retailer raised its annual sales and earnings guidance. Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea agreed with Joly. “I think it is important to look at the whole picture with Best Buy and not pieces, more people are shopping at their stores, their overall performance this quarter is strong and that is something the street needs to understand,” O’Shea said. Online sales make up 15 percent of the company’s total domestic sales and represented a 15 percent share of the U.S. consumer electronics market as of March. The company has doubled its web business in the past five years. The retailer expects full-year comparable sales to grow 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent versus its original guidance of flat to 2 percent. It also revised its earnings outlook upward to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 from $4.80 to $5.00 per share. The company said it expects a dip in its third quarter operating income, consistent with its expectations from the start of the year. The company’s online sales and profit forecast for the current quarter overshadowed second quarter sales and profit performance helped by a strong economy. Excluding charges, Best Buy earned 91 cents per share in its second quarter. Analysts expected 83 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $9.38 billion, beating estimates of $9.28 billion. Earlier this month, the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer said it would buy health services provider GreatCall Inc for $800 million in cash, its largest acquisition ever, hoping to sell health-related products and services to an aging U.S. population."

-10.747129252354744," Best Buy to acquire health services company GreatCall for $800 million (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc said on Wednesday it would buy health services provider GreatCall Inc for $800 million in cash, its largest acquisition ever, as it focuses on selling products and services to an aging U.S. population. The No. 1 U.S. consumer electronics retailer currently sells health and wellness-related products and has sold GreatCall merchandise for a decade as a retail partner. Privately held GreatCall, with annual revenue of $300 million, offers personal emergency response services for senior citizens along with mobile products and connected devices and has over 900,000 paying subscribers, Best Buy said. The acquisition offers Best Buy an opportunity to combine GreatCall’s offerings with its merchandising, marketing, sales and services capabilities, the retailer’s Chief Executive Hubert Joly said in a statement. The health space is a large, growing market in which technology can address the needs of aging consumers, their caregivers and payers. There are approximately 50 million Americans over age 65, a number that is expected to increase by more than 50 percent within the next 20 years, Best Buy said. Moody’s retail analyst Charlie O’Shea said he views this transaction as a long-term investment, with short-term profitability as a secondary consideration. “The $800 million price tag can easily be covered out of existing cash balances and operating cash flow,” he said. The transaction is likely to close by end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, subject to regulatory approvals. Best Buy said it expects the impact of the acquisition on its non-GAAP earnings to be neutral in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 and accretive to earnings by fiscal 2021. GreatCall was founded in 2006 and is based in San Diego. Its products offer one-touch connections to U.S.-based, trained agents, who connect the user to family caregivers, provide general concierge services, answer questions and dispatch emergency personnel. GreatCall will operate as a separate unit and the company’s Chief Executive Officer David Inns will remain in his position after the sale closes, Best Buy said. The retailer’s shares, which have risen nearly 12 percent since the start of the year ended 2.7 percent down at $76.38 per share on Wednesday."
