15.672622601303852," U.S. Treasury launches 20-year bond to help finance record borrowing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday it will launch a long-planned 20-year bond and increase securities auction sizes across a range of maturities to raise cash to meet record government borrowing needs caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak. Treasury also made clear it intends to try and move away from its current focus on Treasury bills that have helped raise urgent funds over the past six weeks in favor of spreading debt over a longer maturity structure over the coming quarters. That said, Treasury noted it would continue to fill some of its financing needs with regular issues of cash management bills. The department has issued more than 30 cash management bills since mid-March, compared with two in February. “While the initial increases in financing related to the COVID-19 outbreak response were focused on Treasury bills, Treasury expects to begin to shift financing from bills to longer-dated tenors over the coming quarters,” Brian Smith, Treasury’s assistant secretary for federal finance, said in a statement. “In light of the substantial increase in borrowing needs, Treasury plans to increase its long-term issuance as a prudent means of managing its maturity profile and limiting potential future issuance volatility,” he added. Following the announcement, yields on the U.S. 30-year bond rose to their highest level since April 14 and yields on the 10-year note also climbed. In the statement, Treasury said it intends to increase auction sizes across all nominal coupon tenors over the May-to-July period, with the increases larger in the 7-year, 10-year, 20-year and 30-year categories. The largest increase will be on the 10-year note. It also plans to “modestly” increase auction sizes for floating-rate notes, but keep auction sizes for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities unchanged. On Monday, the department said it expects to borrow $2.999 trillion during the April-June quarter, five times larger than the previous single-quarter record set during the 2008 financial crisis. Congress has appropriated nearly $3 trillion in recent weeks as it seeks to stem the economic harm on businesses and households from widespread business shutdowns implemented to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. As previously flagged, Treasury will offer a 20-year bond, in an initial offering size of $20 billion, with the first auction taking place on May 20, 2020. The overall offering size over the next three months of $54 billion is more than recommended by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee. A senior Treasury official told reporters strong demand was anticipated for the 20-year bond, and that the difference was partly due to the committee’s estimate having been formulated before the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s clear that the Treasury is starting to finance out the debt faster than most people anticipated. Even as people knew that the deficit is going to grow, expectations on the 20-year bond were in the teens to low-teens, but they start with $20 billion,” said Jim Vogel, senior rates strategist at FHN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. The department also said it is offering $96 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $57 billion of privately-held Treasury notes and bonds maturing on May 15, 2020. Treasury’s previous record for borrowing for a full fiscal year was $1.8 trillion in 2009."

-11.639935330024965," Yields on U.S. 10-year, 5-year TIPS turn negative as virus fears mount NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Yields on 10-year and five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) fell into negative territory on Monday as investors fretted about the global economy amid fears about the impact of the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Aside from being a tool investors can use to protect against a pick-up in inflation, yields on TIPS are a barometer of market sentiment about the economy. Similar to a declining U.S. government bond yield, a falling TIPS yield is a sign investors are worried about the prospects for economic growth “This shows how much distress is coming into the Treasuries market,” said Jim Vogel, senior rates strategist, at FHN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. “It has also shown that it’s quite possible that even if the global economy can recover from the coronavirus, inflation maybe slower to come back,” he added. The death toll from the virus rose to 81 on Monday, with more than 2,800 infected. A small number of cases linked to people who traveled from Wuhan, China, have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, including Thailand, France, Japan and the United States, but no deaths have been reported outside China. Cambodia confirmed its first case on Monday. U.S. 10-year TIPS yields fell to their lowest in more than four months, while those on five-year TIPS dropped to a 2-1/2-month trough. In late trading, U.S. 10-year TIPS yields were last at -0.024%, compared with a positive yield of 0.011% late on Friday. Yields on U.S. five-year TIPS slid to -0.128% , from Friday’s -0.110%. The U.S. 30-year TIPS yield was not negative just yet, but it was the lowest in a month on Monday and last traded at 0.329% . (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Tom Brown)"
-12.884923803825615," TREASURIES-Yield curve steeper on decent U.S. data; TIPS lifted (New throughout) NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. yield curve was steeper on Tuesday in the wake of good economic data, while 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities real yields moved back above zero and five-year TIPS rose, though remained in negative territory. The U.S. trade deficit fell to a more than three-year low in November as imports declined, weighed down by the Trump administration’s trade war with China. Exports rebounded, suggesting the economy ended 2019 on solid footing. “The trade balance was a lot more than anticipated, so that has positive implications for GDP being revised higher,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president, fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson. An Institute for Supply Management report on the U.S. services sector showed its Purchasing Managers Index at 55.0 in December, above expectations and the highest since August. That comes after an ISM manufacturing index last week fell short of expectations. The 10-year yield was last up 1.4 basis points at 1.827%, with the two-year yield roughly flat at 1.547%. A steeper yield curve signals improving sentiment about the economy but low expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. The yield curve, measured as the spread between two- and 10-year yields was last at 27.7 basis points, up from its last close at 26.2. The positive economic news led yields higher following big drops last week on heightened tension between Iran and the United States. Mideast risks rose after a top Iranian military commander was killed by a U.S. air strike, which pushed investors into safe-haven assets, propping up Treasury prices. The Washington-Tehran conflict has also driven up oil prices, and with them, the price of inflation-protected securities. Prices of both fell on Tuesday as concerns about the conflict moderated. Five-year TIPS real yields remained in negative territory for the fourth trading day, falling on Jan. 3 to the lowest level since April 2017. Meanwhile, 10-year TIPS traded above zero after going negative on Jan. 3 for the first time since September 2019. “I don’t think it’s that surprising that real yields have gone negative,” said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. With the Fed having lowered overnight rates to just over 1.5%, anytime they approach their inflation target of 2%, that should produce negative real yields, said Hill. On Tuesday afternoon the Treasury Department sold $38 billion of three-year notes to average demand. Direct bidders took 16.7% of the offering, indirect bidders took 47.5% and dealers took 35.8%.

-12.884923803825615," TREASURIES-Yields flat on mixed data; 10-year TIPS turn positive (Adds TIPS section; updates yields) NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Yields were stable on Tuesday, little changed across maturities after mixed U.S. data, while 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities real yields moved back above zero and five-year TIPS held at negative levels. The U.S. trade deficit fell to a more than three-year low in November as imports declined further, weighed down by the Trump administration’s trade war with China, and exports rebounded, suggesting the economy ended 2019 on solid footing. “The trade balance was a lot more than anticipated, so that has positive implications for GDP being revised higher,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president, fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson. In other positive news, an Institute for Supply Management report on the U.S. services sector showed its Purchasing Managers Index at 55.0 in December, above expectations and the highest since August. The ISM manufacturing index last week fell short of expectations as trade tensions between the United States and China slowed activity. “The non-manufacturing sector, which is the greater part of the economy, is definitely more important,” said Hurley. Still, further evidence of the contraction in manufacturing helped constrain yields on Tuesday. The 10-year yield was last 0.7 basis point higher at 1.818%. The Commerce Department on Tuesday said new orders for U.S.-made goods fell in November, pulled down by declines in demand for machinery and transportation equipment. The two-year yield, which reflects market forecasts for interest rates, was 0.1 basis point lower at 1.547%. Five-year TIPS real yields remained in negative territory for the fourth trading day, falling on Jan. 3 to the lowest level since April 2017. Meanwhile, 10-year TIPS traded above zero after going negative on Jan. 3 for the first time since September 2019. “I don’t think it’s that surprising that real yields have gone negative,” said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. With the Fed having lowered overnight rates to just over 1.5%, anytime they approach their inflation target of 2%, that should produce negative real yields, said Hill. “If anything I’ve been a little surprised by how long this process has taken,” he said, explaining that the dip below zero did not happen sooner because of a significant drop in breakevens in July 2019 when the trade war intensified. “Had breakevens even stayed close to 2% we would have gone negative on a real basis much faster.” On Tuesday afternoon the Treasury Department sold $38 billion of three-year notes to average demand.

Primary dealers, or the top 24 Wall Street firms that do business directly with the Federal Reserve, received 10.63% of the $7 billion in 30-year TIPS offered 912810SG4=, resulting in their yield to be sold at 0.501%, which was the lowest yield at an auction of this maturity since October 2012. “Dealers ended up with very little, but the lack of any follow-through buying suggests that their small takedown was by design,” Tom Simons, senior money market strategist at Jefferies LLC, wrote in a research note. Traders and investors turned their focus on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Friday at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. They await whether Powell may signal the U.S. central bank is prepared for a series of rate cuts to counter the threat from a softening global economy and trade tensions between China and the United States. Indirect bidders, which include fund managers and foreign central banks, were allotted 81.62% of the 30-year TIPS supply, marking their second-largest share ever at such an auction. Direct bidders which include smaller bond dealers and certain large investors acquired 7.75% of the supply, which was their biggest share since June 2017. The ratio of bids to the amount of 30-year TIPS offered came in at 2.70, the strongest reading on overall demand since June 2017. On the open market, the yields among TIPS and regular Treasuries scaled back from their earlier highs after the latest 30-year TIPS sale."

The core rate on personal consumption expenditure, which Fed policy makers prefer over the consumer price index as their measure of the inflation trend, grew at a 1.0% pace in first three months of 2019 from a year earlier.

Still, some have acknowledged the risk on domestic growth from a protracted trade battle between China and the United States. “Thank goodness any price weakness can be safely dismissed as transient,” Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial wrote in a research note. “Or, at least, that’s the way the Fed, safe in the knowledge that what it does is right and what happens in the markets and in the real world is wrong, will likely conclude.”"

2.9679631059838205," BlackRock makes case to own more U.S. TIPS NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, on Monday recommended investors hold more U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) as the Federal Reserve is expected to refrain from raising short-term interest rates in the coming months. The U.S. central bank also signaled it is open to allowing inflation to rise above its 2 percent goal to compensate for years that it has missed that desired target level, the company’s global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill said. “The Fed has confirmed its intent to be patient with its next rate move and may let inflation temporarily breach its 2 percent target,” Turnill wrote in a research note. “Along with a slowing but growing economy, we believe this makes TIPS an attractive alternative to nominal bonds.” So far in 2019, TIPS have produced a total return of 1.08 percent, compared with a 0.06 percent loss among regular Treasury bonds, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. Inflation expectations, as measured by the difference between the yields of TIPS and regular Treasuries known as breakeven rate, have recovered from their dramatic drop in late 2018, as investors lost confidence about the economy due to trade tensions between China and the United States. Investors had also grown worries about further rate hikes from the Fed before policy-makers took a dovish shift at their policy meeting in late January. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate fell to 1.69 percent at the start of the year before touching 1.96 percent last Friday, which was its highest level in nearly three months, Tradeweb data showed. To be sure, TIPS would lose their relative attractiveness to regular Treasuries if the U.S. economy slips into a recession and the Federal Reserve were to begin cutting interest rates, which Turnill said were unlikely to happen in 2019. Investors have shifted $430 million back into TIPS-focused funds so far this year after withdrawing some $4.8 billion from them in the final quarter of 2018, according to data firm Lipper. “We see potential for TIPS to play a valuable role in portfolios in the near term,” Turnill wrote."

Earlier, inflation breakeven rates, or the yield spreads between TIPS and regular Treasuries, were higher as domestic oil prices rebounded from their lowest in more than a year. TIPS breakeven rates have fallen on worries about slowing global economic growth and sagging oil prices. Analysts projected decent demand for the latest 10-year TIPS supply despite a weakening outlook on inflation as the 10-year TIPS yield, which is hovering at its highest in more than seven years, would entice income-oriented investors. “That attractiveness on an outright basis will likely inspire buying at a liquidity point in one of the more illiquid Treasury securities,” BMO Capital Markets U.S. rates analyst Ben Jeffery wrote in a research note.

3.7224463006319484," UPDATE 1-U.S. 5-year TIPS yield hits 9-year peak as supply changes * TIPS 30-year yield reaches highest since Jan. 2016 * TIPS rattled with rest of bond market in October (Adds quote, graphics) NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The yield on U.S. five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities rose to a nine-year high on Wednesday as the government, as expected, said it will hold an additional five-year TIPS auction and will drop a 30-year TIPS auction in 2019. Thirty-year TIPS yield retreated after hitting its highest since January 2016 following the federal government’s refunding announcement for November. The U.S. Treasury Department’s change in TIPS issuance is part of the government’s broader borrowing scheme to finance a widening budget gap due to a massive tax cut enacted last December and a federal spending agreement reached in February. “The move was largely telegraphed. The TIPS market did react a bit. It will be interesting to see how much liquidity you can cram into the five-year sector,” said Com Crocker, senior inflation strategist at New Century Advisors based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. At 1:03 p.m. (1703 GMT), five-year TIPS yield was 1.050 percent, up about 3 basis points from late on Tuesday after touching 1.077 percent, its highest since September 2009, Tradeweb data showed. Thirty-year TIPS yield climbed to 1.319 percent, which was its highest since January 2016 before subsiding to 1.284 percent, marginally higher on the day. The TIPS sector had a rough October as the bond market was roiled by stock market turbulence, lower oil prices and bets on further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. “It’s been a rough month for TIPS. TIPS have given back a lot of their year-to-date outperformance versus nominal Treasuries due to the risk-off trade, energy weakness, and ongoing Fed tightening,” Crocker said. Oil prices fell from four-year highs reached in early October. They were poised for their worst monthly performance since July 2016. As of Monday, TIPS produced a month-to-date loss of 1.16 percent, steeper than the 0.22 percent drop for nominal or regular Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. On an annual basis, TIPS were down 0.94 percent, compared with a 1.73 percent loss for nominal Treasuries."
3.7224463006319484," U.S. Treasury to boost auction sizes, create new TIPS issuance WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday it will increase the size of debt auctions in the coming months, an indication of a rising federal deficit and a shrinking bond portfolio at the U.S. Federal Reserve. The announcement stems from both an extended stretch of U.S. economic growth, which has led the Fed to reduce support for the economy, as well as a $1.5 trillion tax cut package under President Donald Trump that has widened the federal deficit. GRAPHIC: U.S. Treasury bill and note issuance interactive graphic - tmsnrt.rs/2O5H6Fh The government closed the 2018 fiscal year with a deficit of $779 billion, its widest in six years. Borrowing costs have also been rising as the U.S. central bank raises short-term interest rates while also reducing its holdings of long-term federal government bonds. On Wednesday, Treasury said it was increasing the sizes of its 2-year, 3-year and 5-year note auctions by $1 billion per month over the next two months. In November, it will increase the size of its 2-year fixed rate note auction by $1 billion and also boost the size of auctions for 7-year and 10-year notes as well as 30-year bonds by the same amount during the month. Treasury said it was also creating a new 5-year inflation-protected security issuance, with its first auction to be held in October 2019. The department hopes the new issuance will lower debt finance costs by filling a gap in market demand for inflation-adjusted securities, known as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). By having more 5-year TIPS auctions, investors will be better able to “price the seasonality” of inflation readings into market prices for TIPS, Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement."

The ratio of bids to the amount offered 9128284H0= was 2.78, up from 2.55 at the prior five-year TIPS auction in April. US5YTIPINV=RR Investor demand for TIPS has been improving as the government’s consumer price index, its broadest inflation measure, climbed at its fastest year-over-year pace since January 2012 in July. On the other hand, the market’s inflation outlook has softened on worries about a possible drag on global economic growth from escalating trade conflicts between the United States and its major trading partners, analysts said. Still, the latest U.S. TIPS auction signaled investor appetite for this type of bond as their yields have risen. That meant less pressure on primary dealers, or the top 23 Wall Street firms, to buy a heavy chunk of the five-year TIPS supply. “Looks like the Street got what it needed, so we don’t expect anyone to come and chase it,” Jefferies & Co.’s money market strategist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.

-5.34399172753305," UPDATE 1-U.S. TIPS breakeven rates fall as Turkey woes overshadow CPI data (Updates market action, adds quote, graphic) NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - TIPS, the U.S. bond market’s main gauge of the inflation outlook among investors, fell on Friday as worries about Turkey’s economy overshadowed data that showed further improvement in the underlying domestic inflation trend. U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to slap higher duties on Turkish steel and aluminum on Friday widened the rift between Washington and its NATO ally. This exacerbated investors’ jitters about Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s policies to deal with an economy saddled by double-digit inflation. The plunge of the Turkish lira on Friday, in its biggest one-day loss since Turkey adopted a floating-currency regime in 2001, spooked investors who flocked into U.S. Treasuries, dollar and other perceived safe-haven assets. In times of market turbulence, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) often underperform regular or nominal Treasuries. Still analysts were encouraged by July report on the consumer price index. The CPI core rate that excludes volatile food and energy prices grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, the strongest reading since September 2008. “There’s a lot of underlying strength in today’s CPI report,” said Com Crocker, senior inflation strategist at New Century Advisors based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. At 3:04 p.m. (1903 GMT), the yield spread between five-year TIPS and regular five-year Treasuries, or the 10-year inflation breakeven rate, was 1.98 percent, flat from late Thursday. Earlier Friday, the five-year TIPS breakeven rate hit 1.97 percent, the lowest in about six months, according to Tradeweb and Reuters data. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was 2.10 percent, more than one basis point lower than Thursday and near a three-week low. TIPS breakeven rates reached near four-year peaks back in May. A firming inflation backdrop was not enough to push the TIPS market higher. The sector has been bogged down by expectations that inflation data would soften in the latter half of the year, and by withdrawals from TIPS exchange-traded funds, Crocker said. “TIPS have languished this summer due to negative seasonals and outflows from TIPS ETFs,” he said. TIPS mutual funds and ETFs experienced outflows for a third straight week. Their assets fell by nearly $155 million to $79.94 billion in the week ended Aug. 8, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit. “TIPS funds are still outperforming nominal Treasury funds, but they are not getting retail investors that excited,” Crocker said. Year-to-date, TIPS have produced a loss of 0.44 percent , less than a 1.32 percent loss on nominal Treasuries , according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays."
