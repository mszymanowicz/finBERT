-26.618566808513318," Brazil's Eletronuclear to sign letter of intent with Westinghouse SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run nuclear power company Eletronuclear and U.S.-based Westinghouse WAB.N will sign a letter of intent on Feb. 3, according to a statement on Thursday from the Mines and Energy Ministry. The ministry did not give any details on the contents of the agreement. Brazil under President Jair Bolsonaro is attempting to jump start its stagnant nuclear industry, particularly by finishing construction of its long-delayed third major nuclear power plant Angra 3. But Westinghouse was not on the short list of companies selected by state nuclear power company Eletronuclear as potential partners for completing Angra 3, Eletronuclear President Leonam Guimaraes told Reuters in October. Guimaraes said Westinghouse was also interested but the company focuses on nuclear technologies and Brazil wants a partner to help with construction. Beyond Angra 3, Brazil’s mines and energy minister also aims to promote uranium mining domestically and said the country could partner with the United States on building small nuclear reactors."

GE announced last year that it would merge its transportation business with U.S. rail equipment manufacturer Wabtec in a more than $11 billion deal, leaving GE and its shareholders with just under half of the combined business. GE said on Monday it would distribute 8.7 billion shares to shareholders on Feb. 14. Based on the number of shares of GE and Wabtec common stock outstanding on Dec. 31, GE shareholders are also expected to get about 0.005403 of a share of Wabtec common stock for each share of GE share held. Following the closing of the deal, Wabtec will own 50.8 percent of the combined company, with GE and its shareholders owning the rest."
2.155302975696682," China's fourth Westinghouse-designed nuclear reactor begins operations SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s fourth Westinghouse-designed AP1000 reactor went into full operation after a trial run this week, the operator said, marking the completion of the first phase of the project after years of delays. China signed a deal with the U.S. firm in 2007 to build four reactors, hoping to create a platform for Beijing’s ambitious nuclear power expansion plans, but the roll-out of the unproven “third-generation” technology has been beset by safety concerns and design problems. The second unit of the Haiyang nuclear power project on the eastern coast of China’s Shandong province is now ready to go into full commercial operation after 168 hours of full-load operations, China’s State Power Investment Corp said in statement on Thursday. China put the world’s first AP1000 into operation at Sanmen in Zhejiang province last September, four years later than originally scheduled. Two more went into operation at Sanmen and Haiyang later in the year. The AP1000 is designed by U.S.-based Westinghouse, which was acquired by Brookfield Business Partners BBU_u.TO from Japan's Toshiba last August following bankruptcy restructuring. The completion of the project brings China’s total nuclear capacity up to 45 gigawatts, with 46 reactor units in operation throughout the country. Nuclear makes up about 2.5 percent of the country’s generation capacity. China has scaled back the pace of new reactor approvals and no new conventional project has been given the go-ahead in more than three years. It is now expected to fall short of its 2020 target to have 58 gigawatts of working capacity and another 30 gigawatts under construction. At the government’s annual energy meeting in December, officials made no commitments to approving and building any new projects in 2019, saying only that projects now under construction would be “pushed forward in an orderly manner”."
-21.960525600424024," Second China Westinghouse reactor goes into operation SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A second Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor on China’s eastern coast is now ready to go into full commercial operation after a week-long trial run, the project’s operator said late on Tuesday. The State Power Investment Corp (SPIC) said in a notice posted on its website that the first unit of the Haiyang nuclear reactor project in Shandong province completed a 168-hour full-load test late on Monday evening. The reactor unit began construction in 2009 and was finally connected to the grid in August. China gave the go-ahead to build four Westinghouse-designed AP1000 reactors in 2007. The first unit at Sanmen in Zhejiang province was originally scheduled to go into full operation in 2014, but the unproven “third-generation” technology has been beset by years of delays as a result of safety concerns and unanticipated design problems. Unit 1 at Sanmen was finally declared ready to go into full commercial operation last month, making it the world’s first AP1000 reactor to be completed. Westinghouse, owned by Japan’s Toshiba, hoped China would serve as a shop window for its AP1000 design, which boasts enhanced “passive” safety features as well as higher levels of generation capacity. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy last year after its nuclear projects in the United States were also hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns. China also hoped that AP1000 technology would be at the center of its own ambitious nuclear power plans after signing a technology transfer agreement in 2006. But after a root-and-branch industrial safety review in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011, China’s nuclear program has slowed considerably, and it is now unlikely to meet its 2020 capacity targets."
8.743510538156164," Westinghouse eyes Saudi, India deals as end to bankruptcy nears * Westinghouse sees no regulatory roadblocks to takeover * Brookfield to recapitalise the bankrupt reactor builder * Westinghouse resumes talks with India on six-reactor deal * Company confident it will be on Saudi tender shortlist By Geert De Clercq PARIS, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear firm Westinghouse expects to emerge from bankruptcy with sufficient equity in coming weeks and is targeting Saudi Arabia and India for new reactor sales, its CEO said. Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management in January agreed to buy Westinghouse from Toshiba for $4.6 billion after cost overruns on U.S. reactors pushed the atomic energy pioneer into bankruptcy in March 2017. Westinghouse CEO Jose Gutierrez said the Brookfield deal would close as soon as it had been approved by U.S. and British nuclear regulators and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). “We are confident we will get those approvals in the next few weeks, we don’t see any roadblocks,” Gutierrez told Reuters at the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris. Once the deal is closed, Westinghouse will officially emerge from bankruptcy and Brookfield will recapitalise the firm. “We will have the right capital structure and the necessary cash for running our business,” Gutierrez said. The amount of money to be injected is under discussion. Westinghouse hopes sales will get a boost when the first of four long-delayed AP1000 reactors in China starts up this year. Gutierrez said fuel had been loaded in the Haiyang 1 reactor on Tuesday and the Sanmen 2 reactor was waiting for permission to load fuel. The Haiyang 2 had finished hot functional testing and would be ready to load fuel soon, he said. Sanmen 1, in Zhejiang province, loaded fuel in April, ran its first nuclear reactions in June and is set for commercial operation by November, Chinese authorities said this month. Contracts for the four reactors - two at Sanmen and two at Haiyang in Shandong province - were signed in 2007-2009. The first one had been scheduled to launch in 2014. Gutierrez said Chinese authorities expect two or maybe three AP1000s will connect to the grid before end of 2018. Projects for six more AP1000s in China are pending and Westinghouse expects China will build a fleet of at least 20 AP1000s in the coming decade. As Westinghouse has transferred the technology to China it will not benefit from new builds, but expects to earn money on providing fuel and maintenance. About 85 percent of Westinghouse revenue comes from fuel and services, only about 15 percent from building new reactors. Not having a working AP1000 has hampered Westinghouse and other vendors have won major tenders instead. This month, Russia’s Rosatom stole a march on Westinghouse with a contract to sell four VVER-1200 reactors. Two of those will be built at Xudaobao in northeast China, on a site once earmarked for Westinghouse. In April, Westinghouse received strong support from U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry for its plan to build six AP1000s in India, a massive project set in motion by a U.S.-India agreement 10 years ago. But since Toshiba will no longer act as master builder, there are doubts about the plan. “Now that we are emerging from Chapter 11, we are resuming conversations with India,” Gutierrez said. Westinghouse is also waiting for Saudi Arabia to decide on a shortlist of two to three bidders to build two nuclear plants. Besides Westinghouse, state-owned companies from Russia, France, China and South Korea are in the running. “It is a reality that the other four bidders are countries and we are a private company,” Gutierrez said, adding that he was confident that Westinghouse would be on the shortlist. The Saudi authorities had been due to decide at the end of March. Once the shortlist is made, bidders will discuss business models and financing, a process that will take at least another year before Saudi Arabia picks a winner. Gutierrez said that during its bankruptcy, Westinghouse - which sells services, fuel and spare parts to almost 80 percent of world’s 450 reactors - had not lost a single contract. Gutierrez had no news on Toshiba’s attempts to sell its NuGen unit, which has a project to build reactors in Britain. Westinghouse is also working on finalising two AP1000 reactors in Vogtle, Georgia by 2021. Two other AP1000s under construction in the United States were abandoned, half-built as costs got out of hand. (Reporting by Geert De Clercq Editing by Edmund Blair)"
12.153617009595742," GE to merge transportation unit with Wabtec in $11.1 billion deal (Reuters) - General Electric Co GE.N announced a $11.1 billion deal on Monday to merge its transportation business with U.S. rail equipment manufacturer Wabtec Corp WAB.N, with GE and its shareholders owning just over half of the combined business. The deal, first reported by Reuters on Sunday, is the biggest to be inked thus far by GE Chief Executive John Flannery since he announced a major overhaul of the U.S. industrial conglomerate late last year. The transaction values the GE transportation business, which makes train engines, at $11.1 billion. GE will receive a $2.9 billion up-front payment in cash and a 9.9-percent stake in the combined company, with GE shareholders awarded 40.2 percent and existing Wabtec shareholders owning 49.9 percent. GE shares rose 2.8 percent to $15.39. Wabtec shares rose 4.3 percent to $99.28. The deal is tax-free for GE and Wabtec shareholders because it is structured as a so-called Reverse Morris Trust, with GE spinning off the transportation unit and simultaneously merging it with Wabtec. The $11.1 billion deal value includes a $1.1 billion net tax benefit accruing to the combined company, GE and Wabtec said. The equity value of the company combining Wabtec and GE’s transportation business will be more than $20 billion. The deal caps a review of the transportation division by GE dating back to last year after a string of setbacks for the 126-year-old company. But it also follows years of on-and-off talks between Wabtec and the GE unit about combining, Wabtec Chief Executive Raymond Betler told Reuters in an interview. “We’ve always been quite interested. There has been a relationship between (us) that goes back decades,” he said. “For a whole host of reasons, the stars kind of lined up this time, and it presented an opportunity for us to actually get it done.” Betler will remain president and CEO of the merged company while its chairman, Albert Neupaver, has been re-appointed executive chairman. GE Transportation Chief Executive Rafael Santana will become president and CEO of Wabtec’s freight segment. The resulting company will have approximately $8 billion in revenues, with 27,000 employees across 50 countries, the companies said. The transaction is expected to close in early 2019. GE's transportation business, which generated revenue of $3.9 billion last year, is already larger than its sole close peer in the railroad engines business, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N, selling equipment and services to a global fleet of roughly 23,000 locomotives, Santana said. The deal will add more offerings that can improve efficiency and safety to GE's customers, which include Komatsu Ltd 6301.T and Rio Tinto PLC RIO.L, as well as Wabtec's client base which includes Siemens AG SIEGn.DE and Bombardier Inc BBDb.TO, Santana added. Wabtec, which has a market capitalization of $9.2 billion, manufactures equipment for locomotives, freight cars, and passenger transit vehicles. Flannery told GE shareholders late last year he plans to pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare, a departure from the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch. That should include GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE’s stock has lost about half its value in the last year, and the company has been working with activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP, which sits on its board of directors, to turn the business around."

12.153617009595742," Exclusive: GE nears deal to merge transportation unit with Wabtec - sources (Reuters) - General Electric Co GE.N is nearing a deal to merge its transportation business, which manufactures train engines, with Wabtec Corp WAB.N, a U.S. maker of equipment for the rail industry, two people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. A deal valuing the combined business at more than $20 billion could be announced as early as this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. It would be the biggest deal thus far to be inked by GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, who took over last August with a mandate to slash costs and boost the U.S. industrial conglomerate’s plummeting stock price. There is always a possibility that the deal talks, which center on using a tax-efficient structure called a Reverse Morris Trust, could collapse at the last minute, the sources cautioned. GE and Wabtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Flannery told GE’s annual shareholder meeting last month that the company is “keenly aware of the pain” caused by its poor performance and dividend cut last year. Executives are trying to turn around the ailing power and oil and gas businesses, he told shareholders, adding that there is evidence of “green shoots” of improvement. GE has taken several actions to prune its portfolio over the years, shedding plastics, NBCUniversal and most of its GE Capital business. It also combined its oilfield services business with Baker Hughes BHGE.N. GE’s transportation business, which generated revenue of $4.7 billion, manufactures freight and passenger trains, marine diesel engines and mining equipment, among other products. Wabtec, which has a market capitalization of $9.2 billion, manufactures equipment for locomotives, freight cars, and passenger transit vehicles. Following a board of director shake-up, Flannery has pledged to cut $2 billion in cost for 2018 and to slash the company’s once-coveted dividend in half. GE’s stock has lost about half its value in the last year, and the company has been working with activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP, which sits on its board of directors, to turn the business around. A Reverse Morris Trust transaction allows a company to avoid a big tax bill by spinning off a unit that it wants to divest and simultaneously merging it with another company."

Fuel was loaded in the evening of April 25 after the reactor met design and installation requirements, according to a statement posted on the website of China’s State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) on Saturday. The unit is expected to start operations soon. The AP1000 was originally expected to make its debut in Zhejiang in 2014, but it is more than three years behind schedule, dogged by safety concerns and design changes. China aims to complete two long-delayed, foreign-designed third-generation reactor projects this year - the Westinghouse AP1000 in Zhejiang and the first unit of the Taishan European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) project designed by France’s Areva in Guangdong. Westinghouse, owned by Japan’s Toshiba Corp and to be bought by a unit of Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc , is one of the world’s leading suppliers of nuclear fuel and provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world’s 450 commercial reactors. Beijing aims to boost the country’s total installed nuclear capacity to 58 gigawatts by the end of the decade from 35.8 gigawatts at the end of 2017. It also plans to have another 30 gigawatts under construction by the end of 2020. China plans to start construction on six to eight nuclear reactors this year and increase its total nuclear generating capacity by as much as 6 gigawatts.
