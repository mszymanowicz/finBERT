6.6831457885948495," UPDATE 2-Motor racing-Founder Head returns to struggling Williams F1 team * Co-founder Head working with Williams again * Former champions struggling at back of grid (Adds Russell, Davidson quotes) MANAMA, March 29 (Reuters) - Williams co-founder Patrick Head has returned to the Formula One team as a consultant after they started the season with an uncompetitive car that even their own drivers say is fundamentally flawed. The 72-year-old Briton, who founded the team with Frank Williams in 1976 and oversaw a string of title-winning cars in the 1980s and 90s, stepped away in 2011 but retains a nine percent shareholding. Williams finished last overall in 2018 and technical head Paddy Lowe, the man who had ultimate responsibility for this year’s car, left on a ‘leave of absence’ before the season started. The British team said at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Friday that Head, famously blunt in expressing his opinions, was “currently offering some support to our engineering team on a short-term consultancy basis.” A spokeswoman said he had started this week at the Grove factory. “I think it will be great,” the team’s British rookie George Russell told reporters. “He’s a very strong character, with a lot of personality and maybe that’s what we need at the moment. “With all of his experience and the history he has at Williams, just having him around will lift everybody.” Williams, the third most successful team in Formula One history with nine constructors’ crowns and 114 grand prix wins, have not won a race since 2012. They face an uphill struggle with a car that was more than three seconds slower than Ferrari in practice in Bahrain. “It doesn’t take just one person to turn a team around,” said former F1 driver Anthony Davidson, a pundit for Sky Sports television. “As experienced as Patrick Head is, I can’t see him turning up and making that difference with just cracking the whip a bit, which he’s renowned for. A touch of the old school? Who knows. It might work but I have my reservations about it.” The car was also late to be finished, missing the first two days of pre-season testing, and spare parts are in short supply. Deputy principal Claire Williams, daughter of Frank, played down concerns expressed by Polish driver Robert Kubica who said on Thursday that he would have to play safe on track to avoid any damage. “Inevitably we’ve got a little bit of a backlog from not having got the car out when we needed to in testing but everyone’s worked really hard at the factory to make sure we’ve got the spares we need,” Williams told Sky Sports television. “We’ve got spares for all the parts that we need. We’ve just got to make sure that the drivers don’t do anything on track to jeopardise that,” she added. “I think a lot of teams at this time of year anyway are in a similar kind of position, clearly we didn’t help ourselves but it’s not anything that I’m overly concerned about.” Russell, last year’s Formula Two champion, said in Australia that the car had a ‘fundamental problem’ that would take months to fix.

5.565157581311525," S&P analyst must face insider trading charges over merger of paint makers NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday rejected requests by a Standard & Poor’s credit ratings analyst and a friend to dismiss criminal insider trading charges related to the $9.3 billion merger of paint makers Sherwin-Williams Co and Valspar Corp. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said the indictment’s failure to allege that the analyst Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz and Jeremy Millul, a jeweler in Manhattan’s Diamond District, shared a “meaningfully close personal relationship” didn’t matter because it said Pinto-Thomaz had an “intention to benefit” Millul. Pinto-Thomaz’s lawyer, Henry Mazurek, said prosecutors would not be able to prove their case at trial. “We are disappointed that the Court denied Mr. Millul’s motion to dismiss the insider trading charges,” said Millul’s lawyer, Michelle Shapiro. Prosecutors accused Pinto-Thomaz of tipping Millul and another friend in March 2016 about the impending merger after learning about it confidentially at work, and that the friends made about $300,000 trading on his tips. Pinto-Thomaz and Millul argued that a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision rejecting the Manhattan federal appeals court’s narrow view of insider trading left intact that court’s requirement that a tipper and tippee share a close relationship for there to be insider trading. But Rakoff, who has called on Congress to simplify insider trading law and bemoaned courts that have “somehow managed to complicate” it, said that relationship isn’t required if there was a quid pro quo or an intention to benefit a tippee. “The indictment’s allegations that Pinto-Thomaz gave information to Millul with the intention to benefit Millul is directly, explicitly encompassed by (a Supreme Court) rule concerning ‘intention to benefit the particular recipient,’” Rakoff wrote. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment. S&P had suspended Pinto-Thomaz when the charges were announced in June, and his employment ended in July, according to a spokesman for the firm. The other friend, Abell Oujaddou, who runs an upscale hair salon in Manhattan’s Flatiron District, pleaded guilty to insider trading in October. Millul is trying to sever his case from Pinto-Thomaz’s so that he is not unfairly implicated in Oujaddou’s trading. Shares of Valspar surged 23 percent on the first trading day after Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams announced it would buy the company. The merger closed on June 1, 2017. The case is U.S. v. Pinto-Thomaz et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00579."

14.52630305139666," U.S. charges S&P analyst, 2 others with insider trading in paint merger NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday criminally charged a Standard & Poor’s credit ratings analyst and two friends, all from Manhattan, with insider trading related to Sherwin-Williams Co’s $9.3 billion purchase of Valspar Corp. According to prosecutors, the analyst Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz, 32, tipped Abell Oujaddou and Jeremy Millul in early March 2016 about the impending transaction between the two paint makers, after learning about it in confidential memos at work. Oujaddou, 55, who runs an upscale Manhattan hair salon, and Millul, 31, who manages a jewelry boutique in Manhattan’s Diamond District, allegedly made about $300,000 of illegal profit by buying Valspar shares and options, and selling them after the merger was announced on March 20, 2016. Prosecutors also said that after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began examining trades in Valspar that occurred before the announcement, Pinto-Thomaz lied to S&P by denying he knew Oujaddou and Millul. Sherwin-Williams, which is based in Cleveland, agreed to buy Valspar for $113 per share, 35 percent above where it traded before the all-cash merger was announced. Shares of Valspar rose about 23 percent on the next trading day. S&P spokesman John Piecuch said Pinto-Thomaz has been suspended, and that the unit of S&P Global Inc is cooperating with authorities. “We hold our employees to the highest standards of honesty and integrity and take adherence to our compliance policies very seriously,” Piecuch said in a statement. A lawyer for Pinto-Thomaz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oujaddou’s lawyer had no immediate comment. Michael Bachner, a lawyer for Millul, said his client denied wrongdoing and will defend himself. All three defendants were arrested on Tuesday, and charged with securities fraud and conspiracy. Each faces up to 20 years in prison on the securities fraud counts. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against the defendants. Sherwin-Williams completed the purchase of Minneapolis-based Valspar on June 1, 2017, after divesting $431 million of assets. The cases are U.S. v. Pinto-Thomaz et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-mag-05432; and SEC v Pinto-Thomaz et al in the same court, No. 18-05757."
