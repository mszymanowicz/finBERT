30.759414364064398," UK prosecutor loses battle against KBR over extra-territorial reach LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was wrong to try and compel U.S. engineering, procurement and construction company KBR Inc to hand over documents held overseas during an investigation, the UK Supreme Court ruled on Friday. In a judgment that deals a blow to the investigator and prosecutor’s abilities to gather overseas evidence, senior judges unanimously reversed a 2018 lower court ruling that so-called Section 2 notices could have extra-territorial reach. “The presumption against extra-territorial effect clearly applies in this case because KBR Inc is not a UK company, and has never had a registered office or carried on business in the UK,” they said. The SFO said Section 2 powers were fundamental to its ability to investigate multinationals with complex corporate structures, but that it welcomed the court’s clarification. KBR said it was “pleased”. The SFO opened a bribery and corruption investigation into KBR’s British business in 2017. But after a degree of initial cooperation, KBR Inc challenged a Section 2 notice handed to a U.S.-based senior executive in July 2017 during a London meeting to discuss the investigation. KBR Inc said the notice was “ultra vires”, or beyond the SFO’s legal authority, because it sought material held outside the UK, that the agency should have relied on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) from U.S. authorities and that the notice could not be handed to an officer temporarily in the jurisdiction. MLA -- when enforcement authorities exchange information in different nations -- is a more cumbersome route to securing evidence than Section 2 notices. Failure to comply with such an order can lead to imprisonment or a fine. But its powers are enshrined in a 1987 law that largely pre-dates complex, multinational corporate structures and the easy digital transfer of documents. Lawyers said the old law might be ill-suited to the modern age but that it was not the role of the courts to rewrite statutes to further a public interest in investigating crime. “The judgment is a welcome reminder of the presumption against extraterritoriality in English criminal law,” said Andrew Smith, a partner at law firm Corker Binning. Judith Seddon, a partner at Ropes & Gray, called the decision a “victory for principled statutory interpretation”. The SFO still has Overseas Production Orders, a new power introduced in 2019 to speed up the MLA process to secure electronic data held overseas if a co-operation treaty exists between jurisdictions. Companies seeking to avoid prosecution can also voluntarily cooperate with the agency."
15.329451321210666," Pieridae says KBR will not provide fixed-cost contract for Nova Scotia LNG plant (Reuters) - Pieridae Energy Ltd PEA.V said on Monday that KBR Inc KBR.N will not provide a fixed-cost contract to build the Canadian energy firm's proposed Goldboro liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Nova Scotia, and Pieridae said it is exploring its legal options. Pieridae in April had delayed making a final investment decision to build the $10 billion project until after Sept. 30 as government efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak cut global economic growth and energy demand. In June, KBR, a U.S.-based engineering firm, said it planned to exit most LNG and other energy projects. “We are looking at all of our options, including discussing the matter with legal counsel to determine the most appropriate next steps,” Pieridae’s chief executive, Alfred Sorensen, said in a statement. “KBR’s decision to no longer provide a fixed-price contract is in apparent contravention of its obligation under the terms of a signed services agreement dated March 27, 2019,” Pieridae said. Officials at KBR were not immediately available for comment. Pieridae is one of several companies developing North American LNG export plants that have delayed projects as global gas prices TRNLTTFMc1JKMc1 dropped to their lowest levels in years in an oversupplied market in 2019, and then plunged to record lows in 2020 with the coronavirus-induced collapse in demand. Goldboro is designed to produce almost 10 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, or about 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. Pieridae has a 20-year agreement to sell all of the LNG from the first liquefaction train at Goldboro - about 5 MTPA - to German utility Uniper SE UN01.DE starting between Nov. 30, 2024 and May 31, 2025. Pieridae said Uniper has agreed to extend the FID deadline to June 30, 2021. Pieridae said it expects construction to take about 56 months."
-2.7039690245146923," KBR to focus on government contracts, quit natural gas, energy business HOUSTON (Reuters) - Engineering and construction firm KBR Inc KBR.N will exit most of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) construction and other energy projects, it told investors and employees, as customers pull back on energy investments. The company will refocus on government contracts and technology businesses, Chief Executive Stuart Bradie wrote to employees on Monday. It will “no longer engage in lump sum, blue collar construction services,” saying the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the decision to leave fixed-contract energy projects. KBR held contracts for engineering and construction services for several LNG projects, including at Freeport LNG in Texas, Pieridae Energy Ltd’s proposed Goldboro LNG facility in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Glenfarne Group’s Magnolia LNG project in Louisiana. Freeport LNG has delayed its project to 2021 and planned to seek new bids for construction, spokeswoman Heather Browne said. Pieridae and Glenfarne did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. KBR declined to discuss potential impairments on its current LNG projects, but pointed to an investor webcast last Tuesday that said it expected the energy business to be “marginally profitable” this year. It will disclose more details with second-quarter results next month, an executive said in the webcast. About 85% of the company’s forecast earnings for 2020 are expected to derive from government business, up from about 11% in 2015, Bradie told investors during the call. The changes will mean “significant realignment in some offices, a smaller office footprint as we transform to the new structure and the new way of working, and the exiting of certain markets/geographies and offices,” the email said."
-3.5010812136519993," KBR wins $570 million contract for NASA spaceflight operations (Reuters) - Houston-based engineering company KBR Inc said on Monday it was awarded a $570.3 million contract by NASA to develop and execute spaceflight operations at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Under the contract, KBR will perform International Space Station payload operations and support the testing of NASA’s flagship space launch system. NASA is leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration, as it gears up for a long-term presence on the moon and prepares for a manned mission to Mars. The space launch system, set to debut next year, is currently NASA’s ride for transporting humans from the Earth to the moon by 2024. KBR, which until April 2007 was the engineering and construction arm of oilfield services giant Halliburton Co, said on Monday its work would support various NASA programs, payload developers, educational institutions, international partner space agencies and commercial partners."

Circuit busts down KBR’s $58K ‘cost of copies’ award to $362 for e-docs The expense of maintaining an e-discovery system and using it to determine which documents must be turned over to opposing counsel are not “costs of making copies” that a prevailing party can recover, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held Friday. The decision cut a $58,000 award to Kellogg Brown & Root down to $362 - the amount that KBR had spent on creating PDFs and TIFFs and putting them on USB drives, which the panel described as the “e-discovery analogs” of “photocopying the stack of responsive and privilege-screened documents to hand over to opposing counsel.” To read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2vYCgq2"

21.936397911082874," Supreme Court rejects U.S. troops' appeal over 'burn pits' illnesses WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a bid by U.S. troops sickened by smoke from open-air pits used to burn waste in Iraq and Afghanistan to revive a lawsuit against defense contractors KBR Inc and Halliburton Co. The justices left in place a 2018 lower court ruling in favor of the companies. The former service members said in the lawsuit that they developed various cancers, neurological damage and other illnesses, often fatal, because of KBR’s negligent operation of the burn pits. The case centered on the liability of KBR and Halliburton over waste disposal services they provided the U.S. military in Afghanistan starting in 2001 and Iraq starting in 2003. KBR was part of Halliburton until it was spun off in 2007. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the various consolidated lawsuits brought by service members and their relatives amounted to a “political question” that Congress and the president should resolve, not the courts. The plaintiffs, whose cases were consolidated in Maryland in 2009, said they were harmed because the companies did not follow correct safety procedures. They accused KBR of placing the burn pits too close to occupied areas and operating them without regard to wind conditions. The contractor used the pits to dispose of plastics, tires, batteries, medical waste and other material that released airborne toxins when burned. Both companies said they should not be held liable. The Supreme Court in 2015 declined to hear the cases at an earlier stage in the litigation after the companies lost a prior bid to dismiss the lawsuits. Dick Cheney, who served as chairman and CEO of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000, was U.S. vice president at the time the American military operations involved in the case began in Afghanistan and Iraq."

In a brief filed Friday, the companies said the lawsuits were properly dismissed because courts have no jurisdiction over military strategy.
