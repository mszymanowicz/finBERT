23.517947096360345," U.S. auto sales in states with coronavirus lockdown orders to drop 80%: analysts (Reuters) - Vehicle sales in U.S. states that implemented lockdown orders to curb the spread of the coronavirus will drop 80% or more, analysts said on Wednesday. Auto retail sales through the week of March 22 declined 22% nationwide on a yearly basis and as much as 40% in some cities on the U.S. West Coast, according to an analysis by research firm J.D. Power, based on data from dealership stores around the country. Last week’s data did not yet fully account for various U.S. states passing shelter-in-place orders at the end of last week. “We expect to see a much broader and wider impact from these restrictions next week with sales declining 80% or more,” said Tyson Jominy, the firm’s vice president of data and analytics. Tyson said New York in particular, a market that has so far proven rather resilient, is expected to change dramatically over the coming week. New York on March 20 ordered the state’s roughly 19 million residents to stay at home. Separately on Wednesday, dealership company Group 1 Automotive Inc GPI.N told investors its overall U.S. vehicle sales volumes were down 50-70% from regular expected March sales. Group 1 said it would cut its marketing expenses by more than 75% and furlough 3,000 U.S. employees for 30 days, with a possible extension for another 30 days. Despite the grim events, Thomas King, J.D. Power’s president of data and analytics, said car buyers will likely bounce back after an extended shutdown, which will help the industry recover. The crisis is also likely to accelerate the move to online sales by auto dealerships, a business practice car retailers have been slow to embrace."
18.231271446328044," Group 1 signals major drop in March auto demand, furloughs nearly 6,000 staff March 25 (Reuters) - Auto dealership Group 1 Automotive Inc said on Wednesday its overall U.S. vehicle sales in March were down 50% to 70% from normal levels and that its chief executive officer would take a 50% pay cut, as the coronavirus outbreak roils the auto industry. The company said it would furlough 2,800 employees, or about 90% of its workforce, in the UK and 3,000 employees in the United States due to the massive decrease in business activities. Group 1 said its UK order intake nearly halved in recent weeks and it would close all of its dealerships there as per a government order. ""This (the outbreak) is requiring us to take many severe and regrettable actions to re-size our business to minimal activity levels in the near term,"" Chief Executive Officer Earl J. Hesterberg said in a statement here. The company also said it will reduce U.S. marketing expenses by more than 75%. According to research firm J.D. Power, U.S. auto sales in states with coronavirus lockdown orders could drop 80% or more. (Reporting by Nishara Karuvalli Pathikkal in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.)"
-1.8276783490501345," Group 1 posts better-than-expected profit, shares hit new high DETROIT (Reuters) - Group 1 Automotive Inc GPI.N posted a far better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as strong U.S. demand offset weakness in other markets, sending shares of the No. 3 U.S. auto dealership soaring as much as 16% to an all-time high. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a research note the results were well above expectations, calling out “solid execution” in the U.S. market despite struggles in its British and Brazilian markets. They said the British market was weak for the company but better than expected. Group 1 still expects the U.S. auto industry to finish this year at 17 million in new-vehicle sales and finish somewhere in the 16.5 million to 17 million range next year, Chief Financial Officer John Rickel said in a telephone interview. “If you look where the consumer is in the U.S., they’re still pretty upbeat,” he said. Chief Executive Earl Hesterberg in a statement cited the strong U.S. demand in a flat overall market and called U.S. same-store used vehicle and parts and services profit growth of 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, “remarkable.” “A lot of things came together,” Group 1 senior vice president Pete DeLongchamps said in the interview. “The most exciting thing is we posted these results with very little contribution from the UK and Brazil.” Group 1’s net income in the second quarter rose more than 9% to $38 million, or $2.04 a share, from $34.8 million, or $1.74 a share, in the year earlier quarter. Excluding one-time items, Group 1 earned $3.02 a share. Analysts were expecting $2.72 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 7.9% to $3.12 billion, above the $2.95 billion analysts had expected. The Houston-based company, with dealerships in the United States, Britain and Brazil, reported a 7% increase in gross profit as revenue from new-vehicle sales rose 7.3%, and retail used-vehicle revenue increased almost 10%. U.S. operations accounted for almost 78% of total revenue and about 83% of gross profit, while British operations accounted for almost 19% and 14%, respectively. Same-store revenue rose 9.7% in the United States, while it fell 2.3% in Britain. Group 1 said continued weakness in British consumer confidence and the overall auto market due to turmoil over Britain’s plan to leave the European Union is hurting new-vehicle sales and profits. Shares of Group 1 rose to an all-time high of $108.99, and were still up 10.2% at $103.48 in afternoon trading."

17.587645773323263," Auto dealer Group 1's quarterly profit falls due to Brexit impact DETROIT (Reuters) - Group 1 Automotive Inc GPI.N on Thursday posted a lower second-quarter profit as the negative effects of Britain's upcoming exit from the European Union overshadowed strong results in the U.S. market. “The negative in our world is just the difficulty in the UK due to Brexit issues hitting consumer confidence, which hits car sales,” Group 1 Chief Executive Earl Hesterberg said in a telephone interview. “The fact that we could set an all-time quarterly record with no significant financial contribution from over 20 percent of our business is pretty impressive,” he added. Group 1, the No. 3 U.S. auto dealership group, said it is performing a “significant cost reduction effort” in Britain in response. J.P. Morgan analysts in a research note called the results “not stellar,” but said Group 1 trades at a discount to its peers and that any weakness in the stock could signal a buying opportunity. Shares of Group 1 were off 95 cents at $87.04 in afternoon trading. Net income in the second quarter fell almost 13% to $49.2 million, or $2.64 a share, from $56.5 million, or $2.72 a share, in the year earlier quarter.

Same-store revenue rose 6% in the United States, while it slid 7.5% in Britain.

The No. 3 U.S. auto dealership group’s Chief Executive Earl Hesterberg called the second-quarter results “solid,” citing a relatively strong U.S. market, the company’s focus on used car sales and cost cutting. “These results demonstrate our ability to grow earnings in a flat retail sales environment,” he said in a statement.
