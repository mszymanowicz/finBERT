16.459987024619206," Online push helps KFC parent Yum beat revenue, profit estimates (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc beat quarterly estimates for revenue and profit on Thursday as online demand for tacos, pizzas and fried chicken from Americans surged, helping cushion weak sales in certain markets due to renewed pandemic-related curbs. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated online orders and most U.S. fast food chains, including Yum and its rival McDonald’s which invested early on in their e-commerce businesses, are reaping the benefits. “Digital has been such an important part of our resilience during the pandemic,” Chief Financial Officer Christopher Turner said on an earnings call. Digital sales for the KFC owner jumped 45% to a record high of $17 billion in 2020. KFC and Pizza Hut divisions posted same-store sales growth of 8% each in the United States, partly offsetting declines of at least 4% each in their international markets. Turner said Yum would invest more in its digital unit this year by controlling expenses in other areas, while Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said dine-in sales would be a lesser part of its overall business. The company said renewed restrictions in Europe has caused a slowdown in international business from the fourth-quarter, while its U.S. same-store sales strength has waned after jumping in the mid-teens in the first few weeks. Yum’s fourth-quarter revenue rose about 3% to $1.74 billion, beating the Refinitiv IBES estimate of $1.72 billion. Excluding items, it earned $1.15 per share, compared with expectations of $1.01. Shares of Yum, which had risen about 8% last year, were trading flat in the morning session."

8.51954838551604," Thicker pickles, bigger fillet: KFC revamps fried chicken sandwich in U.S NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kentucky Fried Chicken will switch to a new chicken sandwich nationally by the end of February, it said on Thursday, amid a fast food frenzy to win a share of the growing chicken market. The company, owned by Yum Brands Inc, said its existing Crispy Colonel Sandwich was not “living up to our legacy as experts in fried chicken” so it will eventually be pulled off menus in favor of the KFC Chicken Sandwich. McDonald’s Corp on Monday confirmed that it will launch three new versions of a crispy chicken sandwich late next month. With burger chains entering the fray, even poultry purveyors are revamping their menus. In 2019, a social media-fueled feud over similar sandwiches between Chick-fil-A and Restaurant Brands International Inc’s Popeyes sparked a rise in chicken sales across the industry and spurred other restaurants to announce competing menu items. KFC’s new sandwich will contain a quarter pound of white meat fillet - 25% larger than in its existing sandwich - that is double-breaded, fried and served on a new buttered brioche bun with thicker crinkle-cut pickles. It includes mayonnaise or spicy sauce. The restaurant chain will roll out the new sandwiches beginning on Thursday in Chicago, Kansas City, Louisville, Portland, St. Louis, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle and Tulsa, expanding to all 4,000 U.S. locations by the end of February, it said in a statement. KFC’s new sandwich will cost $3.99, in line with those from competitors. KFC tested the new item in Orlando in 2020 and “nearly doubled our sales expectations,” KFC U.S.’s chief marketing officer, Andrea Zahumensky, said in a statement."
2.2345010335513997," Pizza Hut to offer pizzas with Beyond Meat sausages in U.S., UK (Reuters) - Pizza Hut on Tuesday launched two pizzas with plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat's BYND.O sausage in the United States and the United Kingdom for a limited time, taking advantage of the consumer craze for plant-based meat options during the COVID-19 pandemic. The chain, owned by U.S.-based Yum Brands Inc YUM.N, is jumping on the substitute meat bandwagon as more people search out healthier snacks and comfort foods. For Beyond Meat, the deal marks another feather in its cap and comes a day after it announced it had co-created the patty for McDonald's MCD.N new ""McPlant"" line of faux meat products that will debut in 2021. Pizza Hut said it would offer Beyond meat’s faux meat sausages as a 1-topping option on the Beyond Italian Sausage Pizza and as a special recipe in another pizza, The Great Beyond Pizza, across U.S. stores and some Pizza Hut Express stores from Nov. 10, until supplies last. In the United Kingdom, it will be offered at three outlets in London for only three weeks as well as in some locations in Luton and Liverpool, adding that the pizzas will be available only through delivery and takeaway in both countries. Consumers have been craving more plant-based meat alternatives. Retailers and large fast food chains have been answering the call, stocking freezers with several brands and adding options on menus. Pizza Hut’s deal with Beyond Meat is three months after it ran trials with Beyond Sausage pizzas at five locations in Puerto Rico and tested its first-ever burger offerings through the Beyond Burger in China this past June. On Monday, Beyond Meat reported quarterly sales grew at its slowest pace since it went public in 2019, as shoppers eased off on buying burgers, sausages and meatballs at stores, having stocked up earlier in the year."
7.379743869786948," Taco Bell boost helps Yum beat quarterly results (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc YUM.N posted a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales and beat profit estimates on Thursday, helped by strong online sales at its Taco Bell chain as COVID-19 pandemic fears kept customers at home. Fast-food restaurants, including rivals McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.N, have benefited from earlier digital investments, especially when dining rooms were closed at the height of the health crisis. Yum Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said online sales in the third quarter surged by over a billion dollars to $4 billion from a year earlier, setting a new quarterly record. “Drive-thru demand skyrocketed this quarter as Taco Bell served over 30 million more cars.” Taco Bell, which trounced third-quarter comparable sales estimates, remains the crown jewel in Yum’s portfolio, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a note. CEO Gibbs said while the upward online sale trend continues in the current quarter, pandemic-related uncertainty persists. He said there could be more challenges from fresh lockdowns. Yum's net income rose about 11% to $283 million, helped by $8 million in pre-tax income due to change in fair value of its investment in Grubhub Inc GRUB.N, which would be acquired by European online food-ordering company Just Eat Takeaway.com NV TKWY.AS early next year, once approved by regulators. Yum sold its stake in food delivery firm Grubhub for $206 million, more than two years after making a $200 million investment to improve its delivery services. Comparable sales fell 2% for the KFC owner in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with the estimate of a 3.74% slide, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, Yum earned $1.01 per share, 21 cents more than expectations."

2.3423277608443933," Pizza, taco cravings in lockdowns propel Yum Brands quarterly beat (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc YUM.N said on Thursday online orders surged in the second quarter as more people ordered pizzas and tacos while under coronavirus lockdowns, driving better-than-expected sales and profit for the restaurant operator. Restaurants have modified the way they serve their customers to ramp up safety and ensure fast and contactless delivery as online orders surge. For Yum, which operates about 50,000 restaurants globally, online sales hit an all-time high, said Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs. “Digital sales were a big driver of the dramatic improvement in sales from the initial impact of COVID-19.” Gibbs said sales trends for open stores stabilized in June “just a few points short of flat”, even though a majority of its dining rooms were still closed, and the trends have continued into July. Pizzas have been a hit with consumers, with rival Domino's Pizza DPZ.N also posting robust quarterly U.S. sales. Sales at Pizza Hut stores open for more than a year fell 9% in the second quarter ended June 30, but were better than analysts’ expectations of a 11.98% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Comparable sales at Taco Bell fell 8%, but were above estimates. However, KFC did not fare so well, with sales slumping 21%, compared with a 17.32% fall forecast by analysts. Overall, same-store sales fell 15%, while analysts’ were expecting of a 16.02% slump. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 82 cents per share, 28 cents above estimates, helped by $84 million in pretax income from its investment in food delivery firm Grubhub Inc back in 2018, at a time when Yum’s focus on delivery was growing. Net income fell about 29% to $206 million."

10.350700451503172," Yum's KFC closes dining rooms at company-owned restaurants in Florida NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fried chicken chain KFC has closed dining rooms in corporate-owned stores in Florida because of the escalation in coronavirus cases in the state, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The letter, from KFC U.S. Chief Operating Officer Monica Rothgery to franchisees on Monday, said its own Florida restaurants would operate only drive-thru and suggested owner-operators consider doing the same in “hot spots” where new cases are surging, including Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. “This guidance is part of our continued efforts to prioritize the health of our team members, customers, and the communities where they live and work,” the company said in a statement. KFC, a unit of Yum! Brands YUM.N, has 40 company stores in Florida. It said only about 5% of KFC's U.S. restaurants have opened dine-in seating. Florida recorded more than 12,600 new coronavirus cases on Monday, its second-highest daily total since the outbreak began, coinciding with the state’s attempt to revive tourism and attract visitors to the recently reopened Disney World. With restaurants among the hardest-hit sectors economically, some independent restaurants and smaller chains have sought to reopen dining rooms as quickly as allowed, with extra safety measures in place. But fast food giants have not been in such a rush because their drive-thru sales have mostly made up for lost walk-in business during the pandemic. Customer transactions at major quick-service chains were 9% lower in the week ended July 5 compared with the same period the previous year. That is an improvement over the 13% year-over-year drop from the prior week, data provider the NPD Group Inc said on Monday. By contrast, full-service sit-down restaurants still had 30% fewer transactions than the previous year, NPD found. Earlier this month, McDonald's Corp MCD.N delayed reopening dining rooms as states enacted new restrictions, the Wall Street Journal reported."

1.5790107267357936," Taco Bell parent Yum sues Grubhub for alleged violation of delivery deal NEW YORK (Reuters) - Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc sued Grubhub Inc on Thursday for allegedly violating a delivery contract, a day after Europe’s Just Eat Takeaway.com agreed to buy the U.S. food delivery company for $7.3 billion. Yum invested about $200 million in Grubhub in 2018 and struck a partnership to deliver food from thousands of its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants across the United States. But the relationship apparently soured after Yum - which also owns Pizza Hut and Habit Burger – broadened its delivery partners to include two of Grubhub’s biggest rivals, Uber Eats and Postmates, according to the complaint in New York state court. That led Grubhub last week to throw out its exclusive five-year contract with Yum after just two years. Now Grubhub seeks to impose steeper fees on Yum’s franchisees and customers and said Yum had lost its right to a seat on Grubhub’s board, the complaint alleged. Grubhub “vigorously” denies the allegations and will protect itself from Yum’s breach of exclusivity provisions, a spokesman said, adding that it is “very sorry about the situation Yum franchisees are in with millions of dollars now at risk especially in the midst of this challenging environment.” The dispute comes as more restaurant brands have opened up once exclusive relationships with individual delivery partners amid an increase in demand, which accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. While Yum franchisees would still pay Grubhub 0% commissions for marketing and delivery, they would now pay the full 3.05% plus $0.30 per transaction, the complaint said. Grubhub would also start collecting a 17% diners fee, which customers themselves could have to pay if Yum franchisees increase menu prices or charge service fees to make up for the extra cost. The delivery agreement had required Grubhub to pay Yum a $50 million termination fee should Grubhub become controlled by a third-party - which could apply to Just Eat Takeaway."

9.975223040384249," Yum China keeps bets on dine-in, sticks to expansion plans after virus BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Yum China YUMC.N is betting that Chinese consumers will still choose to dine-in in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis and plans to open more Pizza Hut and KFC outlets in China's smaller cities in the coming months, its chief executive said. Joey Wat, CEO of the fast food giant, said that while the virus had driven up the takeaway rate at its businesses, it continues to see expansion opportunities especially in fourth- and fifth-tier cities where there are less Western dining options and fewer competitors. “If you want to have Western food, or a cup of fresh ground coffee, where can you go? Even the hotels don’t have it. KFC is the only choice,” Wat told Reuters in an interview. “We will continue to be committed to the China market and we are here to stay for long,” she said. Yum China said last month that it plans to open up to 850 new stores in China this year, having already opened 179 in the first quarter. The government’s travel curbs and quarantine measures aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in China last year, forced hundreds of thousands of restaurants and eateries across the country to shut or revert to food delivery-only models in late January. Many, including Yum China’s roughly 9,000 outlets, have since reopened in recent weeks as a sharp drop in coronavirus cases has prompted an easing of restrictions, and their progress in returning to normality is being closely watched globally as other countries prepare to loosen their own lockdowns. In reopening its restaurants, especially for dine-in, Yum China has made the wearing of masks and temperature checks mandatory at its outlets. Wat said the virus had helped drive takeway demand for Pizza Hut, which only accounted for 5% of the chain’s orders prior to the epidemic. Pizza Hut’s takeaway rate has so far increased to 13% and “may triple to 15% within this year,” she said. “So we are seeing some positive things come out of it.” Yum China, which reported a 10% fall in month-to-date same-store sales in April, also plans to introduce more value-for-money options in view of how many customers may have been economically affected by the virus, and is looking to beef up its presence in the Chinese dining sector. In April, it paid $185 million for a controlling stake in Huang Ji Huang group, a casual dining franchise business whose signature dish is a pot of meat and vegetables stewed in sauces that is designed to be eaten in groups. There are few sign that the virus is causing Chinese diners to fall out of love with hotpot style dining in spite of contagion fears, with consumers seen returning to such restaurants in recent months once curbs were lifted. “In China, the bulk of the catering industry is still Chinese food,” Wat said. “And we’ve seen that hotpot is the category growing with highest speed in recent years.” (This story corrects to read KFC (not Pizza Hut), paragraph three)"
8.994378152274885," KFC parent Yum says April sales improving after virus hits Q1 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc YUM.N said on Wednesday sales in April showed signs of improvement as stay-at-home consumers ordered in more and diners returned to restaurants after certain countries started to ease restrictions. The KFC and Pizza Hut operator said same-store sales fell 7% in the first quarter and deteriorated through March but were improving in April, with global sales trends picking up significantly across its brands in restaurants that are open. Restaurants across the globe have shifted to a delivery and take-away model as nationwide lockdowns spurred by the coronavirus pandemic keep diners at home. Digital sales played a major role during the health crisis as more consumers ordered in using the mobile apps of the restaurants. Yum Brands expects KFC’s digital sales to account for a quarter of the company’s annual sales. “All the trends in the restaurant industry are playing out at warp speed... It (digital) is a win for consumers, a win for us,” Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs told Reuters. For Pizza Hut, a brand the company has struggled with for years due to intense competition, Gibbs sees the business coming out of the crisis much stronger than before. “This 3-month period we’re in right now is basically going to have 3 years’ worth of changes to our businesses. And it’s accelerating the plan that we had for Pizza Hut in getting us to be truly this digital delivery carry-out business,” Gibbs told analysts. Comparable store sales fell about 30% in the second half of March and into April, as about 20% of its about 50,000 stores were closed. Yum China Holdings Inc YUMC.N, the sole licensee of KFC and Pizza Hut in China, also said the same-store sales decline was slowing, even though most consumers are still not going out in public. Yum Brands said sales at stores open for more than a year fell 8% at KFC and declined 11% at Pizza Hut in the first quarter ended March 31, while they rose 1% at Taco Bell. Analysts expected a 6.16% fall at KFC, 6.55% decline at Pizza Hut and 2.18% dip at Taco Bell, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income fell 68.3% to $83 million, partly due to a goodwill impairment charge of $139 million from its purchase of Habit Burger Grill earlier this year.

Yum’s bond offering represented a glimmer of investor demand in one of the riskiest corners of the corporate credit market, which seized up for much of March after the coronavirus outbreak morphed into an economically devastating pandemic. While U.S. companies last week issued new investment-grade debt at a record clip, there had been no new issuance in the so-called high-yield market for junk-rated debt issuers since March 4. Yum boosted its debt offering by 20%, after planning to raise $500 million. The deal was more than 10 times oversubscribed, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, Yum was forced to accept a considerably higher borrowing cost than in its prior debt deals. The company sold bonds maturing in 2025 at a 7.75% yield. By comparison, Yum raised $800 million in September through 10-year debt with a yield of 4.75%. The higher the yield, the more expensive the bond is for the company. The debt proceeds will go toward “general corporate purposes,” Yum said in a statement. The Federal Reserve said last week it will backstop the investment-grade market but has made no such pledge for high-yield debt. Yum, which has over 48,000 Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants across the globe, said last week it expects the coronavirus pandemic to impact its second-quarter same-store sales more significantly than in the first quarter, as the fast-spreading virus hits customer traffic at its stores globally.

-19.469113754753604," Yum Brands misses sales, profit estimates as Pizza Hut battles rivals; shares drop (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc YUM.N shares fell 4.7% after it reported quarterly same-store sales and profit that missed analyst expectations on Thursday, as stiff competition took a bite out of sales at its Pizza Hut chain in the United States. Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said on a conference call that the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus in China would also be a headwind this year. Yum lost 5 cents per share of its earnings in the fourth quarter because of a sharp drop in the value of its stake in food delivery platform Grubhub Inc GRUB.N, which faced strong rivals. Pizza Hut is struggling to keep its market share amid rivalry from Domino's Pizza DPZ.N, as well as food-delivery apps that offer a wide selection of restaurants to choose from. “Obviously, there’s a lot of work to be done there,” Gibbs said. The pizza chain, which missed Wall Street expectations for sales growth in six of the past eight quarters, has been a weak spot for Yum, even as its other chains, KFC and Taco Bell, continue to outperform. “For so many years, people associated takeout and delivery solely with pizza. And now.. these online delivery companies have expanded the universe of what people take into consideration when they order out,” said Doug Ciocca, chief executive officer of Kavar Capital Partners, which holds Yum shares. To fight competition, Pizza Hut has introduced new concepts such as heated lockers that allow diners to pick up online orders from restaurants and is testing plant-based meat toppings. Comparable sales at the chain fell 2% in the fourth quarter, worse than analysts’ expectations for a 0.71% drop, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Overall, sales at Yum’s restaurants open at least a year climbed 2%, below the Wall Street estimate of 2.26%. Sales grew 4% at established Taco Bell restaurants and 3% at KFC, both beating estimates. This year, Yum’s forecast is clouded by uncertainty from choppiness related to its largest U.S. Pizza Hut franchisee, as well as the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China and elsewhere. However, it is not likely to be hit as hard as other companies, including Yum China YUMC.N, which was spun off into a separate company in 2016. Globally, Yum Brands surpassed 50,000 restaurants in 2019. It added 2,040 new units during the year, an average of 9 gross new restaurants opened per day. In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, net income rose to $488 million, or $1.58 per share, from $334 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Yum earned $1 per share, missing analysts’ estimate by 13 cents. Total revenue rose 8.7% to $1.69 billion, above the estimate of $1.66 billion."

-19.469113754753604," Yum China warns of first-quarter losses, 2020 sales hit after virus outbreak (Reuters) - KFC licensee Yum China YUMC.N said it could report an operating loss in the first quarter and take a significant hit to sales and productivity due to a coronavirus outbreak in China, after it was forced to shut nearly a third of its stores. The company's warning echoed that of U.S. cafe chain Starbucks SBUX.O, which said last week it would delay a planned increase to its outlook for the year and that it expected a material but temporary financial hit. Yum China shares fell 3% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Companies around the world have warned the virus outbreak that has killed more than 500 people and infected over 28,000 could disrupt supply chains or hurt their bottom lines as they are forced to shut factories and shops, and airlines cancel flights. Since the Lunar New Year holiday period, the busiest time of the year for many companies in China, Yum China’s same-store sales at restaurants that remained open slumped 40%-50% compared with the same period a year earlier. “This year, the outbreak right before Chinese New Year is causing significant interruption to the business,” Chief Executive Joey Wat said on a conference call with analysts, adding that the new-year period is an important tourist season that usually drives first-quarter performance. Yum China, spun off from Yum Brands YUM.N in 2016, said it could not yet fully quantify the losses. It also warned it could close additional stores, cut operating hours, or take other steps, depending on the situation. The company, also the exclusive licensee of the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China, has over 9,200 restaurants in more than 1,300 cities. Yum China said, however, that it remained optimistic about the long-term opportunity in China. It expects to open 800-850 new stores in the country this year, subject to any revision based on the impact from the virus. The company’s same-store sales in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 grew 2% thanks to strong demand at its KFC restaurants, versus analysts’ average estimate of 1.9%, according to Refinitiv. It posted an adjusted profit of 25 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 19 cents per share. Yum China said it had rolled out “contactless delivery” and services where a customer can pick up food from a store without contacting staff. These were being received well, it said. A KFC advertisement on Weibo showed a delivery man put a box of food on the ground and stepping back several meters, before the customer picks up the food."

The company’s shares were down 3% after the bell. Yum China also warned it could close additional stores, reduce operating hours, or take other steps, depending on the situation in China. Same-store sales at restaurants that remain open have fallen 40%-50% since the Chinese New Year holiday period, relative to comparable Chinese New Year holiday period in 2019, the company said. However, Yum China on Wednesday beat quarterly same-store sales estimates, as it benefited from strong demand at its KFC restaurants. Same-store sales for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 grew 2%, managing to beat anlaysts’ average estimate of 1.9%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

3.598271374070551," Pizza Hut, GrubHub troubles dent Yum profits; shares fall (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc YUM.N missed earnings expectations, largely hit by a write down in the value of its investment in delivery company GrubHub GRUB.N and warned of sagging sales at its Pizza Hut U.S. chain next year, sending shares down 10% on Wednesday. Restaurants are aggressively investing in technology and convenience to pull in more diners who enjoy a multitude of options in terms of ordering, delivery and even preparing food at home with ready-to-cook items. To keep up with the changing trend, Yum bought a stake in GrubHub last year, hoping to boost sales at its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants in the United States. But diners are now switching to GrubHub's competition, including Uber Inc's UBER.N Uber Eats and DoorDash that provide a variety of offers. This does not help Pizza Hut, which has been streamlining dine-in operations and increasingly relying on delivery in the face of competition from rival pizzeria Domino's Pizza DPZ.N and Papa John's PZZA.O. “The Pizza Hut U.S. business... has some unique challenges given the dining state and the conditions of the assets... So that’s what they’re trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate,” incoming Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said. U.S. sales at established Pizza Hut restaurants declined 3% in the reported quarter, as changes to value offerings and attempts to add more modern delivery systems while restructuring franchisees took a toll on performance, Gibbs said. Overall same-store sales at Pizza Hut were flat, compared with analysts’ estimate of 1.46% growth. KFC rose 3%, also missing expectations. “They’ve (Pizza Hut) done a lot of marketing, they’ve launched a lot of value-priced items... it still doesn’t seem to be working,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. “That was one of the big bull pieces to the story, the big Pizza Hut turnaround... it seems to be falling kind of flat.” Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum earned 80 cents per share in the quarter, excluding one-time items, 14 cents lower than expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It recorded a pre-tax investment expense of $60 million related to the change in fair value of its investment in GrubHub, which resulted in a 15-cent impact. Sales from restaurants open over an year rose 3%, below the estimate of 3.3% rise. “There is always unfinished business... And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S,” said Greg Creed, who will be stepping down as Yum’s CEO next year."

The quick-service restaurant will roll out its vegan menu items nationally based on the customer feedback from the Atlanta test, Yum said. Yum is the latest big-chain restaurant jumping on the vegan bandwagon, a growing market as more fast-food chains tweak their menus to add new options for vegans and ‘flexitarians’. Plant-based meat alternatives have seen booming interest from consumers and restaurants, supporting startups like Beyond Meat and its competitor Impossible Foods, and even sparking interest from veteran meat companies such as Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N and Perdue Foods. Beyond Meat has already partnered with sandwich chain Subway, Del Taco Restaurant Inc TACO.O, Carl's Jr, Dunkin' Brands Group Inc DNKN.O and Restaurant Brand International's QSR.TO Tim Hortons. KFC, known for its fried chicken, will be serving the six or 12-piece combo plant-based nugget meals for $6.49 and $8.49 and boneless wings for $6 and $12. Beyond Meat’s shares rose about 4% before the bell. The stock has risen more than three-fold since it went public in May."

-14.47676681865392," Yum Brands posts earnings beat on KFC boost, Pizza Hut rebound (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc YUM.N beat expectations for quarterly profit on Thursday, as menu refreshes and a delivery push drove better-than-expected growth at all of the restaurant operator's chains, including Pizza Hut, sending its shares to a record high. U.S. restaurant chains are focusing on mobile ordering and pickup services, while sprucing up their menu by adding more value meals and fresher ingredients to compete better in a crowded restaurant industry. Yum picked up a stake in GrubHub Inc GRUB.N last year and bought online ordering software company QuikOrder in hopes of wooing customers looking for easier options to order in. The company’s efforts paid off in the quarter. Pizza Hut, a weak spot for the company in the past few years, grew for the first time in five quarters, while same-store sales at KFC and Taco Bell rose the most in over a year. “While it’s still early days, we found that the GrubHub customers are incremental and some customers are, therefore, trying our (Pizza Hut) products for the first time,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed said. Pizza Hut currently uses GrubHub’s delivery services at over 300 location, with plans to expand further; while KFC has 2,300 outlets offering delivery and 3,500 restaurants that offer “click and collect”. Creed said the company would close underperforming dine-in Pizza Hut locations to sharpen its focus on delivery and takeaway. Overall, the company’s sales from restaurants open at least a year rose 5%, beating Wall Street expectations as Taco Bell and KFC grew 7% and 6% respectively. For interactive graphic, click link: (tmsnrt.rs/2ytZgLh) At KFC, growth was driven by its 2 for $6 mix-and-match menu and the return of its popular chicken and waffles to the U.S. menu, while items catered to regional tastes such as the ‘Wrapsta Lunchbox’ value promotion in Africa helped KFC deliver stronger international results. At Taco Bell, value boxes drove growth in India, UK and Spain, the company said. “(Results a) confirmation that Yum’s stable, high-returning franchise growth algorithm is very much intact,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said. Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30, trouncing expectations by 6 cents. While total revenue of $1.31 billion also beat expectations. Shares of the Louisville, Kentucky-based company rose as much as 6.3% to $119.7. They have risen 22% so far this year. (This story corrects paragraph 10 to say ‘Wrapsta Lunchbox’)"

2.553934539946051," Yum Brands' KFC testing vegan 'chicken' burger in UK June 13 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc’s KFC is looking to tap into the popularity of plant-based protein foods by rolling out a vegan version of its classic chicken burger at some outlets in the UK. The new burger, called “the Imposter Burger”, will have a fillet made from a meat substitute product, Quorn, instead of its classic chicken breast fillet, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Plant-based substitutes for meat have been all the rage as more people shift towards vegan or vegetarian diets, amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat, animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming. KFC said the burger is being tested in London, Bristol and the Midlands for four weeks before it decides to roll it out nationally. KFC is hoping to replicate the success that Greggs Plc has witnessed with its wildly popular vegan sausage rolls. In April, McDonald’s Corp started selling burgers in Germany with a patty made from soy and wheat, while Del Taco launched “Beyond Taco” in late April, using U.S.-based Beyond Meat’s plant-based protein.

15.195074687376039," Yum beats expectations on KFC growth, Taco Bell weighs (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc reported quarterly earnings and same-store sales above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, as KFC recorded its best growth in three years, but weaker-than-expected growth at Taco Bell weighed on the company’s shares. Taco Bell recorded slowest growth in same-store sales in three quarters and missed analysts’ expectations, as the restaurant chain competes for customers in a crowded fast-food market. “They (offer) cheap, inexpensive food and the demand is still there. But it is not a big point of differentiation. You could go to a (convenience) store and get the same thing,” said Tim Powell, a restaurant analyst at Chicago-based Q1 Consulting. The Mexican-inspired chain has been a major growth driver for Yum Brands in the past two quarters, riding on the popularity of its value meals. The restaurant chain has also expanded its delivery in the United States, making the most of Yum Brands’ investments in GrubHub Inc. But Taco Bell’s same-store sales rose 4 percent in the latest quarter, falling short of the 4.47 percent estimated by analysts, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv. Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said expectations for growth in Taco Bell were high going into the quarter and the slight miss in same-store sales could be pulling down Yum Brands shares. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut also fell short of expectations in the face of intense competition from local pizzerias and chains like Domino’s Pizza Inc. The highlight of the quarter was KFC, which reported a better-than-expected 5 percent rise in sales at established restaurants, boosted by growth in its international markets, including Indonesia and Japan. Yum has been aggressively expanding its KFC restaurants, opening 372 new restaurants in 46 countries in the first quarter. “Operational enhancements, such as a new menu board design and delivery through GrubHub each positively contributed to first-quarter sales,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed said on a post-earnings call. Excluding one-time items, Yum earned 82 cents per share, 1 cent above the average estimate. Yum’s net income fell about 40 percent to $262 million in the three months ended March 31, partly due to its investments in food delivery service GrubHub.

11.651732329792," Yum China to open KFC outlets at Chinese gas stations SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Yum China Holdings is partnering with China’s two biggest state oil giants to open franchise fast-food outlets at gas stations in the country, in a bid to tap new growth areas as the domestic economy slows. More than 100 outlets, likely KFC restaurants, will be opened at gas stations owned by Sinopec Corp and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) over the next three years, Yum China said on Tuesday, without giving any financial details. The two Chinese oil firms collectively operate over 50,000 gas stations in the country. “It’s something quite new for both of us, we’re going to open some stores and figure out the economics, once we figure out the economics then we can be more specific on the financials,” Yum China’ Chief Executive Joey Wat told Reuters in an interview after an investor day it held in Shanghai. “We only have a very modest goal in the coming three years,” The New York-listed firm, spun off from Yum Brands Inc in 2016, owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell in China and is the largest fast-food operator there with more than 8,400 outlets, which it intends to expand to 10,000 by 2021. Wat said the company was adapting to changes in China’s economy, whose growth has slowed to a 28-year-low. For example, the company was rolling out more value promotions to meet demand from customers who were seeking more value-for-money deals. These promotions and other factors could put pressure on KFC’s restaurant margin in the first half, Yum China said, though it added that it had the capacity to return $1.5 billion to shareholders over the next three years. The company had flagged both the margin pressure and how much it could return to shareholders last month with its quarterly results. While sales at its KFC chain have largely stabilized after a period of weakness, thanks to upgraded stores and a big push on delivery, Yum China has been trying to revive performance at Pizza Hut, which has posted just three quarters of positive same store sales growth in China since the start of 2014. In February, Yum China, reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in total system sales for the fourth quarter, led by KFC, but sales at Pizza Hut dipped 2 percent during that period. Wat said in 2017 that a turnaround could take up to two years to bear fruit. Towards that goal, the firm has so far rolled out a new store design and a series of promotions. It will introduce a new menu with 15 percent fewer items next week. She said on Tuesday that while same store sales had yet to recover, the business had hit a milestone in the fourth quarter when traffic growth turned positive. “When we are turning the ship, when we work hard to get the momentum to turn, it’s not easy, there are many forces at work, but we certainly feel like we are on the right track and doing all the right initiatives,” she said. “At the time we set out a very aggressive time frame...but management does not have a crystal ball either,” she added. “We still have a little bit of time.”"
7.7319268979944065," Pizza Hut promotions drag Yum Brands profit; Taco Bell shines (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc missed Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit on Thursday, as the fast-food chain operator spent aggressively on promotions to revive sluggish sales at its Pizza Hut restaurants. The miss on fourth-quarter earnings cast a shadow on a strong beat on global comparable sales that was driven by robust performance at KFC and Taco Bell. Pizza Hut has launched a slew of promotions, including $5 value meals, in recent quarters, but has struggled to attract diners to its stores in the face of more compelling offers and marketing from rivals such as Domino’s Pizza Inc. Analysts have also said Pizza Hut has been losing favor with younger customers, especially students, and is working to modernize its delivery services to cater to tech savvy consumers. “For both the U.S. and international (Pizza Hut) business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed said on a conference call. Pizza Hut, which replaced rival Papa John’s International Inc as the official sponsor of the National Football League (NFL), said the partnership is helping bring attention to its promotions. “Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life,” Creed said. U.S. same-store sales at Pizza Hut rose only 1 percent in the fourth quarter, while they were flat globally, largely due to a drop in dine-in sales. The higher spending reduced operating margins at the business to 33.1 percent from 38.8 percent. Meanwhile, Taco Bell recorded its strongest growth in same-restaurant sales in seven quarters. Worldwide same-store sales rose 6 percent at the business, easily topping estimate for a 4.35 percent increase, according to Refinitiv estimates. Yum has been taking the U.S.-centered Taco Bell’s burritos and tacos menu overseas to replicate the success with its KFC business. The company’s global comparable store sales rose 3 percent and topped estimates of a 2.48 percent increase. Yum, which maintained its profit forecast for 2019, said net income fell 23 percent to $334 million in the three months ended Dec. 31. Excluding one-time items, Yum earned 40 cents per share, widely missing estimate of 95 cents. Total revenue fell 1 percent to $1.56 billion, and came in below expectations of $1.59 billion.

The company said Pizza Hut’s international dine-in assets would be cut to about 25 percent in the next three to five years from 42 percent and that it would make similar cuts in the United States. “We are migrating out of many of our dine-in assets to delivery assets in the United States,” Chief Financial Officer David Gibbs said in an interview with Reuters. The 60-year-old chain has been struggling with changing consumer tastes and stiff competition from other restaurant chains, mainly Domino's Pizza Inc DPZ.N, which has relied on its delivery business to drive growth. Pizza Hut’s same-store sales have shown little growth since 2015, with analysts estimating a drop this year too. Artie Starrs, president of Pizza Hut’s U.S. unit, said on the company’s investor day that he was “extremely dissatisfied” with the pizza chain, blaming its dine-in assets, and lack of innovation and creative advertising for its poor performance. As part of a turnaround, the pizza chain is banking on its Delco outlets, which focus on delivery and carryout, and investments in new technologies. Gibbs said Delco is a growth driver, with 90 percent of its new stores built around that model. “(Delivery and carryout) part of the business is growing well today, that gives us a lot of hope and excitement for the future,” Gibbs said. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company forecast full-year system sales growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range, adding that it was on track to deliver a profit of $3.75 per share in 2019.

7.270124023371129," Restaurant operator Yum China rejects $17.6 billion Hillhouse-led offer: sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fast-food chain operator Yum China Holdings Inc YUMC.N has rejected a $17.6 billion buyout offer from a consortium led by Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group, quashing what would have been one of Asia's biggest deals this year, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The Hillhouse-led consortium, which included regional investment house Baring Private Equity Asia, expressed an interest to offer $46 per share, or nearly 24 percent above Tuesday’s closing price, for the biggest fast-food chain in China, the people said. Global investment house KKR & Co KKR.N and Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp were also part of the consortium, one of the people added. The consortium is not expected to take any immediate action and could just back off from pursuing the bid, that person said. Hillhouse had been tapping lenders to finance the deal, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing sources. Yum China was spun off from Yum Brands! Inc YUM.N in 2016 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It is the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China with over 8,100 restaurants in more than 1,200 cities. The offer did not include detailed terms or the structure of the investor consortium, and the board decided it provided no extra value or strategy for the business, said one of the people, who requested anonymity as the information is confidential. The $46 per share offer values Yum China at 13 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), slightly higher than McDonald's Corp multiple of MCD.N 12.6 but lower than Domino's Pizza Inc's DPZ.N 20.8 times. Yum China did not ask for a higher offer in its letter of rejection, two of the people said. Yum China said it would not comment on rumours or market speculation, but a representative said the company had potential to grow to 20,000 stores over the long term. Baring declined to comment. Hillhouse, KKR and CIC did not respond to requests for comment. Chinese investment firm Primavera Capital and Ant Financial Services Group bought a minority stake in Yum China for $460 million as part of the spin-off deal in September 2016. Both are still shareholders in the company. Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera who is also the independent chairman of the Yum China board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Primavera got two Yum China board seats after the spin-off. The Wall Street Journal first reported the rejection, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Shares of Yum China rose as much as 12 percent on Tuesday before closing 3.86 percent higher. In addition to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, Yum China also runs Chinese fast-food chain First East Dawning and hotpot restaurant Little Sheep, which it acquired in 2012. Yum was the first major Western fast-food company to enter China, opening a KFC store in central Beijing in 1987. Parent Yum Brands! currently collects 3 percent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut China sales as royalties. Former Yum China chairman and CEO Sam Su, who was pivotal in the company’s expansion in the world’s second-largest economy, now serves as an operating partner at Hillhouse, although one of the people said he was not involved in the proposed buyout. The company’s second-quarter net income increased 13 percent year-on-year but Pizza Hut continued to face challenges in China’s competitive casual dining space, its CEO said on Aug. 1."

8.239073899647774," Yum Brands comparable sales miss as Pizza Hut, Taco Bell disappoint (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N quarterly sales fell short of Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as fewer customers dined at its Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, sending its shares down slightly in morning trading. Executives last quarter had warned that the second quarter would likely be the weakest period of the year. In February, Yum was forced to shut hundreds of British KFC outlets after a supplier change led to shortages of everything from chicken to gravy, in a snafu that led to a months-long recovery. “I remain confident our actions to become more focused, more franchised and more efficient are establishing the foundation required for sustainable, long-term growth that will translate to strong returns for all Yum! Brands stakeholders,” Chief Executive Greg Creed said in a statement. Yum, the parent company to brands KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said it continues to expects its full-year performance to land within earlier guidelines. New unit growth for the year is now expected at the high end of the 3 percent to 4 percent range, while same store sales growth will clock in at the lower end of between 2 percent and 3 percent growth. Yum shares pared back earlier losses to slip 0.53 percent in morning trading. Its shares are down 3 percent since the start of the year. Sales at Yum’s worldwide restaurants open for at least a year rose 1 percent, missing analysts’ average estimate of a 1.92 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut posted a surprise drop of 1 percent, missing expectations of a 1.21 percent increase, while Taco Bell’s 2 percent rise also fell short of estimates. “(Pizza Hut) comps were worse than already low expectations, but KFC was the real disappointment,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note. Net income rose to $321 million, or 97 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $206 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Yum earned 82 cents per share, beating analysts’ expectations of 74 cents. Total revenue fell 5.5 percent to $1.37 billion, but edged past estimates of $1.36 billion."

9.17288493038109," Breakingviews - Yum China deserves more than a cheap takeout HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yum China deserves more than a cheap takeout. Hillhouse Capital is in talks to buy the operator of KFCs, Pizza Huts and Taco Bells in the People’s Republic, The Information news website reported on Thursday, after which the company’s shares rose 15 percent. If successful, the Beijing investment outfit gets a Chinese consumption play pre-packed with Western-style governance, and its technology knowhow could supersize the $14 billion company. The target has strong cash flows and big ambitions, with plans to operate 20,000 locations in the longer term, nearly triple the number it had when it spun out from Yum Brands in 2016. It also offers investors a rare way to profit from rising Chinese consumption with the safeguards of a New York listing. Still, Yum China trades at 9.4 times expected 2018 EBITDA, according to Eikon, while Starbucks, which is also expanding aggressively on the mainland, trades at 13.5 times. Although food scandals have plagued it in the past, and it’s a franchisee, not an owner, the valuation looks depressed. That makes it a ripe target for a buyout. Yum China had $1.6 billion in net cash in March, meaning Hillhouse could leverage up the business to boost returns. The secretive hedge fund-to-private equity group’s past deals also offer some clues for its ambitions. Founder Zhang Lei has turned $20 million of seed capital into a roughly $35 billion firm thanks to big wagers on Chinese internet companies including Tencent and JD.com. Now it uses its tech savvy to boost returns in takeovers. Last year, the fund led a $7 billion buyout of Chinese shoe retailer Belle International. The company now uses online analytics to improve in-store sales. For instance, products are fitted with electronic tags to track the take-rate of people buying the shoes after trying them on. Hillhouse’s knowhow in applying online analytics to bricks-and-mortar stores could be used to lure more customers to KFCs and Pizza Huts. But convincing Yum China’s management it should be taken private at a knock-down valuation, just two years after going public, could be a challenge."

Hillhouse is planning to form a consortium with other investors for the deal, the report said, citing three people briefed on the matter. The talks are at an early stage and the transaction’s value is still being discussed, the Information reported, adding talks could still fall apart. Yum China has a market capitalization of $12.74 billion. Its shares rose 15 percent on the New York Stock Exchange and were on track for their best one-day performance since the company was spun off in 2016 from Yum Brands YUM.N. Hillhouse, an investment firm founded in 2005, has investments in a host of Chinese companies including Baidu Inc BIDU.O and JD.com Inc JD.O, as well as U.S. short-term home rental service Airbnb, according to its website.

0.9709304439432073," Yum says UK KFC supply snafu will be drag on second quarter results (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N sales at established restaurants rose at just half the pace expected by Wall Street, after a chicken supply shortage hammered sales at KFC in the UK and Pizza Hut struggled in China. Shares in the company that also owns the Taco Bell brand fell 5 percent early on Wednesday, after its chief financial officer said lingering concerns at KFC UK would contribute to the current quarter likely being “the worst” of the year. Sales at Yum restaurants open at least a year rose 1 percent in the three months ended March 31, compared with the 2 percent expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results contrasted with stronger-than-expected global quarterly sales from McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Domino's Pizza Inc DPZ.N, indicating that Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum may have lost market share during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales at KFC rose 2 percent in the first quarter of 2018, missing analysts’ target with the slowest growth rate in four quarters. On a conference call with analysts, Yum executives said KFC would have recorded a 3 percent growth in same-restaurant sales had it not been for a serious supply snafu in the United Kingdom, where it has 871 restaurants. Yum was forced to shut hundreds of British KFC outlets in February after a supplier change led to shortages of everything from chicken to gravy. The restaurants have mostly resumed operations and executives expect to restart advertising this month. Pizza Hut also missed expectations for same-restaurant sales, which were up 1 percent worldwide, after strength in the United States offset a decline in China. Overall revenue at Yum fell 3 percent to $1.37 billion but topped estimates of $1.09 billion, thanks to stronger sales at Taco Bell, where $1 Nacho Fries debuted as its best-selling new product in history. Net income jumped to $433 million from $280 million last year, reflecting gains from the sale of company-owned restaurants to franchisees. Excluding one-time items, Yum earned 90 cents per share, ahead of expectations of 68 cents."
