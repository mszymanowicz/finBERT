11.931168921429872," UPDATE 1-Enterprise Products Partners exported record volumes of NGLs in December (Adds comments, details) NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP exported a record of about 27 million barrels of natural gas liquids in December, co-Chief Executive Officer Jim Teague said during an industry conference on Tuesday. Crude oil exports are likely to grow and overall company results for 2020 are expected to be close to records hit in 2019, Teague said. “We’ve had a pretty darn good year,” he said, adding that the company’s earnings in 2020 were boosted by favorable storage economics due to a market structure known as contango, where prices for oil in the future are above prompt prices. Oil prices plunged in April last year as the coronavirus pandemic eroded global demand and storage capacity across the world started to fill. Going forward, Enterprise will focus on repurposing existing pipeline capacity and expanding petrochemicals capacity, Teague said, during the Argus Crude Live conference. Enterprise expects to receive permits for the offshore crude terminal project, known as Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), in the third quarter, Teague said. The terminal is designed to load Very Large Crude Carriers at about 85,000 barrels per hour, or up to about 2 million barrels per day. Enterprise has been working to address requests from the United States Coast Guard and Maritime Administration (MARAD) for more information such as the project description and a list of landowners that would be affected.

27.08466348535025," Enterprise crude pipeline transport volumes drop 26.1% on oil price plunge (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP EPD.N on Wednesday said crude pipeline volumes fell 26.1% in the third quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic hurt oil prices and left midstream companies with fewer barrels to transport after producers slashed output. The coronavirus outbreak ended a boom in U.S. shale production, which had prompted a rapid expansion of U.S. pipeline networks to carry oil from fields to processing centers and onto refineries and export terminals. AJ Teague, co-chief executive officer of pipeline operator Enterprise, said he expects a signal for higher crude oil prices as early as the second half of next year on recovering demand and a sharp decline in shale production. “In the interim, we believe the midstream industry will be challenged in its producer-facing businesses,” Teague said. U.S. pipeline companies have been sweetening terms and reducing rates to keep producers using their lines as oil transport volumes decline due to the pandemic-led plunge in demand. Crude pipeline transportation volumes fell to 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the quarter from 2.3 million bpd a year earlier. In September, Enterprise abandoned a major 450,000-bpd Permian crude pipeline project in Texas, one of numerous projects on hold due to the slump in demand, and agreed to give customers lower near-term commitments on other pipelines. Revenue fell 13.1% to $6.92 billion, missing analysts’ estimate of $7.1 billion, hurt by a fall in volumes of gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil as well as lower crude terminal volumes."
21.995939819687358," Enterprise abandons Texas pipeline project as oil prices remain weak (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP on Wednesday abandoned a major 450,000-barrels-per-day Permian crude pipeline project in Texas and agreed to give customers lower near-term commitments on other pipelines as oil prices remain stagnant. The cancellation of the Midland to ECHO 4 pipeline is in line with other delayed energy projects, including export terminals and pipeline builds, hurt by lower demand after U.S. oil producers chopped output to cope with oil prices below $40 a barrel. Many analysts have also said that pipeline capacity already in the Permian basin is more than needed at current production levels. The pipeline, also known as M2E4, was planned to transport crude from Midland, Texas - the heart of the Permian basin - to the ECHO 4 terminal in Houston. In April, Enterprise pushed back the expected completion of the M2E4 line by six months to the second half of 2021 and cut its 2020 budget by $1.1 billion. Chief Financial Officer Randall Fowler had said the project was backed by long-term contracts and “in our minds, not cancelable”. Enterprise said the cancellation will reduce growth capital expenditures for 2020, 2021 and 2022 by about $800 million. The decision will also tack on a $45 million impairment charge to third-quarter earnings this year. Enterprise now expects growth capital expenditures to be $2.8 billion this year, $1.6 billion next year and $900 million in 2022. Enterprise rival MPLX LP in May dropped its pursuit of a Permian to Gulf Coast natural gas liquids pipeline, while Kinder Morgan Inc said in March its proposed Permian Pass pipeline faced an uncertain future as no customers had been lined up for the project because of low prices."

0.6536022659581382," Enterprise Products Partners cuts capex, says oil pipeline volumes steady NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP on Wednesday slashed its capital expenditures for 2020 by about $1 billion as oil demand plummeted due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the midstream company said volumes across its oil pipelines have not yet declined. Oil demand has crashed about 30% globally as the coronavirus pandemic has restricted travel and sent crude prices briefly into negative territory last week as storage across the world fills rapidly. Enterprise said it expects crude oil production out of the Permian basin, the largest U.S. shale play located in Texas and New Mexico, to drop in coming months and said gathering and processing volumes are likely to decline. About 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in Enterprise’s pipelines in the Permian Basin are covered under long-term contracts, said Jim Teague, co-chief executive officer at Enterprise, on a first-quarter earnings call with analysts. Those take-or-pay agreements require customers to either supply oil or pay a specific amount to Enterprise. “Tanks have been converted to crude oil services. Our people have found places to store crude oil that two months ago, we didn’t even know existed,” he said. Earlier this month Enterprise said it will give oil companies hunting for places to store crude the chance to ship barrels on its Seaway pipeline from the Gulf Coast to Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. storage hub. The company said on Wednesday Seaway was “virtually full.” Enterprise reported earnings-per-share of 61 cents. It reduced its guidance for total 2020 growth capital investments by approximately $1 billion to a range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion and said six potential joint ventures are being negotiated, which could further reduce capex. Regulators in Texas, the largest U.S. oil-producing state, are considering producer calls for cuts. Texas energy regulators will next week vote on the proposal to reduce state oil output.

6.320089358560099," Enterprise opens up pipeline freeway to Cushing storage hub for crude producers NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said it will give oil companies hunting for places to store crude the chance to ship barrels on its Seaway pipeline from the Gulf Coast to Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. storage hub. Storage is filling rapidly in the United States as the coronavirus pandemic has chopped fuel demand by roughly 30% and sent oil prices plunging, leaving few options for producers. Even though the world’s oil producers agreed to cut output by as much as 19.5 million barrels per day, traders expect U.S. storage to be full by mid-year as the cuts are playing catch-up to last month’s plunge in demand. The Cushing delivery point for benchmark U.S. crude futures has roughly 27 million barrels of free space out of about 76.1 million barrels of total working capacity. “Given the current turmoil in the crude oil market, including impacts on both refinery and export demand, there is strong market interest to access the Cushing storage market,” Enterprise said in a filing late Monday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The 400,000-barrel-per-day Seaway line once only went to Cushing before it was reversed in 2012 to send barrels to the U.S. Gulf for exports. The space that will be used now to send barrels from Fort Bend County, Texas to Cushing represents previously unused capacity on the pipeline system, and barrels will still be shipped in the other direction to the Houston area, a company spokesman said in a statement. Most recent U.S. pipeline construction has been geared for moving oil from big shale plays to the U.S. Gulf to take advantage of growing U.S. exports. But exports have fallen as demand slumped and companies are scrambling for storage. Plains All American Pipeline President Harry Pefanis described the scarcity of storage in stark terms at a Texas regulatory hearing on Tuesday. His company now requires proof of destination to ship oil. “We can’t act as a storage facility for everybody that doesn’t have a market,” Pefanis said. About 54% of total U.S. crude working storage capacity was full as of April 3, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Enterprise said it would offer service from Enterprise Katy in Fort Bend County, Texas, to Cushing. It plans to charge spot shippers $3 a barrel for the service, effective May 1, according to the filing. Seaway is not the only line responding to the need for storage. Phillips 66 Partners LP is offering storage on its Gray Oak crude system in Texas. Front-month U.S. crude futures for May delivery traded at more than $7 a barrel below futures for June delivery on expectations of oversupply at Cushing. That is the widest front-month spread since 2009. Physical crude prices in the Houston area firmed as barrels were expected to move inland from the coast on Seaway, traders said. [CRU/C]"
-32.05703134310646," Enterprise Products expects to complete part of Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline by year-end NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Thursday it will own a 29% undivided joint interest in the Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline system and construction on the segment to Webster, Texas, is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The company said its Midland‐to‐ECHO 3 crude pipeline, which will be a part of the Wink-to-Webster system, is expected to be in service in the third quarter of this year. “I don’t expect more than 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day to flow until the Webster leg is complete,” Jim Teague, co-chief executive officer, said on its quarterly earnings call. The Wink-to-Webster Pipeline System is expected to transport more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and condensate from the Permian, the largest U.S. shale basin, to the Gulf Coast. The project is a joint venture between affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corp, Plains All American Pipeline LP, MPLX LP among others. Enterprise’s Midland-to-ECHO 4 pipeline is expected to be in service by the second quarter of 2021. The system transports crude from Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian basin, to Enterprise’s ECHO terminal in Houston. In 2021, Enterprise said it expects to see an increase in crude volumes going through the Midland-to-ECHO pipeline system, saying the pipelines were backed by firm commitments from oil producers. Midstream companies have raced to add pipeline capacity from the Permian to the Gulf Coast as a shale boom has helped send U.S. crude exports to record highs. However, the pace of new pipeline projects has slowed as production growth is expected to ease due to producers’ plans to reduce spending on new drilling for a second year in a row in 2020. Transportation volumes on its Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline increased 7% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a year earlier. Total crude oil marine terminal volumes rose 38% to 926,000 bpd in the fourth quarter compared to 673,000 bpd a year earlier, the company said. The company’s Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline, which was converted from natural gas liquids (NGL) to crude service, is likely to remain in crude service for the foreseeable future, a company executive said on the call."
-30.566484812622154," Enterprise, Enbridge to develop U.S. Gulf Coast crude export terminal HOUSTON (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge Inc have agreed to jointly develop a U.S. Gulf Coast crude export terminal that would load supertankers off Freeport, Texas, Enbridge said on Monday. The pipeline operators plan to finalize a deal that would provide Enbridge an option to purchase ownership interest in Enterprise’s Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port license, Enbridge said. Enterprise and Enbridge were previously rivals in a field of at least nine competing to build deepwater export projects to load U.S. shale oil onto Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) that carry around 2 million barrels apiece. Enterprise in late July announced it had signed long-term agreements with oil major Chevron Corp that advanced the project. It was the first company - and is still the only one - to make a final investment decision on a proposed U.S. deepwater port. Enterprise expects to receive a deepwater port license in the second half of 2020, with construction taking about two years, spokesman Rick Rainey said. In October, U.S. maritime officials resumed a licensing review of the proposed SPOT facility after a five-month pause to collect additional information. Enbridge did not respond to requests for comment. Rivals racing to develop similar projects include U.S. refiner Phillips 66, commodities trader Trafigura AG and privately held Sentinel Midstream LLC. Carlyle Group said in October it had dropped out of a $1 billion crude export terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas. The Enterprise-Enbridge partnership comes a few weeks after the companies announced an open season to solicit shipper commitments for a 200,000 barrel-per-day expansion on their jointly owned Seaway pipeline system, which carries crude from the main U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to U.S. refiners. A jointly developed deepwater facility would open a direct route for U.S. crude exports from Cushing for barrels produced in Canada and midwestern U.S. fields including in the Rockies and the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma, said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar. Enterprise “now has the momentum to get the first buoy done,” Fielden said. Currently, only the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) can fully load VLCCs from the Gulf Coast."
-30.566484812622154," Enbridge, Enterprise to develop Gulf of Mexico crude export terminal Dec 9 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc and Enterprise Products Partners LP on Monday signed an agreement to jointly develop a deepwater offshore crude oil export terminal in the Gulf of Mexico capable of loading Very Large Crude Carriers. Both pipeline operators will work to finalize an equity participation agreement that would provide Enbridge an option to purchase ownership interest in Enterprise’s Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), subject to SPOT receiving a deep-water port license, Enbridge said in a statement. The companies would first jointly develop the SPOT project, and depending on how the export market grows, would utilize Enbridge’s Texas COLT deep-water port or a similar project. “Enbridge and Enterprise Products are partners in the Seaway Pipeline system. It makes a lot of sense to leverage this strong business relationship in moving forward with an offshore deepwater export facility,” Enbridge said in a statement. Texas COLT, a joint venture between Enbridge and Oiltanking Partners, is another deepwater export terminal off the coast of Freeport, Texas in the Gulf of Mexico and is one of several similar projects proposing facilities that would move U.S. shale to overseas markets.

3.0023095987234485," Enterprise's Midland-to-ECHO oil pipeline system expansions to add 450,000 bpd each NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Monday it expects its Midland-to-ECHO 3 and 4 Permian crude pipeline system expansions will add about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) each of additional capacity. Midland-to-ECHO 4 is further expandable up to 540,000 bpd, Jim Teague, chief executive of Enterprise’s general partner, said on its quarterly earnings call. The Midland-to-ECHO 3 pipeline expansion is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. The system transports crude from Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian basin, to Enterprise’s ECHO terminal in Houston. The addition of new pipelines this year has helped alleviate a bottleneck in the Permian, the biggest oil basin in the country, where prices slumped to the lowest levels in about four years in 2018. Oil production growth in the Permian has slowed in recent months as drillers reduce the number of oil rigs, focusing more on earnings growth instead of increased output. “Our customers are large producers. I don’t see someone like Exxon or Chevron slowing down,” Teague said. Marine terminal volumes jumped to a record 1.9 million bpd in the third quarter compared to 1.5 million bpd a year earlier. The recent spike in global freight rates for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) slowed export activity from the U.S. Gulf Coast, Brent Secrest, Enterprise’s chief commercial officer said. Rates to charter oil tankers from the Gulf, United Kingdom and the U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia surged to record highs this month as global oil traders grappled with a tanker shortage in the aftermath of U.S. sanctions on units of Chinese giant COSCO. However, the ability to store and flexibility to sell to local refiners in the Houston area helped cushion the impact of the slowdown in exports, Secrest said. “People choose to go to Houston because you have that luxury ... What you’re seeing in other markets that are forced to export is either they are severely discounted to Houston or the barrels aren’t following to the water,” he said."

-4.432001917793795," New Permian pipeline startup splits WTI Midland market: traders NEW YORK (Reuters) - WTI Midland crude prices at Plains All American Pipeline LP’s Midland terminal spiked this month compared with barrels traded at Enterprise Products Partners LP’s Midland terminal as Plains’ Cactus II pipeline began service, oil traders familiar with the matter said. The 670,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Cactus II pipeline began commercial deliveries earlier this month, sending WTI Midland prices at Plains terminal as much as 50 cents per barrel above those at Enterprise’s terminal, they said. Price reporting agency Argus Media said on Monday it would change the way it assesses WTI Midland to exclusively reflect prices at Enterprise’s terminal “to more closely align its assessment” with customer expectations and most spot trades. The proposed change is open for comments until the end of the month, Argus said in a notice. The move could draw criticism from Plains All American and shippers on the Cactus II pipeline, the market sources said. Commodities merchant Trafigura AG [TRAFGF.UL] is the biggest shipper on Plains’ Cactus II pipeline. Plains did not immediately respond to a request for comment. About 90% of Argus’ WTI Midland prices typically reflect trades at Enterprise’s terminal, sources said. WTI Midland at Plains was last seen about 20-25 cents per barrel above Enterprise, dealers said. Midland prices are seen as a proxy for prices in the nearby Permian basin, the biggest shale patch in the United States."
-12.098943023811872," Enterprise Products plans to build Gulf of Mexico crude terminal in two years NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP EPD.N said on Wednesday it expects to take about two years to construct its oil export project called Sea Port Oil Terminal, or SPOT, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Permitting for the terminal was expected to reach the final stages by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and final approval was expected during the second quarter, a company executive said on its second quarter earnings call. Enterprise Products signed long-term agreements with Chevron Corp CVX.N to support the development of SPOT, which will be designed to efficiently load supertankers capable of transporting about 2 million barrels of crude. The company said it is building a new Permian crude pipeline but declined to say whether it would be called Midland-to-Echo 3. Analysts expect Enterprise to expand its Permian crude oil transportation system via a possible Midland-to-Echo 3 pipeline with connectivity to the Houston ECHO terminal after the agreements with Chevron. “We have now joined the port and moved our efforts on the Houston Ship Channel to Washington, for funding and permitting of a significant expansion of the ship channel in an expedited way,” Jim Teague, chief executive of Enterprise’s general partner, said on the call. The energy industry is working with the Port of Houston to accelerate the process widening the ship channel from about 530 ft to 700 ft (161.5 m to 213.4 m) through local funding, Enterprise said. “As we see it, every bit of incremental U.S. energy growth is headed for exports and most of that is pointed toward Houston,” Teague said. The company forecast U.S. crude exports to increase from about 3 million barrels per day today to 8 million bpd in the next few years as shale production continues to climb. A shale boom has helped make the United States the world’s biggest oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Output in the Permian, the largest oil basin in the country, is expected to climb by 34,000 bpd, to a fresh peak of about 4.21 million bpd in August, according to government data. The company’s profits rose in the second quarter thanks to record volumes on its liquids and natural gas pipelines as well as a strong performance in the natural gas and petrochemical segments. The pipeline operator posted earnings of 55 cents a unit, four cents above Refinitiv estimates. Its revenue declined to $8.28 billion, missing Wall Street’s estimate of $8.67 billion."

Enterprise’s Sea Port Oil Terminal, or SPOT, is one of at least eight similar projects off the Texas and Louisiana coasts proposed to export oil from the region’s shale fields. It would compete with projects under development by commodities trader Trafigura Ltd, private equity firm Carlyle Group CG.O, and pipeline operators Magellan Midstream Partners MMP.N, Tallgrass Energy LP TGE.N, and Phillips 66 PSX.N. All the projects aim to carry rising shale production from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to overseas markets. A total of 2.3 million additional barrels per day of shale is expected to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast in the next year as volumes rise and new pipelines begin operation. Enterprise declined to say whether Chevron would take a financial stake in the project, or whether Chevron would become a customer for a Permian crude pipeline that it calls Midland-to-Echo 3. Chevron was unavailable to comment. The value of the agreements was not disclosed. Enterprise is due to release its second-quarter results on Wednesday and could provide more details then, spokesman Rick Rainey said. Chevron agreed to use Enterprise’s crude oil transportation, marine terminals and storage facilities, which include its Houston storage facilities, the companies said. SPOT is planned for a site in 115 feet (35m) of water, about 40 miles (64 km) off the coast of Houston. Up to two very large crude carriers (VLCCs) could moor at the site and load up to 2 million barrels per day. The facility would connect to an onshore tank farm able to hold up to 4.8 million barrels of crude oil, according to its federal permit application.

2.6009152926474965," Exclusive: Enterprise Products explores sale of Texas oil terminal stake - document HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners LP is looking to sell its 50% stake in a recently-completed South Texas crude export terminal, according to a marketing document viewed by Reuters. Enterprise is weighing an exit from the joint venture with terminal operator Plains All American Pipeline LP after proposing to build its own offshore port near Houston. There are at least eight proposed deepwater oil ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast seeking to handle rising shale exports. The Houston-based pipeline operator has hired RBC Capital Markets LLC to advise on a sale, according to the document, which did not indicate a price. Enterprise declined to comment, referring queries to Plains, which did not respond to requests. RBC Capital Markets declined to comment. The joint venture, Eagle Ford Terminals Corpus Christi, is connected to the two companies’ 660,000 barrels per day (bpd) Eagle Ford JV Pipeline. The pipeline brings crude from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale fields to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The potential sale comes as three new crude pipelines will by mid-2020 begin carrying some 2 million bpd from Texas shale fields to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Enterprise in January filed to build its own deepwater export terminal, Sea Port of Texas (SPOT), at a site 40 miles (64 km) off the coast of Houston. “Enterprise is focusing on the Houston market,” said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar. Enterprise has a much larger presence in the Houston area than in Corpus Christi, and it is unclear whether the terminal can compete with larger facilities being built in the Corpus Christi area, Fielden added. “That location isn’t somewhere they feel is their sweet spot.” Last month, Enterprise Chief Executive Jim Teague said Chinese companies looking to sign long-term agreements to buy U.S. crude oil have virtually disappeared amid the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. The Eagle Ford Terminals Corpus Christi terminal’s dock will be able to partially load Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) once a project to dredge the Corpus Christi ship channel is completed next year. The facility can load up to 40,000 barrels of oil per hour and has four storage tanks with a combined 1.4 million barrels of storage capacity, with land available to expand capacity to 5 million barrels. The marketing document called the facility “a world-class crude oil export terminal” that is “is well-positioned to capitalize on early-mover advantage with an expected in-service date of Q2 2019.” Asian demand for U.S. crude is expected to continue growing, with around 50% of 2018 U.S. Gulf Coast exports reaching Asian destinations, according to the marketing document. U.S. crude exports could reach 8 million barrels per day by 2025, the company said. Currently, the U.S. exports around 3 million bpd of crude, according to government data."
2.6737238673940658," China not signing deals to buy U.S. crude oil: Enterprise CEO HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chinese companies looking to sign long-term agreements to buy crude oil from U.S. oil exporters have virtually disappeared, the chief executive of Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Tuesday. The United States and China have been embroiled in an increasingly bitter trade dispute for nearly a year, and it escalated recently with the U.S. imposition of 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. The trade war has all but shut down shipments of U.S. crude to China, and it is unlikely Chinese buyers will sign long-term offtake agreements with U.S. crude exporters right now, Enterprise CEO Jim Teague said on the sidelines of a Houston energy industry conference. “When I was in China, I heard two words at every meeting: ‘Trump’ and ‘tariffs,’” Teague said. The Obama administration ended a 40-year ban on U.S. crude exports in 2015 and they have risen sharply ever since. The country now routinely exports more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude. In the first half of 2018, China was the biggest importer of U.S. crude, averaging 377,000 bpd. In the six months ended February, the most recent data available, it has dropped to 41,600 bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Enterprise, an oil pipeline and terminal operator, filed for permits in January to build a deep-water crude export terminal capable of handling supertankers some 35 miles (56 km) off the coast of Houston, joining at least seven other firms racing to build such facilities as U.S. exports climb. Teague said demand for U.S. crude will shift to other countries as U.S. producers pump additional volumes. “Demand will be what it is regardless of the trade war because trade patterns will just change,” he said. “The big (U.S. oil producers) will be the ones who will make it work.”"

4.2593640069843905," Enterprise Products crude volumes at terminals jumps to record NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Wednesday volumes at its crude marine terminals jumped to a record of nearly 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, despite a disruption on the Houston Ship Channel. A petrochemical fire and fog halted vessel traffic for several days and disrupted movements in the nation’s busiest oil port in late March and into April. Enterprise said it expects in early May to load the remaining backlog of vessels due to the disruption. The company also said volumes of crude from the Permian basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, is expected to increase by about 700,000 bpd in 2019, with export demand rising. “We believe substantially all of this increase in volumes will be destined for international markets,” Jim Teague, chief executive of Enterprise’s general partner, said in a statement. Production in the Permian basin, spanning Texas and New Mexico, has surged over the past year, largely outpacing pipeline capacity from the region. That has prompted pipeline companies to announce several new lines and conversions of existing lines to accommodate growing crude volumes. Output in Texas, the largest producing state, rose 1.3 percent to 4.8 million bpd in February, while in New Mexico, it rose 3.2 percent to 843,000 bpd, according to U.S. government data this week. Enterprise’s Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline volumes increased 15 percent from a year earlier to a net 456,000 bpd for the first quarter. The pipeline runs from Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian basin, to Enterprise’s ECHO terminal in Houston. During the first quarter, the company said it also completed the repurposing of one of its Seminole NGL pipelines into crude oil service, now referred to as the Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline. This pipeline began limited service in February and full commercial operations April 1. “Starting April 1, that pipeline was handed over to the committed shipper and that volume is at 205,000 bpd,” a company executive said during an earnings call. About 475,000 bpd of capacity on Midland-to-ECHO 1 was under contracts for the first quarter, and contractual volumes are expected to peak at about 535,000 bpd in the second quarter."
4.2593640069843905," Enterprise Products Partners' crude volumes at terminals jumps to record NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Wednesday volumes at its crude marine terminals jumped to a record of nearly 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, despite a disruption on the Houston Ship Channel. A petrochemical fire and fog halted vessel traffic for several days and disrupted movements in the nation’s busiest oil port in late March and into April. Enterprise said it expects to load the remaining backlog of vessels due to the disruption in early May. The company also said volumes of crude from the Permian basin, the largest U.S. oilpatch, is expected to increase by about 700,000 bpd in 2019, with export demand rising. “We believe substantially all of this increase in volumes will be destined for international markets,” Jim Teague, chief executive officer of Enterprise’s general partner said in a statement.

Enterprise CEO Jim Teague said at IHS Markit’s CERAWeek conference that new crude export terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast are needed to handle an expected flow from U.S. shale fields. The pipeline and terminal operator proposed in January to build a deepwater export terminal 40 miles (65 km) off the Houston shoreline."
5.036419040185108," New Enterprise Products crude pipeline soon to begin service HOUSTON (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP’s repurposed natural gas liquids pipeline in the Permian Basin will begin limited operations in February to carry crude oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, ahead of its original plan, the company said on Thursday. The Houston pipeline operator has begun the process of converting its Seminole NGL pipeline to begin carrying more than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) from West Texas next month for a single customer with a long-term 10-year contract, CEO James Teague said in a conference call. “We have a lot of levers to pull and we pulled the levers that made this happen,” Teague said. The pipeline was originally expected to begin moving crude in the second quarter of 2019. It will begin full service in April. The accelerated schedule helped push Midland crude prices higher over the past few weeks, traders said. West Texas Intermediate at Midland strengthened earlier this month to a premium to U.S. crude futures for the first time in a year, trading at a 35-cent per barrel premium on Thursday, traders said. The company also has a team currently in Washington, D.C., submitting an application to U.S. regulators for permits to build a deep-water oil export terminal that would load 85,000 barrels per hour onto supertankers off the coast of Houston, Teague said. The U.S. government shutdown had delayed Enterprise’s project because the company could not submit its permit applications to the U.S. Maritime Administration. Once the application is filed, U.S. regulators will be required to complete a review over one year, even if the U.S. government shuts down again, Teague said. Enterprise shares rose 46 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $28.12 in early trade on Thursday after the company reported net income of $1.28 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $774 million in the same period last year.

9.004975491840613," RPT-UPDATE 1-CME plans to launch e-auction for U.S. crude oil exports (Repeats to additional subscribers, with no change to text) * Enterprise to offer WTI Midland crude on CME e-auction platform * First auction scheduled for early March SINGAPORE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - CME Group said on Tuesday it plans to launch an electronic auction platform with U.S. energy firm Enterprise Products Partners LP in March to sell U.S. spot crude oil export cargoes. The United States became the world’s largest oil producer last year as shale production hit new highs, encouraging exchanges and pricing agencies to launch new mechanisms to allow companies to price and hedge U.S. oil exports. Enterprise will offer light sweet crude oil from Midland, Texas, to be loaded at the Enterprise Houston Ship Channel (EHSC) terminal in the first auction scheduled to be held in early March, CME said in a statement. Buyers will place bids during the auction at prices based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Houston futures. “The electronic auction will provide a competitive and transparent venue for firms across the world to efficiently hedge U.S. crude oil,” the exchange said. The auction process is similar to one held by CME’s affiliate Dubai Mercantile Exchange for Middle East crude. Enterprise transports crude oil from the Permian Basin to Houston via the Midland-to-ECHO pipeline system, which has a capacity of 575,000 barrels per day. The ECHO terminal in Houston can store 7.4 million barrels of crude oil. CME launched its crude oil futures contract deliverable at Houston in November. Rival Intercontinental Exchange Inc also has a WTI oil contract, deliverable at Magellan Midstream Partners LP’s East Houston terminal."
4.801531576042089," Enterprise mulls advancing Permian NGL pipeline conversion to crude NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Wednesday it could convert one of its natural gas liquids (NGL) pipelines to crude oil out of the Permian basin as early as the second quarter of 2019, ahead of an earlier timeline of 2020. The startup of the Shin Oak pipeline, expected in the second quarter of 2019, would provide Enterprise the option to divert NGL volumes from one of its existing NGL pipelines onto Shin Oak and repurpose the vacated NGL pipeline to crude oil service. “We’re not through building takeaway out of the Permian, and we are putting ourselves in a position to be able to convert a pipeline, but the earliest that would be is when Shin Oak comes on, and that’s not until the second quarter of next year,” Chief Executive Jim Teague said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call. A production surge in the Permian basin, the biggest oil patch in the United States, has outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity, causing bottlenecks and depressing prices in the region. Midstream companies have raced to add takeaway capacity and provide links to the Gulf Coast refining and export hub. Enterprise has said it has three existing NGL pipelines that run from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast - the Seminole Blue, Seminole Red and Chaparral. Separately, the company has expanded capacity on the Seaway pipeline using drag reducing agents this month. The Seaway system hauls crude from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. oil futures, to Gulf Coast refineries. Last quarter, the company said it would expand capacity on the Seaway system capacity to about 950,000 barrels per day from 850,000. A high-stakes competition is emerging among companies proposing multi-million-dollar crude terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast to handle a gusher of shale oil coming from West Texas oilfields. Enterprise has said it expects to receive permit approval in 2020 for its proposed oil export terminal off the Texas Gulf Coast for supertankers. “Our deepwater port project is advancing on both the engineering and commercial fronts. We’re in discussions with domestic producers and global consumers,” Teague said on Wednesday. He touted the proposed terminal’s connectivity to storage and various grades of crude as well as access to third-party pipelines and storage. “I don’t think there’s another location that has that,” he said."
-5.789870732684757," Enterprise crude pipeline expansion to be delayed to year-end (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP’s Seaway crude pipeline will not achieve a targeted increase in capacity to 950,000 barrels per day because of issues unrelated to the expansion, the company said on Tuesday. Enterprise and its joint venture partner, Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc, originally expected to begin taking an additional 100,000 bpd in September. In recent days, it began adding a friction-reducing agent to increase the potential capacity of the 760-mile (1223 km) pipeline. However, the September target date has been delayed due to what was described as third-party issues unrelated to the capacity expansion, Enterprise spokesman Rick Rainey said. He declined to provide further details. The crude production surge in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the biggest oilpatch in the United States, has outpaced the region’s pipeline capacity, causing bottlenecks and depressing prices in the region. Enterprise and others are building new or expanding existing lines to soak up the new production. The existing Seaway system was expanded several years ago to carry up to 850,000 bpd from the main U.S. crude storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to storage facilities and refineries along the Gulf Coast."

-9.482985964310084," Enterprise Products sees oil-export terminal approval in 2020 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Wednesday it expects to receive permit approval in about 18 to 24 months for a proposed oil export terminal off the Texas Gulf Coast for supertankers. Enterprise had started front-end engineering and design and was preparing the application for permit approval, the midstream company said in a slide presentation at a Barclays energy conference in New York on Wednesday. The offshore terminal is underwritten by long-term contracts and is capable of loading at about 85,000 barrels per hour, Enterprise said. Enterprise has been testing supertanker loading capabilities at the terminal since at least April and loaded the first vessel in June. Companies have raced to build export infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf Coast after Washington lifted a four-decade ban on crude exports in late 2015. Supertankers, or Very Large Crude Carriers, are the most efficient and cost-effective way to export crude oil to international markets since they can carry about 2 million barrels of oil. Enterprise’s crude exports totaled about 645,000 bpd in July, according to the presentation. Overall, U.S. crude exports eased slightly in July from a record 2.2 million bpd in June, foreign trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed on Wednesday. Enterprise is also considering additional projects to move oil out of the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the biggest U.S. oil patch, as the region’s production has largely exceeded the capacity of its pipelines. The company is still evaluating converting an existing natural gas liquids pipeline to carry crude to add incremental capacity. The company’s recently completed Midland–to–Sealy oil pipeline is currently moving volumes at full capacity, about 570,000 barrels per day. Enterprise expects U.S oil and condensate production to reach 12 million bpd in 2020 and the nation’s crude exports to climb above 4 million bpd in 2021. U.S. crude production rose 231,000 barrels per day, or 2 percent, to a record 10.674 million bpd in June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week. Output growth from the Permian basin, which accounts for a majority of the increase in U.S. production, is expected to stall amid takeaway constraints. Drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs), especially in the Permian basin, continue to grow in number, an indication of tightness in completion services, labor and trucking, as well as production takeaway concerns, Enterprise said."
-6.633780697520033," UPDATE 1-Enterprise Products Partners to expand Seaway pipeline capacity (New throughout, adds more details from earnings call) NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Wednesday it would expand its Seaway crude pipeline system capacity to about 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 850,000 bpd. The company said it expects to add drag reducing agents (DRAs) to boost capacity on the Seaway 2 line by about 100,000 bpd by September. The Seaway system hauls crude from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. oil futures, to Gulf Coast refineries. Enterprise said it was also evaluating more expansions of the Seaway system and was mulling converting natural gas liquids (NGL) pipelines to crude oil in order to help alleviate pipeline takeaway constraints in the Permian basin. The production surge in the Permian basin, the biggest oilpatch in the United States, has outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity, causing bottlenecks and depressing prices in the region. Enterprise said total crude oil pipeline transportation volumes were a record 2.1 million bpd for the second quarter of 2018 compared to 1.5 million bpd for the second quarter of 2017. The Midland-to-Sealy crude oil pipeline averaged 545,000 bpd of gross transportation volumes from the Permian basin. That pipeline was recently expanded to 575,000 bpd and is fully subscribed under long term contracts, the company said during its earnings call. In its Houston terminal alone, the company has over 2 million bpd of crude export capacity along with about 1 million bpd at its Texas City facility with Enbridge. U.S. crude exports have surged since Washington lifted a ban in late 2015 and have helped support oil prices as production has climbed to a weekly record of about 11 million bpd. In July, Enterprise said it was planning to develop an offshore crude oil export terminal off the Texas Gulf Coast capable of fully loading Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), which have capacities of about 2 million barrels. The project has seen demand from international customers as well as U.S. producers, the company said. (Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)"

12.64687740812938," Enterprise Products tests supertanker capability for crude exports NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enterprise Products Partners LP said on Thursday it is testing crude supertanker capabilities at its Texas City dock in a move that could make it the second major company in the United States that can handle such vessels. The United States lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports in late 2015 and since then tankers filled with U.S. crude have landed in more than 30 countries. Weekly exports of crude oil surged to a record 2.3 million barrels per day last week, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. The Nave Quasar, a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC), is berthed just off Texas City, according to two shipping sources and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. “The arrival of the Nave Quasar at our Texas City dock is part of a test run to confirm that the facility can accommodate a VLCC ship,” Enterprise spokesman Rick Rainey said in an emailed statement. “We will be evaluating today’s test to determine a path forward for possible VLCC loadings in the future.” VLCCs are the largest oil tankers and can ship some 2 million barrels of oil. So far, only Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately owned crude terminal in the United States, can handle incoming VLCCs. Most U.S. shipping channels are too shallow, although Port Corpus Christi, Texas, is deepening its channel to accommodate large vessels. LOOP has also been testing loading and unloading of supertankers, bringing it closer to being able to ramp up exports of U.S. crude oil."
