7.185628742514977," Russia's Mechel sells main coal mine project to reduce debt MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian steel and coal producer Mechel has sold its stake in the Elga coal mine in Russia, which was its main asset for future growth, to a local businessman to reduce debt, it said on Wednesday, sending its Moscow-listed shares up 17%. After the deal to sell one of the world’s largest coking coal deposits was agreed, two state-controlled Russian banks - Gazprombank and VTB - agreed to restructure part of Mechel’s debt by 7 years with an optional extra 3 years, Mechel said. “With the current economic situation and our debt leverage in mind, we made a difficult but well-considered ... decision to sell Elga Coal Complex,” Oleg Korzhov, Mechel chief executive, said in a statement. “This will enable us to retain financial and social stability...” Elga requires further investments to develop, while Mechel, whose net debt stood at 400 billion roubles ($5.2 billion) at the end of 2019, spent months on debt restructuring talks with its creditors. Mechel, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, sold the 51% in the Elga project to A-Property, controlled by Russian businessman Albert Avdolyan, for 89 billion roubles ($1.2 billion), Mechel said. A-Property also settled Mechel’s debt to the state development bank VEB for $107 million. Mechel will use the proceeds from the deal to repay part of its debt to Gazprombank and VTB in proportion to their share in Mechel’s debt leverage. After that, the overall restructured debt to Gazprombank and VTB Bank will total 237 billion roubles ($3.1 billion), it added. The reduced debt will help Mechel to focus on investment in its coal mining and processing at assets in Russia’s Kuzbass and Yakutia regions and increasing output of high-margin steel products, the company said."

The defence ministry said last week it has started to build 16 brand new hospitals covering the country from the central regions of Moscow and St Petersburg to the south and Volga river areas, as well as in Siberia and far east. The first eight hospitals will be ready by April 30, and the remaining eight operational by May 15, able to accommodate a total of 1,600 people - defence ministry personnel and ordinary citizens, the ministry has said. Mechel said on Friday it was supplying rolled steel to five out of the total 16 hospitals, which the defence ministry is building in a round-the-clock programme. Russia has extended a paid non-working period until April 30 and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Friday the epidemic in the country had not yet peaked, as the situation risks developing into a worst case scenario.

Mechel, which has been engaged in the talks since last year, could be asked to make repayments of up to 373.3 billion roubles ($4.73 billion), company data from the end of 2019 showed. The company agreed this year with its main creditors, Gazprombank and VTB, that they would not demand any early repayments but these debt claim relief deals were due to expire on April 1 and March 31. “Mechel has approached the banks with an offer to extend the waivers until the implementation of its restructuring, and discussions about this (restructuring) are currently in their final stages,” a company representative told Reuters. Gazprombank said it was ready to extend the waiver by one more month, its deputy chairman, Tigran Khachaturov, said. “We plan to give Mechel the chance to reach an agreement with all sides,” Khachaturov said in a statement. VTB said it was considering a request from Mechel, which last year said that it would be unable to begin debt repayments in 2020 and entered a fresh round of talks with creditors.

41.98473282442748," Russian tycoon buys 49% of Elga coal project, talks to Mechel on 51% MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian businessman Albert Avdolyan has reached an agreement to buy a 49% stake in the major Elga coal project in Russia from Russian lender Gazprombank GZPRI.MM, the bank said in a statement on Monday. Avdolyan's company A-Property is still in talks to buy the remaining 51% in the project from Russian steel and coal producer Mechel MTLR.MM. For Mechel, Elga is the biggest growth asset, but it confirmed last week that it was in talks to sell it to reduce the debt burden. Elga, one of the world’s biggest coking coal deposits, requires further investments to develop. Mechel’s net debt stood at 400 billion rubles ($5 billion) at the end of 2019, mainly to Gazprombank and another bank, VTB. The businessman may reach an agreement with Mechel by the end of April and become the owner of 100% in the project, two sources familiar with talks told Reuters on Monday. Mechel is in debt restructuring talks with its creditors, and these discussions directly depend on the result of its Elga negotiations, Mechel said last week. It was not clear how much funding Avdolyan was offering Mechel for the stake. Gazprombank and Avdolyan did not disclose the price of their deal on Monday. According to one of the sources, Gazprombank will get 45 billion rubles ($557 million) for its stake from Avdolyan. Mechel, according to this source, may get 95 billion rubles for its stake from Avdolyan and use them to repay part of its debt to Gazprombank and VTB VTBR.MM in proportion to their share in Mechel's debt portfolio. As a result, Gazprombank would get 85 billion to 90 billion rubles from both the deals in total, the source added. A representative of Avdolyan and Mechel declined to comment. The deal with Avdolyan is profitable for the bank, Gazprombank said in the statement. Gazprombank bought this 49% stake in Elga for 34.4 billion rubles from Mechel as part of the miner’s previous round of debt restructuring talks. That time, Mechel used these proceeds to reduce its debt to another creditor. VTB and Gazprombank previously agreed not to demand any early debt repayments from Mechel. This breathing space expires on March 31-April 1. If the deal to sell Elga does not go through, debt restructuring plans will be altered, Mechel said last week. “There are a lot of nuances, so the negotiations are not finalised,” VTB said in its comment. “We are confident that we will be able to agree on all the details in the near future.” ($1 = 80.7805 rubles)"
34.30656934306569," Russia's Mechel confirms talks to sell coal asset as debt claim relief set to expire MOSCOW, March 19 (Reuters) - Russian steel and coal producer Mechel confirmed on Thursday it was in talks to sell its flagship Elga coal project, one of the world’s biggest coking coal deposits, ahead of the imminent expiry of a debt claim relief deal. Mechel has been negotiating the sale of the Elga coal project, its biggest growth asset, which requires significant further investments to develop, as part of the latest round of protracted debt restructuring talks with its creditors. “In January 2020 the group began negotiations with potential buyers over the sale of the Elga coal complex, which will allow it to reduce its debt burden,” the company, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, said in a statement, adding it had not yet reached a deal. It did not name the potential buyers. Russian company A-Property said in January it had formally requested permission from the country’s anti-monopoly regulator to buy a 100% stake in the Elga project. A spokeswoman for A-Property declined to comment. Mechel holds a 51% stake while one of its main creditors, Gazprombank, holds the remaining 49%. Lender VTB is another principal creditor. Mechel’s net debt, as of the end of 2019, stood at 400 billion roubles. The company has the resources to continue servicing this debt, but is unable to complete repayments or to continue investing in the development of the Elga mine, whose ore reserves stand at 2.2 billion tonnes. The company has asked its creditors to delay the start of its repayments by over 12 months, its financial results report showed on Thursday. Earlier this year, VTB and Gazprombank agreed not to demand any early debt repayments, but this breathing space expires on April 1 and March 31. If the deal to sell Elga does not go through, debt restructuring plans will have to be altered, Mechel said in its report on Thursday. A sale of the stake, however, could bring the company some relief. The Vedomosti business daily cited sources as saying last week that Mechel had requested 100 billion roubles ($1.24 billion) for the 51% Elga stake, which would bring the total value of the mine to 196 billion roubles.

-48.466257668711656," UPDATE 2-Russia's Yakutia governor says decision on Mechel mine due in Q1 (Recasts to focus on timeline of the potential deal, Yakutia governor comments) MOSCOW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A decision on the future of the Elga coal project, one of the world’s largest coking coal deposits, is likely in the first quarter of 2020, the regional governor said in an interview. Expansion of the mine, first developed by Russian steel and coal producer Mechel, has stalled in recent years as the project in the remote Yakutia region of Russia’s Far East demands significant investment to reach its annual operating capacity of 30 million tonnes. Mechel, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, has been weighing its options regarding Elga, its biggest growth asset, for some time as it continues talks with creditors over restructuring $6 billion in loans. It sold a 49% stake in the mine in 2016 to one of its main creditors, Gazprombank, as part of a debt restructuring process. On Tuesday, Russian company A-Property, owned by businessman Albert Avdolyan, said it had formally asked permission from the country’s anti-monopoly regulator to buy the mine from Mechel and Gazprombank. Mechel’s shares rose 8% on the news. Mechel declined to comment on A-Property’s request to Russia’s anti-monopoly regulator. Gazprombank said it was interested in selling its stake to A-Property. “I am optimistic that the issue of Mechel’s debts to its creditors and the structure of this deal will be resolved in the first quarter of 2020,” Aysen Nikolaev, head of Russia’s Yakutia region, said in an interview. Nikolaev said he has held regular meetings with both Zyuzin and Elga’s prospective buyers to discuss the mine’s future ownership as a ramp-up would require significant investment that Mechel’s current financial position is unlikely to allow. A main challenge requiring major funds is the expansion of the mine’s transport infrastructure. A 320 km railroad built by Mechel can only carry 5-6 million tonnes of coal a year, Nikolaev said. Elga’s reserves are seen at 2.2 billion tonnes. Last year A-Property made a surprise offer to buy Gazprombank’s stake in the mine, around the time when Mechel was asking its creditors to push back its debt repayments. The offer prompted Gazprombank to give Mechel the option to buy back a 34% stake before the lender considered selling its share to A-Property or to a different buyer. That deadline expired on Jan. 20. Analysts at BCS Global Markets said selling its stake in Elga could allow Mechel to reduce its debt burden by 12%, but would constrain its future development options and cash generating ability. Mechel’s debt at the end of the third quarter of 2019 stood at 408 billion roubles. Little known A-Property has previously said its interest in Elga is in line with its plans to create an industrial cluster in the far east of Russia. The cluster includes the gas producing Yakut Fuel and Energy Company, the Ogodzha coal project and the Vera coal terminal, A-Property said."

Mechel, which is in talks with its creditors about restructuring $6 billion in loans, did not give details about the new offer. It sold a 49% stake in the Elga project in Russia's far east, its biggest asset, to Gazprombank GZPRI.MM, one of its main creditors, in 2016 as part of a debt restructuring process. The mine holds one of the world’s largest coking coal deposits with reserves of 2.2 billion tonnes and Mechel, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, was granted a pre-emptive right by Gazprombank to buy a 34% stake back before a deadline that expired on Monday. This was valued at about 30 billion roubles ($487 million) at the time, sources said. Gazprombank said on Tuesday that Mechel had failed to exercise this pre-emptive right in time, adding the bank would consider options for further action. A representative of Mechel said the company needed more time to study the alternative offer it had received, but provided no further details. Analysts at BCS Global Markets said Mechel’s decision was expected, given market rumours it could sell its remaining 51% stake in Elga as well. “This would not materially improve net debt and would mean Mechel would lose its core growth asset,” BCS analysts wrote. Last year, the bank received a surprise offer for its Elga holdings from investor Albert Avdolyan and his A-Property group, which prompted the bank to offer Mechel the pre-emptive right that expired on Monday. A-Property declined to comment on whether it had made the renewed offer to Mechel. ""We are ready to consider the possibility of restructuring Mechel's current debts in light of a strategic investor entering the project,"" a source at Gazprombank said, adding the bank was counting on the support of VTB VTBR.MM, Mechel's other main creditor, on the matter. VTB declined to comment. Last year, Russian newspaper Vedomosti cited sources as saying that Mechel’s creditors had begun discussing the Elga project with potential buyers. The state-owned Rostec corporation and Russian coal producers VostokCoal and CoalStar were named as potential buyers by Vedomosti. Rostec said it had not made an offer to participate in the Elga project. A representative of CoalStar owner Eduard Khudainatov declined to comment.

Mechel, which had already postponed debt repayments to 2020-2022 following lengthy restructuring talks with Russian state banks earlier this year, is now asking to push payments back to 2024-2026, an executive at Sberbank, one of its key lenders, said. The company’s first-half results published on Thursday showed it still has net debt of 411 billion roubles ($6.21 billion) excluding fines and penalties, though that was down 12 billion roubles year-on-year. “Sberbank will consider the question on restructuring after an analysis of the company’s financial model,” Sberbank’s deputy board chairman Anatoly Popov said in a statement. Mechel’s other key lenders, Gazprombank and VTB, also told Reuters on Thursday they had received and were considering Mechel’s request for a postponement. “We are approaching the period of our main debt’s maturity in accordance with loan agreements we made with lender banks in 2016,” Mechel chief executive Oleg Korzhov said in a statement. But Korzhov said the company’s cash flow was not sufficient to fulfil all its 2020-2022 debt repayment obligations, though cash flow did meet the company’s current capital expenditure and debt servicing needs. “We have accordingly called on our lenders with an offer on moving the debt maturity to a later period. The banks are now considering our offer, and we expect to reach an agreement on this issue in the near future,” Korzhov said. Mechel declined to comment on the proposed timeframe of the postponement but said it was expecting to reach an agreement on the matter in the near future. The company’s shares on the Moscow exchange were trading down 3.6% at 1456 GMT. Mechel, controlled by Russian businessman Igor Zyuzin, borrowed extensively during the commodities boom in the 2000s. Its lengthy restructuring following the 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated by Russia’s economic crisis in 2014. In April 2017, Russia’s three largest state banks confirmed a restructuring of $5.1 billion of the company’s more than $6 billion debt. Mechel’s net debt to EBITDA ratio now stands at 6.4 times. “The deterioration of Mechel’s financial position is directly related to price declines in the market for thermal coal,” Maxim Khudalov, an analyst at the ACRA rating agency, said.

0.0," UPDATE 1-Russia's Mechel seeks to postpone debt repayments to 2024-26 -Ifax (Updates to add context, quotes) MOSCOW, July 24 (Reuters) - Russian coal and steel producer Mechel has asked banks to push back its debt repayments to 2024-2026 from 2020-2024, Interfax news agency cited an executive at Russian state lender Sberbank as saying on Wednesday. Mechel, once on the brink of bankruptcy, has been in restructuring talks with its lenders for several years. Its debt to Russia’s three largest state-controlled banks - Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank - stands at 347.5 billion roubles ($5.5 billion). Mechel submitted a new restructuring proposal to the banks in June, chief financial officer Nelli Galeeva was cited by Interfax as saying at the time, adding that the company hoped an agreement could be reached before the end of the year. Sberbank is considering Mechel’s request, the lender’s deputy board chairman Anatoly Popov was quoted as saying by Interfax on Wednesday. Mechel declined to comment. VTB said Mechel was repaying its debts on schedule and its proposal would be considered in due course, Interfax cited the lender as saying. Gazprombank said it had not yet received an official request from Mechel, Interfax reported. Mechel, controlled by Russian businessman Igor Zyuzin, borrowed extensively during the commodities boom in the 2000s. Its lengthy restructuring following the 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated by Russia’s economic crisis in 2014. In April 2017, Russia’s three largest state banks confirmed a restructuring of $5.1 billion of the company’s more than $6 billion debt. In July 2018, Mechel made significant progress in restructuring the remainder of its debt after obtaining a loan to refinance an earlier pre-export financing agreement worth $1 billion. The company is also in talks with lenders of its credit agency-guaranteed (ECA) loan, which stands at $460 million. In its latest earnings report Mechel said its net debt excluding fines and penalties had dropped to 456.6 billion roubles at the end of the first quarter of 2019, from 467.7 billion roubles at the end of 2018.

-0.8888888888888897," Steel producer Mechel's 2018 profits fall 7 percent on lower sales MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian steel and coal producer Mechel said on Thursday its 2018 core earnings fell 7 percent versus the previous year, with lower sales in the mining division only partly offset by higher coal prices. Mechel, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, said its 2018 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were at 75.67 billion roubles ($1.2 billion), down from 81.11 billion in 2017. Mechel, at one point on the brink of bankruptcy, has been in restructuring talks with its lenders for several years. In January, the company completed the restructuring of a $1 billion syndicated loan. On Thursday, Mechel said net debt stood at 468 billion roubles by the end of 2018, compared to 466.87 at the end of 2017. “Our finance expenses went down by 5.6 billion roubles, or 12 percent, year-on-year due to decrease of the Bank of Russia key interest rate as well as the group’s efforts to restructure debt and decrease debt costs,” chief financial officer Nelli Galeeva said in the statement. Mechel’s shares were trading up 4.93 percent at 1130 GMT. The decline in Mechel’s mining division sale volumes was due to railcar shortages in the second half of the year, the company said. Coal mining volumes fell 9 percent compared to 2017 and coking coal sales fell by 10 percent, the company said in a presentation. “Considering the major work we have done last year to prepare reserves for mining, we expect our output to grow this year,” mining division head Pavel Shtark said in a statement. “The persistently high prices on the mining division’s products will also help us improve our financial results,” he added. Average coking coal prices on the Russian market in 2018 were about 17 percent higher than during the previous year, Mechel said in its presentation. Overall revenue in 2018 rose by 5 percent year-on-year to 312.6 billion roubles, Mechel said, supported by positive price trends in steel. The company also benefited from the write-off of certain fines and penalties after Mechel fulfilled the conditions of its debt restructuring with Russian state banks, Galeeva said in the statement."

-12.977099236641232," Russia's Mechel puts off debt restructuring to 2019 MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian steel and coal producer Mechel MTLR.MM has postponed completing a painful and lengthy debt restructuring process to 2019, the company said on Tuesday. Mechel, at one point on the brink of bankruptcy, has been in restructuring talks with its lenders for several years. On Tuesday the company said the share of its unrestructured debt portfolio was now down to 9 percent. It had planned to complete the process by the end of this year, but has now postponed this to 2019. “We continue working on restructuring the remainder of our loans and expect to complete this process next year,” Mechel chief executive Oleg Korzhov said on Tuesday. The company said its net debt, excluding fines and penalties on overdue amounts, stood at 464.2 billion roubles ($6.97 billion) as of Sept. 30. Mechel, controlled by Russian businessman Igor Zyuzin, borrowed extensively during the commodities boom in the 2000s. Its lengthy restructuring following the 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated by Russia’s economic crisis in 2014. Russia's three largest state-controlled banks - Sberbank SBER.MM, VTB VTBR.MM and Gazprombank - subsequently confirmed, in April 2017, a restructuring of $5.1 billion of Mechel's more than $6 billion debt. In July made significant progress in restructuring the remainder of its debt after obtaining a loan to refinance an earlier pre-export financing agreement worth $1 billion. Mechel’s third-quarter financial results, published on Tuesday, were weaker than in the second quarter, the company said, due to planned repairs at steelmaking facilities and transport limitations due to railway car shortages. This did not significantly impact revenues, Mechel said, as the price environment was strong. Revenues were down 3 percent to 79.97 billion roubles compared to the previous three months. Operating costs did rise, however, bringing down earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Core earnings dropped 17 percent in the third quarter, compared to the second, to 19.21 billion roubles. “Later this year and next year we still have several major repairs ahead of us, necessary for increasing production and further expansion of our product range,” Korzhov said in a statement.

Mechel, which has been in talks with some of its lenders over the past couple of years, said that in July it raised a euro-denominated loan worth 64.7 billion roubles ($966 million) to refinance an earlier $1 billion pre-export financing agreement. Its representative told Reuters that the new loan, due in 2022, was obtained from Russia’s second largest lender VTB in a process that is “yet to be completed”. The company had planned to fully restructure its debt portfolio by the end of 2018. Mechel shares outperformed the market on Wednesday, rising 3.8 percent compared with a 0.2 percent increase in the benchmark stock market index MOEX. That made the company the second biggest gainer on the index. The company, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, on Wednesday reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.4 billion roubles ($20.9 million) after a loss of 8.9 billion roubles a year ago, when its bottom line had been hit by debt revaluation. Mechel borrowed extensively during the commodities boom in the 2000s and went through a painful restructuring of most of its debt following the 2008 financial crisis, exacerbated by Russia’s economic crisis in 2014. As of the end of June, when its net debt excluding fines and penalties totalled 474.4 billion roubles ($7 billion), the portion of restructured debt was at 76 percent. Its second-quarter revenue rose 14 percent year-on-year to 82.2 billion roubles, with earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) up 32 percent to 23.0 billion roubles, the company said in a statement. Revenue was also up from the previous quarter due to higher prices for its products, even though in June the FIFA World Cup put a dampener on construction activity and overall demand, it said. The company also reported a 6 percent decline in its first-half coal production to 9.7 million tonnes on Wednesday and told Reuters that it had downgraded its forecast for 2018 coal production to 21 million tonnes from 23.3 million tonnes.
