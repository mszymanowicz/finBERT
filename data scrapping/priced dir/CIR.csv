-14.626002432146146," Crane says continues to prefer 'negotiated transaction' with Circor's board (Reuters) - U.S. industrial manufacturer Crane Co on Monday said it continues to prefer a “negotiated transaction” with Circor International Inc’s board, weeks after making a $894 million hostile bid for the smaller rival. Earlier this month, Crane said it was willing to adjust its $45 per share offer for Circor if its board was willing to engage in talks. On Monday, Crane began a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Circor and called on Circor shareholders to act on the opportunity. Crane’s tender offer is set to expire on July 16. Circor in response said its board will review and evaluate Crane’s tender offer, and shareholders do not need to take any action at this time. The board intends to make its recommendation within 10 business days, Circor said. “Circor shareholders have endured five years of underperformance and a series of value-destroying capital allocation decisions by current management,” Crane Chief Executive Officer Max Mitchell said in a statement. Crane, which makes pumps and valves, made a hostile takeover bid for Circor in May after an earlier offer was rejected by Circor."

-21.800408192752517," Crane says willing to adjust buyout offer if Circor board engages in talks (Reuters) - U.S. industrial manufacturer Crane Co said on Tuesday it was willing to adjust its $894 million offer for smaller rival Circor International Inc if its board was willing to engage in talks.

-17.18604418604652," Pumps and valves maker Crane makes $894-million hostile bid for rival Circor (Reuters) - U.S. industrial manufacturer Crane Co on Tuesday made a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Circor International Inc for about $894 million, after an earlier offer was rejected by Circor’s board. Crane’s cash offer of $45 per share represents a premium of about 47% to Circor’s closing price on Monday. Circor’s shares jumped 48.4% to $45.44. Crane had sent a letter on April 30 to Circor’s board, offering to buy the company, but it was rejected with no offer of further discussions. Circor said on Tuesday its board rejected Crane’s proposal and determined that the offer “substantially undervalued Circor and its future prospects, and did not constitute a basis for engaging in further dialogue with Crane at this time.” “While we had hoped to complete a transaction privately, Circor’s rejection of our proposal...led to our decision to make our proposal known to Circor shareholders,” Crane Chief Executive Officer Max Mitchell said in a statement. Crane, which makes pumps and valves for industries, said its offer for Circor represents an enterprise value of about $1.7 billion, 13.5 times Circor’s last 12-month adjusted EBITDA. The deal would add brands such as Allweiler, Houttuin, IMO Pump and IMO AB to Crane’s portfolio. Circor, which makes products including centrifugal pumps and automatic recirculating valves, had a long-term debt of about $733.6 million as of March 31. Wells Fargo Securities advised Crane on the deal, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was its legal adviser."
