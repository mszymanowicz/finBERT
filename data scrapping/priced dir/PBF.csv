66.0512923076923," PBF raises concerns over fuel demand after bigger-than-expected quarterly loss (Reuters) - U.S. refiner PBF Energy Inc reported a bigger-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter, hit by uneven demand for fuel due to COVID-19 restrictions and a lower refining margin. The company joined other U.S. independent refiners in reporting multi-billion dollar losses in 2020 as demand has struggled to regain footing after multiple waves of coronanvirus-induced travel restrictions were enacted globally. The refiner reported a loss of $1.4 billion in 2020, following its competitors Valero, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66. In 2020, U.S. fuel demand fell 12% from the previous year due to the pandemic. “PBF’s fourth-quarter, and full-year, results reflect the continuing headwinds brought on by the global pandemic and attendant demand destruction for our products,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Nimbley said. He added that although there are some signs of improvement, “we expect demand to remain depressed until vaccine distribution is improved, so that everyone can return to their normal routines.” U.S. refining margins were below $10 - the threshold above which most refiners make money - for the majority of the fourth quarter of 2020. The resurgence of coronavirus cases across the world has complicated the recovery in fuel consumption worldwide. PBF also said it expects refining capital expenditures to be about $150 million for the first six months of 2021. It aims to reduce operating expenses across the company by $200 million to $225 million annually. It expects near-term throughput for the company’s refining system to be between 675,000 barrel per day and 725,000 bpd. Total crude oil and feedstocks throughput in the quarter was 62.3 million bpd, down from 65 million bpd in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, gross refining margin, excluding special items, declined 68.5% to $60.8 million. The company’s adjusted loss widened to $547.4 million, or $4.53 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $346.6 million, or $2.87 per share, in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting a loss of $3.17 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. PBF also said it completed its East Coast refining reconfiguration and is continuing a strategic review of its portfolio. PBF plans to engage the Biden administration about potential changes to the Renewable Fuels Standard after RINs prices climbed tenfold in 2020, said company president Matthew Lucey. “The prior administration made attempts to level the playing field but left the situation worse than when they started,” Lucey said. The refiner said it is assessing the possibility of a renewable diesel project at the Chalmette, Louisiana refinery that could produce 15,000 to 20,000 barrels per day of the fuel. “Chalmette happens to have an idled hydrocracker with an ample supply of hydrogen,” said Lucey."

123.18652849740934," Midwest refiners to ship more fuel to East Coast, pressuring plants (Reuters) -U.S. Midwest refiners are gearing up to send more gasoline and diesel to East Coast buyers, hoping to fill a void created by refinery closures and cutbacks, but likely to add pressure to regional fuel producers. Midwest refiners, such as BP and Husky Energy, that process inexpensive Canadian crude are betting on East Coast markets to boost sales and margins. But the move could make it more difficult for PBF Energy to restore production of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel at its Paulsboro, N.J., plant. “The midwest refining complex is a firehose to the East Coast, which is already drowning in imports,” said Zachary Rogers, senior oil analyst at consultancy Rapidan Energy Group. Shippers are geared up to transport up to 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) of refined products on the Mariner 1 pipeline from the Midwest as soon as this week, two traders familiar with the matter said. If demand permits, refiners could double that amount, they said. “We do expect that this service will help to lower overall fuel costs for Pennsylvania residents and business,” said a spokeswoman at Energy Transfer, which operates Mariner 1. Volumes of between 20,000 bpd and 25,000 bpd will begin this month, she said. Gasoline prices in the Midwest traded 4 cents a gallon below the futures benchmark for gasoline on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday while New York Harbor conventional gasoline prices were 3.25 cents above the futures benchmark. East Coast refineries produce only part of the fuel consumed in the region, with pipeline and seaborne imports furnishing most. Three refineries, owned by Delta Airlines, PBF Energy and Phillips 66, produce 700,000 bpd combined out of the 5.2 million bpd of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel consumed last year, Energy Information Administration data shows. The largest refiner, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, halted operations following a 2019 explosion, Canada’s Come-by-Chance, which sold fuel into the East Coast, was idled in May, and PBF Energy said in October it would shut fuel-producing units at its 180,000 bpd Paulsboro refinery. PBF did not reply to a request for comment. Midwest refiners a year ago began targeting the region with 120,000 bpd through a partial reversal of the Laurel Pipeline, which opened western Pennsylvania markets. Laurel operator Buckeye Partners likely will push for the pipeline to fully reverse direction and to reach Philadelphia, said Sandy Fielden, downstream energy analyst at Morningstar. Buckeye Enterprises, which operates the Laurel Pipeline, did not respond to requests for comment. “The argument not to fully reverse the line now gets weaker and weaker as the East Coast refining sector shrinks,” Fielden said."
92.06349206349206," PBF Energy to shut fuel-producing units at Paulsboro, New Jersey refinery: letter (Reuters) - PBF Energy PBF.N will shut most refining units at its Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery, the company's chief executive said in a letter to employees on Wednesday that cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on fuel demand. The company will cut 250 jobs at the refinery, which will now only produce partially refined feedstocks that will be sent to PBF’s nearby Delaware City, Delaware, refinery, CEO Tom Nimbley said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters. “PBF Energy, along with the entire oil industry, has been significantly, unexpectedly, and negatively impacted from the wellhead to the pump by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily through demand destruction for transportation fuels related to lockdowns that throttled back the economy,” Nimbley said in the letter. It was sent to employees after the market close on Wednesday. PBF was not immediately available for comment. In a 2019 press release, PBF said it had 489 full-time workers at the refinery. Earlier this year, the Parsippany, N.J.-based company cut spending, laid off employees, sold off hydrogen plants, and suspended its 30-cent a share quarterly dividend to weather the oil downturn caused by the pandemic. Gasoline refining cracks, or margins, have been weak since the beginning of the pandemic. They are currently $8.46 per barrel, compared with the five-year average of $13.17 a barrel at this time of year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The company was particularly exposed in part due to high levels of debt associated with its $1.2 billion purchase of Shell’s Martinez, California refinery in February. The 180,000 barrel-per-day Paulsboro refinery is one of just a handful remaining on the East Coast, where a number of facilities have closed in recent years. Canada’s Come-by-Chance plant in Newfoundland and Labrador has been idled since May in the pandemic. In 2019 the Philadelphia Energy Solutions plant was shut down following an explosion and fire. Elsewhere, HollyFrontier shut down its Cheyenne, Wyoming refinery, Marathon Petroleum began closing refineries in Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico while Calcasieu Refining idled its Lake Charles refinery in southwest Louisiana. Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Santa Maria refining plant in Arroyo Grande, California, in 2023 and plans to reconfigure its San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, to produce renewable fuels. The remaining operating refineries operating on the U.S. East Coast include PBF’s Delaware City refinery, Delta Airlines’ refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania and the 258,500 barrel-per-day Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey owned by Phillips 66. PBF will report third quarter earnings Thursday morning. Its shares closed down more than 8% to $4.27 on Wednesday."

-46.198156682027644," PBF Energy sees jet fuel demand capping industry-wide refinery runs July 31 (Reuters) - Depressed demand for jet fuel could cap refinery utilization rates across the entire industry, according to executives at PBF Energy, the fourth-largest U.S. oil refiner by capacity. Demand for gasoline and distillates has recovered by 80% to 90% since the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, but jet fuel demand has only rebounded 30%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Because refineries cannot make products like diesel without producing jet fuel as well, they will restrain output, PBF Chief Executive Thomas Nimbley said on Friday. “I’m not convinced that we could get to full utilization in this industry if jet demand is where it is today,” Chief Executive Thomas Nimbley said on an earnings call. Running refineries at full tilt would reduce the ability for refiners to contain the production of jet fuel. Other independent U.S. refiners are running near 80% utilization, but PBF is still operating below that and will continue to do so until it sees demand return in key markets, Nimbley said. Executives defended the company’s acquisition of Shell’s refinery in Martinez, California, despite reporting gross margins of only $1 million in the second quarter in the West Coast. “We had negative cracks in April, which severely impacted our earnings on the West Coast,” Nimbley said. Gasoline demand rebounded in recent weeks in California, he said, and physical crack spreads were approximately $13 in San Francisco and Los Angeles earlier this week. Nimbley disagreed with the idea that California has too much refinery capacity. “I think we’re going to be fine in California over the long haul,” he said. However, he noted that the pandemic will result in a permanent reduction in U.S. refining capacity. PBF reported adjusted loss per share of approximately $3.19, missing analysts expectations.

3.410341034103416," PBF sees slow refining rebound as U.S. gasoline demand creeps higher May 15 (Reuters) - PBF Energy, the fourth-largest U.S. oil refiner by capacity, is holding processing near 70% of throughput even as more states relax stay-at-home orders, boosting demand for motor fuel, executives said on Friday. The gasoline crack spread RBc1-CLc1, which drifted negative in March as the coronavirus pandemic sharply cut air and road travel, has recovered to $11.42 per barrel this week. However, fuel demand is off 23% in the United States over the last four weeks. “We are just not going to do what everybody expects refiners to do, see an improvement in gasoline cracks and say, ‘The Holy Grail, there it is, let’s ramp up, let’s run,’” Chief Executive Thomas Nimbley said on an earnings call on Friday. “This thing is not over.” PBF’s shares were up nearly 4% at $9.62 on Friday. They are off nearly 70% year to date. At the start of the year, PBF planned to run about 950,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd). But it now expects to run in the 650,000 to 750,000 bpd range, executives said on the call. Demand for gasoline has inched up and gasoline production has climbed for a third straight week to 7.5 million bpd, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration. “We’re not planning to get back to where things were prior to the pandemic, but I do believe at this point, we are starting to see green shoots related to a recovery,” Nimbley told investors. PBF Energy joined rivals such as Marathon Petroleum in shifting production to gasoline after initially maximizing diesel output during the early surge of coronavirus cases. With COVID-19 cases rising in South America, exports are being reduced, Nimbley said. PBF reported a quarterly loss in the first quarter on a $1.28 billion inventory writedown amid the sharp decline in fuel demand. The company posted an adjusted loss of $1.19 per share, wider than analysts’ average estimate of a $1.04 per share loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The loss reflected refinery operating expenses that were higher than analysts expected and weaker margins from a turnaround at its Toledo, Ohio, plant, financial services firm Tudor Pickering, Holt & Co wrote in a note on Friday. PBF said it cut its 2020 planned capital expenditures further by a total of more than $350 million, from its previous estimates of $240 million.

The units were taken offline earlier this year as part of a plant turnaround, but since that time the spread of the novel coronavirus has sapped demand for key products including gasoline and jet fuel. The restart of the refinery’s gas plant and alkylation unit will also be delayed from their initial targeted early April restart, the sources said. Some units will be brought back online in the coming days, they said, and the refinery will continue to focus on chemical and diesel production. PBF Energy did not respond to a request for comment. The refinery has also drastically reduced contract maintenance workers in the plant in response concerns over the spread of coronavirus, the sources said.

U.S. refiners are cutting output in the face of shrinking demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel as airlines have canceled flights and local governments have ordered businesses to close and people to stay home. The company, which analysts warned last week could see its cash reserves fall from weaker profits and reduced access to loans, said it will sell five plants that produce hydrogen gas used for its refineries to Air Products and Chemicals for $530 million. Shares rose nearly 13% to $7.17 in morning trading on the news. They are off 77% year to date. “We are focused on generating and preserving the liquidity needed for the duration of the long-term, economic impacts of stay-at-home orders,” said Chief Executive Thomas Nimbley. The Parsippany, N.J.-based company also suspended its 30-cent a share quarterly dividend and said top executives would have pay cut by 50% and its CEO’s pay by 67%. Overall, it expects to lower 2020 operating expenses by about $125 million and will reduce capital expenditure for the year by another $240 million, including spending on its newly acquired Martinez, California, refinery. The reductions will bring its oil processing down to about 627,000 barrels a day from 895,000 bpd it had forecast for the first quarter in February.

0.06169641056645602," PBF Energy to buy Shell's Martinez, California oil refinery for up to $1 billion (Reuters) - U.S. refiner PBF Energy Inc on Tuesday agreed to pay up to $1 billion for a California oil refinery that Royal Dutch Shell PLC has been trying to sell for at least four years. Terms of the deal require Shell to pay about $70 million for turnaround costs anticipated in the first quarter of 2020, and about $40 million in compensation for downtime, if the deal does not close by the first quarter of 2020, PBF said in a presentation here. The deal is expected to close by December and is expected to be “significantly accretive” to PBF’s earnings and cash flow, the company said. Shell had put the Martinez, California plant on the market in 2015 and later suspended its sales efforts after a fire at the refinery. The refinery 30 miles northeast of San Francisco has been operating since 1915. “The recent global macro softness could have helped the parties to come to an agreement,” said Matthew Blair, a refining analyst at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. PBF has been interested in balancing its production in California, where it operates a 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) plant in Torrance, Blair said. “They wanted the two refinery systems, especially considering that when Torrance goes down they just have that one refinery and they don’t make anything back,” Blair said. The Martinez plant can process 157,000 bpd of crude oil into gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other refined products. It also has a coker unit used for processing heavy grades of crude. PBF had earlier looked at buying the refinery from Shell, but was unable to reach an agreement and it recently re-approached the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, a person familiar with the matter said. PBF said the acquisition would expand its West Coast operations and increase its overall throughput capacity to over 1 million bpd. The deal also gives PBF a leading position to supply International Maritime Organization 2020-compliant fuels, the company said."
