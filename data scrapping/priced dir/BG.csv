22.021614805235306," UPDATE 3-Bunge Q4 profit tops expectations on strong demand, forecasts solid 2021 (Adds CEO quote, updates share price) Feb 10 (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd posted stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday and said its full-year adjusted profit would top estimates due to strong demand and tight commodity supplies. Shares climbed to $76.45 in early trading, the highest in nearly three years. Bunge’s fourth-quarter earnings, propelled by strong oilseed processing margins and robust North American exports, offered the latest look into how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting the world’s largest grain traders. The company said it expects full-year 2021 adjusted profit of at least $6 per share, higher then estimates of $5.53 per share, but down from the $8.30 per share it earned in 2020. Despite massive shifts in food and fuel demand as consumers curbed travel and shifted from eating at restaurants to cooking more meals at home, Bunge and rivals ADM, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, known as the ABCD quartet of grain trading giants, have weathered the pandemic unexpectedly well. Grain merchants have thrived despite as tightening global supplies stoked elevated demand from importing countries stockpiling food amid the pandemic. Bunge Chief Executive Greg Heckman called the company’s 2020 performance “exceptional” and that momentum has carried into 2021. Tighter crop supplies and higher prices, however, clouded the forecast for late 2021. “These balance sheets are really tightened up in the last year, and they’re going to stay that way,” Heckman said during a call with analysts. “It would be hard to recreate for everything to happen the way it did in 2020. But I’ll tell you, we’re optimistic.” Net income attributable to Bunge stood at $551 million, or $3.74 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $51 million, or 48 cents per a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Bunge earned $3.05 per share compared to analysts’ estimates of $1.82, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue jumped nearly 17% to $12.61 billion.

The company forecast full-year 2021 adjusted profit of at least $6 per share. It earned $8.30 per share in 2020. Bunge said numerous countries around the globe, including places where it operates production facilities, have continued to impose COVID-19 quarantines.

22.548706851335623," Brazil court weighs claims holding up Bunge soy acquisitions SAO PAULO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court on Wednesday could clear up a legal hurdle delaying Bunge’s plans to take over two soy processing plants following a deal in May with crusher Imcopa. Wednesday’s hearing will focus on two Panama-registered firms that claim, as indirect creditors of Imcopa, which is in bankruptcy protection, to have rights to some of the proceeds from the sale, according to court filings seen by Reuters. The three-judge panel is expected to rule on whether the Panamanian firms Minefer Development SA and Triana Business SA are legitimate participants in the process. The panel will also decide whether to uphold a May 2020 decision determining that part of the proceeds from the sale of the soy plants should be deposited in an escrow account pending a final ruling on the Panamanians’ claims, according to the filings. Bunge and Imcopa declined to comment. Lawyers for Minefer and Triana did not respond to requests for comment. Bunge agreed to take on some 1 billion reais ($186 million) of debt and pay 50 million reais for the Brazilian soy crushing plants, which can process about 1.5 million tonnes of soybeans per year. Imcopa’s plants are being operated by brewer Cervejaria Petrópolis, which has challenged Imcopa’s early termination of their leasing agreement. A final ruling is pending on the matter. That dispute, plus the legal challenges from the Panama entities, have forced Bunge to wait nearly a year before getting its hands on the Imcopa plants. The owner of Cervejaria Petrópolis, Walter Faria, holds 100% of Panama-based Minefer and Triana, according to public records pertaining to an unrelated court case. Cervejaria Petrópolis declined to comment on Faria’s ownership of Minifer and Triana. The brewer said in a statement to Reuters that it aims to keep operating Imcopa’s facilities through 2024, when its leasing agreement would expire."
15.748645117402832," Bunge raises 2020 outlook as quarterly profit nearly doubles, shares jump (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd BG.N raised its 2020 outlook after reporting a 91% jump in adjusted third-quarter profit on Wednesday as strong soy processing margins and robust demand for soy products boosted its core agribusiness segment. Bunge shares rose almost 7% to their highest level in more than a year. The company raised full-year profit guidance for a second straight quarter, projecting 2020 earnings of $6.25 to $6.75 per share. The company cited better-than-anticipated agribusiness results and a more favorable outlook for its edible oils unit despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “In our view, the team’s execution was nearly flawless this quarter,” said Chief Executive Greg Heckman, adding that guidance was lifted “based on Q3 results and improving market trends.” Grain traders like Bunge and rivals Archer Daniels Midland ADM.N, Cargill [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus [AKIRAU.UL], known as the ABCDs of grain, have faced headwinds from the pandemic as shuttered restaurants and reduced travel disrupted demand for food and fuel. Infection rates are rising again globally, triggering fresh lockdowns and other restrictions. But they have weathered the crisis better than other industries, and Bunge said its facilities continued to operate at or near normal levels. Bunge agribusiness earnings more than doubled to $467 million on robust margins in South America, Europe and Asia and active grain sales by South American farmers. Edible oils performed better than expected, although results were down year-on-year. Net attributable income to Bunge was $262 million, or $1.84 per share, for the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $1.49 billion, or $10.57 per share, a year earlier when Bunge took charges totaling about $1.7 billion. On an adjusted basis, Bunge posted a profit of $2.47 per share, up from $1.28 per share a year earlier. Net sales fell 1.6% to $10.16 billion, but topped analysts’ estimates of $9.92 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES."

30.470494849125362," Bayer's Orbia plans Latam expansion after Bunge deal in Brazil SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Orbia, an online farm products trade platform majority owned by Germany's Bayer AG BAYGn.DE, is betting that a deal with U.S. grain merchant Bunge Ltd BG.N will pave the way for a planned international foray, Chief Executive Ivan Moreno said on Monday. Under the partnership with Bunge announced in September, Orbia’s 170,000 registered farm users in Brazil can sell produce online to the U.S. firm, which secured exclusive origination rights to the platform. Moreno, a former Bayer executive, said in an interview the deal allows farmers to sell corn and soy on the futures or spot market in exchange for cash or credit to buy inputs on Orbia for use in future seasons, a transaction typically known as “barter.” Farmers can also acquire seeds, pesticides and fertilizers from 120 accredited distributors using the platform, which gives them loyalty points that can be swapped for products or support services. “Bunge’s presence adds a lot of liquidity to the business model,” Moreno said. The company is preparing to expand into Colombia, Argentina and Mexico next year and allow the sale of coffee and wheat on the platform, Moreno said. Orbia’s launch coincides with the emergence of a younger generation of Brazilian farmers keen to go digital. Farm managers aged 25 to 35 represent 35% of the leadership, up form 20% in 2013, Moreno said. As more growers go online, Orbia could capture up to 20% of Brazil’s 110 billion real ($19.6 billion) market for farm inputs in three years, Moreno predicted. In a single week in August, farm input sales on Orbia reached 140 million reais. Traders other than Bunge could join in as buyers, Moreno said, without giving a time frame because the duration of Bunge’s exclusive origination rights is confidential."
39.69355803658943," UPDATE 1-Argentine authorities step in to end soy workers strike (Recasts with end of strike) BUENOS AIRES, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Argentine authorities on Wednesday ended a less-than-24-hour wage strike by the Federation of Oilseeds Workers that had temporarily halted local soy processing at plants owned by major shippers Cargill, Bunge , Glencore and Dreyfus. The Labor Ministry ordered the union back to work, with the government set to sit down with company and workers’ representatives next week, the federation said in a statement. “The measure dictated by the Labor Ministry ended the strike at 1 p.m. (1600 GMT) today and the holding of a hearing on October 20,” the union said in a statement. The work stoppage, affecting some parts of Argentina’s key grains hub of Rosario, began at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. The government often steps in to end strikes and force negotiations when work stoppages affect vital national industries. Argentina is the world’s top exporter of soymeal livestock feed, used to fatten hogs, cattle and poultry from Europe to Southeast Asia. The strike came as the country, suffering from a recession and a debt crunch, desperately needs export dollars to help replenish central bank reserves strained by a dollar-selling campaign designed to prop up the swooning local peso. The government this month reduced export taxes in a bid to spur selling of soybeans, the country’s main cash crop, and bolster trade. But farmers have said they will keep hoarding crops due to foreign exchange uncertainty. The spread between the official and black market exchange rates has escalated to 117%, hurting farmers who get paid at the official rate while paying their expenses on the black market. Work stoppages are common in Argentina, where employers are hard-pressed to offer wages that keep up with inflation, which the government expects at 29% next year."

30.42054485153745," Bunge raises outlook as robust agribusiness powers profit beat (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd on Wednesday raised its full-year outlook after its second-quarter profit handily beat Wall Street estimates, bolstered by oilseed crushing and robust crop exports to China. Despite a worsening coronavirus pandemic that has rattled global markets, Bunge reported strong soy processing margins in South America, Europe and Asia, record capacity utilization at its plants and the lowest crushing costs in three years. Meanwhile, accelerated crop sales by U.S. and Brazilian farmers provided ample exportable supplies. Top importer China logged record Brazilian soy imports during the quarter. Shares were up about 1.5% early on Wednesday. “These results would be strong in any environment, let alone a pandemic,” Chief Executive Greg Heckman said in a statement. Bunge’s strong second quarter, following a surprise loss in the first, highlighted the disruption the agribusiness industry has faced during the pandemic. Shuttered restaurants and food service companies, both major customers for Bunge’s cooking oils, shifted demand to more at-home dining, while travel restrictions hammered biofuel margins. Rival agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co will release second-quarter results later on Wednesday. Bunge said its facilities worldwide continue to operate at or near-normal levels despite the pandemic, although it confirmed on Tuesday that one positive COVID-19 case suspended operations at an Argentine port facility. Operating earnings in Bunge’s agribusiness segment grew four-fold in the quarter, triggering the improved 2020 outlook. Edible oils, milling and fertilizer units also posted gains, while sugar and bioenergy posted a loss. The oils segment, however, may struggle from uncertain demand due to the pandemic, Bunge said. Net income available to shareholders was $521 million, or $3.47 per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $214 million, or $1.43 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Bunge earned $3.88 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.32, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

32.608707030657776," Bunge reports loss, cuts 2020 outlook as coronavirus hits demand CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd BG.N reported a first-quarter loss on Wednesday and lowered its full-year forecast as the coronavirus crisis hammered demand for fuel and upended global food supply chains, sending shares plunging 11%. Demand for edible oils fell toward the end of the January-to-March period as the crisis shuttered restaurants and suspended travel, while crashing Brazilian ethanol prices and whipsawing currency markets dented Bunge’s outlook for its sugar and bioenergy unit. The results do not yet reflect the more recent oil price crash and its related impact on biofuels pricing. “We’re operating at a time of unprecedented volatility, complexity and uncertainty,” Chief Executive Greg Heckman said. “We expect to see a greater impact from COVID-19 in our business in the second quarter, primarily in our edible oils business.” The earnings hit offered the latest glimpse into how the pandemic is affecting global supply chains, from shuttered meat packers and biofuel plants to heightened demand for at-home meal ingredients. Bunge forecast a particularly challenging year for its edible oils unit as the pandemic diminishes demand from restaurant and food service customers. Retail demand for oils from at-home chefs would only partly offset the hit, the company said. Slumping fuel consumption, including for soybean oil-based biodiesel and corn- and sugar-based ethanol, created further headwinds for Bunge as pandemic lockdowns continue to limit travel. “What’s weighing on the stock is you’ve got challenges associated with edible oils and the sugar and bioenergy business that didn’t exist two months ago,” said Ben Bienvenu, analyst with Stephens Inc. “That’s going to weigh on their earnings power this year despite what is really solid execution in the core agribusiness segment.” Rival agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N last week highlighted supply-chain disruptions after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Privately held Cargill Inc canceled its most recent earnings release due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic is the latest hurdle for two-century-old Bunge following a U.S.-China trade war that reordered global grain flows and a years-long grain glut that depressed crop prices and thinned trading margins. Bunge has been cutting costs and shedding non-core assets to weather a prolonged market downturn that made it a takeover target in 2017 and 2018. The company last month said it would sell 35 of its U.S. grain elevators to rival Zen-Noh Grain. Bunge’s adjusted first-quarter net loss came to $181 million, or $1.34 a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $59 million, or 36 cents a share. The company’s stock was down $4.37, or 11%, at $33.57 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

13.54905414430632," Bunge's takeover of Brazilian soy crushers blocked by court injunction SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A previously unreported Brazilian court injunction last month has thrown a wrench into Bunge Ltd's BG.N plan to take over two soy processing plants from local crusher Imcopa, according to court filings seen by Reuters. The injunction was granted on behalf of two Panamanian entities identified in the filings as “third parties.” It effectively suspended a bankruptcy court auction in which Bunge had bid a combined 50 million reais ($9.16 million) for the plants. The Feb. 17 offer, made under an Imcopa reorganization plan approved by creditors in 2017, also entailed assumption by Bunge of around 1 billion reais ($183.11 million) of debt related to the assets. Both Imcopa and Bunge have since challenged the ruling suspending the sale of the plants, which crushed a combined 1 million tonnes of soybeans in 2019, according to filings dated April 20 and April 16. Imcopa argued before the court that the Panamanian entities, which say they acquired claims against Imcopa from other company creditors, made “false allegations” and hence “induced the judge to error.” Procedural delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic have made it difficult to predict the timing of a new ruling that would allow Bunge to close the deal, a source familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Bunge’s acquisition is seen as crucial to keeping the plants running, protecting 650 jobs and repaying Imcopa creditors. The Imcopa plants have been run since 2014 under an agreement with Brazilian brewer Cervejaria Petrópolis whereby it pays certain operating expenses in exchange for the proceeds of their soy processing activities. That contract represents Imcopa’s only source of income, it said in court filings. Last year, Imcopa tried to end the agreement with the brewer due to an alleged breach of contract, sparking a parallel legal battle. Imcopa is now seeking repayment of at least 4 million reais from Cervejaria Petrópolis covering certain operating expenses incurred this year, court filings showed. Imcopa says its ability to keep processing soy is threatened by a lack of money to pay suppliers. Bunge said it won the auction but has yet to sign the purchase agreement for the plants, which will only happen after the bankruptcy court approves the deal. Imcopa declined to comment. Cervejaria Petrópolis told Reuters it is current on all its contract obligations, adding that it does not recognize certain expenses claimed by Imcopa under their agreement that extends at least until 2024."
20.44220041041855," Bunge to sell 35 U.S. grain elevators to Zen-Noh Grain CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd said on Tuesday it will sell 35 of its interior U.S. grain elevators to Zen-Noh Grain Corporation, dramatically reducing its grain origination network in the United States. Financial details of the sale with the subsidiary of Japan’s Zen-Noh Group were not disclosed, and the deal is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, Bunge said. Although the sale will significantly reduce the number of Bunge grain storage and handling assets in the United States, Bunge said “certain supply agreements” with Zen-Noh will result in a “larger and stronger origination and distribution network.” Before the sale, Bunge owned 158 grain storage facilities globally, according to regulatory filings. Bunge will retain ownership of its bulk grain export terminal in Detrehan, Louisiana, and its jointly owned EGT Grain export terminal in Longview, Washington. It will also retain ownership of elevators in its Bunge-SCF Grain joint venture and elevators in Indiana that supply its Morristown soybean processing plant. “This transaction will allow Bunge to operate more efficiently and re-invest in higher returning areas of the company while reducing costs and strengthening our balance sheet,” Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in a news release. Bunge has been cutting costs and shedding non-core assets in recent years as a sharp downturn in grain prices has squeezed margins for the two-century-old global agribusiness giant. The company ended its 13-year ownership interest in an Iowa ethanol plant in January and sold its Brazilian margarine business in December."

27.30408102045366," Brazil farm town's coronavirus lockdown could affect Bunge, Cofco SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A town in the heart of Brazil’s farm country has halted all non-essential services and ordered industrial sites, including agricultural processing facilities, to suspend operations in response to the coronavirus crisis. The municipal decree ordering the closures was issued on Saturday by the mayor of Rondonópolis in Mato Grosso state, Brazil’s largest producer of grains and meat. The order could face legal challenges as the federal government pushes to keep certain businesses open through the outbreak. Chinese food conglomerate Cofco and U.S.-based grain trader Bunge are among companies that have plants in the city. Bunge and Cofco directed questions to oilseed industry association Abiove. Abiove said all of its members in the area continue to operate normally and export logistics are not affected. Several parties are negotiating with the Rondonópolis city government to attempt to resolve the issue, a person in the oilseeds industry said on condition of anonymity. Aprosoja, a group representing Brazilian grain growers, warned that states and municipalities are enacting measures to curb the circulation of people that could “threaten the supply of food products, goods and diesel oil and automotive parts.” In a statement, Aprosoja called on regional governments to observe a federal decree issued by President Jair Bolsonaro last week as to what constitutes essential services. Bolsonaro’s decree states that production, distribution, commercialization, and delivery of food and beverages is essential, along with the transportation of cargos more generally. The press office for Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry told Reuters that companies should present the relevant federal law to their local governments in Rondonópolis and other cities that have enacted similar measures to halt spread of the virus. If the matter cannot be resolved, companies should sue in their local jurisdictions in order to prevent “essential activities” from being shut down, the ministry said. Frederico Favacho, a partner at law firm Mattos Engelberg Advogados, told Reuters on Monday that the Rondonópolis mayor lacks jurisdiction to enforce such restrictions. The attorney said at least two other towns, one in Bahia state and another other in Minas Gerais state, are enforcing similar decrees that his law firm is legally challenging on behalf of clients he declined to name. Rondonópolis city hall could not be reached for comment. Favacho, who has clients in the agribusiness sector but does not represent Abiove in this matter, said the measure would be detrimental to soy crushers that produce oil and soymeal in the region, and could affect commercial contracts."

-32.93483385433492," Bunge bids for two Brazil soy plants, building lead over Cargill SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd has offered to buy two soy processing plants in Brazil from local crusher Imcopa, the U.S. grains trader said on Tuesday, reinforcing its position as the country’s biggest oilseeds processor. Two sources familiar with the transaction told Reuters that Bunge agreed to pay about 50 million reais ($12 million) for the plants while assuming debt of around 1 billion reais related to the assets, located in the state of Paraná. In a statement, Bunge confirmed making a bid for the assets, adding that it was awaiting a court decision to continue with the process. It declined to give more details. Bunge was the only company to submit a bid in the auction, according to one of the sources. Imcopa, now restructuring debt in bankruptcy court, said in a statement that it had received one offer for the plants on Monday, although it did not name the bidder. Bunge is already Brazil’s top oilseeds processor, and the move will help it expand a lead over rival Cargill Inc, which has two-thirds as many crushing and refining facilities, according to data from national oilseeds group Abiove. According to Abiove data from 2018, Cargill owned eight active oilseed crushing units in Brazil and Bunge owned 12. “Bunge not only intends to acquire the two industrial plants ... (it also) intends to hire a significant number of the current employees,” according a filing Bunge made to the bankruptcy court dated Nov. 26. On Imcopa’s website, the company touts capacity to crush 1.5 million tonnes of soybeans per year, producing up to 240,000 tonnes of soy protein concentrate. The minimum asking price of each of the plants was 25 million reais in an auction scheduled for Feb. 17, according to bankruptcy court documents. The debt attached to the plants was 1.043 billion reais in December 2018, public records show. Last year, Imcopa ended a leasing contract with Brazilian brewer Grupo Petrópolis for use of the two crushing plants, alleging a breach of contract, and put the assets up for sale. The leasing agreement was set to expire in 2024. Petrópolis declined to comment on Bunge’s bid to assume control of the two Imcopa plants."

-36.48201983982186," Bunge profit tops estimates on strong South American agribusiness results CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd BG.N reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as rising crop prices boosted farmer sales in South America and swelled margins in its large agribusiness segment, sending shares up more than 3% in pre-market trading. But uncertainty about global trade and demand for Bunge’s food and feed products clouded the outlook for this year, with 2020 earnings per share seen about flat. The company cautioned that agribusiness results could slip this year as margins shift depending on crop sizes, farmer sales and the implementation of an interim U.S.-China trade deal. Bunge and its agribusiness peers Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co have been hit hard by a years-long crop supply glut followed by a tit-fot-tat tariff war between the United States and China that disrupted global trade flows. The companies, known as the ABCDs of global grain trading, have also seen livestock feed demand dented by a deadly hog disease in China known as African swine fever, or ASF. The full impact of China’s coronavirus outbreak on Bunge’s business also remains unknown. “We’re still faced with uncertainty in 2020. We expect markets to remain volatile as long as U.S. and China trade tensions and ASF continue to create uncertainty,” Chief Executive Officer Gregory Heckman said on a call with analysts. “It’s too early to tell what, if any, impact the coronavirus situation will have on our markets or how developments in Argentina may affect the industry this year,” he said, referring to changes in Argentine agricultural export tax policy. Bunge’s agribusiness segment, its largest in terms of revenues and volumes, gained in the fourth quarter on strong vegetable oil demand and good South American oilseed crushing margins. Accelerated farmer crop sales in Argentina ahead of anticipated increases to export taxes boosted the grains unit, which reported positive adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins compared with a negative margin last year. Adjusted EBIT for the agribusiness rose over three-fold to $177 million in the fourth quarter. Bunge said net sales fell to $10.78 billion in the quarter ended Dec.31, from $11.54 billion a year earlier year. Adjusted net income attributable to the company was $191 million, compared with $18 million a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.27 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 32 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

U.S. ethanol producers say the industry has suffered from the Trump administration’s expanded use of waivers to exempt oil refineries from blending ethanol into gasoline. As of last month, some 13 plants had shut since November 2018, while others had temporarily reduced production. “As Bunge focuses our resources on our core businesses, selling our shares in SIRE, while maintaining a relationship, is an attractive opportunity,” said Andrés Martín, North America country manager for Bunge. Bunge had a 25% ownership interest in SIRE, which operates the ethanol plant near a Bunge oilseed processing facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa, according to an annual report Bunge filed last year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The plant’s other owners are primarily agricultural producers in southwest Iowa, the filing said. SIRE is permitted to produce 140 million gallons per year and Bunge will continue to buy all of its ethanol under a revised commercial agreement, according to Thursday’s statement. But SIRE will assume responsibility for buying corn to produce ethanol and for selling a byproduct used for livestock feed, the statement said. SIRE will also continue to lease rail cars from Bunge, which named a new chief executive last year after being stung by slumping grain prices and a bruising U.S.-China trade war. Bunge and rival merchants Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, known as the ABCD quartet of global grain traders, have restructured operations and cut costs after a years-long crop supply glut thinned margins and sapped profits. ADM said last year it would move three dry ethanol mills into a wholly-owned subsidiary while the company evaluates strategic alternatives. “While conditions in the ethanol industry are difficult, with Bunge’s capital support and strategic advice over the years, SIRE is and will continue to be a strong participant in the renewable energy industry,” said Mike Jerke, SIRE’s chief executive."

JBS said in a separate statement that Seara Alimentos will pay Bunge 700 million reais ($170.64 million) for the assets, which include three plants in Brazil and brands such as Delícia, Primor and Gradina. “This transaction further streamlines our operations in Brazil around our core capabilities, while providing good value for a solid business,” Bunge’s chief executive, Greg Heckman, said in its statement. This is the second major deal for Bunge in Brazil this year. In July, the company decided to put all of its sugar and ethanol assets in a venture with oil company BP Plc, in a deal in which it received $775 million. Seara Alimentos is JBS’s arm for poultry processing and for a large food service business in Brazil. JBS said the deal strengthens Seara’s position in the Brazilian margarine market and in line with the company’s strategy to boost a portfolio of higher-value branded products. Conclusion of the deal is subject to local regulatory approval."

The auction of the two plants by privately owned Imcopa group, rescheduled to Feb. 17 from Dec. 4, is part of the seller’s plan to emerge from bankruptcy. Imcopa and a court-appointed judicial administrator agreed to cancel this week’s auction of the two strategic plants in Paraná state, court documents showed. Bunge owns most of Brazil’s oilseeds crushing and refining facilities, with 12, followed by Cargill [CARGIL.UL] with eight, according to industry group Abiove data from 2018. One of Imcopa’s plants is 100 km (60 miles) from a key port and produces soy protein concentrate used to make livestock feed. Bunge said there are synergies for one buyer to run both units. “Bunge not only intends to acquire the two industrial plants ... (it also) intends to hire a significant number of the current employees allocated to Araucária and Cambé ...,” according a filing Bunge made to the court dated Nov 26. Paraná accounts for 19% of Brazil’s oilseeds processing capacity. Bunge alleged that missing and “outdated” information in Imcopa’s data room makes it hard to analyze the risks of the potential investment. It also claimed “inconsistencies” between the reorganization plan and bidding rules. According to Bunge’s interpretation of Imcopa’s reorganization plan, both plants should be divested under the same “UPI” structure, which can be sold free of any liabilities. Partially agreeing with Bunge’s arguments, Judge Mariana Gusso ordered Imcopa to update the data room, a Dec. 3 ruling showed. However, the decision stated that Imcopa’s reorganization plan allows the creation “of up to two UPI” structures. Bunge declined to comment. The minimum asking price for each of the plants is 25 million reais. The combined debt attached to the two plants, which any buyer will have to assume, is 1.043 billion reais ($248 million) as of December 2018, according to public records. Imcopa, which makes soyoil and soy protein concentrate, is one of the largest non-genetically modified soy crushers in Brazil. It declined to comment. Two other potential contenders are CJ Selecta, owned by South Korea’s CJ Cheiljedang, and the local unit of Russia’s Sodrugestvo. Neither returned a request for comment.

The auction of the two plants by privately owned Imcopa group, rescheduled to Feb. 17 from Dec. 4, is part of the seller’s plan to emerge from bankruptcy. Imcopa and a court-appointed judicial administrator agreed with canceling this week’s auction, court documents showed. Bunge alleged in a filing that missing and “outdated” information in Imcopa’s data room made it hard to analyze the merit and risks of the potential investment, referring mainly to environmental and regulatory approvals for the plants to operate. The trading firm’s Brazilian unit also claimed “inconsistencies” between the amended reorganization plan approved by Imcopa’s creditors in 2017 and bidding rules published last October. The inconsistencies would mainly relate to whether the plants may be sold separately by Imcopa. According to Bunge’s interpretation of Imcopa’s reorganization plan, both plants should be sold together as part of the same “UPI” structure, which can be sold free of any liabilities. Partially agreeing with Bunge’s arguments, Judge Mariana Gusso ordered Imcopa to update the data room, according to a Dec. 3 decision seen by Reuters.

-7.583756429512017," BP, Bunge complete Brazil deal to form world's No.2 cane processor SAO PAULO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - British oil major BP Plc and U.S. commodities trader Bunge Ltd announced on Monday the completion of a deal to combine their sugar and ethanol operations in Brazil, creating the world’s second largest cane processor. The 50-50 joint venture BP Bunge Bioenergia, which will manage 11 plants in five Brazilian states with a total capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of sugarcane per year, will rank only behind Raízen, the joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Brazilian energy group Cosan SA. When the deal was announced back in July, the combined group was still holding a third position among the world’s largest processors, but since then Biosev, the sugar and ethanol unit controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, reduced its crushing as it sold two mills in Brazil’s northeast. The completion of the deal means BP and Bunge obtained all the regulatory approvals needed. It allows both companies to put together staff and start to plan jointly for the next Brazilian sugarcane season that starts in April. Brazil is finishing processing for the current season, with most mills already ending their cane crushing operations. Bunge will receive cash proceeds of $775 million in the deal, of which $700 million is Bunge’s debt that will be assumed by the JV. Bunge said the non-recourse debt was arranged by a syndicate of banks led by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, ABN Amro Bank NV and ING Bank NV. Brazil’s Itaú BBA acted as financial advisor to Bunge, and Lefosse Advogados acted as legal counsel. The new JV has a clear focus on ethanol, as demand for the biofuel in Brazil has grown for the last two years and a new federal program to boost biofuels use kicks off next year. “Biofuels are an increasingly important component of a low carbon energy system,” said in a statement Mario Lindenhayn, BP’s biofuels head, which will become executive chairman of the venture. Geovane Consul, former head of Bunge Açúcar e Bioenergia, will be the Chief Executive of BP Bunge Bioenergia. “We are positioning ourselves to support Brazil’s increasing demand for low-carbon bioenergy,” he said.

0.35525015150968714," Bunge warns of agribusiness challenges amid weak demand (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities merchant Bunge Ltd BG.N said on Wednesday the environment for its grain trading and processing business will remain challenging as demand falls on the back of an ongoing U.S.-China trade war. The U.S. agricultural sector has suffered for more than a year from tit-for-tat tariffs, which have cut farm exports from North America. Additionally, harvests of corn and soybeans are now lagging behind schedule after heavy rains and historic flooding delayed U.S. plantings in the spring. In China, the world’s top pork consumer and producer, an outbreak of fatal pig disease African swine fever has reduced the need for soy imports used for livestock feed. Bunge Chief Executive Officer Greg Heckman described market conditions as “uncertain and deteriorating” and said he expected headwinds to continue. The company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by higher margins on its edible oil products in North America and Brazil. However, Heckman warned of a profit decline of 15 cents to 20 cents a share for the current year compared to a year earlier. The outlook excludes some items, such as Bunge's investment in plant-based meat company Beyond Meat BYND.O. U.S. farmers are also holding off on selling soybeans to merchants like Bunge, anticipating higher prices. The company’s earnings before interest and taxes from the agribusiness unit, which includes everything from crushing oilseeds to export of corn and wheat, fell over 68% to $153 million. The company’s operations in Brazil and Argentina helped it offset the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on its U.S. business. Bunge is also streamlining its operations and cutting costs as part of its restructuring program. “The results on the quarter represented a solid, albeit noisy beat,” Stephens analyst Ben Bienvenu said. Bunge took a $1.7 billion charge related to its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy business joint venture with British energy company BP Plc BP.L. The joint venture, BP Bunge Bioenergia, will merge the two companies’ Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations to create the world’s third-largest sugarcane processor. Bunge has tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past with no success. Excluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share, beating analysts’ expectation of 48 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Net sales fell 9.5% to $10.32 billion, missing analysts’ estimate of $11.31 billion."

-6.213571194115945," BP still aiming to close Brazil deal with Bunge in 2019 SAO PAULO (Reuters) - BP Plc is still looking to close its deal with Bunge Ltd to merge sugar and ethanol assets in Brazil in 2019, so the companies can go on to plan their operations together for the new cane season that starts in early 2020. BP’s chief executive for biofuels, Mario Lindenhayn, told reporters on the sidelines of Datagro’s sugar conference in Sao Paulo the oil major was just waiting for the green light of antitrust bodies in three countries, including China, to close the deal. “We already had the approval from Brazil and the European Union, and we are expecting remaining approvals still this year, that is the objective,” Lindenhayn said. BP and Bunge announced in July the deal to merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations. BP agreed to transfer $700 million of Bunge’s debt to the new venture, and make an additional cash payment of $75 million to Bunge. The resulting company will have 11 plants in Brazil and capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year. Lindenhayn said BP sees an opportunity for continued growth in ethanol consumption in Brazil for years, despite changes in the global auto industry toward electrification. He said he believed the current fuel infrastructure in Brazil, with ethanol pumps spread over all states, makes it likely that flex fuel cars and hybrid vehicles that will use ethanol will continue to dominate the market for years to come. Lindenhayn also said he felt positive regarding the potential for increased ethanol blending in gasoline in large fuel-consuming countries such as India and China, which could help boost the global market for the biofuel."

Proceeds from the plants, operated by Brazilian brewer Cervejaria Petrópolis under a leasing agreement, would repay Imcopa’s creditors under terms of a restructuring plan approved by the company’s lenders in late 2017. The combined debt attached to the two plants, which the buyers will have to assume, is 1.043 billion reais ($260.25 million) as of December 2018, according to public records. The bids are due on Dec. 4 and the minimum asking price for each of the plants is 25 million reais ($6.23 million). According to Imcopa’s restructuring plan, the lessee of the Cambé and Araucária plants in Paraná state can be the sole operator of the assets until they are sold via a judicial process. Under the restructuring terms, the leasing agreement with Cervejaria Petrópolis will cease to exist once that process is concluded. Cervejaria Petrópolis, which is fighting in court for the right to maintain the leasing contract through 2024, declined to comment.

-5.62890131379011," Big Ag wants a cut of booming fake-meat market WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd, one the world’s biggest grain traders, recently disclosed the 1.6% stake it had purchased in the fast-growing fake-meat startup Beyond Meat. The play looked smart after the stock surged more than 250% since the faux burger and sausage maker's initial public offering in May. Indeed, Beyond Meat's BYND.O market capitalization of $9.9 billion is now larger than Bunge's BG.N, a 201-year-old firm with 31,000 employees. No wonder many top agricultural firms want to grab their cut of the booming market for plant-based fake meat. Bunge’s investment is just one example of how grain traders and seed companies are trying to capitalize on a market that now accounts for 5% of U.S. meat purchases - a share expected to triple over a decade, according to investment management firm Bernstein. That growth would mirror the fast ramp-up of milk substitutes made from crops such as almonds. ""I definitely think this is going to continue to drive demand,"" said Vince Macciocchi, president of the nutrition group at Archer Daniels Midland ADM.N, one of Bunge's chief rivals. ADM and privately-held grain trader Cargill are selling processed peas and soy proteins to consumer food companies and restaurants that use them to make vegetable burgers, sausages, fish substitutes and other faux-meat products. They are also getting into the business through acquisitions and corporate partnerships or by leveraging their labs and research capabilities to help make new plant-based products for clients including food and beverage makers. Seed company Corteva CTVA.N - which spun off in June after a merger of Dow Chemical and Dupont DD.N - is studying potential vegetable seed offerings. Grain traders and seed-makers are following the lead of Beyond Meat and another startup, Impossible Foods, along with traditional meat producers such as Tyson Foods TSN.N and Maple Leaf Foods MFI.TO that have cashed in on plant-based meat substitutes. Demand for meat alternatives has soared as consumers add plant-based protein to their diets for health reasons and out of concern for animal welfare and environmental damage from livestock farming. Tofu, made from soybean milk, is the best known meat alternative and has been around for decades. But in recent years, other crops such as black beans, peas, lentils, canola, beets and sunflower have become popular in products made to taste like or replace meat. The big agricultural firms are in part playing defense. Grain traders supply the world's livestock farms with animal feed - a business that would suffer if fake meat sales rise at the expense of real meat. Seed companies such as Bayer AG BAYGn.DE sell to farmers who grow the corn and soybeans that are now sold mostly to feed livestock. ADM this year created a new position - director of “flexitarian” solutions - to focus on developing products for food companies who are targeting the market for a mostly plant-based diet, Macciocchi said. The company is also considering repurposing an animal-feed plant in Rotterdam to produce human-grade soy products, he said. ADM has expanded its plant-protein team of scientists and marketers in the past three years even as it aims to cut its overall workforce. “We’ve dedicated a significant amount of our team - the technical side of our team, as well as the commercial side of our team - to plant-based proteins,” Macciocchi said. Cargill [CARG.UL] in August announced an additional $75 million investment in North American pea-protein producer Puris - which supplies Beyond Meat. That triples its original $25 million investment in January 2018. Cargill’s customers have been clamoring for pea or soy protein products, including alternative meats, said Laurie Koenig, who leads a Cargill unit developing such items. “We’ve never seen this kind of pull before from the market,” Koenig said. Like ADM and Cargill, Bunge is now looking to supply ingredients to startups and large companies involved in the imitation-meat trend, Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in an interview. “There’s just so many ways that it is touching our business,” he said. Seed developer Corteva has discussed expanding into research or small acquisitions in vegetable seeds in part to take advantage of increasing demand for plant-based proteins, Chief Executive Jim Collins told Reuters. Corteva’s ability to research breeding and genetics of corn and soybean crops could be applied to vegetables, he said. “The whole vegetable-seed industry is interesting to me,” Collins said. Rival Bayer also could enter the market as a provider of plant-based meat alternatives, an executive said in August, without providing details. The company, which sells seeds and farm chemicals, said it also offers products for plant-based protein sources such as soybeans, tree nuts and peas. Toronto-based pork processor Maple Leaf two years ago bought U.S.-based Lightlife Foods, a plant-based burger-maker, to expand its reach into a market with boundless potential, chief executive Michael McCain said. While the trend is starting in North America and Europe, it will expand worldwide within a decade, McCain said. Marfrig Global Foods SA MRFG3.SA is making a plant-based burger for the Brazil market - made from soy supplied by ADM, and sold at Burger King starting in November. ADM is building a pea protein plant in North Dakota, while France’s Roquette and Verdient Foods, backed by Hollywood director James Cameron, are building plants in Manitoba and Saskatchewan respectively. Fake meat makers largely rely on soy, wheat, and peas, according to the Good Food Institute, which promotes the alternatives. But a wide variety of other crops play a role, presenting an opportunity for companies that maintain relationships with farmers. In a Winnipeg, Manitoba laboratory that doubles as a kitchen, a Burcon NutraScience BU.TO food scientist grills black bean burger patties that are held together with canola protein, rather than the usual eggs - making such burgers appealing to vegans. The company makes protein ingredients from canola, pea and soy, and business is brisk. “The plant-protein industry is as hot as it’s ever been,” said Burcon vice-president Martin Schweizer."
-2.2149671976582512," Bunge lays off grain traders in Geneva as company seeks to minimize risk: sources PARIS/LONDON/HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness firm Bunge Ltd BG.N laid off up to 10 grain traders in Geneva in recent days as it pursues a global restructuring to cut costs and reduce market exposure, five industry sources said. The cuts to trading staff come as Bunge is streamlining its operations in tough agricultural markets and seeks to avoid a repeat of money-losing bets made early in the year-old U.S.-China trade war. The exact number of jobs cut was unclear as the matter was confidential and the reorganization ongoing, the sources said. A sixth source said Bunge would unveil further details of its new organization on Sept. 16. Bunge CEO Gregory Heckman, who took over in January, told Reuters in an interview last month that improving risk management at the 200-year-old company is a key focus as he oversees a portfolio review expected to last through the middle of 2020. “It’s mostly targeting risk-takers,” one source said of the staff cuts in Geneva. “It’s about changing the organization towards one that breaks even and is more consistent, rather than making big bets.” The group’s Middle East grain desk was among sectors of the Geneva office targeted for staff cuts, other sources said. The firm has already outlined a new global organization that will reduce the role of regional structures and last month said it would move its headquarters in the United States. Bunge spokesman Frank Mantero declined to comment on staff cuts, saying “discussions with employees are ongoing”. The company is “finalizing a new organizational set-up,” adding to operating changes announced this year, Mantero said. Like other multinational grain merchants, Bunge uses Geneva as an important hub to cover key markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Bunge has already scaled back its presence in the Swiss city after it sold its sugar trading business last year. It also shifted some support functions to Barcelona, sources said. The latest cuts in Geneva also reflect streamlining linked to the planned headquarters move from White Plains, New York, to St. Louis, some of the sources said. “This is a direct consequence of the decision to move the headquarters to St Louis,” one said. “It’s unclear now what happens to the Geneva office.”"

3.5309498171604456," As trade war drags on, new Bunge CEO looks to avoid 'stroke-of-the-pen' risk CHICAGO (Reuters) - A year removed from a losing bet that the U.S.-China trade war would be promptly resolved, global grains trader Bunge Ltd BG.N is facing an even more uncertain business environment, with a new chief executive who is determined not to get burned again. Gregory Heckman, who joined Bunge’s board late last year and took on the CEO role in January, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday improving risk management at the 200-year-old company is a key focus as he oversees a portfolio review that is expected to last through the middle of 2020. As the trade war enters its second year with no sign of a resolution, White Plains, New York-based Bunge and other grain traders are also navigating weather-reduced crops in the United States, a herd-culling hog disease in China that has slashed demand for soybeans and currency gyrations that have fueled uncertainty in top soymeal exporter Argentina and elsewhere. Bunge’s surprise loss in last year’s second quarter, when bets on a quick trade war resolution turned sour, and another loss-triggering bet in the fourth quarter as trade tensions eased is something Heckman is determined to avoid. “We want to avoid any surprises from stroke-of-the-pen risk,” Heckman said, referring to unforeseen risks such as abrupt government policy shifts or tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump. Investors last year pointed to a culture at Bunge where traders took on more risk compared with rival trading houses as contributing to the loss. “While we have to make certain decisions to manage the inherent risks and protect the margins in our crushing and our distribution and milling assets, we try to absolutely stay out of the way of any big changes that can happen,” Heckman said. The company is improving coordination between its risk management and commercial teams and doing more scenario analysis to make sure that any bets are appropriately weighed against earnings prospects, he said. Grain merchants like Bunge and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, known as the ABCD quartet of global grain trading giants, have already been restructuring their businesses and cutting costs after a years-long crop supply glut that thinned margins and sapped profits. Heckman joined Bunge's board as part of a deal to ease activist investor pressure on the company following a string of weak results that made it vulnerable to takeover attempts by ADM and global commodities trader Glencore Plc GLEN.L. Heckman, a founding partner of private investment firm Flatwater Partners and the former CEO of grains trader Gavilon Group, declined to comment on whether the company was currently in takeover talks. Rising market uncertainty has stiffened near term earnings headwinds for Bunge since it reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings last month, Heckman said. Bunge left its full-year 2019 earnings guidance unchanged when it announced second-quarter results on July 31, but warned that uncertainty from African swine fever and the trade war meant more of the profit for the second half of 2019 would come in the fourth quarter. “We thought that our (second-half 2019) earnings would be largely weighted to Q4. It’s probably even more so now,” Heckman said. Bunge is looking to streamline the company’s operations and maximize profit as part of its ongoing portfolio optimization program. It unveiled a new global operating model in May and announced last week that its headquarters would move to St. Louis from White Plains, New York. The effort has also found a new home for Bunge's sugar business, long a drag on earnings, in a Brazilian bioenergy joint venture with BP Plc BP.L. The company is actively working on “a number of other projects” that will be announced as they are completed, Heckman said. He declined to elaborate on which businesses would be impacted. “We’ve given ourselves an internal deadline to have the majority of the portfolio transformation and optimization work completed by the end of Q2 2020,” he said."
-6.731819216009631," Bunge posts profit on South America, gain from Beyond Meat investment CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd swung to a profit in the second quarter from a year-ago loss, helped by improved results at its South American operations. Bunge also reported an unrealized gain from the company’s stake in Beyond Meat Inc, meaning it could profit from the plant-based burger venture if it sells its nearly 980,000 shares, a roughly 1.6 percent interest according to the latest government filing. Though profits were tempered by weak export demand resulting from U.S.-China trade tensions and harsh U.S. spring weather, they topped Wall Street expectations and Bunge’s operations in Brazil and Argentina make it better placed than many rivals. Shares rose 3.6% to $58.42, more than a seven-month high. Bunge left its previous earnings forecast unchanged, with results for its agribusiness segment, Bunge’s largest in terms of revenue, seen lower in 2019 amid uncertainty about late-planted U.S. crops and the trade war. Bunge and its agribusiness peers Archer Daniels Midland Co , Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL] have been cutting costs and restructuring operations as years of oversupplied grains markets dragged down prices and sapped trading opportunities for quartet, known as the ABCDs of grain. Grain merchants faced processing-plant downtime, shipping delays and other supply uncertainty this spring as historic floods ravaged the central United States. The weather sliced about $13 million from Bunge’s second-quarter profit, Chief Financial Officer John Neppl said. Massive culling of hogs in China because of African swine fever is also “a major source of uncertainty” for the industry’s animal feed suppliers, Chief Executive Greg Heckman said. “Combined with the unresolved U.S.-China trade situation, this has altered both typical trade flows and producer marketing patterns,” he said on a conference call with analysts. Bunge’s large South American operations may shield the company from a more severe trade war impact, according to analysts. The company’s “solid presence in South America will benefit if the U.S.-China negotiations stretch into next year,” said Arun Sundaram, analyst with CFRA Research, which raised its 12-month Bunge share price target by $5 on Wednesday to $65. Bunge reported second-quarter net income available to its shareholders of $205 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with a loss of $21 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share topped analysts’ average estimate of 34 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Bunge’s agribusiness unit was also boosted by soybean crush hedging gains of about $70 million that it said will reverse in the third quarter when soy products are sold. ADM, whose operations are more heavily concentrated in the United States, is due to report second-quarter results on Thursday. Cargill reported a 41% profit drop in its most recent quarter because of trade tensions and U.S. floods."

-0.7641402776927602," Bunge and BP team up in Brazil bioenergy venture, create No. 3 sugarcane processor SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. commodities trader Bunge Ltd BG.N and British energy company BP Plc BP.L said on Monday they will merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations to create the world's third-largest sugarcane processor. The joint venture is the largest deal in Brazil's bioenergy sector since Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L joined forces with Cosan CSAN3.SA to form industry leader Raízen in 2011. Together, Bunge and BP will manage 11 cane processing plants in Brazil with capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year, putting them behind just Raízen and Biosev, which is controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus. The deal gives BP a role in Brazil’s booming ethanol market ahead of a new federal policy next year aimed at boosting use of biofuels, which are used interchangeably with gasoline in Brazilian passenger cars. “Brazil is the Saudi Arabia of biofuel,” BP’s head of Alternative Energy, Dev Sanyal, told Reuters. He added that the new venture was cash-flow positive. Bunge said it will receive cash proceeds of $775 million as part of the agreement, which it expects to use to cut debt. But the company said in a U.S. filing that it is planning a third-quarter impairment charge “in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion” related to the “cumulative currency translation effects” of its business in Brazil. Bunge shares opened up more than 3% higher in New York before reducing gains to 1.4%. BP rose 0.3% in London. The U.S.-based company has tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past with no success. It then tried listing shares of the unit in Sao Paulo last year, but canceled the plan, citing adverse market conditions. Bunge sold its sugar trading business to Wilmar International Ltd last year. Its bioenergy unit posted losses in five of the past six quarters and the company forecast results for the unit would be roughly break-even in 2019. “This partnership with BP represents a major portfolio optimization milestone for Bunge which allows us to reduce our current exposure to sugar milling,” Bunge CEO Gregory Heckman said in a statement. Market conditions have improved for ethanol in Brazil, with strong demand and better prices, but the global sugar market remains challenging. SBc1 “I think the companies together will be able to have large synergies, there will be great optimization of resources and cost reductions,” said Arnaldo Corrêa, a sugar and ethanol consultant in Brazil. “It is great news for the sector, because the deal creates a much stronger player. All those worries about the future of Bunge’s assets disappeared,” he added. The joint venture, named BP Bunge Bioenergia, will operate on a standalone basis, headquartered in Sao Paulo. Besides sugar and ethanol, the company has capacity to produce electricity fueled by waste biomass from sugarcane. “The new company will certainly focus on fuel and electricity, which will have a growing importance as Brazil’s economy recovers,” said Plinio Nastari, chief analyst at Brazilian consultancy Datagro. “Brazil has a deficit of fuel production,” said Mario Lindenhayn, head of biofuels at BP and future chairman of the new JV, adding that the company has its eye on new Asian ethanol markets. The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, includes exit rights after 18 months including a private sale. Bunge has an option to launch a share offering after two years. “We have a strong, committed partner in BP, as well as flexibility in the medium- and long-term for further monetization, with full exit potential via an IPO or other strategic route,” said Bunge’s Heckman."

3.5570897046079986," Bunge's Brazil sugar unit posts record cane crushing numbers -company SAO PAULO, June 27 (Reuters) - Bunge Açúcar & Bioenergia, the Brazilian sugar unit of commodities trader Bunge Ltd, posted in May and June some of its best results yet for cane crushing volumes, the company said on Thursday. Bunge said its eight mills operating in Brazil crushed 2.65 million tonnes of cane in May, the largest amount of cane processing reported by the Brazilian sugar unit since the food processor started operations in Brazil in 2007. The company said operations continued strong in June, when it reached peaks for average daily crushing over a 30-day period. Rogério Bremm, the unit’s agriculture director, said the numbers are a result of work done by the company to increase agricultural yields, aimed at turning the operation profitable in any market condition. Brazil’s center-south, in general, is harvesting a better crop this year compared to the previous season. Agricultural yields were around 5% higher in May compared to the previous season, but they fell 2% in the first two weeks of June, according to cane industry group Unica. Bunge said the high crushing numbers are also a result of improvements in its industrial capacity. The U.S.-based company tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past, with no success. It then tried to do an initial public offering (IPO) of shares of the unit in Sao Paulo last year, but later canceled the plan citing adverse market conditions. Since then, market conditions improved in the ethanol side in Brazil, with strong demand and better prices. The sugar side, however, remains sluggish globally.

9.749798473360258," Bunge appoints new CFO, revamps operations for second time in 18 months CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd on Wednesday overhauled its global operations and named a new chief financial officer in the latest shake-up for the 200-year-old company hard hit by a years-long grain market downturn. The moves come as Bunge reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit due to higher soy crush margins in the United States, Brazil and Europe. Shares rose as much as 7.5 percent hours after the company announced the operations revamp, its second in 18 months. Bunge is battling to reverse a string of weak earnings blamed on a global grains glut and slumping commodities prices made worse by a bruising trade war between the United States and China. The company announced management changes and unveiled a new global operating model, shifting away from a regional structure. The operational change, which could shore up some of Bunge’s recent risk management shortfalls and better utilize its global assets, helped boost its stock by the most since January 2018, said Arun Sundaram, equity analyst at CFRA Research. Bunge’s operating structure since November 2017 has included three regions: North America, South America, and Europe and Asia. The move to a global model “will simplify the organization and speed up decision making, increasing our strategic flexibility, customer focus and accountability,” said Greg Heckman, who was named Bunge’s chief executive officer last month. Bunge appointed John Neppl as CFO, effective May 29. Neppl joins from U.S. ethanol producer Green Plains Inc. Raul Padilla, former president of South America and sugar and bioenergy, was named president of global operations, overseeing crop handling and processing. Christos Dimopoulos, formerly president of agribusiness, was appointed president of global supply chains, charged with managing Bunge’s trading and transportation activities. Bunge said it continues to evaluate its operations as part of a strategic portfolio review announced last year. The company did not change its full-year 2019 forecast. Agribusiness results were expected to slip while food and ingredients earnings were seen improving. A severe African swine fever outbreak that has slashed Chinese demand for soy and uncertainty about the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks is clouding the outlook, Heckman said. “While these dynamics should create positive catalysts for our globally diverse footprint, the timing and magnitude of these potential benefits remain unclear,” Heckman said. Bunge reported net profit from continuing operations of $45 million, or 26 cents per share, compared with a loss of $21 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted net income was 36 cents per share, better than the loss of 3 cents per share expected by analysts, on average, according to Refinitiv data. Net sales fell to $9.94 billion from $10.64 billion. The stock was up 6.4 percent at $53.18 after hitting a session high of $53.71. Bunge and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co are known as the “ABCD” companies that dominate global grain trading."

17.626272623379005," Bunge names acting CEO Gregory Heckman as new chief executive (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd on Thursday named Gregory Heckman as its new chief executive officer, three months after he stepped in as acting CEO at the embattled global grains merchant stung by slumping grain prices and a bruising U.S.-China trade war. Heckman, a founding partner of private investment firm Flatwater Partners and the former chief executive of grains trader Gavilon Group, was appointed acting CEO in January after long-serving CEO Soren Schroder was removed. The leadership change follows a turbulent period for the two-century-old company as profits in its core grain trading, handling and processing business thinned due to a global supply glut and a U.S.-China trade war that redrew global commodity flows. “After a thorough, global search process, the board clearly recognized that Greg has the unique combination of expertise, vision and leadership to successfully lead Bunge,” Kathleen Hyle, Bunge’s non-executive board chair, said in a statement. Heckman joined the Bunge board late last year as part of a deal to ease activist investor pressure on the company following a string of weak results that made Bunge vulnerable to takeover attempts by rival Archer Daniels Midland Co and global commodities trader Glencore Plc. The appointment of Heckman, who headed Gavilon in 2012 when it was sold to Japanese trading house Marubeni, is likely to stoke market expectations for large merger and acquisition deals involving Bunge and its rivals, including an outright sale of the company, said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. Bunge has been undergoing a strategic review of its businesses and has not ruled out a sale of the company. “It leaves the option on the table, whereas Bunge management previously had been resistant to being acquired or even wanting to discuss that with potential acquirers,” Goldstein said. Bunge is one of the “ABCD” quartet of global grain merchants, which include ADM, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co. As profits in grain trading have thinned, the companies have been cutting costs and expanding into higher-margin businesses such as food ingredients and specialty oils. Rival ADM, which is due to report quarterly results on Friday, said this month that it will seek voluntary early retirements by some employees and may eliminate jobs as part of a restructuring of specific areas. Bunge is scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 8. Shares of White Plains, New York-based Bunge closed down 4.9 percent on Thursday at $48.60, ahead of the CEO announcement."

9.172337249123352," Brazil ports linked to Bunge, Cargill seek lower Panama Canal fees SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian port operators including units of global grain traders Cargill Ltd and Bunge Ltd will unveil a proposal this week to lower Panama Canal tariffs and cut their costs in shipping agricultural commodities to their main market China. They will argue that at current tariffs, shipping grains from Brazil’s northern ports via the Cape of Good Hope is almost $206,000 cheaper on a per-ship basis than using the Canal, despite the shorter distance. In a study to be presented at a conference in Panama City on Thursday, the private port operators association ATP will propose using the idle capacity of the old Panama Canal instead of the congested large new locks opened in 2016 for Panamax ships. This could potentially cut shipping costs and shorten journey times by 4-5 days between Brazil, the world’s leading soybean supplier, and the Chinese and other Asian markets, according ATP, of which Cargill, Bunge, Brazil’s grain trader Amaggi and pulp and paper producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA are members. The operators hope their proposal will open the way for talks between Brazil and Panama to find a way to slash tariffs. “It is good for both sides, because today Panama no longer receives a significant number of Brazilian grain ships bound for China due to the inexistence of a tariff agreement,” Luciana Guerise, ATP executive director, said in a statement sent to Reuters. ATP said the tariff proposal has to be made by the Brazil’s agriculture ministry to the country’s foreign affairs ministry, which would be responsible for negotiating the terms with Panamanian authorities. Neither of the ministries had an immediate comment. The initiative marks a new step in the development of new trading routes for Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of agricultural commodities including soybeans, sugar, coffee, tobacco, orange juice, pulp, beef and chicken. An initial step in that direction was taken in March last year when Aprosoja, an association of grain growers in Mato Grosso state, signed a cooperation agreement with the Panama Canal Authority. “We believe we can capture part of the grains that leave Mato Grosso and reach the north of Brazil,” Jorge Quijano, the Canal’s chief executive, said then. “The Panama Canal would be an option for the product to reach Asia, especially China.”"

-1.8842136739249438," UPDATE 3-Bunge's U.S.-China trade war bet leads to Q4 loss, shares dive (Adds acting CEO quote, updates share price, adds change how Bunge will issue guidance) Feb 21 (Reuters) - Global grains merchant Bunge Ltd reported a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday after a truce in the U.S.-China trade war ruined the company’s bets on Brazilian soy, sending shares down to a three-year low. Bunge, under pressure from weak results over the past two years, missed Wall Street forecasts for the fourth time in five quarters. Shares of the White Plains, New York-based company dropped 4.2 percent to $50.41. Brazilian soy prices had swelled to a large premium to U.S. beans after China slapped steep tariffs on shipments from the United States in July. But that premium narrowed after the countries declared a temporary truce in their trade war on Dec. 1. That resulted in a $125 million loss as the value of Bunge’s soybean inventory plunged. The gaffe was at least the second major risk management blunder by Bunge, whose executives had asserted last summer that shifts in global trade flows “play to our strengths.” “We’re not satisfied with our performance,” acting CEO Gregory Heckman told analysts on a conference call, adding that “2018 could have and, frankly, should have been a much better year.” Gross profit in Bunge’s agribusiness segment, historically responsible for about 80 percent of company revenue, fell to $203 million from $238 million in the fourth quarter a year earlier. Last month, Bunge warned of lower full-year earnings in the segment as well as in its sugar and bioenergy business. The company has been under investor pressure and the target of takeover attempts after an earlier string of weak profits. It removed long-time CEO Soren Schroder and is conducting a strategic review of its businesses that may include a sale of the 200-year-old company. Bunge’s problems are expected to stretch into the current year. Agribusiness results in 2019 are expected to be below 2018 due to narrowing soybean crush margins, while its struggling sugar and bioenergy unit’s results are likely to be “about break-even,” the company said. Bunge also said it would no longer offer earnings guidance estimates for its business segments, but instead give directional guidance. The company’s net loss available to shareholders widened to $74 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 8 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 20 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said net sales fell 0.5 percent to $11.54 billion.

-0.7193412437981814," U.S.-China trade war rattles agribusinesses, especially Bunge CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war with China has roiled agricultural markets and given the world’s top grain merchants the one thing they have long claimed was essential to turn a trading profit: volatility. And yet, Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, the so-called ABCDs of grain, have not performed as well as expected - and, in some cases, failed to deliver the profit windfall promised by company executives, investors and analysts said. If anyone should have been a winner in the Trump administration’s sweeping trade war, it should have been the ABCDs, said industry analysts. Investors had expected these international grain traders to benefit from market volatility and shifts in global grain flows resulting from a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. But as China imposed steep tariffs on a raft of U.S. goods including grain and soybeans in July, the traders have struggled to capitalize on moving goods from areas of surplus to areas in need. The reasons are varied and company-specific, from bad political bets to supply-chain gaffes. If not for the silver lining of solid soy processing results due to strong global crush margins in 2018, their earnings would have been far worse. “Benefiting from trading opportunities and arbitrage and dislocations around trade ... that, overall, turned out to be a more difficult landscape to navigate, which ultimately hurt these companies,” said Chris Johnson, director and agribusiness lead for Standard & Poor’s. Bunge, which reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, has arguably fared the worst of all as at least two trade-war-related bets backfired, leading to the removal in December of the company’s chief executive, Soren Schroder. Bunge had already been conducting a strategic review after pressure from activist investors, and was the target of takeover attempts from ADM and global commodities trader Glencore Plc after an earlier string of weak profits. In its first notable trade war misstep, Bunge took long positions in soybean futures, betting on a prompt end to Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans in the second quarter of 2018. It led to a $125 million mark-to-market loss in the quarter. Then, as the trade war dragged on, Bunge increased purchases of Brazilian soybeans to meet accelerated demand from China, only to see their value drop as U.S.-China tensions eased following a trade detente on Dec. 1. That strategy led Bunge to cut full-year earnings for its large agribusiness segment, historically responsible for about 80 percent of company revenue, estimating earnings would come in $90 million to $100 million below the low end of its earlier forecast. The troubles came after Schroder said in May that “our global footprint is built for this type of environment” and the shifts in trade flows “play to our strengths.” Fitch Ratings and Moody’s have since both downgraded Bunge’s long-term debt rating to one notch above junk, while S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook for the company to negative from stable. Bunge’s ill-timed bets frustrated investors. Bunge shares are down more than 32 percent from a year ago, compared with a 3 percent loss in that time by its publicly traded peer ADM. “If you can’t control the variables, don’t make big bets,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer for Capital Innovations, which holds shares of both Bunge and ADM. Still, Capital Innovations expanded its position in Bunge in the past quarter, expecting a turnaround at the 200-year-old company. Underhill has a share price target of $70 for the stock, which is currently trading in the low $50s. Analysts, on average, expect Bunge to report fourth-quarter earnings of 20 cents per share on Thursday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. That compares with a loss of 48 cents per share a year earlier, which included restructuring charges. Bunge was not alone in its trade war stumbles. ADM’s CEO Juan Luciano had been more cautious in its forward-looking statements, calling the trade tensions “manageable in the near term.” The company’s chief financial officer, Ray Young, was more emphatic: “We actually feel very, very confident about our prospects.” Still, the company’s fourth-quarter net income dropped by more than half to $315 million due to “rapidly changing trade, geopolitical and market conditions,” its worst fourth-quarter result in seven years. Cargill last month reported a 20 percent drop in fiscal second-quarter profit due partly to global trade war tensions that hurt its global shipping business. Louis Dreyfus posted lower profits for the first half of 2018, citing a negative $65 million mark-to-market hit from oilseed hedging along with greater unpredictability in markets as the U.S.-China trade war began. The company said a stronger second half would boost full-year earnings."

-12.58777075571697," Bunge CEO Schroder to step down amid investor pressure (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd BG.N Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder is stepping down after five years at the helm of the global agribusiness following months of pressure from shareholders to shake up the company amid a prolonged grain market slump. The management change is the latest event to rattle the two-century-old commodities trader after a stretch of particularly weak earnings results beginning last year that left the company vulnerable to takeover attempts by rivals Glencore Plc GLEN.L and ADM ADM.N. Bunge shares were up modestly at $59.64 on Monday after last week touching their lowest level since April 2016. The company in October bowed to the demands of activist investors D.E. Shaw and Continental Grain, adding four new board members and creating a strategic review committee that would explore all options for the company, including selling itself. Bunge has been grappling with a global grains glut that has dragged down crop prices and thinned margins for trading grains. The U.S.-China trade war has slashed exports of U.S. crops to China, further depressing prices. The company’s strategy in recent years has focused on expanding higher-margin businesses such as food ingredients, but results have been slow to offset the challenges in its core trading and processing businesses. Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, said he was glad to see Schroder step down because the CEO was too comfortable with the status quo at Bunge. Capital Innovations owned about 15,000 shares of Bunge as of Sept. 30, according to an SEC filing. “I don’t think he could be characterized as being an aggressive leader,” Underhill said. “Inconsistent execution has been a key element of the Bunge investment story in recent years and something that has kept us from being more positive.” Bunge is open to reengaging with both Glencore and ADM with the departure of Schroder, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Schroder will continue in his current role until a successor is named, the company said in a statement. White Plains, New York-based Bunge also appointed board member Kathleen Hyle as chairman, effective immediately, replacing L. Patrick Lupo. She most recently was the head of the audit committee on the company’s board.

-15.468354650277668," Bunge sees Brazil 2019 wheat imports rising 11 pct on crop failure SAO PAULO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Brazil wheat imports are expected to increase 11 percent in 2019 to 7 million tonnes as the country grapples with crop failures this year, a senior manager for commodities trading firm Bunge Ltd said on Friday. In Brazil, weather problems including rainfall during the harvest have contributed to the forecast for Brazil’s 2018 wheat crop being cut to 5.3 million tonnes from the 6 million tonnes projected originally, said Edson Csipai, Bunge’s manager of grain origination. Brazil may also face higher prices in meeting demand with wheat from Argentina, the largest exporter of the grain to Brazil, despite its neighbor’s record harvest of 20 million tonnes this year. Farmers in Argentina have advance sold more of their crop than ever before with the harvest just getting underway. “The situation in Argentina is extremely comfortable in terms of price,” Csipai said at an event in Sao Paulo. Argentina should be able to raise prices soon as leading wheat exporter Russia is facing crop failures as well and will likely need to reduce its shipments starting in January or February, he said. Argentine wheat is currently priced around $237 per tonne, roughly $70 below the United States’ product. The quality of Brazil’s grain will also suffer with high moisture levels in southern Brazil and only 1.9 million tonnes of the harvest will be fit for baking flour for bread, the principle form of domestic demand. Brazil uses an estimated 11 million tonnes of so-called type 1 wheat annually for bread. Nearly half of the harvest will be lower quality type 2 wheat used in products like cookies, while 890,000 tonnes will be destined for animal feed. Much of the lower quality wheat will need to be exported, with the cargoes generally bound for Africa and Asia, Csipai said.

The White Plains, New York-based agribusiness company also reported a stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, but lowered its 2018 earnings outlook by $100 million to $1.2 billion with cuts to guidance in two of its four business segments. Bunge shares tumbled 9.2 percent to $61.73 per share in the steepest drop in 1-1/2 years as the lower outlook and fears of future earnings volatility hammered the stock, even as the broader market rose. The plunge more than reversed a 3.4 percent jump the previous day on news that Bunge was finalizing a deal with the activist investors to expand its board and set up the committee. J.P. Morgan cut its price target for the company by $5 to $70 a share, citing possible earnings volatility in the coming quarters amid an ongoing U.S.-China trade war, according to analyst Ann Duignan. The board expansion after the company has fielded unsuccessful takeover bids by rival Archer Daniels Midland Co and commodities trader Glencore, while a prolonged global grain glut has hurt crop prices. “The strategic review committee formed by the board still leaves the door open for a possible sale of the company, but it also leaves the door open to sales of only portions of the company to give it a narrower focus,” said Christopher Muir, equity analyst at CFRA Research. Bunge said three new directors, joining immediately, are Continental Grain Chief Executive Officer Paul Fribourg, former Gavilon Group CEO Gregory Heckman and Henry Winship, president of Pacific Point Capital. A fourth mutually agreed upon director will join the board by the end of the year, bringing the total number of board members to 15. Bunge also said it would form a separate committee, chaired by new board member Fribourg, to conduct a “strategic review focused on enhancing long-term shareholder value.” The six-member strategic review committee will include the new directors named on Wednesday and three current directors, the company said. “This committee has been created as a good check on what it is we’ve been doing, whether we can do additional things, whether we can accelerate things ... There’s no preconceived notions of either direction or topic,” Bunge CEO Soren Schroder told Reuters. Although Schroder is not part of the committee, it will channel its findings through him and the rest of the board, he said. There is no deadline for its review. Bunge reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, helped by higher margins from its agribusiness division. Net income available to shareholders rose to $365 million, or $2.39 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $92 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.52 per share, beating average analysts’ estimates of $2.39 per share, according to Refinitv data. Bunge held its 2018 agribusiness segment earnings outlook unchanged in the upper half of an $800 million to $1 billion range, supported by oilseeds operations in the Northern Hemisphere. Fertilizer segment guidance was raised by $10 million tom $35 million.

The sale is the latest in Bunge’s efforts to reduce its exposure to a struggling sugar unit, which the company first said in 2013 it was looking to sell. Bunge said earlier this year it would seek to sell its trading operations separately from its production assets in Brazil.

-4.448367331055423," Bunge posts surprise loss; blames bets on trade war truce CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grains merchant Bunge Ltd reported a surprise quarterly loss on Wednesday after being caught wrong-footed in the soybean futures market with bets that a trade war between the United States and China would be averted. Bunge stock fell 3.9 percent to $66.42 a share. The result was in stark contrast to trading rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], which reported strong profits in their most recent quarters. Bunge largely blamed a bet that soybean prices would rise as U.S.-China trade tensions eased during the period. However, the trade war escalated and soybeans fell sharply. Bunge reported a $125 million mark-to-market loss tied to soybean crush contracts in the April-to-June quarter and a $24 million hit from currency hedges in Brazil, but said it expects to recover the losses in the second half of the year. The loss was particularly surprising because international grain traders had been expected to benefit from market volatility and shifts in global grain flows resulting from a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods on July 6, prompting Beijing to levy taxes on the same value of U.S. products, including soybeans. Bunge bought large volumes of Brazilian soybeans in the quarter and took on long positions in soybean futures to protect crush margins in the event that China’s threatened tariffs would not be implemented, Schroder said. “We thought that (resolution) would have been very bullish, positive to futures, which, in turn, would have put pressure on the basis long that we had accumulated in Brazil,” he said. “As it turned out, the trade talks have not resulted in any resolution and futures subsequently drifted lower, which led to a loss.” Schroder called the strategy an “enterprise risk” that he would take again under the same circumstances. The hedges were necessary to lock in crushing profits that will be realized in the second half of 2018 as the company secured a larger-than-normal portion of its Brazilian crushing needs during the second quarter. Bunge maintained its full-year earnings forecast of $1.3 billion, with profit from its agribusiness unit, its largest, contributing $800 million to $1 billion. Bunge said net loss available to shareholders was $21 million, or 15 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit $72 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose to $12.15 billion from $11.65 billion."

-2.12642369577904," Bunge to close Argentine soybean mill, lay off 60 workers -union BUENOS AIRES, July 24 (Reuters) - A union of employees of soy crushing plants in Argentina said on Tuesday that U.S. grains merchant Bunge Ltd told workers it will shutter a mill at the port of Ramallo in the province of Buenos Aires, laying off 60 workers. The Workers’ Federation of the Industrial Oilseed Complex, which represents employees at Argentina’s soy crushing plants, said Bunge informed workers about the decision on Monday, though they have not yet formally been dismissed. Argentina is the world’s top soybean oil and meal exporter. Bunge, the leading global producer of soymeal and soyoil, has been trying to slim down to focus on core areas and improve profitability following a series of poor quarterly results. “(Bunge) told us yesterday, Monday, that they were going to lay off 60 soybean oil employees,” Carlos Zamboni, the union’s legal advisor said by phone. “They also told us they were going to close the mill, the plant, the whole Ramallo establishment.” The union plans to protest the lay-offs with a strike that could include different port areas in Argentina, Zamboni said. Bunge did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Ramallo operations is one of the company’s six industrial port complexes in Argentina, according to the company’s website. Grain merchants have struggled in recent years as a global oversupply of food commodities has made it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing, and selling corn, soy and wheat. International agricultural companies like Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus operate grain mills with their own port terminals in Argentina.

-8.115229754644016," Bunge in talks with traders to sell 300,000 tonnes of raw sugar SAO PAULO, June 18 (Reuters) - U.S.-based food processor Bunge Ltd is in talks with major sugar traders looking for the best terms to sell around 300,000 tonnes of raw sugar to be produced by its Brazilian unit as part of the 2018-19 crop, a Bunge executive told Reuters on Monday. Bunge announced earlier this year that it was closing its global sugar trading desk. With the move, an additional volume produced in Brazil that would normally be traded by Bunge overseas will have to be delivered to other traders such as Alvean and RAW. Geovane Dilkin Consul, vice president for sugar and bioenergy at Bunge South America, told Reuters that in the past the Brazilian sugar unit used to deliver 70 percent of its sugar to international traders, with around 30 percent remaining the charge of Bunge’s sugar trading desk. Bunge’s Brazilian sugar unit exports around 1 million tonnes of sugar, so the 300,000 tonnes that would usually be delivered to the company’s sugar trading arm will from this season onward be sold to other major traders in the sector. “We do not have a preferential partner, we are talking to all the major traders looking for the best terms,” Consul said on the sidelines of an industry seminar in Sao Paulo. Bunge announced last week it was cancelling plans for an initial public offering (IPO) of its Brazilian sugar unit, saying adverse market conditions made the deal difficult. The executive declined to comment on the issue, saying that kind of operation was being handed by top management in White Plains, New York, Bunge’s U.S. headquarters. But Consul said there has been no major changes in the sugar unit’s day-to-day operations so far. It expects to crush 20-21 million tonnes of cane in the current season (2018-19, April-March) compared to 19 million tonnes in the previous crop. He said cane processing was advancing quickly due to drier-than-normal weather in Brazil’s center-south region and the company was keen to produce as much ethanol as possible to maximize returns. “We are testing our limits (for ethanol production),” he said, adding that the unit was earmarking 39 percent of cane to sugar production currently and 61 percent to ethanol output. Consul said that dry weather could hurt cane volumes. The company will run an evaluation of cane fields this month to check if it will maintain its crush estimate or reduce it.

-7.480062064014947," UPDATE 1-Bunge calls off Brazilian IPO amid sugar glut, fuel price fears (Adds background) SAO PAULO, June 15 (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd on Friday called off listing its Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit amid a global glut for the sweetener and erratic fuel-pricing policies in the domestic market. In a statement, the U.S. agricultural commodities trader said it was postponing the initial public offering (IPO) of its Bunge Açúcar & Bioenergia unit due to adverse market conditions. Bunge filed last month to float its stake in the loss-making unit, which has struggled to reduce its 2.9 billion reais ($763 million) of debt with sugar prices languishing near multi-year lows. The latest setback was a dramatic reversal last month in how Brazil handles diesel pricing, following a truckers’ strike that paralyzed economic activity, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A price freeze and tax cuts stoked investor concerns Brazil would resume heavy fuel subsidies after less than a year of letting domestic prices track global markets. Over the past decade, gasoline and diesel subsidies in Brazil have undercut the profitability of sugarcane ethanol, which competes at pumps. Bunge’s Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit IPO had not been an easy deal to pull off even before the discussion on fuel subsidies. The unit reported a loss of 112 million reais ($29 million) in the first quarter, compared with a loss of 62 million reais in the same period a year earlier, according to the IPO filing. Investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Santander Brasil SA were working with the company on the deal. Newspaper Valor Economico reported earlier on Friday that Bunge’s IPO could be canceled."

-10.709510231513129," ADM, Bunge say they can navigate U.S.-China trade tensions CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global grain merchants Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd can withstand agricultural trade disruptions arising from U.S.-China tensions and potentially profit from them, company executives said on Wednesday. Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, and Ray Young, ADM’s chief financial officer, also said at an investor conference in New York that their companies were benefiting from a savage drought in Argentina that has increased soy processing margins and trading prospects. The companies are projecting improved profits in 2018, after massive global harvests increased grain stockpiles and reduced trading opportunities in recent years. The U.S. trade dispute with China may create additional opportunities for ADM, Young said, two weeks after the company warned the conflict could pinch revenue. “When we take a look at the short term, the medium term, as well as some of the trade frictions that are out there, we actually feel very, very confident about our prospects,” Young said. Grain traders such as ADM and Bunge have seized upon the tensions between the world’s two biggest economies to turn around struggling trading units. However, the dispute is also disrupting supply chains worldwide, with ships carrying U.S. sorghum turning around after Beijing raised prices for buyers. Soybean buyers in China have separately shifted purchases to Brazil from the United States, after Beijing threatened tariffs on imports of U.S. products including soybeans. The crop is America’s top agricultural export to China, worth more than $12 billion last year. ADM is confident the countries will “get through” the dispute, and sees an opportunity for China to import additional ethanol, Young said. For Bunge, the dispute provides a chance for the company to make use of its global footprint, which includes oilseed processing facilities in the United States, Europe and South America, Schroder said. Last year it acquired two oilseed crushing plants from rival Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] in the Netherlands and France. “You can arbitrage the soybean sourcing from any origin,” Schroder said. Argentina’s drought has improved global oilseed crushing margins for the merchants, according to the companies. Losses linked to the dryness also have spurred global buyers of soybean meal, used to feed livestock, to make purchases in advance, instead of only when they need it, Young said. “We’re creating a fairly sizable forward meal book, which allows us to trade around the book as well and create additional margin opportunities,” he said. Argentina, the world’s third-biggest soy producer, booked its largest purchase of U.S. soybeans in 20 years last month after the drought cut its harvest, forcing crushers there to turn to imports. ADM may look at expanding corn processing in South America as part of its growth strategy, Young said. Also in South America, Bunge plans to sell part of its stake in its Brazilian sugar and ethanol subsidiary, according to documents filed with Brazil’s securities industry regulator CVM on Tuesday. The company has been looking to sell the sugar assets since 2013. However, no deal has emerged due to a downturn in the sector and the high price at which Bunge scooped up the mills. Raw sugar prices are languishing at multi-year lows as huge global supplies of the sweetener outpace demand. A string of weak results over the past year left Bunge’s management fending off takeover approaches from traders Glencore Plc and ADM. Media reports say the talks with ADM have ended, and neither company has commented on them."

The transaction will be comprised only of a secondary offering, in which the controlling shareholder sells part of its stake, according to the preliminary prospectus filed on Tuesday with Brazilian securities industry regulator CVM. The subsidiary, Bunge Açúcar & Bioenergia SA, will not issue any new shares. Bunge said on Tuesday it had filed with the securities regulator for a potential IPO and would maintain a controlling stake after an offering, a week after Reuters reported the hiring of banks to manage the transaction. The sugar and ethanol unit posted a first-quarter loss of 112 million reais ($30 million), compared with a loss of 62 million reais a year earlier, according to the preliminary prospectus. It had net debt of 2.9 billion reais at the end of March, around two times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The prospectus gave no details on pricing and timing for the sale of shares, or what Bunge’s stake would be after the transaction. Bunge’s chief executive officer, Soren Schroder, said at an investor event in New York earlier on Wednesday that an IPO would allow the Brazilian sugar milling unit to “stand on its own two feet.” The company has been looking to sell the beleaguered sugar assets since 2013, but because of a downturn in the sector and the high price at which Bunge scooped up the mills, no deal has emerged. Raw sugar prices are languishing at multi-year lows as huge global supplies of the sweetener outpace demand. Bunge’s chief financial officer, Thomas Boehlert, also speaking at the event in New York, noted Tuesday’s filing for a potential IPO and said the company plans to keep a majority stake in the unit in the short term. “So we would maintain a majority ownership and participate in the company, and potentially exit altogether down the road,” he said.

-10.709510231513129," Bunge cuts biodiesel output in German refinery HAMBURG, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness group Bunge said on Wednesday it was reducing biodiesel output at a German refinery, the latest in a series of production cuts in Germany following a surge of cheap imports of the green fuel into Europe. Bunge expects to initially cut output at its Mannheim biodiesel plant by 50 percent in the second quarter of 2018, a Bunge spokeswoman said. The plant has capacity to produce 120,000 tonnes of biodiesel annually. “Afterwards we will review production periodically and adjust as necessary,” the spokeswoman said. The production cut is another sign of problems in Europe’s biofuel industry after the EU in March removed duties on biodiesel imports Argentine and Indonesian producers following the end of legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice. The EU’s removal of duties on low-price biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia created a surge in EU imports forcing European producers to cut production in coming months. EU producers say biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia gets unfair state support enabling it to be sold at low prices in Europe. U.S. agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland Co said in March it would suspend production at a major biodiesel plant in Germany because of increasing cheap imports. In April, German renewable fuel producer Natural Energy West said it was reducing biodiesel output by 50 percent because of surging imports from Argentina and Indonesia.

The U.S. headquartered company said it recently obtained debt financing for the unit, which it has prepared to operate as a stand-alone company. Bunge said it plans to keep a controlling stake in the company after the IPO, “enabling it to participate in future value creation driven by the stand-alone company’s growth and cyclical improvement in global sugar market conditions”. The global sugar market is facing challenging times due to a supply glut that has pushed raw sugar prices to the lowest levels in two and a half years. Many sugar companies in Brazil are facing low profit margins and high debt. Bunge has tried to sell its eight Brazilian sugar and ethanol plants for four years, but a separate sale process has failed to attract firm interest from strategic or financial investors. On May 8, people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the company had hired banks to prepare for a listing in Brazil. Most of Bunge’s mills in Brazil are located in the northern part of Sao Paulo state and in the south of Minas Gerais state. The company has capacity to process around 22 million tonnes of cane per year. Bunge entered the sugar and ethanol sector in Brazil in 2010, when it bought the holding Moema Participações, which controlled the then six mills. Brazil’s market regulator CVM confirmed Bunge’s listing request. The IPO prospectus is not yet available."

-8.862511719350953," Trade tensions crimp U.S. soybean sales to China: Bunge CEO (Reuters) - U.S. soybean sales to China ground to a halt after Beijing threatened tariffs on imports, the CEO of agricultural trader Bunge Ltd said on Wednesday, the latest sign of mounting trade tensions upsetting the global flow of commodities. Countries such as Brazil and Canada are increasing soybean sales to China following Beijing’s threat last month to impose a 25 percent tariff on imports of U.S. soybeans, Chief Executive Soren Schroder said in an interview. U.S. farmers rely on China as the top buyer of soybeans, but at a current price of about $420 per ton, that translates to a potential tax of more than $100 per ton on shipments. “Nobody’s willing to take the risk of committing to U.S. soybeans to China in the current context, knowing that there could be a $100 penalty from one day to the other, and no way of managing that risk,” Schroder said after the company reported a quarterly loss. Soybeans were the United States’ most valuable agricultural export last year to China, which bought $12 billion of the crop. Freshly harvested South American soybeans typically dominate the world trade in the first half of the calendar year, followed by the United States from September onwards. But U.S. soybean sales to China over the last four weeks are down 10 percent from this time a year ago, according to U.S. trade figures - a blow to U.S. farm country, which helped propel U.S. President Donald Trump into office in the 2016 election. Growing trade disputes are disrupting the agricultural supply chain worldwide and causing U.S. farmers and manufacturers to back away from expansion plans due to steel and aluminum tariffs. “The trade stuff has been another layer of uncertainty that nobody really knows how to price yet,” Schroder said. Separately, Beijing slapped hefty anti-dumping deposits on U.S. imports of a livestock feed known as sorghum. Bunge’s rival, Archer Daniels Midland, said on Tuesday it would take a $30-million hit in the second quarter due to the sorghum dispute. ADM is closely monitoring U.S. trade developments regarding China and the North American Free Trade Agreement, CEO Juan Luciano said. Bunge has seen trade flows shift amid NAFTA renegotiations as well. In one example, Bunge milled wheat that had been imported to Mexico from Argentina as a test, Schroder said. Mexican buyers imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year due to concerns that NAFTA renegotiations could disrupt their U.S. supplies. The shift in China’s soybean business is not a net negative for Bunge because it has operations globally, Schroder said. “If there is a problem in one part of the world, we can solve it in another,” he said. Bunge reported a net loss of 20 cents per share in the quarter ended March 31, down from a profit of 31 cents a share a year ago. The loss included a $120 million charge due to forward oilseeds crushing contracts, which Bunge said it would recover. Improved margins for soybean crushing should boost earnings significantly this year, executives said, after a severe drought reduced harvests in Argentina, the world’s top exporter of soy products. The higher margins prompted Bunge to raise its agribusiness unit’s full-year earnings outlook to a range of $800 million to $1 billion from $550 million to $700 million. Shares gained 2.3 percent to $73.29. Bunge’s projection for stronger performance was a turnaround after years of bumper harvests reduced price volatility and margins for the company and its rivals, making it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing and selling corn, soy and wheat. A string of weak results over the past year left Bunge’s management fending off takeover approaches from traders Glencore PLC and ADM."

Bunge is a major player in the global sugar industry, both as a trader and as a producer. The company has also secured debt financing for the milling business, which could now operate on a standalone basis. “We are prepared to take it to the next step in the form of an IPO if the markets are, let’s say, open and put the right price on it,” Schroder said in an interview after Bunge reported a quarterly loss. Bunge has been seeking to get out of the sugar milling business in top-grower Brazil since 2013 as a supply glut has pushed prices lower and made it tough for industry participants to turn a profit. Its eight Brazilian mills can produce sugar and ethanol and have a capacity of more than 20 million tonnes, according to the company’s website. Bunge’s sugar and bioenergy division lost $20 million in the quarter ended on March 31, compared to a loss of $11 million a year earlier. The company cut its forecast for the unit’s 2018 earnings to a range of $40 million to $60 million from $50 million to $70 million, primarily because of low sugar prices. Valuations for the milling business will determine whether Bunge finalizes an IPO, executives said. Investor appetite is uncertain. “We won’t know until we test the waters,” Schroder said. “Can investors see that this is more than just the price of sugar?” Bunge said in February that it was also exiting sugar trading to concentrate on its grains and oilseeds operations, and had interested parties in the business. The company has struggled to sell the trading operations, though, according to sources familiar with the matter. “We are exploring various opportunities at the moment - whether or not we can pass the trading book and some of the relationships on to other market participants who value that,” Schroder said on Wednesday. He said the company will conclude discussions about the trading business relatively soon, declining to give a specific date."
