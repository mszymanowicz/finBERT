10.454349360388171," Uber joins forces with SK Telecom to crack tough South Korea market SEOUL (Reuters) - Uber Technologies UBER.N said on Friday it will invest more than $150 million in a joint venture and partnership with South Korea's SK Telecom Co Ltd 017670.KS, which is proposing to split off its mobility business. The move is Uber’s latest attempt to expand in a market where it has faced tough competition, opposition from taxi drivers and regulations which forced it to stop using private cars for its ride-hailing service in 2015. The U.S. ride-hailing company currently offers premium taxi-hailing and registered taxi-hailing services in South Korea, a market dominated by local player Kakao's 035720.KS mobility unit. The new joint venture would “create opportunities in the taxi-hailing market in Korea and explore new areas, including future mobility services,” Uber and SK Telecom said in a joint statement. Under the plan, SK Telecom would split off its mobility services including satellite navigation and taxi-hailing into a new company called T Map Mobility, which Uber would then back with a direct investment of $50 million and another $100 million in a joint venture structure, the companies said. Subject to regulatory approval, the joint venture is expected to begin operations in the first half of 2021, the statement said. The joint venture would combine T Map Mobility’s “network of drivers and mapping technology with Uber’s ride-hailing technology and global operations expertise,” it added. It is expected to launch a co-branded platform, which riders and drivers of T Map Taxi will be encouraged to join after the launch. T Map Taxi is SK Telecom’s taxi-hailing platform, the second-largest in Korea after Kakao with 750,000 monthly active users. Its T Map satellite navigation platform is Korea’s largest with 13 million monthly active users. Uber will own 51% of the joint venture, while T Map Mobility will hold the remaining 49%. SK Telecom said it expected T Map Mobility, valued at about 1 trillion won ($873.3 million), to grow into a company worth 4.5 trillion won by 2025."

-11.084240672480478," Deutsche Telekom wins SK Telecom backing for venture arm; 5G joint venture agreed BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom’s venture capital arm said on Tuesday it was closing its second fund to new money after raising $350 million to invest in software service companies that are powering digital transformation. Corporate sponsors SK Telecom of Korea and German optics company Zeiss have joined Deutsche Telekom, HarbourVest, Neuberger Bermann and others in backing the fund, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP) said. SK Telecom’s $30 million investment is part of a wider agreement with Deutsche Telekom to set up a joint venture to develop technologies and services for next-generation 5G mobile networks, the Korean company said separately. DTCP’s Venture/Growth Fund II, founded last year, has already made five investments. These include leading a funding round at Fastly, which helps accelerate internet page loads and floated recently in New York. The fund is focusing on so-called Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies that offer cloud-based software with subscription pricing - a “land and expand” model that makes it easy to ramp up use without major IT headaches, said DTCP head of Venture/Growth and Managing Partner Jack Young. “From an investor’s perspective, an enterprise SaaS business is easily measurable and predictable,” Young told Reuters, adding that digital transformation will accelerate as artificial intelligence is increasingly deployed in software. DTCP’s first fund, set up in 2015, raised $140 million from Deutsche Telekom. It has made four exits, returning half of the capital already to investors and remains invested in nine firms. In total, DTCP is managing or advising on $1.7 billion in assets."

SK Telecom said in a statement that it would pay 702 billion won for a 55 percent stake in Siren Holdings Korea, a holding company that owns 100 pct of ADT Caps, while partner Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, a Macquarie Group Ltd MQG.AX unit, would pay 574 billion won for a 45 percent stake. SK Telecom and Macquarie plan to ink the deal with seller Carlyle CG.O and complete the transaction as early as the third quarter of this year, SK Telecom said. SK Telecom and Macquarie valued ADT Caps’ business at about 2.97 trillion won ($2.8 billion), including the 1.28 trillion won plus about 1.7 trillion won in debt, the telecom firm said. The valuation was about 11 times the firm’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which was in line with average valuations for global security systems companies’ mergers and acquisitions, SK Telecom said. Through ADT Caps, South Korea’s second-largest security systems firm with about 570,000 subscribers and about 30 percent market share, SK Telecom said it planned to strengthen its security business and expand its household clients. ADT Caps, a former unit of Tyco International Inc, was owned by Carlyle after the private equity firm bought it at auction for $1.93 billion in February 2014."
