The New York-based hedge fund, which owns a 5.93 percent stake, warned that the company is vulnerable to an unwanted takeover bid and said management should hire a financial advisor to “explore the sale of the European business.” “We expect the proceeds should be in the $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion range,” Alexander Roepers, Atlantic’s president and chief investment officer wrote in a letter to the board. The letter was released in a public filing."
