12.10184232180861," Exclusive: Kraft Heinz, Conagra may raise some product prices as grains, edible oil costs surge CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co and Conagra Brands Inc said they may choose to raise prices this year on some products that use wheat, sugar and other commodities that are becoming increasingly expensive due to high demand. Conagra CEO Sean Connolly said the company, which makes Duncan Hines cake mixes and Marie Callender’s pulled pork mac and cheese bowls, will need to implement inflation-justified price increases this year so it can also continue to fuel sales growth through innovation. Ingredient and packaging costs represent 60% to 65% of Conagra’s total cost basket, Finance Chief Dave Marberger said on the sidelines of the Consumer Analyst Group of New York virtual conference. With people on lockdown cooking more at home – and still stockpiling in some parts of the world – prices for commodities like sugar, wheat and soy are surging, forcing food companies to absorb higher costs. U.S. consumers on average paid 3.7% more for food consumed at home in January than they did a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Year-over-year increases in food prices have topped 3.5% each month since last April, the longest such stretch in nearly a decade. “We have inflation, we are seeing inflation, we are concerned about inflation. We have to mitigate that inflation, or at least part of it, with hedges and with efficiencies in the factories,” Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Miguel Patricio told Reuters in a recent interview. “Will we have price increases in food this year? Maybe in some categories that are very exposed to specific commodities.” “Where we are seeing (inflation) is in grains and everything related to grains ... It’s across the board. Sugar has big inflation; mac & cheese because it has wheat; mayo because it has oil; salad dressing because it has oil; all sweet products like desserts,” Patricio said. Kraft Heinz - which makes Jell-O, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and a slew of Heinz mayonnaise products and salad dressings – said it did not increase prices in the most recent quarter, but did cut down on promotions and discounts. Other major food companies, including Lipton tea and Hellmann’s mayonnaise maker Unilever, have also signaled higher prices due to global commodity inflation. “We’ve got some inflationary pressures coming forward. And we do expect mid-to-high single-digit commodity inflation in the first half. So we have to be at the top of our game in pricing going forward,” Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said on a recent earnings call. The food producers are not the only U.S. manufacturers beginning to respond to sharply higher input costs - the highest in a decade in some national surveys - with price increases of their own. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s monthly factory survey for January showed prices received by manufacturers for their goods rising by the most since 1989. U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers, however, have downplayed any imminent inflation risk. They do not regard one-time price hikes in an industry or across a group of goods as inflation, as opposed to sustained price increases across the broader economy. “Households have been buying more groceries. You are going to see price pressures,” Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Tuesday in a presentation to a real estate symposium. “Airlines, dining out, where activity remains depressed, is offsetting” the price pressure, she added. “In the near term I don’t see we are going to have an inflation problem.”"

11.096860503088326," Conagra issues upbeat profit forecast, reports in-line quarterly sales (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc on Thursday forecast current-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates, betting on continued demand for its frozen dinners, cake mixes and snacks as the COVID-19 pandemic shows little sign of easing. However, shares of the Chicago-based company fell 3% in noon trading after quarterly sales came in line with expectations. “This was just an OK quarter,” John Boylan, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones said. “Sales merely matched expectations despite more people eating at home, inventory replenishment at grocery stores and improvements in its supply chains,” he added. Sales in the second quarter ended Nov. 29 rose 6.2% to nearly $3 billion, in line with expectations. Organic sales, which strips out currency and M&A effects, rose 8.1%, slower than the 15.1% growth it saw in the previous quarter, when retailers placed more orders ahead of the holiday season. The Slim Jim beef jerky and Healthy Choice meals maker also forecast third-quarter organic sales growth between 6% and 8%, a slower pace than its prior two quarters. “Investors will increasingly shy away from names in which growth will decrease or turn negative in the next few months,” analysts from Truist wrote in a note. Investors are also apathetic to near-term consumption trends as the pandemic has pushed sales of food companies higher than average growth levels, making it “nearly impossible” to gauge what individual company performance will be in “normal” times, according to the note. Conagra Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly told Reuters he was confident consumers will keep buying its products even during normal times based on repeat buying rates during the pandemic, investments in e-commerce and data analytics, as well as efforts to reach more consumers on mobile devices."

1.8764385404569663," Conagra says retailer order boom may ease after big quarter (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N put better-than-expected first quarter sales on Thursday down to heavy ordering by retailers worried about the durability of supply chains in the months ahead as a second wave of coronavirus cases takes hold. Shares in the foodstuffs maker dipped as much as 3% before recovering after Chief Financial Officer David Marberger warned that, while stocking up by its big retail customers had boosted sales growth by 6 full percentage points, ordering was likely to now ease. Chief Executive Sean Connolly added that many retailers had already stocked up against the end-of-year holiday period when they worry that coronavirus cases will spur new lockdowns and economic trouble that will hurt supplies of goods. Conagra and its retail customers have boomed since February as coronavirus-induced at-home eating boosted demand for all kinds of foods, including the frozen vegetables, snacks and ready-to-eat meals the Chicago-based firm is best known for. Retailers were “seriously depleted” in the three months to Aug. 30, Marberger told a call with analysts. Restocking was so strong, the company increased third-party manufacturing to meet orders for its Birds Eye frozen vegetables, it said. “Between manufacturing capacity overall and retailer inventories being light... we’re still in catch-up mode,” Connolly said. Overall, organic net sales, which exclude impact from mergers & acquisitions and currency fluctuations, rose 15% in the quarter, much higher than the 10%-13% range the company had previously expected. It expects growth of 6% to 8% in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings rose to 70 cents per share, 13 cents above analysts’ average estimate, according to Refinitiv IBES and the company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 29%."

2.116201909725643," Conagra Brands forecasts profit above estimates, beats fourth-quarter expectations (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N on Tuesday forecast current-quarter profit above estimates after reporting strong fourth-quarter results as coronavirus-led lockdowns fueled demand for its frozen foods and snacks, sending the company's shares up 4%. Demand for packaged foods with long shelf lives has continued into the current quarter even as many U.S. states ease restrictions, with consumers working from home looking to avoid going to restaurants due to fears of contracting the virus. The Chef Boyardee pasta maker said it expected to earn 54 cents to 59 cents per share on an adjusted basis in the first quarter, above Wall Street expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Conagra also estimated organic net sales to rise 10% to 13%, even as it expects decreased demand for products the company sells directly to restaurants. “Many consumers are rediscovering the enjoyment associated with at-home eating, whether it’s making fun baked goods, cooking with the family or enjoying a movie night with some snacks,” Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly told analysts on the earnings call. The company also reaffirmed its fiscal 2022 outlook, prompting JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman to call the move “a modestly positive surprise” given that some investors were curious if the forecast range would be cut. Net sales rose nearly 26% to $3.29 billion in the quarter ended May 31, while organic net sales rose 21.5%. Excluding one-time items, Conagra earned 75 cents per share.

20.612765358545534," Conagra raises forecast on heightened food demand during pandemic (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N raised its financial expectations for 2020 on Tuesday as consumers swarm stores to pick shelves clean of food items and essentials due to the lockdowns imposed across the United States to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Cases related to the virus have soared in the country in the past few weeks to over 163,000, forcing consumers to work from home and avoid social gatherings. To prepare for the situation, consumers lined up at supermarkets to stock their pantries with everyday essentials, frozen foods and snacks, leading to shortages at many supermarkets. Conagra and other packaged food makers manufactured more of the products in demand and even paid one-time bonuses to its employees as they hurried to restock supermarkets shelves. “Typically, we would be spending our time on this call reaffirming our guidance ... But this year is unprecedented, and the impact of COVID-19 will be significant,” Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly told analysts on a post-earnings conference call. Shares of the company were up 7% at $30.22. They have fallen 13% this year. Last month, the company had lowered its forecast for fiscal 2020, citing weak consumption trends especially in its foodservice category. “People are eating much more at home and not away from home, products like ours are getting levels of trial that were not anticipated ... that could turn into consistent users over time,” Connolly said. On a quarter-to-date basis, shipments and consumption in domestic retail business, which is about 80% of total company sales, increased about 50%, he said. Conagra now expects 2020 organic net sales growth to be above the high-end of its previous forecast range of flat to 0.5%. The company now also estimates earnings to come in above the top-end of its outlook range of between $2 and $2.07 per share. For the third quarter, Conagra’s net sales fell 5.6% to $2.56 billion, mainly due to softer-than-expected demand for products it supplied to restaurants due to the cold winter. Analysts on average had expected $2.58 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net earnings attributable to the company fell 15.5% to $204.4 million.

-21.331289273895525," Conagra Brands tops profit estimates on strong snacks, frozen food demand; shares soar (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N beat Wall Street's second-quarter profit and sales estimates on Thursday, benefiting from strong demand for the packaged food maker's snacks and frozen foods, pushing its shares up 18% and setting them up for their best day ever. Conagra has been pouring money into innovating its brands including Hunt’s and Chef Boyardee and partnering with retail outlets to increase shelf space for its products. The latest results showed the company has also largely recovered from its initial hiccup in integrating brands including Birds Eye and Duncan Hines that it bought as part of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition last year. “Conagra’s innovations, both with its legacy brands and brands from the recent Pinnacle acquisition, along with business improvements the company has made, are beginning to shine through,” Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. “Any doubts investors may have had about Conagra’s prospects for this fiscal year were likely erased with these results.” The Chicago, Illinois-based company raised its forecast for annual cost synergies for its Pinnacle acquisition by $20 million to $305 million by the end of fiscal 2022, and said it planned to invest the savings to drive sales. Conagra’s most profitable grocery and snacks segment’s quarterly sales grew 14.2%, with Conagra citing strong demand for products such as Slim Jim and Swiss Miss. Its refrigerated and frozen food unit grew 28.8%, benefiting from strong sales for brands including Birds Eye, Healthy Choice and Marie Callender’s. Excluding items, the company earned 63 cents per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate of 57 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to Conagra nearly doubled to $260.5 million, or 53 cents per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 24, from a year earlier. Net sales rose 18% to $2.82 billion, largely due to Conagra’s acquisition of Pinnacle last year, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $2.80 billion, marking its first quarterly beat in over a year. The company, however, cut its annual forecast for net sales growth and profit, mainly to reflect the sale of its direct-store-delivery snacks business in October.

Pinnacle is the biggest of a handful of acquisitions the Chicago-based firm has made over the past three years to beef up its product portfolio with brands including Birds Eye and meatless brand Gardein. Investors were initially uncertain about the success of the deal last year, but as the company works to integrate the new product lines, shares in Conagra have risen about 40%.

19.94812703709084," Conagra misses estimates as rivals step up promotions, cut prices (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc's CAG.N on Thursday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings and sales as low prices and aggressive store promotions by rival food makers ate into demand for Marie Callender's, Hunt's and Chef Boyardee products. Chicago-based Conagra’s shares fell 12% to $25.44, the stock’s worst day in six months. The U.S. consumer goods industry has struggled with soaring commodity and freight costs for more than a year. Forced to raise prices, Conagra and its peers have lost market share to low-priced private label brands at Walmart WMT.N, Kroger KR.N and Amazon.com AMZN.O. Conagra told Reuters it expected another inflationary year, driven by increased costs for raw materials such as pork amid African swine fever outbreaks. The company raised prices for Hunt’s canned tomatoes last year after tariffs and strong global demand drove steel costs up by double-digits. “By the end of the quarter, price gaps were simply too wide for consumers to ignore and we lost volume,” Conagra Chief Executive Sean Connolly said, noting that quarterly results were below expectations. Sales in Conagra’s refrigerated and frozen business, previously a bright spot for the company, declined 0.6% to $687 million due in part to lower demand and a P.F. Chang’s recall. ""Conagra's growth momentum in the frozen category appears to have started to taper off,"" Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said. ""This seems to have coincided with Kraft Heinz's KHC.O heavy promotion in frozen products."" Conagra beefed up its portfolio of frozen food with its acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in 2018, adding healthy products from meat-alternative brand Gardein and Birds Eye. “It might take longer than we thought for Conagra to normalize as management adjusts its business to the Pinnacle acquisition and fixes its shorter-term issues,” Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. Conagra said it was also hit hard toward the end of the quarter by manufacturing challenges at its P.F. Chang’s, Dukes and Peter Pan brands. The company’s sales were weakened further by the divestment of its Wesson oil business and the impact of foreign exchange. With the sale of its frozen Italian-food brand Gelit, Conagra expects current-year adjusted profit of $2.08-$2.18 per share, largely below estimates of $2.16, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales rose 32.9% to $2.61 billion, mostly because of the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, but missed expectations of $2.66 billion. Excluding items, the company earned 36 cents per share, short of the average analyst estimate of 41 cents.

12.001434226281262," Conagra profit tops on price-hike boost; shares rise (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc’s quarterly profit beat Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as the Reddi-wip and Slim Jim beef jerky maker raised prices to make up for higher transportation and commodity costs, sending shares up 7 percent before the bell. Like most packaged food companies, Conagra is wrestling with higher material and freight costs due to driver shortages and new regulations. Simultaneously, the industry is struggling to keep up with rapidly changing consumer preference for healthy, fresh food. There’s also stiff competition from restaurants and food delivery services that deliver ready-to-eat meals in less than thirty minutes. To combat competition from all quarters, Conagra made several acquisitions including millennial favorites Angie’s Boomchickapop popcorn and Duke’s smoked meats, and splurged billions to buy Birds Eye frozen vegetables and Duncan Hines cake mix owner Pinnacle Foods in October. Last quarter, Conagra blamed Pinnacle’s sub-par innovation for poor sales. In its latest quarter, sales from Pinnacle fell in mid-single digits. For the full year, the company said it expects sales for Pinnacle in the range of $1.71 billion to $1.73 billion, compared with $1.70 billion to $1.75 billion it had projected earlier. “We are aggressively applying our proven ‘Conagra Way’ to address the executional challenges in the Birds Eye, Duncan Hines and Wish-Bone businesses,” Chief Executive Sean Connolly said. Earlier this month, the company announced new products such as gluten-free mugcakes under Udi’s and frozen burritos and meal bowls under Evol, brands it acquired from Pinnacle. Excluding certain items, Conagra earned 51 cents per share in the third-quarter ended Feb. 24, beating estimates of 49 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Net sales rose 35.7 percent to $2.71 billion, but fell below the average analyst estimate of $2.75 billion. Organic sales, which exclude impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, rose nearly 2 percent driven by sales of frozen foods and snacks such as Orville Redenbacher’s and Act II popcorn. Net income attributable to the company fell to $242 million, or 50 cents per share, from $362.8 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier."

-4.7305308045988355," Conagra shares tumble on weak 2019 profit forecast, hiccups at Pinnacle (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N forecast full-year adjusted profit below Wall Street expectations and hinted underperformance of some of the brands it bought as part of its Pinnacle Foods acquisition was hurting business, sending shares down as much as 12 percent. Conagra, which bought the frozen food maker in October for $8.1 billion, said lack of innovation and sub-par execution had stalled growth at Pinnacle’s Birds Eye, Wish-Bone and Duncan Hines brands, accounting for most of the newly acquired company’s current problems. “There’s only so much you can see in public company diligence, particularly when you buy a competitor ... we could see it all now,” Chief Executive Sean Connolly said on a post-earnings call. “The deterioration in the legacy Pinnacle business over the course of calendar year 2018 means we have some hard work to do.” Connelly said that the said issues would see Pinnacle under-deliver on its own pre-deal close internal targets, resulting in roughly $3 billion in sales at the end of 2018, or about $160 million or 5 percent below its earlier target. As a result, net sales at Conagra for the second quarter, that included a month’s contribution from Pinnacle came to $2.38 billion, but was below analysts’ average estimate of $2.41 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales from the year-ago period were also challenging to beat because of hurricane-fueled demand for packaged food during the comparative quarter. Organic sales in the grocery and snacks unit, which is Conagra’s biggest and makes Slim Jims and Duke’s meat snacks, declined 1.9 percent in the quarter, with volumes dropping 2.2 percent as some scheduled shipments were pushed into the next quarter. Truckers have been in short supply across the United States this year, and many food companies have been hit with surging freight costs. The rising costs and waning demand for packaged food as consumers turn increasingly to healthy eating have further hurt Conagra. The company cut its adjusted earnings profit for the year to $2.03-$2.08 per share, short of the $2.11 per share analysts were forecasting. Conagra’s full-year forecast implies a very conservative outlook for Pinnacle by the management, Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale said in a note. Net income attributable to the company fell about 40 percent to $131.6 million in the second quarter ended Nov. 25. However, excluding items, the company earned 67 cents per share, surpassing expectations of 55 cents."

The agreement came after J.M. Smucker Co SJM.N, owner of rival Crisco brand, dropped its bid in March to acquire Wesson, after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission argued it would lessen competition. Richardson’s purchase price was not disclosed, but Conagra had previously agreed to sell Wesson to Smucker for $285 million before that deal collapsed. Richardson’s deal with Conagra, subject to regulatory approval, includes the Wesson plant in Memphis, Tennessee. Acquiring Wesson, the top-selling U.S. cooking oil brand, adds to Richardson’s diversification into food products from bulk grain handling, said Jean-Marc Ruest, the company’s senior vice president of corporate affairs. Richardson also owns an oat mill in Nebraska, and is interested in further acquisitions to build its U.S. business, Ruest said in an interview. Winnipeg-based Richardson International is a subsidiary of James Richardson & Sons, a family-owned business dating back 161 years. The company’s core business is handling Canadian farmers’ canola and wheat. It also owns oilseed-crushing plants and grain mills. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. Ruest said Richardson did not expect difficulty obtaining regulatory approval as it currently sells little cooking oil in the United States."

-35.46707624261014," Regulators investigate salmonella infections linked to Conagra's cake mixes (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said here on Wednesday they were investigating Conagra Brands Inc's facility that makes cake mixes after a sample of the product that contained Salmonella agbeni matched the strain that had infected five people. Conagra on Monday had recalled four varieties of the cake mix after officials in Oregon found Salmonella agbeni in a box of Duncan Hines Classic White Cake Mix. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating five illnesses in three states to determine if they are linked with recently recalled here Duncan Hines cake mixes. “We’re cooperating with CDC and FDA on this investigation and recalled the products out of an abundance of caution,” the company told Reuters. Conagra acquired the Duncan Hines brand as part of its $8.1 billion take over of Pinnacle Foods Inc."
-35.275542494937646," Conagra results fall just short, shares down 6 percent (Reuters) - Sales at Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N fell short of Wall Street estimates on Thursday as the packaged food company sold fewer products at full-price to restaurants and caterers, weakening profit and sending the company's shares lower. The company also said its second-quarter advertising and promotion costs would be higher than the first quarter. The sales miss and cost warning pushed the company's shares down as much as 7 percent and weighed on the stocks of rivals such as Kellogg K.N and J.M. Smucker SJN.N. Conagra has been investing on marketing its products in the face of intense competition among packaged food makers and the shifting taste of the health-conscious consumer. “We need to be in-store and online ... and this takes investment,” Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said. “It’s about getting noticed.” The company’s net sales in the first quarter rose 1.7 percent to $1.83 billion, but were below the average analysts’ estimate of $1.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at the food service business that delivers products such as sauces and beef cuts to caterers and restaurant chains fell 6.9 percent to $234 million in the quarter, compared to estimates of $246 million. However, its larger refrigerated foods business continued to be the bright spot with sale rising 3.2 percent. The company has been looking to bulk up in the fast-growing frozen meal business and recently announced the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc PFN.N for $8.1 billion. That deal would catapult it much closer in size to rival Nestle NESN.S and give it much needed scale and negotiating power to deal with stiff competition. Overall, net income attributable to the company rose 17 percent to $178.2 million in the first quarter ended Aug. 26. Excluding items, the company earned 47 cents per share, missing estimates of 49 cents per share. The company’s shares fell 6 percent to $33.76 in afternoon trading."

-6.433118169297276," Conagra to buy Pinnacle for $8.1 billion, creating frozen food powerhouse (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N said on Wednesday it would buy Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N for about $8.1 billion, trying to grab a bigger share of the fast-growing snack and frozen food markets amid fierce competition in the packaged food industry. The cash-and-stock deal, which would make Conagra the No. 2 U.S. frozen food maker by sales after Nestle NESN.S, comes as demand rises for convenient, healthy ready meals, especially among millennials. Conagra and Pinnacle Foods have been investing aggressively to become the two fastest-growing frozen meal companies, according to analysts, with such brands as Birds Eye, Power Bowls and Hungry-Man, which tout more protein and fewer artificial ingredients. The combined market capitalization of Conagra and Pinnacle Foods is about $23 billion, on par with rival Kellogg Co K.N. The deal comes at a time when scale and negotiating power are crucial to packaged goods companies being squeezed by high commodities and freight costs and pressure from retailers for low pricing. “M&A is a common theme we’re going to continue to see as the growth environment has slowed for many packaged goods companies,” Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said, adding that many in the industry considered the deal “inevitable.” “There are benefits to M&A on the cost side of things from buying power to supply chains, by being larger. But there’s also benefits on the negotiating side with prices, merchandising and working with retailers,” Weissman said. Conagra Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly told Reuters the deal would help the company cut down on supply chain costs and strengthen its relationship with retailers. “We can do a better job of filling full truckloads when we ship to our customers and work more efficiently,” Connolly said, adding that the company will use the cash from cost savings to invest more in developing its brands. DEAL WAS ‘INEVITABLE’ Chicago-based Conagra said the two packaged food companies would have reported a combined $11 billion in full-year proforma net sales, with $4.9 billion in frozen food sales. It expects to save about $215 million by the end of the fiscal year 2022. Pinnacle shareholders would get $43.11 per share in cash and 0.6494 Conagra shares for each Pinnacle share, implying an offer price of about $68 a share. Including debt, the deal is valued at $10.9 billion. It is expected to close by the end of calendar 2018. The acquisition is a victory of sorts for Connolly, who had unsuccessfully tried to buy Pinnacle when he was CEO of Hillshire. The sale to Hillshire was canceled after Hillshire agreed to sell itself to Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N for $7.7 billion. Talks between Conagra and Pinnacle, however, restarted after activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC in April bought a 9.1 percent stake in New Jersey-based Pinnacle and urged the company to look for a sale. Conagra stock slid 7 percent to $35.56 and Pinnacle fell 4.2 percent to $65. Weissman said Conagra shares were likely down because the market was not thrilled with Conagra using shares for the deal. Also on Wednesday, the company reported mixed quarterly results, with better-than-expected sales but lower earnings than analysts had expected. Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said the implied offer price was below the $75 per share he expected. He said the offer was ""a bit surprising,"" citing other recent deals, such as General Mills Inc's GIS.N purchase of Blue Buffalo, which have reached up to 19 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners are Conagra’s financial advisers, while Evercore and Credit Suisse are advising Pinnacle."

President Donald Trump said he will use a strengthened national security review panel — the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — to deal with potential threats from Chinese acquisition of U.S. technology, instead of imposing China-specific restrictions. The decision marks a somewhat softer approach to curbing Chinese investments than reports on earlier plans to block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. tech firms. “Nothing today came out other than commentary from the administration. The problems that we’re dealing with in the market isn’t going to be allayed by a couple of interviews,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “We’re going to need significant commentary from the President, trade advisers about where this is all going.” After an initial rally, the S&P technology and industrial sectors — which have a relatively higher revenue exposure to China – fizzled. Tech stocks fell 0.63 percent, while industrials held a slim 0.15 percent gain. The drop was relatively steeper in chipmakers, which on average get about a quarter of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia semiconductor index slid 1.4 percent. “I think it’s still likely that chip stocks are a point of contention between the U.S. and China. So when they drop so low, they get interesting to investors and they come back to a place where fear kicks in again,” said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. At 13:39 ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 16.21 points, or 0.07 percent, at 24,266.90, the S&P 500 was down 5.62 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,717.44 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 54.88 points, or 0.73 percent, at 7,506.75. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 percent, leading the gainers among the 11 major sectors, lifted by a jump in U.S. crude price as plunging stockpiles compounded supply concerns. Among stocks, General Electric gained about 3.2 percent, riding the optimism from the industrial conglomerates’ restructuring plans announced on Tuesday. Conagra dropped 6.9 percent after the company said it would buy Pinnacle Foods for about $8.1 billion in cash and stock. Pinnacle Foods fell 4.1 percent after the widely anticipated deal announcement. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.62-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.81-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

-1.6061950915446377," Pinnacle Foods, Conagra restart deal talks: sources (Reuters) - Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N, the owner of Birds Eye frozen foods and Mrs. Butterworth’s syrups, has restarted talks about potentially selling itself to its larger peer Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N, according to two people familiar with the matter. Packaged foods giants have been facing a crisis of slowing to stagnant growth in recent years as shoppers switch away from processed foods to healthier fare. These companies have also seen their profits squeezed by macroeconomic forces such as higher commodities and transportation costs. A deal for Pinnacle would come after much speculation about the company’s fate after failed talks a year ago as well as pressure by activist hedge fund Jana Partners. Pinnacle shares rose nearly 3 percent on Thursday, bringing its market capitalization to $7.91 billion, after Bloomberg first reported that Conagra had approached Pinnacle about a potential deal. There is no certainty the new talks will lead to a deal and the negotiations could still fall apart, the sources cautioned. ConAgra and Pinnacle declined to comment. Discussions between Conagra, the maker of Hunt’s ketchup and Healthy Choice microwave dinners, and Pinnacle Foods fell apart last summer because of price disagreements, sources said at the time. The sources asked not be identified because the matter is confidential. In April, Jana Partners said it had accrued a 9.1 percent stake in the New Jersey-based company and said it would discuss with it the possibility of exploring a sale. In early May, Conagra said it had ended a standstill agreement with Jana, which gave the activist hedge fund further leverage in attempts to engineer a tie-up. Conagra has been trying to remake many of its most prominent brands to suit contemporary tastes, with healthier ingredients and eco-friendly packaging."
2.426863573407766," Jana, ConAgra end standstill as Pinnacle Foods comes under pressure to sell (Reuters) - ConAgra Brands Inc CAG.N, the maker of Hunt's ketchup and Marie Callender's microwave dinners, said on Friday it had ended a standstill agreement with Jana Partners LLC, the activist hedge fund pushing for a sale of Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N. The termination of the agreement, which dates back to 2015 when ConAgra and Jana reached a deal for two new mutually agreed directors to join ConAgra’s board, allows Jana to more freely push both ConAgra and Pinnacle Foods to explore a combination. ConAgra held talks to acquire Pinnacle Foods last year, but could not clinch a deal because of price disagreements, sources said at the time. Last month, Jana said it had amassed a 9.1 percent stake in Pinnacle Foods and that it would speak to the maker of Duncan Hines bake mixes and Vlasic pickles about it participating in industry consolidation by exploring a sale. ConAgra said its standstill agreement with Jana ended by mutual agreement. Pinnacle Foods and Jana did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Pinnacle Foods shares were up 4 percent at $63.16 on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of $7.5 billion. ConAgra shares were up 2.7 percent at $36.80, giving it a market capitalization of $14.7 billion. Packaged foods giants have struggled in recent years as shoppers switch away from processed foods to healthier fare. U.S. food companies have also recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs. Railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy. ConAgra has been pushing hard to remake many of its most prominent brands to suit contemporary tastes, with healthier ingredients and eco-friendly packaging."
