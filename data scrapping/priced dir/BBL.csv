14.534174605727118," U.S. judge will not stop land transfer for Rio Tinto mine in Arizona (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday said he would not stop the U.S. Forest Service from transferring government-owned land in Arizona to Rio Tinto Plc for its Resolution Copper project, denying a request from Native Americans who said the land has religious and cultural import. The judge’s decision is likely to escalate the clash between members of Arizona’s San Carlos Apache Tribe, who consider the land home to deities, and Rio and minority partner BHP Group Plc, who have spent more than $1 billion on the project without producing any copper, the red metal used to make electric vehicles and other electronics devices. The ruling means the land transfer can now take place by mid-March under a timeline approved by Congress and then-President Barack Obama in 2014. U.S. District Judge Steven Logan, an Obama appointee, said the group of Native Americans who brought the suit lacked standing and that the government has the right to give the land to whomever it chooses. Tribal members claimed the U.S. government has illegally occupied the land for more than 160 years, but Logan sided with government attorneys by finding that Washington gained the land in an 1848 treaty with Mexico. Representatives for the tribe, Rio Tinto and the U.S. Forest Service were not immediately available for comment. BHP declined to comment. “We remain undaunted,” said Michael Nixon, an attorney for Apache Stronghold, the nonprofit group of Native Americans opposed to the mine. Logan’s ruling was related to an injunction request. Apache Stronghold had also asked for a jury trial to determine, in part, whether the U.S. government can give the land away. It was not immediately clear when that trial could take place as U.S. courts have prioritized criminal cases during the coronavirus pandemic. Some Native Americans work for and support the Resolution project, though many others have vowed to oppose it forcefully. Logan last month declined to block the publication of an environmental study that started the 60-day countdown for the land swap."
19.264652253180735," Brazil's Samarco to restart mining five years after deadly dam burst SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Samarco is planning to restart operations in late December, the company said on Friday, five years after a dam burst killed 19 people and resulted in Brazil’s worst ever environmental disaster. Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture between BHP Group and Vale SA, said it had begun the commissioning process at the Germano Complex in the town of Mariana, starting with the ramp-up of two concentrating plants and a new plant to filter waste from mining activities. Production operations should begin in earnest in the second half of December at its Ubu Complex, where the company produces iron ore pellets, it said in a statement. The company initially expects to operate at 26% of capacity, which is 30.5 million tonnes of iron ore pellets annually, it said in a separate statement given to Reuters. Samarco has been subject to extensive litigation in the years since the November 2015 disaster. In January 2019, a nearby dam in Brumadinho that was wholly owned by Vale also burst, killing 270."
33.36374088326294," Colombian mine Cerrejon says it has initial deal with indigenous Wayuu, leaders disagree BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian coal mine Cerrejon has reached a preliminary agreement with a Wayuu indigenous community to comply with environmental and health requirements in its operations, the company said on Tuesday, which community leaders denied. The Provincial community in La Guajira has argued with Cerrejon, which is owned jointly by BHP Group, Anglo American and Glencore, for years over its use , of water, pollution, dust, noise, and health problems. Colombia’s Constitutional Court earlier ordered Cerrejon to comply with requirements aimed at protecting health and the environment, while a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the government to suspend some of the mine’s operations on health and environmental concerns. The agreement includes building a community health center and an environmental rehabilitation program, which will include planting 248,000 trees, and other measures ordered by the court. The company will implement a program to clean community facilities and nearby areas over the next five years and will also provide technical support for measuring air quality, Cerrejon said in a statement. Indigenous leaders said there was no deal. “Today ... Cerrejon has issued a public statement in which it lies seriously and fraudulently, and tries to deceive the country and international bodies,” Provincial community leaders said in a statement. Responding to the Special Rapporteur’s concerns, Cerrejon said it operates responsibly to help reduce impacts on the environment and community, while looking to improve existing controls and processes. Cerrejon complies with applicable quality standards for air and water, the company said in a separate statement, adding it regularly monitors water sources in the area. Production at Cerrejon has been held up since Aug. 31 because of a strike organized by its largest workers’ union demanding better pay, health benefits and education among other things. A decision to reorganize shifts has become a major sticking point in negotiations. While Cerrejon says changes are necessary to keep operations competitive, union Sintracarbon says it will endanger workers’ health. The company on Monday proposed establishing technical tables to gradually implement the new shifts, but Sintracarbon said “there was no progress whatsoever.”"
38.936583832843354," Australia's biggest mining royalty firm Deterra debuts with $1.83 billion market value (Reuters) - Deterra Royalties Ltd debuted on the Australian Securities Exchange on Friday with a market value of A$2.57 billion ($1.83 billion) after being spun off from mineral sands producer Iluka Resources Ltd. Deterra, the country’s biggest listed mining royalty business, joins Australia’s top 200 listed companies after issuing about 528 million shares, which started trading at A$4.87 per share. The stock rose as much as 1.6% to A$4.95, before falling below its opening price to A$4.80 in midday trade. Deterra’s key asset is an iron ore royalties stream from global giant BHP Group’s South Flank operations in Western Australia, but the company has said it plans to diversify its portfolio beyond the steel-making raw material. Royalty streaming, where a miner gets paid upfront for part of its metal production, is catching on as a way to raise capital. It offers a lower risk profile to investors by giving them exposure to rising metal prices rather than a mining company. Deterra has said it intends to pay out all of its net profit after tax as dividends. Iluka will own a 20% minority stake in the company.

36.03287737172797," BHP delays sulphate output until first-half 2020, pushes green battery supply chain MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group BHP.AX will begin production of nickel sulphate by the middle of next year as it focuses on improving the green credentials of operations that will supply battery materials to the automotive industry, an executive said on Tuesday. BHP said in August last year that it planned to start nickel sulphate production at its Kwinana plant, south of Perth, by the second quarter of 2020, before development was delayed due to complex engineering required to make the high purity product. “We expect to have first crystals in the second half of this financial year,” asset president Eddie Haegel told the Diggers and Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, according to a copy of his speech. Nickel makes batteries energy dense so cars can run further on a single charge. As buyers seek low carbon choices, BHP is focusing on improving the environmental footprint of the operations, Haegel said. “Our customers and future customers are increasing their demand for clean nickel products and a clean supply chain, so having the best assets also means addressing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions,” Haegel said, referring to direct and indirect carbon emissions such as those that come from power use. Tesla Inc TSLA.O chief Elon Musk urged miners to produce more nickel in July, warning the cost of batteries remained a big hurdle to the company's growth. “Elon Musk’s recent call to nickel producers is a welcome reminder that there is huge demand coming for battery grade products,” Haegel said. BHP produces sulphate from higher-grade nickel sulphide deposits, which require less power to process than from laterite ore alternatives and are common in Indonesia. BHP is securing renewable power contracts, installing 18 megawatts of solar and a new steam generator at its smelter. It also plans to upgrade the acid plant at its Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter to cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 2024, Haegel said. The division is still a tiny part of BHP’s overall business, recording a $37 million loss in underlying earnings last year compared with an $11.1 billion profit for iron ore."
36.03287737172797," BHP reaches heritage agreement with Aboriginal land council group MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group BHP.AX said on Tuesday it reached an agreement with a coalition of Aboriginal land councils over principles for heritage management, a day ahead of a shareholder vote on a related issue at its annual meeting. The agreement follows increased scrutiny on the protection of significant cultural sites after Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX legally destroyed a rock shelter showing evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation in Western Australia as part of an iron ore mine expansion in May. BHP and the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance would identify areas where they could work together to improve standards and practices on cultural heritage, they said in separate statements. The alliance is made up of Australia’s major Aboriginal Land Councils and Native Title groups. BHP said the two bodies had determined a set of shared principles, including informed consent in decision making, support for appropriate regulatory regimes and self-determination for Aboriginal peoples. Alliance Co-Chair Anne Dennis said the group had held productive discussions with BHP. “We are confident that this process will make a real positive difference to the culture and capabilities of the minerals industry in relation to the protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage,” she said. The uproar over Rio’s destruction of the Juukan caves cost the company’s CEO his job and led to a review by the industry of its practices and an Australian parliamentary inquiry. BHP’s testimony to the inquiry revealed that it had pursued permission to damage Aboriginal cultural sites as recently as April despite being told of the distress it would cause traditional owners. As a result of the latest agreement, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said it would withdraw its proposed resolution on cultural heritage from BHP’s annual meeting. The Alliance would continue to work with ACCR on similar proposals with other miners like Rio Tinto, Dennis said."
36.84088291215929," U.S. energy companies begin restoring oil and gas output after hurricane HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies were returning workers and restarting operations at storm-swept production facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast on Sunday, two days after Hurricane Delta barreled through the area. Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BHP Group all said workers were headed back to production platforms in the U.S.-regulated northern Gulf of Mexico. BHP expects to complete the return of workers to its Shenzi and Neptune production platforms on Sunday, spokeswoman Judy Dane said, adding that resuming flows will depend on how quickly pipelines return to service. It can take several days after a storm passes for energy producers to evaluate facilities for damage, return workers and restore offshore production. The companies that operate oil and gas pipelines and process the offshore output also shut ahead of the storm. On Sunday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said 91% of offshore crude oil production remains shut in the U.S.-regulated northern Gulf of Mexico following Hurricane Delta, which made landfall on Friday night. In addition, 62.2% of natural gas output remains shut in the Gulf following the storm that made landfall near Creole, Louisiana, and weakened into a low-pressure system over Mississippi on Saturday. Through Sunday, a cumulative total of 8.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil production and 8.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output from the Gulf has been shut because of Hurricane Delta. The area produces about 17% of total daily U.S. oil production and 5% of daily natural gas production. Still remaining shut are the Calcasieu Waterway in Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes in Louisiana and the ports of Lake Charles and Cameron, Louisiana, near where Delta made landfall. The ports of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, including the Sabine Pass, which serve major oil and liquefied natural gas processing plants, were reopened with restrictions on Sunday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Total SA continued restarting its 225,500 barrel-per-day Port Arthur, Texas, refinery on Sunday. The refinery, which is about 65 miles (100 km) west of Creole, Louisiana, lost power on Friday. Fast-moving Delta swept over Louisiana on Saturday and became a low-pressure system over the U.S. state of Mississippi later that day. It was south of Knoxville, Tennessee, Sunday morning and moving northeast at 16 mph (25.7 km per hour). Remnants of Delta were forecast to drop 3 inches to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of rain on parts of Tennessee, the Appalachian region of northeast Georgia, western Carolinas and western Virginia, the National Hurricane Center said on Sunday."

BHP and Encounter will complete the initial validation of the Elliot project, sprawling over 4,500 sq km (1,737 sq miles) in Australia’s Northern Territory, by the end of December, the gold and copper miner said. BHP would need to spend up to A$22 million ($16 million) for exploration within 10 years at Elliot if it decided to take a stake in the project, Encounter said. It added that BHP could elect for further validation programmes next year before deciding whether to exercise its option and enter an earn-in joint venture with Encounter."
21.418796688450758," BHP in talks with three firms for LNG bunker supply contract - executive SINGAPORE (Reuters) - BHP Group BHP.AXBHPB.L is in talks with three companies for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to fuel five ships it plans to use to transport iron ore between western Australia and China, a senior company executive told Reuters. A contract is expected to be awarded next month after an initial 8 to 10 firms vied for delivery of the super-chilled fuel to the miner over 2022 to 2027, Rashpal Bhatti, BHP’s vice president for maritime and supply chain excellence told Reuters. BHP earlier this month awarded a tender to charter five LNG-fuelled Newcastlemax bulk carriers to Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping, aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions on voyages to biggest customer China by more than 30%. The five vessels will be able to carry about 10 million tonnes per year (tpy) of iron ore, or about about 3.6% of BHP’s 280 million tpy in exports. BHP will assess the vessels once they are on the water before deciding whether to expand its LNG-fuelled fleet, Bhatti said. Currently, less than 400 out more than 80,000 registered ships run on LNG as fuel source, according to Mohd Rafe Mohamed Ramli, head of global LNG bunkering at Petronas Marine. “Our five vessels will make up 10% of all Asian (LNG) bunkering volumes. That equates to 1.5% of all global LNG bunkering requirements,” BHP’s Bhatti said. Miners are under pressure to reduce pollution to meet concerns about the environment, while investors increasingly demand that companies offer a compelling sustainability strategy. Spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen sharply over the past two years due to new supply from Australia and the United States. “LNG is significantly less expensive than VLSFO (very low sulphur fuel oil),” Bhatti said. “When it comes to cost, the build of the vessel is more expensive than a conventional vessel ... but the gas supply is the one that really allows us to take a like for like view.”"
17.389404028825226," BHP sought to disturb cultural sites even after concerns raised: inquiry MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group pursued permission to damage Aboriginal cultural sites in April, an Australian parliamentary inquiry heard on Thursday, despite being told of the distress it would cause traditional owners. The inquiry is investigating Rio Tinto’s legal detonation in May of sacred and historically significant rockshelters for an iron ore mine at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Rio’s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies stepped down last week following a public outcry, the deep upset of the traditional owners and the discontent from institutional investors who called for management to better account for the damage. BHP executives David Bunting, the company’s Australian Heritage Manager, and Libby Ferrari, Head of Indigenous Engagement, testified about the company’s application to disturb 40 sacred sites of the Banjima indigenous group as part of its $2.9 billion South Flank mine expansion in the Pilbara. The Banjima “did provide feedback through BHP that there were concerns around some of the places” that would be disturbed, said Ferrari. “They were able to and did air their views quite clearly with us and with the regulator.” Both Ferrari and Bunting noted that the Banjima did not object to the South Flank expansion, but also acknowledged that the consent agreement between BHP and the Banjima does not allow them to legally object to the destruction of sacred sites. However, an April 16, 2020, letter from Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation Chief Executive Officer Joanna Ramsey submitted as part of BHP’s application contains heartfelt objections to their destruction. In the letter reviewed by Reuters, Banjima Corporation Chairman Maitland Parker says, “that while he knows Banjima cannot object to the application, this in no way diminishes the cumulative loss that Banjima people feel each and every time significant places ... are to be harmed.” Parker added that he wanted future generations to “know we didn’t just sign off on this stuff and forget about it, we put up a fight about these places.” The Western Australia Minister for Aboriginal Affairs approved BHP’s application on May 29, just days after the news that Rio destroyed the Juukan Gorge sites. Of more than 480 applications by miners to disturb significant sites in the past 10 years to July, all but one have been approved. In her testimony on Thursday, Ferrari said that BHP was working under the consents that are currently in place. “Would we have done things differently in hindsight? Possibly.” BHP pledged on June 11 not to disturb any of the Banjima sites without further study and consultation. Edgar Basto, the head of BHP’s Australian operations, said the miner is focusing on improving its approach to better protect heritage sites in a process of deep engagement with traditional owners. BHP said last week it would set up a heritage committee with senior Banjima elders to improve consultation and communication around heritage sites. BHP has also clarified that Aboriginal owners are free to comment on the management of their cultural heritage, and is reviewing clauses around consent in its agreements. However, BHP, like Rio and Fortescue Metals Group have stopped short of supporting the right of Aboriginal groups to veto the destruction of sacred sites."

A 1.3% gain in the FTSE 100 saw the index outperform its European peers, with Rio Tinto and BHP Group among the biggest boosts as data showed China’s industrial output accelerated the most in eight months in August. Online supermarket Ocado Group topped the FTSE 100 after saying its retail joint venture with Marks & Spencer posted a 52% jump in revenue in the 13 weeks to Aug. 30. The mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.8%, with major insurers supporting the index after a court ruling meant that some of them would have to pay much less than expected in claims to small firms battered by the coronavirus pandemic. The index, considered a barometer of Brexit sentiment, has underperformed the FTSE 100 this month following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to breach the Brexit treaty with the European Union. The proposal won initial approval in the UK parliament on Monday. “A deal is now at best a 50:50 probability,” ING economists wrote in a note. “The key factor will be whether the Internal Market Bill makes its way through the Commons and Lords successfully. If so, the EU is highly unlikely to sign a free-trade agreement.” Later in the week eyes will be on a Bank of England policy meeting, where the central bank is likely to signal more stimulus to lift the economy out of a deep recession that could be exacerbated by a messy Brexit. Britain’s jobless rate rose in the three months to July, the first such increase since coronavirus-led lockdowns began in March, but data also showed a less severe fall in employment than feared.

15.797550404123681," BHP freezes executive salaries as CEO Henry takes $6.1 million for first six months MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group BHP.AX said in its annual report on Tuesday that it froze salaries of key leadership personnel for the coming financial year, while Chief Executive Mike Henry received $6.1 million in the first six months on the job. Henry, who became chief executive on Jan. 1 this year, was set a salary of $1.87 million a year, including a base salary of $1.7 million and a 10% pension contribution, but not including short- and long-term incentives that make up the majority of his remuneration. The outcome reflected “an appropriate alignment between pay and performance during the year and is also fair in terms of the global context in which decisions have been made,” Chair of the remuneration committee, Susan Kilsby, said. The coronavirus-induced pressure at companies globally is likely to feed through into lower executive salaries more broadly. At global mining companies, costs have also surged as miners have spent on safety and quarantine measures to curb the virus impact on their workforce and nearby communities. BHP also announced that there would be no hike to salaries or total remuneration packages for the CEO or other key management personnel. Henry’s 2021 total target remuneration is unchanged at $7.5 million, BHP said, 12% lower than that of previous Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie. The former CEO took home $2.4 million for the first half of the 2020 financial year and another $5.3 million as his 2015 long-term incentive. Chairman Ken MacKenzie’s fee remained at $880,000, with the level being constant for a fourth year. Base fee levels for other non-executive directors will also remain unchanged at $160,000 a year."
22.315004626026848," BHP lays down goals to cut own emissions by 30% by FY2030 MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group BHP.AX will focus on cutting its operational emissions by 30% by the 2030 financial year from 2020 levels, and will link executive bonuses to its progress, its chief executive said in a climate strategy update on Thursday. The world’s biggest listed miner will focus on using cleaner forms of power supply as well a taking steps to electrify its diesel-powered truck fleet as part of steps that will eventually see it reach net zero operational emissions by 2050. “We are ... realistic about the magnitude of the task that the world faces in meeting the Paris goals,” Mike Henry said. “Unfortunately, today the world is not currently on track ... The world will need to increase action if it is to achieve the ambitions of Paris.” BHP said it will work with the steel and maritime industries, both among the world’s most heavily polluting, to develop ways to cut emissions intensity, by 30% for the steel industry and by 40% for BHP-chartered shipping. “We expect our actions to catalyse broader emissions reductions throughout the steel and maritime sectors,” Henry said, adding that 10% of short-term incentives for the executive leadership team will be linked to the firm’s climate change progress. BHP's operational emissions last financial year stood at 14.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, around half of peer Rio Tinto RIO.AX at 26.4 million tonnes, according to investor group Market Forces. Its scope three emissions, or those of its customers, however, at 566.8 million tonnes are bigger than Australia’s total national emissions for the year to December 2019 of 532.5 million tonnes, Market Forces said. “BHP has set the bar for its diversified mining competitors,” its executive director Julien Vincent said, pointing to Rio Tinto’s target to reduce its operational emissions to 15% below 2018 levels by 2030. “However, setting the bar at 30% below 2020 levels by 2030 is clearly choosing to fall short of the Paris Agreement... This limit has been supported by investors worth over US$37 trillion, not to mention the global community concerned for a liveable climate.” BHP announced plans to divest some coal assets last month as it rebalances its portfolio towards commodities such as copper and nickel that it expects to be in greater demand in a lower carbon future. It reaffirmed its commitment to petroleum. The miner has shaped its climate change plan according to four climate scenarios. Its most extreme ‘Climate Crisis’ scenario “involves an abandonment of existing global decarbonisation initiatives for a time, leading to a catastrophic climate crisis, which catalyses urgent subsequent decarbonisation.” The others include maintaining a temperature rise of 1.5% Celsius as per Paris goals; a “lower carbon view” based on rapid decarbonisation in easier to abate sectors; and a view of decarbonisation in some of the world’s more developed regions."

17.400130496928195," BHP awards tender for LNG-fuelled bulk iron ore carriers MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group BHP.AXBHPB.L said on Friday it has awarded a tender to charter five bulk iron ore carriers powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions on voyages to biggest customer China by more than 30%. The contract for five LNG-fuelled Newcastlemax bulk carriers to carry ore between Western Australia and China was awarded to Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping, and will run for five years from 2022, the global miner said. The shipping industry has been under pressure to bring down levels of carbon emissions, having this year also introduced new rules on the level of sulphur in marine fuels. The BHP tender offered an incentive to move to LNG from highly polluting bunker fuel. BHP Chief Commercial Officer Vandita Pant said the LNG-fuelled vessels would virtually eliminate sulphur oxide emissions and significantly reduce carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. “As one of the largest dry bulk charterers in the world BHP recognises the role we play in working with our suppliers and customers to drive actionable reductions in GHG emissions across the maritime supply chain,” Pant said. “We expect the introduction of LNG-fuelled vessels will result in more than 30% lower CO2-e emissions on a per voyage basis compared to conventional fuel along the Western Australia to China route.”"
2.9175008193772385," BHP to tap green energy to mine coal in Australian state MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group BHP.AX said on Tuesday it has signed an agreement to use more renewable energy at its coal mines in Australia's Queensland state which it expects will help it cut its indirect emissions such as those from fuel and power in the country by 20% in five years. The move comes as BHP prepares to update the market on its climate actions next week which will include targets to cut operational emissions by 2030, as part of its broader commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The steel-making coal that BHP digs out of the Bowen Basin in central Queensland will be exported and does not count towards BHP’s net zero target. “This is an important step forward in BHP’s transition to more sustainable energy use across our portfolio, and a first for our Australian operations,” said BHP’s President Minerals Australia Edgar Basto said in a statement. BHP produced 41 million tonnes of the steel-making ingredient last year. The renewable power purchasing agreement with Queensland’s state-owned clean energy generator CleanCo, will run for five years from Jan. 1 2021. Long-term power purchasing agreements improve the viability of large renewables projects because they guarantee a source of income, making projects easier for banks to finance. The agreement will support the development of new solar and wind farms in Queensland – the Western Downs Green Power Hub due for completion in late 2022, and Karara Wind Farm due for completion in early 2023. For the first two years, power will be contracted from CleanCo’s low emissions portfolio which includes hydro and gas generation assets, before the new projects ramp up. BHP Group produced 3.5 million tonnes of direct greenhouse gas emissions and 1.37 million tonnes of indirect emissions in 2018-2019, making it among the country’s largest emitters, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Australian corporations reported 338 million tonnes of direct greenhouse gas emissions and 88 million tonnes of indirect emissions that year, the regulator said."

-4.003498849691053," BHP plans sale of Australian Bass Strait oil and gas stake MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group said on Tuesday it plans to sell its 50% stake in the Australian Bass Strait oil and gas venture as it seeks to focus on its higher-value petroleum assets. The Bass Strait joint venture is co-owned and operated by Exxon Mobil Corp, which has also put its 50% stake up for sale. Analysts have estimated the 50% stake could fetch up to $3 billion. The Bass Strait oil and gas fields off Australia’s southeastern coast have produced more than 4 billion barrels of crude oil and about 8 trillion cubic feet of gas over the past 50 years and now face a steep decline. “We continue to optimise our petroleum portfolio through the exit of later life assets, including an intended exit from Bass Strait,” BHP said in its annual results statement. At $1.1 billion, the Bass Strait was the biggest single contributor to BHP’s petroleum revenue in the year to June 2020, but that was down from a $1.6 billion annual contribution a decade ago. Analysts said BHP might be able to sell its stake ahead of Exxon as the Anglo-Australian company’s interest might attract more bidders as it is not the operator of the field. However Wood Mackenzie analyst Daniel Toleman said not knowing who the operator is going to be is a “major risk”. “The main impediment to this deal is the abandonment liabilities, which are significant,” Toleman said, referring to the costs of decommissioning offshore oil and gas platforms. He did not give an estimate. Regulators will likely watch the sale closely after a small company, North Oil & Gas Australia (NOGA), bought an ageing field in 2016 which came with $156 million in abandonment liabilities, but then went into voluntary administration last year. The decommissioning costs for the Bass Strait assets would be many times higher than that. “Abandonment costs and heightened regulatory scrutiny over any buyer’s ability to meet them in the wake of the NOGA debacle, could drastically limit the pool of buyers for Bass Strait interests,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic."
-4.003498849691053," BHP falls short of expected profit, warns of slowing growth outside China MELBOURNE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - BHP Group on Tuesday said it expects most major world economies except China to bear the brunt of a coronavirus-led downturn this year, reporting a 4% drop in annual profit that missed analysts’ estimates. While miners have seen green shoots emerge from an economic pickup in the world’s top metals user, as well as a boost in infrastructure spending, the risk of new virus outbreaks around the world threatens to undermine growth, BHP said. The warning came as BHP reported underlying profit attributable from continuing operations for the year ended June 30 that fell to $9.06 billion - below estimates of $9.42 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. “With the exception of China, the world’s major economies will contract during the 2020 calendar year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Chief Executive Mike Henry said in a statement. Henry added that the potential for fresh waves of coronavirus infections in key markets was weighing on the demand outlook for 2021 at the world’s largest listed miner. “Not too many surprises in there,” said portfolio manager Andy Forster of Argo Investments in Sydney. “Maybe a touch under expected, and the dividend a bit below.” Shares fell by as much as 1.3% before trimming the drop to 0.3% at A$39.75, by 0203 GMT, compared with a 1% rise in the broader index The profit miss was in contrast to rival Rio Tinto, which last month rode its iron ore-rich portfolio to beat profit estimates and touted “a very steep V-shaped” recovery in China. It declared a final dividend of 55 cents per share, down from 78 cents a year earlier, but still in line with its payout ratio. BHP also announced asset divestments and executive leadership changes - that will see top management evenly split by gender - as Henry, who officially took the reins in January, puts his stamp on the business. The miner said it is looking at options including a demerger or sale of thermal coal assets, as it favours energy-rich metallurgical coal in its portfolio given a lower-carbon future. These include its Australian Mount Arthur operations, 80% of its BHP Mitsui Coal joint venture, and one-third of the Cerrejón mine in Colombia. Japanese trading house Mitsui had no immediate comment. It also said it was looking to sell off its Bass Strait oil and gas stake, though that was not down to any environmental agenda, Henry told an analyst call. He said BHP was bullish on oil because it has profitable prospects for at least the next decade and is open to acquisitions near existing assets."

-6.761867010973448," BHP to steer mining lobby groups' climate change policies MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group BHP.AX said on Friday it will closely monitor the work of industry associations to ensure they match its climate position on keeping the world's warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The world’s largest listed miner has faced increasing pressure from investors worried that some mineral lobby groups, particularly in Australia, are promoting coal in contravention of the goals of the Paris climate pact, and have urged BHP to stop funding them. BHP, which quit the World Coal Association in 2018, said it will publish annually a list of material association memberships and disclose in real time if any of the associations breach its global climate policy standards. “We welcome this effort to ensure trade associations remain in step with their more forward-thinking members,” said Thomas O’Malley, Global Head of Corporate Governance at HSBC Global Asset Management and co-lead of the Climate Action 100+ engagement with BHP. BHP also said industry groups it supports should not advocate in favour of Australia’s use of Kyoto carryover credits, a controversial accounting method that would allow Australia to use its old carbon credits from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol to meet Paris targets. Last year, BHP said it was reviewing its membership of four industry associations including the New South Wales Minerals Council due to concerns about their climate and energy policies. The NSW Minerals Council in June promoted 21 coal mines as a key employment driver. It said in a statement that its policies reflected the views of all members. “BHP is an important member... and we will seek to progress BHP’s request in consultation with our board and the executive committee which includes BHP.” The Minerals Council of Australia said it welcomed BHP’s findings and would work with the miner and state associations to progress the key issues raised."
-6.683357550185801," Shareholders seek BHP moratorium on Australian cultural site damage MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group must commit to not damaging Aboriginal cultural sites as its expands its mining operations while a review of Australian heritage law is carried out, a shareholder group said in a resolution filed on Thursday. The proposal comes before BHP’s financial results, due out next week, and after a government enquiry into how peer Rio Tinto legally destroyed caves that showed human habitation stretching back 46,000 years, as part of an iron ore mine expansion. The moratorium on damaging culturally important sites would cut risk while reforms are considered, the shareholder group, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), said in a statement. “Investors simply can’t stand by and allow another Juukan Gorge disaster to take place,” said the group’s executive director, Brynn O’Brien, referring to the site of the caves destroyed by Rio Tinto. The group is aligned with industry funds that pledge to uphold socially responsible investment. The resolution is backed by a group representing all of Australia’s major Aboriginal Land Councils. BHP said it consulted regularly with its investors on matters such as its approach to cultural heritage. “Our engagement with Traditional Owners is based on deep respect and a commitment to understanding the cultural significance of their country and heritage,” the company said in a statement. A proposed revision of Western Australia’s Aboriginal Heritage Act is to be made public in coming weeks. The law is widely considered out of date because it does not allow traditional owners right of appeal, among other issues. BHP has said it would not disturb any sites of importance to the Banjima people at its South Flank operations, even though the state government had given it approval to disturb 40 sites. The ACCR also called on BHP to lift gag orders that restrain Indigenous groups from objecting to developments on their land and to be transparent when it comes to lobbying by industry groups. In a separate resolution, the ACCR called for BHP to review the work of its industry associations in connection with economic stimulus measures in response to the novel coronavirus, and how that relates to their Paris climate accord commitments. The New South Wales Minerals Council in July called for the state government to fast-track approval of 21 new or expanded coal mining projects."
-3.1043494304090027," BHP hits record iron ore output but warns of risks from virus MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group on Tuesday posted a 7% rise in fourth-quarter iron ore output, but warned the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks threatened the short-term demand outlook for its key commodities and widened its production guidance range for next year. Mining companies are banking on the recent uptick in industrial activity in China, the world’s top metals consumer, to support prices and insulate them from uncertainty over demand elsewhere, as global coronavirus cases continue to spike. The world’s biggest listed miner met guidance for its iron ore production of a record 67 million tonnes for the quarter, up 4%, and 248 million tonnes for the financial year, reflecting strong demand from top consumer China. Reflecting uncertainty over a second wave of infections and the possible impact to demand from China, the world’ stop commodity consumer, it also widened its 2021 guidance across commodities, including 2% each way for iron ore to 244 – 253 million tonnes for FY 2021. “BHP’s 4Q FY20 production was stronger than we had expected as we had modelled more significant disruptions from COVID and weak demand,” said broker Jefferies in a report. China’s domestic industrial activity had been improving, BHP said, given supportive credit and fiscal policy, but it reiterated a major risk to maintaining that positive trajectory due to a possible emergence of a second wave of infections. “Indications are that the U.S., India, Japan and Europe will all experience a flatter recovery trajectory than China. Negative feedback loops to China from the downturn in the rest of the world are factored into our range analysis.” Last week, rival Rio Tinto stuck to its 2020 iron ore shipment forecast and sounded markedly more upbeat, saying demand for the steelmaking ingredient was improving in China. BHP produced 414,000 tonnes of copper in the quarter, ahead of UBS expectations of 388,000 tonnes, hitting 1.724 million tonnes for the year. It lowered its 2021 guidance to 1.48–1.645 million tonnes, down by 14%–5% from its 2020 outlook given coronavirus impacts in Latin America."

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose as much as 0.9% in early trade, rebounding from Monday’s 0.6% fall. Trial data from three potential vaccines released on Monday raised hopes that a vaccine can train the immune system to recognise and fight the novel coronavirus without serious side effects, lifting sentiment across the globe. All eyes are now on the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s last policy meeting and a speech by Governor Philip Lowe on ‘COVID-19, the labour market and public-sector balance sheets’ later in the day. The coronavirus outbreak has flared up in Victoria this month, with the country’s acting chief medical officer saying it could take weeks to tame despite lockdown measures. All major sub-indexes on the benchmark opened higher, with tech stocks leading the rebound after a surge in U.S. peers.

-1.9618651131463032," BHP faces first step in $6.3 billion UK claim over Brazil dam failure LONDON (Reuters) - More than 200,000 Brazilian people and groups will next week kick off a 5 billion-pound ($6.3 billion) lawsuit against Anglo-Australian miner BHP in Britain over a 2015 dam failure that led to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster. The group claim, one of the largest in British legal history, has been brought on behalf of Brazilian individuals, businesses, churches, organisations, municipalities and indigenous people and will open in Manchester on July 22. An initial, eight-day hearing will establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until later in the year. If successful, further trials are expected to determine liability and quantify damages. BHP spokesman Neil Burrows said the claim did not belong in Britain because it duplicated proceedings in Brazil and the ongoing work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the miner and its partners to manage reparations and repairs. The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining company Vale, killed 19 and spilled roughly 40 million cubic metres of toxic sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away. Claimants allege BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam’s capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that pointed to early signs of rupture. “The public companies at the top of the BHP group structure, which we firmly believe bear ultimate responsibility for the disaster, have until now been insulated from its consequences within the Brazilian legal system,” said Tom Goodhead, a partner at law firm PGMBM, which represents the claimants. Goodhead said Brazilian environmental law had a long reach and imposed strict liability for environmental damage."

Cornerstone has an 8% stake in SolGold, making it the BHP-backed company's BHP.AXBHPB.L fourth-biggest shareholder. “The current SolGold Board is incapable of managing the affairs of SolGold for the benefit of all shareholders in a prudent and transparent manner,” said Greg Chamandy, chairman of Cornerstone, in a statement. At the centre of SolGold’s public spat with two of its largest shareholders are concerns it is raising money for its mammoth Ecuador copper-gold project using inefficient and expensive methods. In May, SolGold announced a financing package of up to $150 million and a $15 million bridge loan with mining financiers Franco-Nevada Corp FNV.TO to develop its Alpala project. Cornerstone's Chamandy said the proposed royalty financing would destroy value for all SolGold shareholders, echoing comments by SolGold's second largest investor Newcrest NCM.AX Cornerstone said it expected a new SolGold board to review the terms of the Franco-Nevada financing package and possibly terminate the deal if it was not in the best interests of SolGold and its shareholders. SolGold CEO Nick Mather said the call to remove the company’s board was “unnecessarily destabilising”, adding he was not sure of the motivation but was “confident of defending such an attack”. He was speaking on a webinar to try to convince Cornerstone shareholders to take an all-stock offer made in late June of 11 SolGold ordinary shares for each Cornerstone share. An earlier proposal was also rejected by Cornerstone in 2019 on the grounds that it undervalued the Canadian company. Mather urged Cornerstone shareholders to “accept the premium bid”. He added the Franco-Nevada deal was on favourable terms and was fair for all shareholders. Franco-Nevada declined to comment. Cornerstone said on Tuesday about 65% of its shareholders would not support SolGold’s second offer. Shares in SolGold were up 4% by 1425 GMT."

BHP and technology firm MineHub said in separate statements on Monday that blockchain - a digital ledger that forms the backbone of many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin - would boost efficiency and transparency. They did not say whether BHP has used blockchain before for other uses. For the past several years, commodities groups have been seeking to save money by using blockchain to digitise a sector that still uses millions of paper documents, but have come up against obstacles. BHP said that the trial transaction using the MineHub platform was worth about $14 million and was delivered in June. The platform processed contract terms, exchanged digital documents and provided real-time cargo visibility, it added. “The bulk commodity industry needs a digital revolution to reduce physical documentation processes,” said BHP sales and marketing officer Michiel Hovers. Last month, the world’s top listed miner BHP said it had made its first yuan-denominated sale of iron ore to China Baoshan Iron & Steel, known as Baosteel and the listed arm of the world’s biggest steelmaker China Baowu Steel Group. BHP added at the time that it expected to complete its first blockchain transaction with the Chinese company soon. Privately-held MineHub Technologies said this was the first of a series of transactions on its blockchain-based platform that would include other industry partners. “Current pandemic events and fraud cases in the commodity trading industry are causing a step-change in the adoption of digital solutions,” said MineHub Chief Executive Arnoud Star Busmann, previously a commodities executive at ING Bank. Canada-based MineHub said it was also developing digital systems for base metals concentrates, structured finance and emissions tracking."

BHP’s Mt Arthur open cut mine, in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, supplies thermal coal used as fuel for power plants, to domestic and international customers. Prices have tumbled this year, slashing BHP’s likely sale price to less than $1 billion, two banking sources said. BHP and U.S. investment bank JP Morgan declined to comment. Australian bank Macquarie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BHP previously said that the thermal coal business is a very small part of their portfolio, contributing about 3% of turnover and said in February that if a good offer came along they would be willing to sell. Activist investor Elliott, which holds a 4.7% stake in the mining company, has pushed for the sale of BHP’s thermal coal assets, which include one third of the Cerrejon mine in Colombia. BHP has also been pressured by green groups and some shareholders to leave any industry associations with policies that fail to match the company’s support for the 2015 Paris climate accord. Rival mining companies have also taken steps to go thermal coal free, with Rio Tinto selling its last coal mines in 2018, and Anglo American considering the spinoff or sale of its South African coal operations within the next two or three years. There is a handful of companies including Australia’s Whitehaven Coal Ltd, China’s Yancoal and India’s Adani Enterprises that have expressed interest in the Mt Arthur mine, the sources said. Sales processes have slowed over the past few months, as government lockdowns to contain the novel coronavirus halted mine visits and due diligence.

40.888593019190374," Australia's top court rejects BHP appeal over tax ruling CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia’s highest court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal by BHP Group against a tax ruling, the latest loss for the global miner over the treatment of profits from commodities sold out of its Singapore marketing hub. BHP said in a statement the decision offered clarity on the interpretation of a technical area of Australian tax rules, and it would pay $87 million in additional taxes for income generated over 2006-2018. The dispute was over whether BHP should pay so-called “top up tax” in Australia on profits made by its Singapore marketing hub from selling coal from an Australian mine owned by the UK side of BHP’s dual-listed structure, BHP Group Plc. The High Court of Australia upheld a federal court ruling that commodities acquired from Australian subsidiaries of BHP Group Plc are subject to “top up tax” in Australia under “controlled foreign company” rules. BHP had argued that its marketing hub in low-tax Singapore creates value, such as by negotiating specialised coal blends, for which extra profits should not be subject to additional tax. The tax office held that profits on commodities dug out of the ground in Australia should be subject to the country’s tax and royalty systems, no matter where they are sold from. The Australian Tax Office said in a statement the court decision finalised the dispute over marketing hub profits, which would be “fully taxed in Australia”. BHP said the additional tax represented less than 0.2% of the about A$71 billion ($46 billion) it had paid in taxes and royalties over the past 10 years. In 2018, BHP settled a separate transfer pricing dispute with the tax office for about A$529 million ($386 million), ending a battle over whether the company had been underpaying tax by basing its marketing arm in Singapore. It also agreed last June to pay the state of Western Australia A$250 million to end a dispute over royalties paid on iron ore shipments, also sold through its Singapore marketing hub.

12.618262095015742," Australia wins appeal against BHP over tax owed by marketing arm MELBOURNE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Australia’s federal court ruled against BHP Group Ltd on Tuesday over whether the global miner should pay tax in Australia on profits made by its marketing arm on the sale of commodities owned by the company’s UK side, BHP Group Plc. BHP, which has a dual sharemarket listing in Australia and the UK, was considering whether to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia, a spokesman said. The tax office says BHP owes A$82 million ($59 million) in “top-up” tax for 2006 to 2015 on sales of commodities, now mostly energy coal, from BHP Group Plc’s Australian subsidiaries, made through the group’s marketing arm, BMAG, according to BHP’s 2018 annual report. As a result of the judgment by the full bench of the Federal Court, 58 percent of BMAG’s profits from the sale of commodities from BHP Group Plc would be subject to Australian for the years since 2006. The judgment overturned an earlier ruling by a tax tribunal that had backed some of BHP’s objections to the tax assessment. The Australian Taxation Office declined to comment on its win on Tuesday, given the case could still be subject to further court action. The fight is separate from a transfer pricing dispute with the tax office which BHP settled last November for about A$529 million, ending a battle over whether the company had been avoiding tax by basing its marketing arm in Singapore. As part of that settlement, from 2020 onward, 100 percent of BMAG’s profits from the sale of Australian commodities from the BHP Group Plc side will be subject to Australian tax.
