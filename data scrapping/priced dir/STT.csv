8.372606076456549," State Street pays $94.3 million to settle U.S., state charges over hidden fund markups (Reuters) - State Street Corp agreed to pay $94.3 million to settle federal and state regulatory charges it routinely overcharged mutual fund customers and other clients over roughly 17 years by adding hidden markups on back-office expenses. Thursday’s settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey resolve allegations that State Street overbilled clients by more than $170 million related to its custody of their assets. The SEC said roughly 5,000 clients incurred more than $110 million of the overcharges when State Street tacked on markups for sending messages through SWIFT, a secured international payments network used by banks and other financial companies. “Fund expenses make a big difference to mutual fund investors and advisers,” Paul Levenson, director of the SEC office in Boston, said in a statement. “They have a right to receive honest information about what they’re paying for.” State Street will pay a $40 million civil fine plus $48.8 million of disgorgement and interest in the SEC settlement, and a $5.5 million civil fine to Massachusetts. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing, and was credited by the SEC for disclosing its conduct and cooperating. State Street previously set aside money to cover both settlements. “We regret these invoicing errors and the impact on our clients,” State Street said in a statement. State Street is one of the world’s largest custodial banks, which provide services such as accounting, asset valuations, currency trading, portfolio servicing and stock lending. The Boston-based company had $32.6 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of March 31, as well as $2.81 trillion of assets under management. State Street said it began reviewing customer invoices in 2015, and has since reimbursed most customers affected by the overcharges, while also improving its billing processes. It has said it was cooperating with probes by the U.S. Department of Justice’s civil and criminal divisions into its invoicing, which Thursday’s settlements do not cover. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July 2016, State Street agreed to pay $530 million to settle regulatory probes and private lawsuits claiming it overcharged clients on foreign currency transactions."

Ross McLellan, 46, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston after a federal jury in June found the one-time State Street executive vice president guilty of charges including conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud. “The issue here is you can’t lie,” Sorokin said. “Truth matters. You can’t tell people you’re going to charge one thing and charge another.” Prosecutors had sought five years in prison, saying McLellan oversaw a scheme that defrauded institutional clients including Irish, British and Dutch pension funds and the Kuwait Investment Authority out of millions of dollars. McLellan’s lawyers sought a one-year prison sentence. In court, McLellan asked Sorokin for mercy, saying the case had hurt his family and ended his career. “It pains me to be here,” he said. “It is obviously an extremely difficult time for my family.” The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six customers mark-ups on certain transactions. In 2017, Boston-based State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement. Prosecutors said that from 2010 to 2011, McLellan with others conspired to add secret commissions to trades made for six customers using the bank’s “transition management” business. The service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios. The goal is minimizing costs of transitioning the investments. Two former State Street executives, Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt, pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme and testified against McLellan at his trial. Boomgaardt was sentenced to probation in July. Pennings has yet to be sentenced. Prosecutors also claimed McLellan defrauded a unit of insurance company AXA SA by applying hidden fees to trades conducted on its behalf. Jurors acquitted McLellan on that charge. Another ex-State Street employee, Kevin Walker, was also charged over the AXA scheme.

-14.636004462189462," Oilfield service giants miss earnings forecasts despite soaring U.S. production (Reuters) - Oilfield service giants Schlumberger and General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes missed second quarter revenue forecasts on Friday as slow international growth offset record production in the United States that boosted domestic demand for their services. The Houston-based companies were the first among their peers to report earnings, putting them under scrutiny from analysts seeking clues about the health of the industry. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services firm, is viewed a as bellwether for the global oil and gas industry due to its heavy international exposure. Schlumberger’s overall revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter to $8.30 billion, missing analysts’ estimate of $8.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from Schlumberger’s international business dragged the overall performance down: it grew 4 percent in the quarter to $5.07 billion, but remained 1.4 percent below a year ago. GE’s Baker Hughes reported total revenue of $5.55 billion, versus analysts’ forecasts of $5.57 billion, according to I/B/E/S. Baker Hughes’ revenues were hurt by its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses. The performances reflect how a relatively slow recovery in international markets, where oil projects are often more costly, continues to drag down earnings for large integrated service firms, even as surging U.S. production helps. U.S. oil production last week hit a record 11 million barrels per day, marking a dramatic comeback in an industry that had been hard hit by the 2014 oil price crash. Wall Street analysts were not fazed by the missed estimates, and instead focused their attention on stronger-than-expected sequential growth in international markets and upbeat comments from executives. “Both companies were much more optimistic about the global land and offshore recovery than in previous conference calls,” said James West, a senior managing director for investment banking firm Evercore ISI. Shares of Schlumberger were trading at $66.86 in afternoon trade, off a fraction of a percent. Baker Hughes was up about 0.8 percent at $32.04. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, topped $80 a barrel in the second quarter, its strongest level in roughly three and a half years amid an effort by major oil producers to cut production and stabilize prices and supply disruptions. Schlumberger said it expected to fully utilize its international equipment in the fourth quarter of this year and forecasted double digit growth in that segment next year. “The broader-based recovery has finally started,” Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on the company’s conference call. Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said his firm was seeing positive indications from a number of international markets and that longer-cycle activity should drive growth in its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses going forward. “This is what people have been looking for - the inflection in the international business. It is starting to materialize now,” said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, referencing the firm’s sequential growth. Revenue from Schlumberger’s North America operations jumped about 43 percent to $3.14 billion. Both companies said they have yet to see the impacts of pipeline constraints in the Permian, where growing production is quickly outpacing available takeaway capacity. Schlumberger warned the constraints could slow growth in the coming months, but said it plans to continue deploying hydraulic fracturing fleets. The bottlenecks have sent the price of local crude down to an almost $15 a barrel discount to benchmark prices at Cushing, Oklahoma. Revenues in GE’s Baker Hughes’ oilfield services unit, which accounts for more than half of its overall sales, rose 14 percent year over year to approximately $2.9 billion, driven by stronger activity in North America. Last month conglomerate General Electric said it would divest its stake in Baker Hughes in a bid to simplify its business and boost shareholder returns, less than a year after merging with the services firm."

U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin scheduled McLellan’s sentencing for Oct. 10. “We’re disappointed in the verdict and optimistic in an appeal that will include an enormous amount of significant issues, some of which are virtually unprecedented,” said Martin Weinberg, McLellan’s lawyer. McLellan is one four ex-employees of the Boston-based bank who since 2016 have faced U.S. charges that they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars. Two of those former executives - Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt - pleaded guilty in 2017.

-9.05055118918372," Ex-State Street executive pulled 'bait-and-switch' on clients: U.S. prosecutor BOSTON (Reuters) - A former State Street Corp STT.N executive engaged in ""bait-and switch"" by promising to charge several of the bank's clients low fees to execute billions of dollars of trades before secretly applying commissions to them, a U.S. prosecutor said on Monday. Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president, sought to defraud customers including Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund and European pension funds out of millions of dollars, prosecutor William Johnston told a federal jury in Boston. In his closing argument following three weeks of trial, Johnston said the evidence showed McLellan from 2010 to 2011 directed employees to charge customers the hidden commissions in order to “secretly pick the pockets of State Street’s clients.” He said that McLellan, with the help of two other executives who testified against him at trial, overcharged the customers despite the bank promising them low fees and to act in their best interest. “At its the heart, it was one of the oldest and most basic frauds out there: bait-and-switch,” said Johnston, an attorney with the U.S. Justice Department. But Martin Weinberg, McLellan’s lawyer, said his client never intended to defraud anyone and believed the mark-ups were allowed under the customers’ contracts. He urged jurors to discredit the testimony of the prosecution’s star witnesses, Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt, the two other State Street executives who pleaded guilty in 2017. Weinberg said both men saw McLellan as their “ticket to freedom” as they had agreed to testify against him in hopes of leniency at sentencing, a fact that had “corrupted” their testimony in the securities fraud trial. “If you don’t trust them, the government’s case falls,” Weinberg said. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement.

-10.386905044898068," Ex-State Street executive cheated clients with secret fees: U.S. prosecutor BOSTON (Reuters) - A former State Street Corp STT.N executive directed a fraudulent scheme to overcharge several of the bank's clients, including Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund, by applying secret commissions to billions of dollars' worth of trades, a U.S. prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday. Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president, worked with others to overcharge customers using hidden fees that allowed State Street to earn millions of dollars, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Frank told a federal jury in Boston. In his opening statement at the trial’s start, Frank said McLellan, 46, and other executives overcharged customers despite promises the bank made to its large institutional clients that it would charge them low fees and act in their best interests. “They lied to separate their clients from their money,” he said. Frank said McLellan carried out the scheme with the help of two other executives, Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt, who pleaded guilty in 2017 and agreed to testify against McLellan in hopes of receiving lenient sentences. But Martin Weinberg, McLellan’s lawyer, said his client was innocent of the securities fraud and wire fraud charges he faces and that if anyone carried out a crime, it was Pennings and Boomgaardt alone. He contended the two had a powerful incentive to change their stories because of their plea deals. “Truth is the first casualty of this sort of cynical agreement,” he said. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement. In his opening statement, Frank told jurors that McLellan worked with Pennings and Boomgaardt from 2010 to 2011 to add the secret commissions for trades made for the six clients, which were using the bank’s “transition management” business. The service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move their investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios with the objective of minimizing the costs of transitioning the investments. The six clients included the Kuwait Investment Authority, one of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds, and Irish, British and Dutch pension funds. Frank said McLellan also defrauded a New York-based unit of insurance company AXA SAAXAF.PA by applying hidden fees to trades conducted on its behalf."

Jury selection wrapped up on Monday in Boston federal court in the case of Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president at the bank accused of committing securities fraud and wire fraud. Lawyers will deliver their opening statements on Tuesday. McLellan is one four former employees of the Boston-based bank who have since 2016 faced charges by the U.S. Justice Department that they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars. Two of those former executives - Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt - pleaded guilty in 2017 and are expected to testify at the trial, according to court papers. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Frank said Boomgaardt would be the first witness. McLellan, 46, pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. “What he denies is that any unlawful or improper commissions were charged,” Martin Weinberg, McLellan’s lawyer, said in court prior to jury selection. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. In January 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement.

The six clients included a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund and Irish and British government pension funds, according to court papers. Prosecutors allege that McLellan also participated in a separate scheme to apply hidden fees to fixed-income trades conducted for funds advised by a New York-based insurer, resulting in about $700,000 in overcharges."

-10.722422237293218," Ex-State Street employee accused by U.S. of defrauding insurer BOSTON (Reuters) - A former State Street Corp employee in Massachusetts was arrested on Friday and charged with participating in a scheme to defraud an insurance company by applying hidden fees to fixed income trades conducted for funds advised by the insurer. Kevin Walker, an ex-vice president at State Street, was charged in a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Boston with conspiring to commit wire fraud as part of a scheme involving a former executive already under indictment. That person is Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president at the Boston-based bank accused of defrauding clients by charging them secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades. Prosecutors in February unveiled a revised indictment that added a new allegation that McLellan with others sought to defraud a New York-based insurance company, the same one now at issue in Walker’s case. McLellan, who is scheduled to face trial in June, has pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Walker, 43, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case brought to four the number of former State Street employees who have since 2016 been accused by federal prosecutors in Boston of participating in schemes to fleece the bank’s clients. The cases followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. State Street in January 2017 agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations. Prosecutors accused McLellan and two other executives, Richard Boomgaardt and Edward Pennings, of conspiring to add secret commissions for trades performed for six clients of the bank’s “transition management” business in 2010 and 2011. That unit helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or liquidate investment portfolios, prosecutors said. Walker during much of his time at State Street from 2004 to 2015 was likewise assigned to that unit. Friday’s complaint said that in 2011 Walker participated in a scheme with McLellan and another unnamed State Street employee to defraud the insurance company through inflated trading commissions. The scheme caused the insurance company and the funds it advised to be secretly overcharged by more than $800,000, the complaint said. Boomgaardt and Pennings pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. State Street said it is cooperating with authorities. The case is U.S. v. Walker, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-mj-07160."
