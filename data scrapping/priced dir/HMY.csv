Harmony said it was on track to meet its annual gold production guidance of between 1.26 million ounces and 1.3 million ounces after producing 745,347 ounces in the six months ended December. Mponeng mine, the deepest in the world, and related assets have contributed 103,525 ounces to the group since it assumed full ownership from rival AngloGold Ashanti in October."

Harmony agreed in February to buy rival AngloGold Ashanti’s assets in South Africa, including Mponeng, the world’s deepest gold mine, for about $300 million. Every sale in the mining industry in South Africa must be approved by the ministry under mineral resources rules in accordance with Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development regulations. “The Department can confirm that an application in terms of Section 11 of the MPRDA has been received and was approved on 24 July,” the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) said via email. The ministry said the granting of the application was based on a understanding between AngloGold Ashanti and the department that the company would not disinvest from the South African economy by delisting from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) or relocate its headquarters. AngloGold had said in February it would consider moving its primary listing on the JSE as it streamlines its portfolio. But in August the company said moving its listing was no longer a priority amid the pandemic. AngloGold said on Wednesday it had not yet received all necessary approvals and was still in talks with government. “We remain in dialogue with the DMRE in relation to these, and will make the necessary disclosures once those engagements are concluded,” AngloGold Ashanti said. Harmony Gold said: “We are continuing to engage with the DMRE and hope to conclude the transaction as soon as possible”.

-18.006994654524913," Harmony Gold sees margin doubling as gold price surges JOHANNESBURG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - South African gold miner Harmony Gold on Wednesday said it sees production recovering to pre-coronavirus lockdown levels around the end of August and that it expects a soaring gold price to double its margin. The miner, which has around 5,500 migrant workers who returned to their home countries during lockdown, said “while they have started returning, Harmony will only return to pre-lockdown production levels towards the end of August 2020.” Harmony’s gold production, at 37,863 kg, was 15% lower in the financial year to June 30 than in the previous 12 months, mainly due to South Africa’s lockdown, the company said. Lower production will drive up all-in sustaining costs across its operations by between 17% and 19% in Rand terms, Harmony said. But the miner expected to benefit from a soaring gold price, saying its operating free cash flow margin could double from 7% to between 13% and 15%. The gold price was 25% higher in Rand terms this financial year, Harmony said, while the increase in dollar terms was 14%. South African gold miners have rallied recently as investors rush to buy shares in the export-oriented companies which do well when the Rand depreciates against the dollar.

Harmony agreed in February to buy rival AngloGold Ashanti’s assets in South Africa, including the world’s deepest gold mine the Mponeng mine, for about $300 million.

The details of the share sale, which is being done through a placement of ordinary shares, such as the closing date, the price of shares and allocations to investors will be decided in due course, Harmony said in a statement. All South African miners, except those mining coal, were hurt by a month-long lockdown in April as the government tried to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The miners were allowed to operate with a workforce of 50% from May and 100% from June, under strict social distancing guidelines. The relaxation helped Harmony increase its gold sales from the South African operations from approximately 1 tonne in April to approximately 1.7 tonnes in May, it said. Shares of most gold mining companies have surged in the last few months as fears of a global economic slowdown pushed investors’ money into safe-haven gold."

Mines in South Africa were forced to shut temporarily when a nationwide lockdown to contain the virus began in late March. Open-cast mines have been allowed to work at full capacity since May 1, though deep-level mines - where social distancing is more difficult - were restricted to operating at 50% until the government allowed full capacity to resume from June 1.

AngloGold said in February it would sell the assets, including Mponeng mine the world’s deepest gold mine, for about $300 million to Harmony turning it into the country’s largest gold producer.

Mining operations were halted as South Africa went into a five-week lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. From May 1, mines have been allowed to start operations with 50% of their workforce. “Due to the impact of COVID-19 and the continued uncertainty as to when our mines will be allowed to return to full production, we have decided to withdraw our annual production guidance,” Harmony Gold said in a statement.

123.12926935075772," South Africa's Harmony Gold to resume reduced operations during coronavirus lockdown JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s Harmony Gold said on Monday it will resume operations up to 50% capacity after the government relaxed regulations on miners during the coronavirus lockdown. South Africa said on Thursday it would allow mines to operate at up to half capacity after it had previously ordered most underground mines and furnaces to be put on care and maintenance, apart from coal mines supplying state power utility Eskom. The bullion miner said it expects it to take up to five working days to restart its underground operations. “We are grateful that we can start up our underground mines and undertake to do so responsibly. Every possible mitigating and preventative process, procedure and control has been adopted to ensure that we start-up in a safe, controlled and accountable manner,” said chief executive officer Peter Steenkamp. The company said operating free cash flow margin is expected to rise by around 55% for the quarter ended March 31 compared with the previous quarter due to a rise in the gold price. Total gold production quarter on quarter was expected to be 8% lower, due largely to the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown announced on March 23 and the usual slower start-up after the Christmas break. Harmony said it had suspended exploration and major capital projects, embarked on cash preservation and rolled forward the majority of its hedge transactions maturing from mid April to the end of May to protect its balance sheet during the pandemic. The miner, which also has operations in Papua New Guinea, said it had taken the measures after declaring force majeure on select supplier agreements and cutting production. The lockdown, which started on March 27 and has been extended until the end of April, has hit global commodities markets since several local miners have cut their production plans or declared force majeure, which exonerates them from contractual obligations."

19.93466832942903," AngloGold shifts focus as it sells South African assets to Harmony JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - AngloGold Ashanti ANGJ.J said on Wednesday it would sell its remaining South African assets for about $300 million to Harmony Gold HARJ.J, turning the buyer into the country's largest gold producer. AngloGold said the deal, part of its plan to shrink its portfolio and focus on assets with higher returns so it can shift its primary listing to London or Toronto, included selling Mponeng mine, the world’s deepest gold mine. AngloGold will receive cash and deferred payment totaling about $300 million subject to subsequent performance, with additional proceeds due if Harmony developed the West Wits mines below the existing mining infrastructure. Alongside Mponeng mine, the sale includes a surface rock dump processing business and a mine waste retreatment operation. AngloGold retains its interest in Rand Refinery and its obligations under the Silicosis Class Action Settlement, a legal battle by miners seeking compensation for illnesses they blame on negligence in health and safety. Harmony, which bought South Africa’s Moab Khotsong mine in 2018, said it planned to focus on the above infrastructure. “At this point in time, we have made no decision to go down below infrastructure,” Harmony Chief Executive Peter Steenkamp said, adding further development was unlikely to involve a vertical shaft even though “there is a massive resource below infrastructure.” Harmony, which also has operations in Papua New Guinea, said acquiring AngloGold’s assets provided a strategic, financial, operational and geographical fit. “The acquisition has the potential to improve our overall recovered grade and increasing our cash flow margins,” Steenkamp said, adding that it would increase annual gold production by around 350,000 ounces a year. AngloGold said Harmony was identified as the most suitable party to buy these assets during the nine-month sales process, citing its financial capacity and ability to operate ultra-deep, hard-rock mining assets in South Africa. Rival Sibanye-Stillwater SGJ.J had also made an offer. Unions at the operations, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Solidarity, welcomed the choice of Harmony. “At the same time we are disappointed that AngloGold Ashanti decided to disinvest from South Africa. They are now a global company because of the profits they made in South Africa,” NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said. Harmony said it had no plans for job cuts at the operations which employ around 6000 people. The mining industry has battled rising costs, safety concerns and operational obstacles in mines that sometimes operate more that 3 km (1.9 miles) below the surface. AngloGold, which sold its stake in the Sadiola project in Mali for $105 million, said in May it would review divestment options for its South African assets, paving the way for it to move its primary listing. AngloGold also flagged headline earnings per share, the main profit measure in South Africa, for the year to December of 86 cents to 96 cents, up from 53 cents in 2018. The transaction, subject to approvals by the mining ministry and competition watchdog, could be completed by June 30."

25.270762231895183," Harmony Gold's rebounding profits give hunt for acquisitions fresh impetus JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s Harmony Gold Mining reported a rebound in interim profits on Tuesday on the back of rising gold prices and said it was looking for acquisitions in its home market, elsewhere in Africa and Papua New Guinea. CEO Peter Steenkamp said Harmony was in talks with parties about acquisitions but would not comment on whether they included AngloGold Ashanti’s sole remaining operation in South Africa, the world’s deepest gold mine. Harmony and precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater have both previously expressed interest in acquiring AngloGold Ashanti’s Mponeng mine in South Africa, as AngloGold looks to exit the country and pursue higher returns elsewhere. “We are continuously looking at potential acquisitions and growth opportunities in both South Africa, Papua New Guinea and also, the rest of Africa,” Steenkamp said. Harmony would not shy away from deep level mining but would look for assets with at least a million ounces of reserves, at least 10 years of life and all-in-sustaining cost of round about a $1000/ounce, he said. “We do have the expertise and the ability to run underground mines, so we will not necessarily shy away from underground mines,” he said. AngloGold’s CEO Kelvin Dushnisky told Reuters last week that the miner would update the market later this month on the progress of the sale. Harmony reported headline earnings per share, the main profit measure used in South Africa, of 249 cents for the six months ended Dec. 31, rebounding from a loss of 4 cents in the same period a year ago. Earnings were boosted by a 19% climb in the group’s average gold price during the six months, although it also faced production cuts in South Africa due to nationwide power cuts, and rising operating costs. Harmony said it had to cancel both a night and day shift in South Africa after state utility Eskom imposed power cuts at short notice, resulting in a production loss of around 80 kilograms to 90 kilograms in December. The group’s total production costs worldwide rose 9% in July-December because of annual and inflationary increases, higher labour costs and increased electricity costs among other factors, it said. Gold production for the six months fell 8% due to a reduction in underground recovered grade mainly at its Kusasalethu operations, as well as the cutbacks in South Africa. In Papua New Guinea, Harmony’s joint gold-copper project with Australia’s Newcrest Mining Ltd, the Wafi-Golpu project, has hit problems after the Papua New Guinea government said in September that it wants to keep 40% of gold produced from the project. The proposed policy changes are part of a push by the South Pacific archipelago to transform its mineral-rich economy amid a perceived lack of benefits flowing from resources projects back to communities. Newcrest said on Tuesday that the Papua New Guinea national court had dismissed a stay order on work relating to the project, paving the way for talks to resume on it with the Pacific country’s government. “As we go forward then, we will start to renegotiate the terms of the Wafi-Golpu,” Steenkamp said."

Harmony Gold called off its underground shifts, saying it would resume as soon as state power company Eskom could provide assurance power supply would be more reliable. Impala Platinum has shut production at its Rustenberg and Marula mines owing to power cuts that have left it functioning at 20%-30% of normal power, a spokesman said on Tuesday. The platinum miner was using electricity only for essential maintenance, he added, saying: “We certainly can’t risk any attempt at production with this level of power.” Sibanye-Stillwater shut all its deep-level mines on Monday, a spokesman said, but aimed to send miners back underground for the afternoon shift on Tuesday.

5.797091480114116," Lonmin warns on cash woes, urges shareholders to back Sibanye takeover (Reuters) - Platinum miner Lonmin does not have sufficient liquidity to fund the new projects needed to avoid shaft closures and job losses, it said on Monday as it urged shareholders to back its proposed takeover by Sibanye-Stillwater. The London-listed company, crippled by soaring costs and subdued platinum prices, has been cutting spending to conserve cash and retain a positive balance sheet required by conditions of South Africa-based Sibanye’s offer. However, progress on all fronts has been slow against the backdrop of strikes by South Africa’s Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) in a long-running pay dispute. AMCU, which has been on strike at Sibanye-Stillwater’s gold operations since mid-November, wanted to extend the strike to at least 11 other companies including Anglo American’s gold and platinum operations, Harmony Gold and Lonmin. However, South Africa’s labor court rejected AMCU’s request this month. “The challenges facing Lonmin and the industry persist,” Lonmin said in a statement ahead of what is likely to be a fiery AGM in London on Monday. “This is why your board, recommends the all-share offer from Sibanye-Stillwater.” Despite “new and prudent measures” to refinance the business with a previously announced $200 million facility, Lonmin said it remains “financially constrained and unable to fund the significant investment required to sustain our business and associated employment in the future”. Lonmin added that poor production and correspondingly high unit costs have continued in its second quarter this year, largely offsetting the benefits of improved prices of platinum group metals. Lonmin shares were up 8.4 percent at 76.9 pence at 1242 GMT."
7.006367363649738," UPDATE 2-Profit drops, mining deaths spike at South Africa's Harmony Gold * Deaths in Harmony mines spike to 13 in FY2018 vs 5 in 2017 * CEO says people fired over incident that killed five * Earnings fall, hit by impairments (Updates with CEO comments on safety) JOHANNESBURG, Aug 21 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Harmony Gold reported a 43 percent fall in annual earnings on Tuesday, hurt by impairments and a loss relating to debt denominated in U.S. dollars, and a setback to its safety record. The gold industry in South Africa, which has produced a third of the bullion mined in history and is home to the world’s deepest mines, has been squeezed for years by depressed prices and soaring labour, power and operational costs. The challenges faced by the sector, which is mostly labour-intensive and non-mechanised, were underscored by a spike in the number of Harmony workers killed during the financial year, to 13 from five in the previous year. Safety is a huge issue in South Africa’s deep and dangerous mines and a concern for investors. A spate of deaths at Sibanye-Stillwater’s gold operations, including a seismic event that killed seven miners in early May, has raised red flags and brought the issue into focus. There was a rise in mining deaths overall in South Africa in 2017 to more than 80 from 73 in the previous year, ending nine straight years of falling fatalities. In one incident last August at Harmony’s Kusasalethu operation west of Johannesburg, which fell under the 2018 financial year, five miners were killed when a support pillar burst at a depth of around 3 kms (2 miles). “We fired people over the incident ... We are taking action,” Chief Executive Peter Steenkamp told Reuters. But he admitted more needed to be done and that more could be done despite the constraints of an unforgiving geology that makes mechanisation extremely difficult and the inherent risks of deep-level mining. “I firmly believe that eventually we will have a way of automating more things for example through robotics,” Steenkamp said. Harmony is also rolling out a network of permanent safety netting in the tunnel roofs to help prevent falls of rock, a common danger. Headline earnings per share - the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items - came in at 171 cents, in line with what it had previously flagged to the market, from 298 cents a year earlier. Harmony produced 1.22 million ounces of gold in the 2018 financial year and said its 2019 target was 1.45 million ounces."
