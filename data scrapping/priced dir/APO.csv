11.482791695672757," Breakingviews - Clayton’s new Apollo role is a non-spicy jalapeño NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apollo Global Management is spicing up its board of directors, sort of. The private equity firm founded by Leon Black has appointed former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton as lead independent director. The role is sometimes used by U.S. companies as a sort of governance half-way house. In this case, it lets Apollo delay a full separation from Black, which is what it needs most. Black’s decision to step down as chief executive reached investors on the same day Apollo unveiled an investigation into his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But he is keeping the title of chair and his successor as CEO is Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, so it’s hardly a clean break. In the buyout firm’s statement on Thursday, it’s Black and not Rowan whose praise for Clayton appears first. By putting its governance in the hands of a lead independent director, Apollo is in good company. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have similar positions, to counterbalance chief executives who are also chairmen. JPMorgan recently replaced Lee Raymond, after more than three decades on the bank’s board, with Stephen Burke, a director for almost two decades. In that sense, Clayton stands out as truly independent, and a fresh pair of eyes. His most recent experience is as a regulatory enforcer focused on governance. The question is whether Clayton can stand his ground against two long-serving insiders, and in this case founders. His recent track record isn’t exactly one of creating friction. Clayton was one of the few Donald Trump appointees who didn’t quit before the former U.S. president’s term ended. While he took on Tesla CEO Elon Musk over tweets to take the electric-car maker private, he also rolled back rules, like disclosure requirements on legal proceedings, in a way that benefited his regulatory wards. Clayton’s appointment gives Apollo a new voice in the boardroom, but it also makes it possible for the firm to defer Black’s exit. With Apollo’s stock underperforming peers including KKR and Blackstone over the past year, Apollo is only prolonging what could be its most important governance step yet."
11.482791695672757," Apollo taps ex-SEC chief Clayton in board overhaul (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc said on Thursday it had appointed former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief Jay Clayton as its lead independent director to improve corporate governance in the wake of an inquiry into Chairman Leon Black’s ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The review found that Black, who co-founded Apollo 31 years ago and turned it into one of the world’s largest private equity firms, had paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017. While the probe, which was carried out by law firm Dechert LLP, cleared Black of any wrongdoing, he said last month he would relinquish his role as chief executive by July and keep his role as board chairman. Clayton was selected due to his professional experience and understanding of private and public capital markets, Apollo said. He will assume the newly created role on March 1. Apollo said last month it would look into changing its corporate governance structure, getting rid of shares with special voting rights that currently give Black and other co-founders effective control of the firm. The firm also added two new independent directors. Clayton was SEC chairman from May 2017 to December 2020. In that role he pursued changes to regulations that critics saw as burdensome or hindering corporate growth, often in the face of opposition from investor advocates. Before that, Clayton was a corporate deals lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell. The Trump administration nominated Clayton last summer to replace a top federal prosecutor in New York, but did not press on with his appointment. Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor, said that Clayton would have the heft to stand up to Black and other Apollo controlling partners if something “doesn’t square with his spidey sense.” “If anyone can establish their independence in a controlled company it would be someone like Jay Clayton,” Talley said. Clayton will earn about $500,000 annually through equity and fees for his service, according to a regulatory filing. Such compensation is high for a lead independent director, said Dan Laddin, a founding partner at consulting firm Compensation Advisory Partners LLC. “He’s getting paid more akin to a non-executive chairman,” Laddin said. Clayton is one of the most high-profile additions to Apollo since the 2014 departure of Marc Spilker, who was recruited as the firm’s president months after leaving Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Spilker left Apollo abruptly without any explanation. The revelations of Black’s ties to Epstein led the firm’s executives to warn in October that some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo’s funds as they awaited the review’s findings. The company, however, said in January that despite the controversy, its assets under management grew by $22 billion in the final quarter of 2020 to $455 billion."

15.626771167950734," Apollo-backed low-cost airline Sun Country files for U.S. IPO (Reuters) - Sun Country Airlines, an ultra low-cost air carrier backed by private-equity giant Apollo Global Management Inc, filed for an initial public offering on Monday, banking on a rebound in air travel as countries roll out vaccines against COVID-19. Minnesota-based Sun Country, which offers affordable flights and vacation packages to destinations across the United States and in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, said it would list its stock on the Nasdaq under they symbol “SNCY”. Founded in 1982 by Jim Olsen and a small group of pilots and flight attendants, Sun Country began flight operations in 1983 with a single Boeing 727-200 aircraft. The airline, which has been bought and sold a few times over the years, was forced to declare bankruptcy after the Sept. 11 2001, attacks on the United States and was hurt again by the recession of 2008 and the revelation of financial fraud. The airline, a contract cargo operator for Amazon Air, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in 2008. The company was eventually bought by Apollo in 2017. Sun Country’s IPO comes as U.S. capital markets are poised for another banner year, with January’s IPO haul totaling $33.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The company reported operating revenue of $293.7 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, from $537.5 million a year earlier. “With the expectation that recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines will be widely distributed in 2021, we believe the airline industry will rebound in the back half of 2021 and normalize in 2022,” the company said in its filing. Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs and Nomura are among underwriters for Sun Country’s offering."
9.210302486923116," Apollo-backed SPAC upsizes offering, looks to raise $500 mln Feb 4 (Reuters) - A blank-check firm, backed by private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc, upsized its offering and is now looking to raise $500 million through an initial public offering (IPO), a regulatory filing showed on Thursday. Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II aims to sell 50 million units, composed of shares and warrants, at $10 per unit. The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) had earlier planned to raise $400 million, by selling 40 million units at $10 per unit. SPACs, or blank check firms, are shell companies which raise funds through an IPO to take a private company public through a merger. For the private company, it is an alternative route to enter the public markets and has gained immense popularity in recent times. Apollo Global has raised hundreds of millions through multiple blank-check companies to date. Some of Apollo’s SPACs have already landed deals. Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp, an Apollo-backed SPAC, took electric vehicle maker Fisker Inc public last year for $2.9 billion. Deutsche Bank Securities, Barclays and Credit Suisse are the lead underwriters for the offering. (Reporting by Sohini Podder in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)"
11.16015228880308," Apollo's fourth-quarter earnings fall as asset sales slow (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc reported on Wednesday that fourth-quarter distributable earnings fell 30% from a year earlier, amid a slowdown in its divestment of private equity assets. The decline was smaller than analysts expected partly because of gains in Apollo’s real estate and credit holdings. Rival Blackstone Group Inc last month reported a 60% rise in fourth-quarter distributable earnings. Last week, Apollo’s Chief Executive Officer Leon Black said he would step down after the firm investigated his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Black was cleared of any wrongdoing but announced he would retire by July and only keep his role as chairman. Apollo’s lower earnings were not tied to Black’s investigation though some investors held back on new fund commitments as they awaited the results. The firm said assets under management increased $22 billion in the fourth quarter to $455.5 billion. Marc Rowan, Apollo’s co-founder who will succeed Black as CEO, said he expected fundraising to pick up after the vast majority of its institutional investors said they were satisfied with recent changes at the firm, including the expansion of the board to include four new independent directors. Apollo’s shares traded at $49.82 per share, up 1.9%, in afternoon trading in New York. Apollo’s earnings drop was driven by its cashing out much less on companies it owns, resulting in a 92% drop in performance fees in its private equity business. Distributable earnings (DE), the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders, fell to $317.4 million from $454.9 million a year earlier. Apollo’s DE per share of 72 cents, surpassed the average analyst forecast of 50 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Apollo said its private equity portfolio appreciated 13% during the fourth quarter, while real estate, principal finance and infrastructure funds climbed 3.1% in aggregate. Its corporate credit and structured credit funds rose 4.2% and 5.9%, respectively. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Apollo reported a net income of $424.9 million, which includes the mark-to-market value of its assets. This was up 170% year-on-year, because of the appreciation of Apollo’s funds. Apollo ended the quarter with $46.8 billion in unspent capital. It declared a quarterly dividend of 60 cents per share.

17.58391073221309," Apollo can't use bankruptcy court to block litigation over LightSquared investments The New York judge who oversaw the bankruptcy of wireless venture LightSquared has rejected Apollo Global Management’s attempt to reopen the nine-year-old Chapter 11 case to fend off litigation from hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, which in 2008 bought LightSquared’s predecessor from Apollo. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan issued her ruling at the conclusion of a remote hearing on Monday, finding that because Apollo was not a player in the company’s reorganization, it was not entitled to protection afforded by the reorganization plan she confirmed in 2015. Apollo, represented by O’Melveny & Myers, sought the relief after Harbinger filed a lawsuit in New York state court last year accusing it and former LightSquared executives of duping it into investing $1.9 billion into the company before the bankruptcy.

16.640527975528602," Japan's Showa Denko to sell aluminium business to Apollo TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Showa Denko KK said on Thursday it would sell its aluminium business to U.S. investment fund Apollo Global Management as the materials maker steps up efforts to divest assets. Specifically, Showa Denko said it plans to sell its aluminium rolling business for electronic components as well as the aluminium can business. The company did not disclose details of the deal, but it is expected to be valued around 50 billion yen ($480.31 million), a source briefed on the matter said. The divestiture is part of the company’s business portfolio overhaul following the $9.2 billion acquisition last year of Hitachi Chemical, a supplier of materials for semiconductors, displays and lithium-ion batteries. Global private equity firms such as Apollo, KKR and Carlyle Group have been looking to expand in Japan, taking advantage of large Japanese companies coming under pressure to sell non-core assets and improve returns to shareholders. Japanese cosmetics firm Shiseido Co Ltd said last week it was in talks to sell its lower-priced skincare and shampoo brands to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners."
17.306919649881454," Apollo Global Management's shares surge on resignation of CEO Black (This 26 January story corrects to remove erroneous reference to Brown not being a member of the CalPERS investment committee) NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc shares surged more than 7% on Tuesday after the resignation of CEO Leon Black, which investors viewed as bolstering the private equity firm’s fundraising efforts. Black said on Monday he was stepping down after an investigation into his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The independent review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in Epstein’s criminal activities. But it concluded Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, a decision that Black said he regretted. Apollo executives said in October that some investors had paused their commitments to the buyout firm’s funds as they awaited the review’s findings. Apollo said on Monday that despite the controversy, its assets under management grew by $22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $455 billion. Analysts said on Tuesday the conclusion of the review and Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan taking over from Black as CEO could prompt some investors to proceed with commitments to Apollo’s funds that they had previously suspended. “The news does clear much uncertainty,” Citi analysts wrote in a note. “We view the update collectively as a net positive for investors, but potentially not yet enough closure to fully step in.” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that Rowan’s work building Apollo’s insurance business has been “the main growth engine for the firm.” The analysts added that changes to its governance structure, including nixing special voting rights for founders, would be positive for the stock price. Margaret Brown, a board member at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), said she still wanted the roughly $400 billion pension plan, the largest in the United States, to consider halting future investments to Apollo. “I will raise the issue in closed session with the board and hope to have a discussion in open session as well,” said Brown. A majority of CalPERS’ board would have to approve such a decision. “We expect and demand the companies and executives we do business with to act ethically and with prudent judgment at all times,” CalPERS said in a prepared statement. CalPERS declined to comment on whether they will authorize new investment in Apollo’s funds. Despite Tuesday’s rise, Apollo shares are down 10% over the last 12 months. By comparison, shares of peers Blackstone Group Inc and KKR & Co Inc are up 5% and 29%, respectively."
12.173965222408487," Leon Black step downs as Apollo CEO after review of Epstein ties NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black said on Monday he would step down as chief executive at Apollo Global Management Inc, following an independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While Black, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $8.2 billion, will remain Apollo’s chairman, his decision to step down illustrates how doing business with Epstein weighed on the reputation of one of Wall Street’s most prominent investment firms. Black co-founded Apollo 31 years ago. Apollo said it plans to change its corporate governance structure, doing away with shares with special voting rights that currently give Black and other co-founders effective control of the firm. The independent review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in any way with Epstein’s criminal activities. Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, according to the review. Black, 69, said that although the review confirmed he did not engage in any wrongdoing, he “deeply” regretted his involvement with Epstein. “I hope that the results of the review, and related enhancements ... will reaffirm to you that Apollo is dedicated to the highest levels of transparency and governance,” Black wrote in a note to Apollo fund investors. He will step down as CEO no later than July 31. Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, 58, will take over as CEO. Rowan has often kept a low-key profile compared with Apollo’s other co-founder, Joshua Harris, 56, and spearheaded many initiatives that turned Apollo into a credit investment giant, including the permanent capital base the firm enjoys through its ties to reinsurer Athene Holding Ltd. The revelations of Black’s ties to Epstein took a toll on Apollo, which Black turned into one of the world’s largest private equity groups. Apollo executives had warned in October that some investors had paused their commitments to the buyout firm’s funds as they awaited the review’s findings. Apollo shares are down 1% since the New York Times reported on Oct. 12 that Black paid at least $50 million to Epstein for advice and services, when most of his clients had deserted him. Over the same period, shares of peers Blackstone Group Inc, KKR & Co Inc and Carlyle Group Inc are up 19%, 10% and 23%, respectively. “We think a large number of (Apollo fund investors) took a ‘pause’, and we believe the outcome (of the review) and changes today will cause most of them to return to allocating to future Apollo funds,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research note. Apollo shares jumped 4% to $47.65 in after-hours trading on Monday. “We continue to follow these events closely and will evaluate how Apollo addresses its issues,” the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, one of the largest U.S. public pension funds and an Apollo investor, said in a statement. Epstein was found dead at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for allegedly abusing dozens of underage girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. New York City’s chief medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was suicide by hanging. Black previously said he had paid millions of dollars to Epstein, but the exact size of his payments was revealed for the first time on Monday. Beyond the $158 million in payments, Black made two loans to Epstein totaling $30.5 million in early 2017. Dechert said in its report that Black’s social ties with Epstein, who built his fortune by endearing himself to powerful figures in high society, went back to the mid-1990s. Epstein won Black’s trust by resolving an estate tax issue for him in 2012 potentially worth at least $500 million, the report said. He ended up advising Black on various aspects of his personal financial affairs, from his family office and airplane to his yacht and artwork. Black believed that Epstein provided advice over the years that conferred between $1 billion and $2 billion in value to him, according to the Dechert report. Black said in his note to investors that he had paid Epstein a fee equivalent to 5% of the value he generated on an after-tax basis, and not tied to hourly rates. Black and Epstein’s relationship deteriorated after Epstein failed to repay $20 million of the loans and Black refused to pay tens of millions of dollars in fees that Epstein demanded, according to the Dechert report. They severed ties in October 2018, according to the report. Black knew Epstein had been convicted in Florida a decade earlier for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the Dechert report said, but there was no evidence suggesting Black had knowledge of the other alleged crimes before they were publicly reported in late 2018, culminating in Epstein’s July 2019 arrest. On Monday, Black pledged $200 million toward “initiatives that seek to achieve gender equality and protect and empower women,” as well as helping survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking. Apollo said it would pursue a “one share, one vote” corporate governance structure that would do away with shares with special voting rights. It said the move could qualify it for listing on the S&P Global indices. Apollo also said it would seek to give its board more authority to oversee its business, eroding the power of its executive committee led by Black. The board will be expanded to include four new independent directors, including Avid Partners founder Pamela Joyner and physician and scientist Siddhartha Mukherjee, Apollo said. Apollo co-Presidents Scott Kleinman and James Zelter will join the board and take on increased responsibility running day-to-day operations. Apollo had about $433 billion in assets under management as of the end of September."
12.173965222408487," UPDATE 1-Leon Black to step down as Apollo CEO post after Epstein review Leon Black said on Monday he would relinquish his chief executive post at Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) following the buyout firm's independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in any way with Epstein's criminal activities. Black, the review found, paid Epstein bona fide fees for advice on tax and estate planning, and other related services. Nevertheless, Apollo said it would undertake efforts to strengthen its corporate governance to allow the board to oversee ""all aspects"" of the buyout firm and delegate less of that work. Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan will take over as CEO, with Black remaining Apollo's chairman, the firm said. The sudden end to Black's management of Apollo, a New York-based firm he co-founded 31 years ago and turned into one of the world's largest private equity and credit investment groups, reflects the toll that revelations of his ties to Epstein took on the investment firm's business. Apollo executives had warned in October that some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo's funds as they awaited the review's findings. Apollo shares missed out on a stock market rally and are down 1% since the New York Times reported on Oct. 12 that Black paid at least $50 million to Epstein for advice and services, when most of his clients had deserted him. Shares of peers Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N), KKR & Co Inc (KKR.N) and Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) are up 19%, 10% and 23% over that period, respectively. The conflicts committee of Apollo's board pursued the review with Black's support in October. In a letter to Apollo's fund investors earlier that month, Black said he regretted previous business and social relationships with Epstein, while denying any wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct. "

26.050653924383205," Exclusive: Investor group says Apollo director overseeing Epstein review is not independent NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group representing U.S. pension funds says the head of an Apollo Global Management Inc committee overseeing the investigation of CEO Leon Black’s ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is not independent. The group told Reuters that the chairman of the committee, Michael Ducey, was not independent because of his previous dealings with the buyout firm. Ducey was on the board of printing paper manufacturer Verso Paper Corp, which was controlled by Apollo, from May 2006 until July 2016, according to corporate disclosures. The head of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII), which represents pension funds, said it disagreed with Apollo’s characterization of Ducey as an independent board director, because he was on the board of a company owned by the private equity firm less than five years ago. “CII believes a five-year look-back helps avoid conflicts or the appearance of a conflict of interest,” executive director Amy Borrus said in an email. CII, whose members include investors in Apollo’s funds, does not keep track of how many companies adhere to its guidance. It states on its website that its guidelines are not binding on its members or corporations. The New York Stock Exchange, where Apollo is listed, asks companies to consider business relationships going back three years when assessing independence, rather than five as CII recommends. An Apollo spokeswoman said Ducey met the requirements to serve as an independent director set by the New York Stock Exchange as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “We are confident that our practices for director independence are consistent with best practices followed generally by publicly listed companies, including companies in our industry,” the spokeswoman said. Ducey and a spokeswoman for Black did not respond to requests for comment. Black controls Apollo, which he co-founded in 1990 and turned into one of the world’s largest private equity firms. Last week, he asked Ducey and two other Apollo board directors to independently verify that he had not engaged in any wrongdoing. The three directors, who comprise Apollo’s so-called ‘conflicts committee’, hired law firm Dechert LLP to help them with their review. Black said earlier this month that he regretted payments to Epstein of between $50 million and $75 million over the last decade for what he called “professional services.” He was responding to a story in the New York Times, which revealed the payments. The outcome of the probe could determine whether Black continues to lead Apollo. On the firm’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, executives said some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo’s funds as they waited for the findings of the review. “I would have concerns about those ties between the director and Apollo. But the proof will be in how directors handle themselves,” said Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance consultant ValueEdge Advisors. Black said on Thursday that in 2012, three years after Epstein got out of jail following his conviction in Florida on soliciting prostitution from a minor, he retained Epstein for “personal estate planning, tax structuring and philanthropic advice.” He called this decision a “terrible mistake” that he regretted. Epstein was found hanged at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for allegedly abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty. CII is an association representing the interests of pensions funds, foundations and endowments with total assets under management of approximately $4 trillion. Borrus said CII engages with companies to convey shareholder worries, and it had not yet contacted Apollo about its concerns. No Apollo shareholder has spoken out against the firm’s handling of Black’s relationship with Epstein, although some investors in the New York-based firm’s funds have expressed concerns. The Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (PSERS) said last week it would not consider any new investments in Apollo’s funds in the wake of the investigation."
22.72127330829184," Apollo third-quarter earnings drop as CEO faces heat from investors NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc, the private equity firm under investor scrutiny over CEO Leon Black’s ties with late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, reported an 8% drop in third-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday. Distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - fell to $205.1 million from $222.5 million a year earlier, as a big rise in profit in Apollo’s credit businesses was not enough to offset a steep drop in its private equity and real estate divisions. This translated to DE per share of 47 cents, underperforming Wall Street analysts’ average forecast of 49 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. Apollo said last week it would launch an independent review of Black’s payments of between $50 million and $75 million to Epstein over the last decade, as some of the firm’s investors issued statements for the first time expressing concerns. Black wrote to Apollo’s fund investors last week that he regretted payments to Epstein for what he called “professional services,” but has denied any wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct related to his business and social ties with him. The 69-year-old private equity veteran said the payments were for advice on estate planning, taxes and philanthropy. The New York-based firm said on Thursday the value of its credit funds appreciated 3.7% in aggregate in the third quarter, with its private equity portfolio rising 8%. Its real estate, principal finance and infrastructure funds climbed 3.4% in aggregate. Blackstone Group Inc, the world’s largest private equity firm, reported a 9% rise in third-quarter distributable earnings on Wednesday, while its private equity portfolio appreciated by 12.2%. Carlyle Group Inc reported a smaller-than-expected 6% drop in its third-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, with its overall fund portfolio rising 5% during the quarter. Apollo said total assets under management rose to $433.1 billion as of the end of September, up from $414 billion three months earlier. The firm ended the quarter with $45.8 billion in unspent capital. The firm said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share.

22.72127330829184," UPDATE 1-Apollo CEO Black calls giving Epstein a second chance 'a terrible mistake' (Recasts with Black’s comments, analyst note, share reaction) NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc CEO Leon Black said on Thursday that giving Jeffrey Epstein a second chance following the late financier’s imprisonment in 2008 for soliciting an underage prostitute in Florida was a “terrible mistake.” Black gave his most comprehensive account to date of his ties with Epstein on Apollo’s third-quarter earnings call, as he acknowledged that what he has called a personal matter was now affecting the private equity firm he co-founded in 1990 and still controls. Several investors in Apollo’s funds expressed concerns after Black said earlier this month that he regretted payments to Epstein of between $50 million and $75 million over the last decade for what he called “professional services.” “Let me be clear, there has never been an allegation by anyone that I engaged in any wrongdoing, because I did not. Any suggestion of blackmail or any other connection to Epstein’s reprehensible conduct is categorically untrue,” Black said on the call. Black said he first met Epstein in 1996, when the latter was advising prominent clients, including several heads of state, Nobel laureates, and even a U.S. treasury secretary. The 69-year-old private equity veteran said he was not aware of Epstein’s criminal conduct until media reports surfaced in late 2006 of U.S. and Florida investigations into Epstein. Black said that in 2012, three years after Epstein got out of jail following his conviction on soliciting prostitution from a minor, he retained Epstein for “personal estate planning, tax structuring and philanthropic advice” because of “misplaced comfort” in the “distinguished reputations” of the individuals in high society that Epstein continued to associate with. “This was a terrible mistake. Had I known any of the facts about Epstein’s sickening and repulsive conduct, which I learned in late 2018, more than a year after I stopped working with them I never would have had anything to do with him,” Black said. Epstein was found hanged at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors and lawyers have sued Epstein’s more than $630 million estate to obtain compensation for the young women and girls he allegedly abused and trafficked. In January, U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George sued the estate, seeking claims on behalf of victims he raped and trafficked on a private Caribbean island. Black has said he intends to cooperate with the U.S. Virgin Islands inquiry and any other investigation. Apollo said that Epstein never did any work for the New York-based firm and announced last week that three board directors tasked with probing Black’s ties to Epstein had retained law firm Dechert LLP to launch a full review. Apollo Chief Financial Officer Martin Kelly said on Thursday the review would include going though emails and interviewing people. He said he hoped it would be concluded by the end of the year. Apollo co-founder and Senior Managing Director Josh Harris, seen as Black’s likely successor were he to step down, said the firm expected fundraising would slow down in the near term, as some investors waited for the review’s findings. Kelly added that only 3% of the investor money Apollo manages could be withdrawn in the next two years, and that the firm’s big insurance investment portfolio buttressed its income from a slowdown in fundraising. Apollo shares were down 2.8% at $37.82 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday. “Although the stock appears oversold to us, the ring-fencing seems mostly discounted,” Citigroup Inc analyst Bill Katz wrote in a note following the earnings call. Apollo reported a steeper than expected drop in third-quarter profit. Distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - fell to $205.1 million from $222.5 million a year earlier, as a big rise in profit in Apollo’s credit businesses was not enough to offset a steep drop in its private equity and real estate divisions. That translated to DE per share of 47 cents, underperforming Wall Street analysts’ average forecast of 49 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.

17.19229401498126," Apollo seeks to tame investor concerns over CEO's ties to Epstein (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc said on Wednesday it would launch an independent review of Chief Executive Leon Black’s ties with late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as some of the private equity firm’s investors issued statements for the first time expressing concerns. Black wrote to Apollo’s fund investors last week that he regretted making payments to Epstein for what he called “professional services,” but has denied any wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct related to his business and social relationship with him. Black, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $7.8 billion, was responding to a New York Times story that reported he had wired between $50 million and $75 million to Epstein over the last decade. The 69-year-old private equity veteran said the payments were for advice on estate planning, taxes and philanthropy. The news has sent shock waves through Wall Street, where Apollo reigns as one of the largest investors in corporate credit and leveraged buyouts, with $414 billion in assets under management as of the end of June. On Wednesday, the $57 billion Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (PSERS) said it would not consider any new investments in Apollo funds after speaking with the buyout firm about Black’s involvement with Epstein. “PSERS is closely following the ongoing legal issues and the newly launched internal Apollo investigation,” PSERS spokesman Steve Esack said in a statement. A spokeswoman for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who manages the city’s five public pension funds totaling approximately $228.67 billion in assets, said in a statement they were “troubled” by these reports. “We are closely monitoring the situation in accordance with our fiduciary duty.” The Financial Times was the first to report PSERS’ comment. Bloomberg News reported that Cambridge Associates, which manages about $32 billion on behalf of institutional investors, said it may stop recommending Apollo funds to investors. Cambridge Associates declined to comment. Black, who co-founded Apollo in 1990, asked that the board’s conflicts committee, made up of independent board members, retain outside counsel to conduct a “thorough review” of the information he had shared about his relationship with Epstein, Apollo said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. The board committee has appointed law firm Dechert LLP to conduct the review. Apollo’s stock closed 2.6% higher on Wednesday, after dropping 13% last week. “I think the damage to the stock has been done and investors are in a bit of a holding pattern in the near term to get some clarity to remove that overhang,” said Jefferies analyst Gerald O’Hara. Epstein, who was charged by federal prosecutors with sex trafficking last year, committed suicide in his New York City jail cell in August 2019, before his trial. Black and two other Apollo co-founders, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, control 52.9% of the private equity firm, according to regulatory filings. “From a common-sense perspective, it’s hard not to have concerns about whether directors of a controlled company are going to exercise true independence when investigating allegations against the controlling party,” said Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor and corporate governance expert. Talley said he needed to know more about the arrangement of Apollo’s hiring of independent counsel to assess its effectiveness."

5.636696516369776," Caesars shoots lower than expected with $3.7 billion William Hill bid (Reuters) - Caesars CZR.O is in advanced takeover talks with William Hill WMH.L that value the British bookmaker at 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) and would give the casino operator full control of a quickly expanding U.S. sports-betting and online business. Caesars was considering offering 272 pence per share and William Hill’s board was inclined to recommend such an offer to shareholders, the companies said on Monday. William Hill shares on Friday surged to more than 312 pence each after it said it had received separate offers from Caesars and buyout group Apollo APO.N. Those gains were handed back on Monday, however, leaving the stock at 273 pence, suggesting that even if Apollo counters, investors now expect the price to be far lower. Caesars only holds 20% of its U.S. joint venture with William Hill but the business is built on a presence in Caesars casinos and its brand name, which the casino owner said it would have the right to terminate in the event of an Apollo buyout. The bid significantly undervalues the company but there seems limited scope for bid competition due to the joint venture terms and also since William Hill’s board said it would be minded to recommend the offer, Jefferies analysts said. Apollo did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment outside usual business hours. Stifel analyst Bridie Barrett said the brokerage’s valuation range for William Hill is 270 pence to around 400 pence. “While a termination of the relationship with William Hill under new ownership makes little business sense, it does add risk for a private equity acquisition...a price at the upper end of our range is unlikely,” Barrett said. William Hill’s shares were already trading close to two-year highs before news of the proposals, having fallen to their lowest in 20 years in March. It has offset regulatory pressure at home by expanding in the U.S. and partnering with CBS Sports and ESPN to cash in on the relaxation of sports betting rules there. To fund the deal, Caesars said it was raising equity and would take out $2 billion of new debt secured against William Hill’s non-U.S. businesses. Caesars said the enlarged sports and online gaming business in the U.S. could generate between $600-$700 million in net revenue in FY2021. The offer comes soon after Eldorado Resorts completed buying bigger rival Caesars for about $8.5 billion, creating a new competitor for larger sector players like Las Vegas Sands LVS.N and Wynn Resorts WYNN.O."

-6.627263850615675," Apollo to acquire stake in renewable energy developer US Wind for $265 million (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N said on Friday that it agreed to invest $265 million in offshore wind developer US Wind Inc, marking the private equity firm's first foray into one of the hottest areas of renewable energy development in the country. Apollo said its investment, which includes both debt and equity, will fund the construction of an offshore wind project off the coast of Maryland. Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the United States, generating about 7.3% of the nation’s electricity supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The majority of U.S. wind energy is currently generated onshore. But most new wind power projects are being sited offshore owing to limited availability of leased land and growing conflicts with local communities and land owners. Apollo said US Wind holds a lease on about 80,000 acres located 10 to 30 miles off the coast of Maryland, which can contain 1.3 gigawatt of installed wind power generation capacity. US Wind aims to construct a 270-megawatt wind power plant in the first phase of the project, which will supply electricity to75,000 Maryland homes when it launches in early 2024. “US Wind is a premier developer at the forefront of an offshore wind energy industry that is rapidly expanding in both the US and abroad, as interests coalesce around clean energy,” Geoffrey Strong, co-head of infrastructure and natural resources at Apollo, said in a statement. Apollo’s investment in US Wind was made out of the buyout firm’s second infrastructure fund, Apollo Infrastructure Opportunities Fund II, which is seeking to raise $3.5 billion from investors, according to regulatory filings."

The stock was trading at $16.59 at 1:16 p.m. ET (1716 GMT) on Wednesday, down from the $21 per share price Rackspace shares had sold for in its initial public offering on Tuesday. The lackluster IPO and trading debut bucked the recent trend of strong appetite from investors for cloud computing companies as the novel coronavirus pandemic drives more businesses to operate digitally and rely on cloud computing for more of their workflow. Rackspace sold 33.5 million shares in its IPO at the bottom end of its target range of $21 to $24 per share, valuing the company at $4.18 billion, excluding debt. “We’ve actually been very pleased with how the IPO process has gone. This is one of the largest tech IPOs of the year so we’re pretty excited to reach this milestone,” Rackspace Chief Executive Kevin Jones said in an interview before the stock started trading. “We’re not really focused on today’s stock price. We’re more focused on the long term and the future,” Jones added. Cloud companies such as Ncino Inc NCNO.O and Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd KC.O have seen their share prices more than double since going public earlier this year. Rackspace has historically leased server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud, and in recent years, has expanded its business to include multicloud services. Rackspace had been exploring an IPO for the last two years, but its weak organic growth and large debt due to its $4.3 billion leveraged buyout by Apollo in 2016 and subsequent acquisitions had stopped it from pursuing an IPO earlier.

-26.313401578371558," Apollo Global's earnings drop on slower asset sales NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N said on Thursday its second-quarter distributable earnings fell 11% year-on-year, weighed down by slower asset sales in its private equity and real estate businesses. Apollo said distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - fell to $205.2 million from $230.8 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 46 cents, less than the Wall Street analyst consensus of 48 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. Apollo’s shares were trading 3.1% lower at $52.38 in afternoon trading. “Asset sales were muted as prices are still recovering and the environment is challenging, though the reopening of capital markets may offer more opportunities to monetize assets,” said JMP analyst Devin Ryan. Apollo said the value of its funds rebounded in the second quarter following the rally in U.S. public markets from the coronavirus-induced downturn, leading to a 180% year-on-year rise in net income to $437.2 million under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The New York-based buyout firm said its credit funds appreciated by 7.4% in aggregate in the second quarter, its private equity portfolio rose by 11.7%, while its real estate, principal finance and infrastructure funds climbed 1.4% in aggregate. Apollo's peers also reported a similar appreciation in their funds. Blackstone Group Inc BX.N said last week its private equity portfolio grew 12.8% in the second quarter, while Carlyle Group Inc CG.O reported its corporate private equity and credit funds rose by 13% and 8%, respectively. Apollo said its assets under management (AUM) rose by nearly $100 billion during the second quarter to $413 billion. The steep rise was largely driven by strong fundraising and the closing of two deals by its insurance affiliates that boosted its credit assets. Apollo also said Marc Rowan, its co-founder who has led its drive into the insurance space, will step down from day-to-day management. “Marc will remain a member of the Apollo board and executive committee, will continue to serve on the board and executive committee of Athene and will remain on the board of Athora,” Apollo CEO Leon Black said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday. Apollo’s fee-related earnings rose to $259 million from $239 million in the second quarter, driven by the addition of AUM in Apollo’s credit business."

The buyout firm said its credit funds appreciated by 7.4% in aggregate in the second quarter, its private equity portfolio rose by 11.7%, while its real estate, principal finance and infrastructure funds climbed 1.4% in aggregate. Apollo’s peers also reported a similar appreciation in their funds. Blackstone Group Inc said last week its private equity portfolio grew 12.8% in the second quarter, while Carlyle Group Inc reported that its corporate private equity and credit funds rose by 13% and 8%, respectively. Apollo said its assets under management (AUM) rose by nearly $100 billion during the second quarter to $413 billion. The steep rise was largely driven by strong fundraising and the closing of two deals by its insurance affiliates that boosted its credit assets. In April, Apollo’s European insurance business, Athora Holdings, closed its acquisition of life insurer VIVAT from China’s Anbang Group Holdings Co, which contributed about $45 billion in AUM. Last month, Athene Holdings Ltd agreed to reinsure most of the liabilities of U.S. annuities provider Jackson National Life Co, a subsidiary of British insurer Prudential Plc , a deal that increased Apollo’s AUM by about $28 billion. Apollo is the investment manager of Athene’s entire assets. Apollo’s fee-related earnings rose to $259 million from $239 million in the second quarter, driven by the addition of AUM in Apollo’s credit business. Apollo declared a quarterly dividend of 49 cents per share. (Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)"

Apollo said distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - fell to $165.1 million from $207.4 million a year ago. This translated to DE per share of 37 cents, which missed the consensus analyst forecast of 48 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. Apollo’s shares were down 4.8% in early afternoon trading. Just like other buyout firms, Apollo was forced to mark down the value of its funds as global markets plunged due to economic shutdowns imposed by governments to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. “The pandemic resulting from the novel coronavirus and the actions taken in response have caused severe disruption to the global economy and financial markets,” Apollo said in a statement. “In line with public equity and credit indices, we have experienced significant unrealized mark-to-market losses in our underlying funds.” Apollo said its private equity portfolio depreciated by 21.6% in the first quarter, while its real estate, principal finance and infrastructure funds fell 6.5% in aggregate. The New York-based firm’s credit funds - encompassing corporate credit, structured credit and direct origination - declined 9% during the quarter. Apollo's peers Blackstone Group Inc BX.N and Carlyle Group Inc CG.O also reported declines in the value of their funds in the first quarter. Blackstone said here its private equity portfolio fell by 21.6%, while opportunistic and core real estate funds fell by 8.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Carlyle said here its own private equity funds depreciated by 8% in the quarter, while credit funds fell by 21%. Apollo said its portfolio companies will not be accessing the Paycheck Protection Program rolled out by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as part of the $2.3 trillion U.S. economic stimulus package to aid small and mid-sized businesses impacted by the pandemic. The firm added that it does not expect its companies will benefit from U.S. Federal Reserve’s emergency funding schemes. “Although we are still reviewing the guidance recently announced by the Federal Reserve, we do not anticipate that the Main Street lending program will provide any relief or financial assistance to companies controlled by us or our funds,” Apollo CEO Leon Black told investors and analysts on a conference call. Apollo reported a $2.3 billion net loss under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), compared with a net income of $315.6 million a year ago, hit by a plunge in investment income. The New York-based firm said it had $315.5 billion of assets under management at the end of March, down 5% from the prior quarter, due to unrealized market losses arising from the pandemic that was partially offset by fundraising.

42.417398140409915," Exclusive: Apollo readies IPO of cloud company Rackspace - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc has registered Rackspace Holding Inc for an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the cloud services firm at more than $10 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said. Apollo has been emboldened by the rally in the shares of Rackspace peers such as Fastly Inc and Datadog Inc in recent weeks, the sources said, as the novel coronavirus outbreak drives more businesses to operate digitally and rely on cloud computing for more of their workflow. Rackspace has confidentially filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is planning to proceed with a stock market debut as soon as the volatility that has been fueled by the pandemic subsides, the sources said. The sources cautioned that a date for Rackspace’s IPO had not yet been set and asked not to be identified because the preparations are confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Rackspace did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. listings have come to a near-standstill in the last two months due to coronavirus outbreak-induced stock market swings, which have made it harder to price shares in an IPO and have dampened the valuation that many companies can attain. There were only two IPOs in the United States in March, compared with seven a year ago, according data provider IPO Boutique. So far in April, there have also only been two new listings. Some 14 companies went public in April 2019. Rackspace leases server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud. The San Antonio-based company had been exploring an IPO for the last two years, but its weak organic growth and large debt pile, accumulated as a result of its $4.3 leveraged buyout by Apollo in 2016 and subsequent acquisitions, had stopped it from pursuing it. The push by companies to have employees work remotely and make more of their operations “pandemic-proof” has breathed new life into Rackspace’s business and brought an IPO within reach, according to the sources. The global cloud services market generated $264.8 billion in revenue last year and was estimated to exceed $900 billion by 2027, according to Allied Market Research."

Apollo’s bid for Tutor Perini comes as the construction company is trying to recover from what its CEO Ronald Tutor this week called “an extremely disappointing year” in 2019. It has struggled with the delivery of some electrical and mechanical projects, though analysts have pointed to the company’s strong project backlog as grounds for optimism. Apollo has made an offer of around $17 per share in cash for Tutor Perini, one of the sources said. There is no certainty that Tutor Perini will accept Apollo’s bid or that it will successfully negotiate a deal, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Tutor Perini did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tutor Perini shares rose 23% to $14.83 on the news in New York on Friday. The shares have lost 30% of their value in the last 12 months, compared to a 7% rise in the S&P 500 Index. Based in Los Angeles, Tutor Perini has worked on some of the biggest infrastructure projects in the United States, including Newark Liberty airport’s Terminal One and the San Francisco subway’s extension to Chinatown. The product of a merger between Tutor-Saliba Corp and Perini in 2008, the company worked on approximately 1,300 construction projects last year. Tutor, who is also the chairman of the company’s board, owns about 16% of Tutor Perini, making him its largest shareholder. Tutor Perini has “meaningful scale and diversity across several US nonresidential building and civil infrastructure construction markets”, but is struggling with thin margins and unbilled receivables, credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc said earlier this month. Tutor Perini had total debt of $834.5 million as of the end of December."

16.296618578462912," Apollo quarterly earnings flat, slightly missing analyst estimates (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N reported flat third-quarter earnings on Thursday, slightly missing analysts' expectations, as declines in its private equity and real estate businesses offset strong growth in its credit investments unit. Apollo said its third-quarter after-tax distributable earnings per share came in at 54 cents, unchanged from a year earlier, and lower than the average analyst forecast of 57 cents, according to Refinitiv. Frothy valuations have made negotiations between sellers and buyers of private equity-owned companies challenging, hindering the ability of buyout firms such as Apollo to cash out of their holdings at the same clip as last year. Last week, Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest private equity firm, reported a decline in its third-quarter distributable earnings, largely due to a drop in asset sales in its private equity business. Carlyle Group CG.O and KKR & Co Inc KKR.N also reported a fall in distributable earnings. Apollo’s private equity funds appreciated 3.6% in the third quarter. By comparison, Blackstone’s and Carlyle’s private equity funds appreciated by 2.6% and 1%, respectively. Apollo said its distributable earnings from credit business rose 20%, while its income from private equity declined during the quarter, driven by an 18% drop in performance fees. On Monday, Apollo said it had agreed a $1.6 billion deal to raise its stake in U.S. reinsurer Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N and eliminate the multi-class share structure of the Bermuda-based company. The deal aims to boost Athene's stock, which had underperformed compared to its peers since an IPO in 2016.

Tech Data has lower operating margins than some of its peers, as it invests in expanding its offerings. Two years ago, it acquired Avnet Inc's AVT.O technology solutions business for $2.6 billion. The technology equipment distribution sector has attracted strong private equity interest in the last year. In January, buyout firm CVC Capital Partners acquired ConvergeOne Holdings Inc, a distributor of networking and collaboration products, for $1.8 billion.

18.08297591539172," Private equity can still find 'diamonds in the rough': Apollo exec NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity billionaire Joshua Harris thinks there are still plenty of undervalued companies to improve and profit from, especially away from the public markets. “Certainly, this is not a value-oriented environment,” said Harris, senior managing director of Apollo Global Management, “but we’re able to find really interesting diamonds in the rough.” Harris, speaking at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference, said Apollo saw opportunity in taking public companies private. Harris cited Apollo’s purchase of Aspen Insurance Holdings for $2.6 billion in August 2018 and Smart & Final Stores for $1.1 billion in April 2019 as examples. There is likely more to come: The New York Post reported Apollo wants to buy publicly traded Hilton Grand Vacations Inc, the hotel chain’s time-share operator, for $2.4 billion. Harris said at the New York event that sectors still under significant pressure, including banking, insurance and energy, still needed capital and provided opportunity for firms like Apollo. Generally, Harris said that private equity profits “have come down a bit,” but that they “still way better” than returns in the public market, such as stocks. Investors seem to agree: Earlier this year, the firm said it planned to raise around $9 billion. Apollo, founded in 1990, already has $319 billion in committed capital. Some $77 billion of that is in private equity funds, including $24.7 billion for its latest portfolio, Fund IX, which was closed in 2017."

The New York-based firm said DE per share rose to 56 cents per share, from 52 cents per share a year earlier. That was just shy of the average analyst forecast of 57 cents, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Jefferies analysts Gerald O’Hara and Daniel Fannon, who rates Apollo’s stock “buy,” said in a note to investors that the company’s earnings “reflect relatively muted exit activity” during the quarter, referring to asset sales. Apollo’s performance fee income rose to $176.9 million from $129 million a year earlier owing to fewer asset sales across its private and public investments. The earnings lag slightly the trend set by private equity rivals Blackstone Group LP BX.N, Carlyle Group CG.O and KKR & Co Inc KKR.N, whose second quarter earnings beat analysts' estimates. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Apollo said net income per share on a diluted basis rose to 75 cents per share, up from 25 cents per share a year earlier. Blackstone and KKR reported 45 cents per share and 93 cents per share respectively. Fees earned from its credit business, which accounts for more than half of Apollo’s asset under management, rose 40% during the quarter. This was driven mainly by earnings from fundraising activity and management fees from permanent capital. Total asset under management rose to $311.9 billion, up 3% from three months earlier. Apollo declared a distribution of 50 cents per share."

Epstein was a tax and estate-planning adviser to Black for many years and also served as a director for the Debra and Leon Black Family Foundation. In a memo to Apollo employees, Black had said Epstein was asked to resign in 2007 and did no business with the private equity firm."

The potential deal would allow Natixis, owned by French cooperative lender BPCE, to cash out on its remaining 42 percent stake in Coface following an initial public offering of the company in 2014. The deal talks between Apollo and Coface are at an early stage, and there is no certainty they will result in an agreement, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Details of the price negotiations could not be learned. Coface did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apollo declined to comment. Coface shares jumped 8.4 percent on the news to 10.70 euros, giving the company a market capitalization of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion). Coface provides credit insurance to protect companies against potential nonpayment by their customers. It also offers debt collection, factoring and market research services to its clients. Natixis was one of the French banks hardest hit by the crisis in 2007, when the collapse of bonds backed by poor quality mortgages - dubbed subprime - spread through financial markets. Natixis eventually had to be rescued by its parent bank, BPCE. Natixis, France’s fourth largest listed bank, has sold businesses related to retail banking such as consumer lending and factoring to BCPE for 2.7 billion euros, in order to focus on investment banking, asset management and insurance.

22.556056939261175," Italian banks reject Apollo's rescue plan for Carige ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s banking fund FITD said on Monday it had rejected a rescue plan presented by a private equity fund for ailing lender Banca Carige. In a statement, the fund did not name the private equity but sources had told Reuters last week that U.S. private equity fund Apollo Global Management, which already owns Carige’s insurance units, had presented its offer. The FITD did not give a reason for the rejection on Monday but only said that it “was not in a position to accept a private equity fund’s draft plan in its current state”. However, one source close to the bank said Apollo was expected to present a new rescue plan in the coming hours. FITD added it was ready to consider alternative solutions involving the bank’s current shareholders and other private or public investors. Carige, which was placed under special administration by the European Central Bank in January, has a capital shortfall of 630 million euros ($717 million). Carige’s temporary administrators have been trying to find a buyer for months but their efforts were thrown into disarray last month when BlackRock pulled out of a proposed rescue plan. That plan included the conversion into equity of a 320 million euro bond held by the FITD deposit guarantee fund. FITD said it would start a detailed analysis of Carige’s capital needs on Tuesday. Bank rescues are sensitive in Italy, where an anti-establishment government has campaigned against EU “bail-in” rules that limit the use of public money to prop up ailing lenders. EU antitrust regulators blocked the rescue of Tercas in 2015 because it was carried out with money from FITD. Brussels considered the bailout breached EU state aid rules because it said the fund had acted on behalf of the Italian state, effectively providing unfair subsidies to the bank. The EU General Court overturned that decision in March, ruling that the fund had acted independently. A source close to the FITD, said on Monday, that thanks to this ruling, the FITD, which has 1.5 billion euros of liquidity, could inject cash into Carige without breaking EU antitrust rules. However, the European Commission appealed against the EU court ruling last month, paving the way for a long legal dispute which could prevent the Italian government from using the easier terms of the Tercas rescue for future bank bailouts."
21.706986313532003," U.S. fund Apollo presents rescue plan for Italy's Carige: sources MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. private equity fund Apollo Global Management has presented a draft rescue plan for Italy’s troubled bank Carige, three sources close to the matter said. Meanwhile, Italian banks are considering whether they could step in to plug Carige’s entire capital shortfall, the head of a deposit guarantee fund made up of all of the country’s banks said on Wednesday. Carige, which was placed under special administration by the European Central Bank in January, has a capital shortfall of 630 million euros ($706 million). Carige’s temporary administrators have been trying to find a buyer for months but their efforts were thrown into disarray last month when BlackRock pulled out of a proposed rescue plan. That plan included the conversion into equity of a 320 million euro bond held by the FITD deposit guarantee fund. Two of the sources said on Wednesday Apollo, which already owns Carige’s insurance units, had presented its offer through Italian broker Equita, which is acting as its adviser. Salvatore Maccarone, who heads the FITD fund, said it had received an offer by an unnamed party, but it was still at such an early stage that the fund could not assess it. Apollo was not immediately available for comment. Italian newspaper Il Messaggero said on Wednesday the offer by Apollo called for a capital increase of 450-500 million euros, of which the U.S. fund would cover around 120-130 million euros. The banks would plug the bulk of the remainder through the 320 million euros bond conversion, which would give them a controlling stake in Carige. According to the paper, Apollo wants an option to buy the banks’ stake in Carige for 1 euro. Such a plan might be difficult to swallow for both Italy’s government and the country’s banks. Maccarone said on Wednesday the banks were considering whether to plug Carige’s entire capital shortfall themselves, without Apollo’s intervention. Back in 2016, the U.S. fund had offered to buy a controlling stake in Carige in a 550-million euros cash call, but the bank’s top shareholder - the Malacalza family of steel entrepreneurs - rejected the bid saying it did not reflect Carige’s market value. The Malacalzas have a 27.6 percent stake in Carige. Vittorio Malacalza was quoted as saying at the weekend that Apollo’s renewed interest for the bank was not based on an industrial project."
22.348204437629853," Apollo in talks to finance Dish Network bid for T-Mobile, Sprint assets - sources (Reuters) - Private equity group Apollo Global Management is in talks with satellite TV provider Dish Network to finance a bid for wireless assets that will be divested in the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint Corp, according to two people familiar with the matter. The two U.S. wireless carriers have agreed to sell prepaid brand Boost Mobile to gain regulatory approval for the $26 billion merger. Sources said that Dish is interested in the assets. The talks between Apollo and Dish demonstrate private equity interest in the wireless business as regulators are pushing to create a viable fourth U.S. wireless competitor, even as the nation’s third- and fourth-largest carriers are combining. Dish and Apollo declined to comment. There is no certainty that Apollo will participate in Dish’s bid, and Apollo may decide to finance another bidder or pass on the opportunity, one of the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been in discussions with Dish, Altice USA and Charter Communications to purchase wireless assets from the merger to preserve competition in the industry, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Justice Department is expected to decide whether to approve the merger as early as next week, a source has told Reuters. Over the past few weeks, regulators have held discussions with potential bidders about what would constitute a wireless company that could compete with larger carriers Verizon, AT&T and the combined T-Mobile. Dish has stockpiled wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, and is facing a deadline next year to build a network that fulfills the license requirements or risk losing the license. The company, controlled by founder Charlie Ergen, met with the Federal Communications Commission on June 11 to discuss the impact of the merger on its plans to enter the wireless market, according to a regulatory filing."

24.240506364824643," Buyout firm Apollo Global agrees to acquire Shutterfly (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC said on Monday it had agreed to acquire U.S. digital imaging company Shutterfly Inc for $2.7 billion, including the company’s $900 million debt. The deal, first reported by Reuters on Monday, is the culmination of several years of private equity interest in Shutterfly, which allows customers to make photo books, cards and gifts from their photos. Its business has become increasingly commoditized and competitive, forcing it to explore a sale. Apollo said it would pay $51 per share in cash for Shutterfly, a 13% premium to the company’s value on Feb. 5, the last trading day before it announced it would explore a sale. Apollo also announced it would acquire privately held Snapfish LLC, a small internet-based retailer of photography products, to merge it with Shutterfly. Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Shutterfly makes personalized consumer photo products such as photo books, holiday cards, invitations and stationary. Founded in 1999, Shutterfly faces increasing competition from other online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish and Vistaprint, as well as brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Costco and Target, that offer low-cost digital photography products and services. Shutterfly was approached by several buyout firms over the years about a deal, including by Thomas H. Lee in 2016 and Silver Lake Partners LP in 2014, Reuters has previously reported. In February, Shutterfly said its board had formed a committee to explore its options with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley after receiving acquisition interest from an undisclosed party. The company also announced that its Chief Executive Christopher North would leave the company in August. Shutterfly last year acquired privately held Lifetouch, which helps schools and families shoot professional photos, for $825 million in cash."

The talks between Apollo and Jupiter Energy Group are the latest example of investors looking for oil infrastructure deals that tie booming U.S. shale production in West Texas and New Mexico to Gulf Coast export hubs. At least eight crude export facilities capable of loading supertankers also have been proposed for the U.S. Gulf Coast, to provide an outlet for record U.S. oil production which last year surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become No. 1 in the world. Apollo’s investment would be dependent on Jupiter securing commitments from producers willing to transport crude in its pipeline, as well as regulatory approvals, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Apollo declined to comment. Jupiter late last year proposed a crude pipeline and export facility off Brownsville, Texas, that would compete with similar projects advanced by Enterprise Products Partners LP, Enbridge Inc, and commodities trader Trafigura AG. Investors Carlyle Group LP and Blackstone Group LP separately are backing planned crude export facilities in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Venice, Louisiana, respectively.

-3.212413007044029," Apollo-backed Starboard in exclusive talks with Petrobras for 9 oilfields -sources RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management-backed investment firm Starboard Restructuring Partners is in exclusive talks with Petrobras to buy nine onshore oilfields for roughly 1 billion reais ($252 million), two sources familiar with the matter said this week. The Brazilian investment firm, in which Apollo has a 20% stake, has partnered with oil startup 3R Petroleum, aiming to bring Starboard, for which this would be its entry into oil production, more knowledge about the sector. 3R was founded in part by former Petrobras managers and has been active in the industry only recently. The move comes as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Brazil’s state-run oil firm is formally known, seeks to unload stakes in mature oilfields in a bid to reduce debt and focus on the nation’s offshore, ‘pre-salt’ play. Last week, the company announced the $384 million sale of a complex of 34 relatively small oilfields known collectively as Riacho da Forquilha to PetroReconcavo, a Salvador, Brazil-based firm. Current Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has made a priority of exiting the onshore segment, where production has fallen dramatically in recent years, amid flagging investments by the firm. Petrobras and Starboard declined to comment. Ricardo Savini, a partner at 3R, did not respond to a request for comment. One of the sources said Starboard is in talks with Petrobras to acquire the Macau and Fazenda Belem clusters, which are composed of seven and two oilfields, respectively. Combined, those assets produce about 5,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, according to the document seen by Reuters. A deal would represent a second chance of sorts for 3R. Petrobras announced in November that it had reached a deal with the startup to sell Riacho da Forquilha, which aroused suspicions from unions and trade groups concerned about the deal’s lack of a clear financing structure. Eventually, the deal was rescinded after 3R failed to acquire financing, and PetroReconcavo agreed to purchase the fields. Starboard manages 2.5 billion reais, while its partner Apollo has more than $300 billion under management. (This story Starboard corrects Apollo stake to 20 percent, not 30 percent, in paragraph 2)."
-3.212413007044029," Apollo Global to switch from a partnership to a corporation (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC, a manager of alternative assets such as private equity and corporate credit, said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation, in a bid to get more investors into its stock. Apollo is hoping the move, which will take effect in the third quarter of the year, will boost its share price, which has traded at a discount to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock Inc for close to a decade. Peers KKR & Co Inc and Ares Management Corp announced last year they would also make the switch. Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, said last month it would convert from a partnership to a corporation. Under the so-called C-Corp structure, Apollo will pay corporate taxes on all its revenue, in exchange for enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock. The additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered effective last year to 21 percent from 35 percent. Passive investors such as mutual funds, which are becoming more important as they manage more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring the stock of publicly listed partnerships. Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees. Apollo said the expanded investor base was worth the tax hit. “We believe (this) will simplify our structure and enable a much broader set of shareholders to participate in the exceptional long-term growth and profitability that we have been delivering to our investors,” Apollo CEO Leon Black said a statement. Apollo also announced first-quarter earnings on Thursday, reporting distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - of $207.4 million in the first quarter, up from $188.6 million a year earlier. This translated to distributable earnings per share of 50 cents, lower than the 56 cents analysts had predicted on average based on Refinitiv data. Nevertheless, the announcement of the switch to a corporation sent Apollo shares surging about 5 percent in premarket trading to $34.42. Fee-related earnings, the amount Apollo earns from management fees, were up 58 percent year-on-year at $209.8 million."

21.666360454529244," Buyout firm Apollo to buy Smart & Final Stores for $1.1 billion (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC said on Tuesday it will acquire Smart & Final Stores Inc for about $1.1 billion, including debt, the second time the private equity firm will own the U.S. food retailer. The deal comes after Apollo sold Smart & Final to Ares Management Corp, another buyout firm, in 2012 for $975 million, including debt. It is Apollo’s latest bet on the brick-and-mortar grocery sector, even after its last acquisition in the space, its $1.4 billion leveraged buyout of Fresh Market Inc in 2016, has soured amid increasing competition. Apollo will pay $6.50 per share in cash for Smart & Final, a 21 percent premium to its closing share price on Tuesday. The shares soared in after-hours trading after Reuters reported on the deal ahead of the announcement. Smart & Final operates 324 grocery and food service stores in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana and Utah. Ares took Smart & Final public in 2014 at a price of $12 per share. The shares have lost close to half their value since then, as the company struggled in a tough environment for brick-and-mortar retailers. Ares now owns close to 60 percent of the company. Based in Commerce, California, Smart & Final faces competition from direct rivals and e-commerce firms. Amazon.com Inc acquired Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion in 2017. Deep-pocketed international entrants to the U.S. market such as Lidl and Ahold Delhaize, as well as discount retailers such as Walmart Inc and Dollar General Corp, have also been squeezing Smart & Final’s profitability. Apollo plans to split Smart & Final into two operationally separate units, because of their different business model, according to people familiar with the matter. One unit will comprise the 257 stores operated under the Smart & Final banner, which allow consumers to shop at a discount without a membership fee. The second unit will comprise 67 stores under the company’s Smart Foodservice banner, which sell goods in a no-frills warehouse format to other food businesses such as restaurants and caterers. Apollo’s previous acquisition in the grocery sector, the Fresh Market, has struggled amid a plethora of organic and natural food offerings by rivals. Its bonds trade well below their par value, and credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service has called its capital structure “unsustainable”. To be sure, Apollo has enjoyed success in the grocery sector as well. It made 10 times its $200 million investment when it cashed out of organic grocer Sprouts Farmers Markets Inc in 2015."
18.308511545511553," Berry Global trumps Apollo with $4.37 billion offer for RPC (Reuters) - British packaging company RPC Group has agreed to a higher takeover offer from plastics maker Berry Global Group Inc worth 3.34 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), and has ditched a lower bid from Apollo Global Management LLC. RPC, Europe’s biggest plastic packaging group, said on Friday it had revoked support for Apollo’s offer in favor of Berry Global and said its directors would recommend shareholders to vote in favor of the new offer. Berry’s offer of 793 pence in cash for each RPC share is 1.4 percent higher than Apollo’s offer, and represents a premium of 3.5 percent to RPC’s closing price on Jan. 30, the last day before Berry said it was weighing a bid for RPC. The new offer values RPC at 3.34 billion pounds. Apollo was not immediately available to comment. RPC shares were down more than 1.3 percent at 785.4 pence in early trading on Friday, still below Berry Global’s offer price, with analysts saying the new offer was not a blockbuster. “A better offer is an improvement, but it’s not going to have shareholders dancing in the streets,” Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett said. Panmure Gordon analyst Adrian Kearsey said the market was hoping for more than 793 pence a share. Berry’s bid for RPC marks the latest in M&A deals in the packaging sector, which private equity firms have been focusing on for its stable cashflow and demand from online shopping. Packaging maker DS Smith Plc this week agreed to sell its plastics business to a private equity company. Evansville, Indiana-based Berry Global, which plans to fund the purchase through debt, began showing interest in RPC after Apollo had sealed the deal. Apollo did not sweeten its offer even though some analysts noted that it could have been higher. RPC’s products are highly complementary to Berry’s existing businesses and will allow the combined company to be a bigger player in the highly fragmented global market for plastic packaging, Berry said."

The deal represents a bet by Apollo on Direct ChassisLink’s dominant position in the transfer of shipping containers between ports and hubs for transport by rail or truck. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based Direct ChassisLink has doubled in size since investment firm EQT Partners AB acquired it in 2016, according to EQT’s website, despite reduced trade flows driven by a drop in imports to and exports from China. Apollo and EQT plan to announce the deal later on Thursday, the sources said, asking not to be identified ahead of an official announcement. The deal includes Direct ChassisLink subsidiary Blume Global, a logistics and digital supply chain management company, one of the sources added. Apollo declined to comment, while EQT did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Direct ChassisLink owns or manages more than 226,000 marine and domestic chassis, and has 450 locations on or near key port facilities and intermodal hubs throughout the United States, according to its website. In 2018, Direct ChassisLink acquired a fleet of approximately 73,000 domestic chassis from TRAC Intermodal. Blume Global allows Direct ChassisLink customers to use a single information technology platform for reservations, tracking and billing of both chassis and containers."
2.01249075423131," Exclusive: Apollo bets on Clearway Energy, defying PG&E bankruptcy fallout (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC has amassed a 6 percent stake in Clearway Energy Inc, a renewable energy producer whose shares were hit after one of its customers filed for bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Apollo’s move is a sign of confidence in Clearway, which cut its dividend from 33 cents to 20 cents per share last month amid concerns that California utility PG&E Corp could abandon its power purchase agreement with Clearway, a wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation company. PG&E filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 29, citing mounting liabilities, including the possibility its equipment set off the deadly Camp Fire, which destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people. Since November, Clearway’s shares have lost more than a fifth of their value as investors worried that PG&E will renege on its contract. PG&E has $42 billion worth of contracts with about 350 energy producers, mostly solar and wind farms. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded several renewable energy projects with significant revenue exposure to PG&E in the aftermath of its bankruptcy filing, including Topaz Solar Farms, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, and Genesis Solar Farm, developed by NextEra Energy. The PG&E contract accounts for about 23 percent of Clearway’s cash flow. Clearway Chief Financial Officer Chad Plotkin told investors on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday that PG&E had continued to make payments, but that the cash did not flow to Clearway because of debt covenants in its renewable energy projects. PG&E has not yet decided whether it will default on its power purchase agreements as part of its bankruptcy process. If it does, these contracts would have the same claim as $20 billion of unsecured bonds that PG&E has outstanding. Were this to happen, Apollo believes PG&E’s contract to Clearway would pay in full, at 100 cents on the dollar, the sources said. Clearway currently has an equity cushion of $9 billion, a rare occurrence for a company in bankruptcy. Apollo, which is one of PG&E’s biggest creditors, believes that the utility’s contract with Clearway has a value equivalent to $4.5 to $5 per Clearway share, according to the sources. Apollo’s stake in Clearway is a passive trading position originating from the private equity firm’s global liquid credit business, that is co-led by Joseph Moroney and John Zito, the sources said. Apollo declined to comment. Clearway, which is controlled by infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Clearway shares pared some losses and were trading down 2 percent at $14.71 in late morning trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.8 billion."

Other parties vying for the Chevron assets, which could fetch around $1.5 billion, include Ithaca Energy, majority owned by Israel’s Delek and Chrysaor, which is backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, sources said. Ithaca Energy declined to comment. Chrysaor, which became one of the largest North Sea producers after buying $3 billion of oil and gas fields from Royal Dutch Shell in 2017, is also bidding for North Sea assets being sold by Chevron rival ConocoPhillips, according to sources close to the process. Chevron in July kicked off the sale of its central North Sea oil and gas fields Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin, Erskine and Jade as well as the Britannia platform and its satellites. Chevron’s net daily production in the North Sea in 2017 averaged 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas, according to its website."
10.422150314945453," Apollo to buy Cox TV stations in broadcast push (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC has agreed to acquire a majority stake in 14 television stations from privately held Cox Media Group, the company said on Friday, a move that sets up Apollo to become a player in broadcasting, an industry it has sought deals in for some time. While Apollo and Cox did not disclose financial terms, sources said the transaction was valued at around $3 billion. The stations are in cities such as Seattle, Boston and Jacksonville, Florida, and reach more than 31 million U.S. viewers. Apollo is also gaining control of several radio, news, and television properties in Ohio, the company said. Broadcast television operators are looking to either gain scale or exit the space as viewership, and advertising dollars, increasingly shift to providers of web-based, streaming content. Reuters previously reported that Apollo was nearing a deal to acquire Cox’s stations. Apollo is also a bidder for a portfolio of local TV stations worth about $1 billion that Nexstar Media Group Inc plans to shed following its $4.1 billion takeover of Tribune Media Co, Reuters reported. If Apollo wins that group of stations, it would combine the assets with the Cox TV stations, sources have said. Apollo also has an agreement to acquire the assets of Northwest Broadcasting, which owns more than a dozen TV stations in mostly rural markets in the Pacific Northwest, and combine them with the Cox assets, Reuters reported. Cox said last July it was exploring options for its 14-station portfolio. The broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate. Private equity firms find broadcast TV stations appealing because of the cash-rich fees the stations generate from being carried by cable operators. Apollo would also be able to cut costs at Cox’s TV stations, which have been family-controlled for many years. Apollo tried unsuccessfully last year to acquire both Nexstar and Tribune Media, in separate attempts. Barclays PLC, Moelis & Co LLC and BDT & Co LLC advised Cox. RBC Capital Markets LLC, Guggenheim Partners LLC, and LionTree Advisors LLC advised Apollo."
12.536332154904011," Exclusive: Apollo nears $3 billion deal to buy Cox TV stations - sources (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC is nearing a roughly $3 billion agreement to acquire Cox Enterprises Inc’s 14 regional TV stations, the biggest in a series of deals the private equity firm is lining up to become a force in U.S. broadcasting, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. Cox, a privately held media conglomerate whose holdings span automotive websites, newspapers and cable TV, has been seeking to exit the regional TV sector, which is going through a wave of consolidation. Operators are looking for scale to counter the rise of online streaming and the shift of advertising dollars to the internet. Cox and Apollo are also discussing some joint venture agreements for Cox’s broadcast station in Atlanta, where Cox is headquartered and also has radio stations, the sources said. There may be other cities where the companies decide to have joint ventures, the sources added. An agreement between Apollo and Cox could be announced later this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. As with any negotiations, talks could always fall apart at the last minute, the people cautioned. Apollo is also a bidder for a portfolio of local TV stations worth about $1 billion that Nexstar Media Group Inc plans to shed following its $4.1 billion takeover of Tribune Media Co, the sources added. That process is expected to wrap up later this year. Should Apollo prevail in that auction, it would combine the assets with the Cox TV stations, the people said. Apollo also has an agreement to acquire the assets of Northwest Broadcasting, which owns more than a dozen TV stations in mostly rural markets in the Pacific Northwest, and combine them with the Cox assets, the sources said. Apollo and Cox declined to comment. Northwest Broadcasting and Nexstar could not be reached for comment. Cox said last July it was exploring options for its 14-station portfolio. The stations are in nine states, including Florida and Georgia, and reach more than 31 million viewers in their markets. The broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate. Private equity firms find broadcast TV stations appealing because of the cash-rich fees the stations generate from being carried by cable operators. Apollo would seek to use some of Northwest Broadcasting’s contracts, which have higher fees thanCox’s, to hike up fees from the cable operators, some of the sources said.

10.98338551892391," Arconic to split into two after rebuffing Apollo offer (Reuters) - Arconic said on Friday it would split into two companies and slashed its quarterly dividend by two-thirds, just weeks after the U.S. aluminum products maker spurned a buyout offer from Apollo Global Management. The company, formed following a split of Aloca Corp in 2016, plans to spin off one of its core divisions later. Arconic has been under pressure from its biggest shareholder Elliott Management Corp to sell itself and Apollo’s offer last month could have valued the company at about $17 billion. However, potential legal liabilities from its smaller building and construction systems unit likely put a question mark on the valuation. The unit had supplied the Reynobond PE panels used in the cladding of the Grenfell Tower apartment complex in London, England, where more than 70 people were killed in a 2017 blaze. “After a rigorous and comprehensive process...the board sees more shareholder value creation through a restructuring of the company,” Chairman John Plant said in a statement, after Arconic’s fourth-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates. Plant on Wednesday assumed the role of chief executive officer in a surprise move, replacing General Electric Co veteran Chip Blankenship who was at the helm for just over a year. Arconic said the unit, which makes parts for aircraft and power generation equipment, will now be called engineered products and forgings. The business, currently its biggest, clocked $6.32 billion in 2018 sales, a 6.3 percent jump. Global rolled products, its second division which makes sheet and plates products for the aviation and automotive industries, reported a 12.1 percent jump in sales to $5.60 billion. Arconic did not specify which division it intends to spin off and when but said it will consider the sale of businesses that do not fit into either of the divisions. The company said it expects to cut quarterly dividend to 2 cents per share from 6 cents, with a target to reduce operating costs by about $200 million on an annual run-rate basis. Arconic shares fell nearly 3.2 percent to $17.12 on Friday, after rising as much as 2.6 percent in early trading."

13.76410891589764," Apollo reports first full-year loss since 2011 after rocky fourth quarter NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management on Thursday reported a loss for the last quarter of 2018, contributing to the firm’s first year in the red since 2011 as falling equity markets diminished the value of its investments on paper. Apollo’s economic net loss per share was $1.01 in the fourth quarter, steeper than the 82-cent loss analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv data. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Apollo reported economic net income per share of $1.22. Overall in 2018, Apollo lost 21 cents per share, the firm’s first year in the red since 2011. Still, shares were up around 5 percent in mid-morning trading, outshining the broader U.S. stock market, as analysts took comfort from Apollo’s assets under management rising to a record $280.3 billion by the end of 2018. “While we do not dismiss one quarter of challenging investment performance, given that marks can be volatile from period-to-period (and were actually roughly in line with our expectation), we remain encouraged with the business heading into 2019,” according to a note by JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan, who rates the stock “market outperform.” The benchmark S&P 500 index suffered its worst three months in more than 7 years at the end of 2018, dropping about 14 percent in the fourth quarter. In late morning trading, the S&P index was up about 0.4 percent. Apollo reported its private equity fund depreciated 10.9 percent in the quarter and was down 9.8 percent for 2018. The value of Apollo’s public equity holdings fell 29 percent. “What we’ve seen in our portfolio is a microcosm of what’s been going between the markets and the underlying economy in the U.S.,” Chairman, Chief Executive and Co-founder Leon Black said in a statement. “The fundamentals actually have been pretty attractive... vis-à-vis our own portfolio in terms of revenue and earnings growth. But the market got very skittish in the fourth quarter.” Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Apollo’s portfolio. Peers Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and KKR & Co have recently deemphasized the earnings metric and focused primarily on distributable earnings, the actual cash available for paying dividends. Apollo’s distributable earnings totaled $252.4 million in the quarter, down 20.4 percent from $317.2 million a year earlier. Blackstone on Thursday posted distributable earnings of $722 million for the fourth quarter, down 42 percent on the year."
13.76410891589764," Berry Global weighs bid for packager RPC in challenge to Apollo (Reuters) - Berry Global Group is considering a cash offer for British packager RPC Group in a challenge to a 3.3 billion pound ($4.3 billion) bid from the U.S. company’s former parent, Apollo Global. Apollo agreed to acquire RPC last week after months of negotiations, marking the latest M&A deal in the consolidating packaging sector. Private equity firm Apollo would not sweeten its offer of 782 pence per share, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, despite grumbling at the relatively modest premium. “It (Apollo’s offer) is fully funded, it is deliverable in a short space of time and that is the final offer ... Apollo is not going to be sort of spooked into a bidding war,” the source said. RPC, Europe’s biggest plastic packaging company, said that it had received a request for information from plastics maker Berry Global, based in the town of Evansville, Indiana. “The board of RPC confirms that it will engage with Berry in accordance with its obligations under the (Takeover) Code and in order to advance discussions in the interests of delivering best value to shareholders,” RPC said in a statement. The packaging sector has seen a series of recent takeovers as investors are drawn to reliable cashflow underpinned by strong demand from online shopping. RPC’s shares were up 3.7 percent at 793 pence at 1440 GMT, comfortably above Apollo’s offer. Apollo’s offer represented a premium of 15.6 percent to RPC’s closing price on Sept. 7, the day before reports of takeover interests emerged. Royal London Asset Management, which owns a 1.33 percent stake in RPC, flagged the low offer price. “Apollo was always going to run this risk having pitched the bid at this level which has clearly given others encouragement,” said Craig Yeaman, fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. “Berry Global, being a competitor to RPC, would have plenty of synergies to go after and the first casualties could include senior management who were so willing to accept Apollo’s offer,” Yeaman said. (Graphic: Apollo offer fails to cheer RPC investors - tmsnrt.rs/2SffFPf) Aviva Investors, which owns a 1.93 percent stake in RPC according to Refinitiv Eikon data, has said it does not agree with the terms of Apollo’s offer.

21.452262231740562," Apollo Global to buy packaging group RPC for 3.3 billion pounds (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management is to buy packaging products maker RPC Group RPC.L for 3.3 billion pounds ($4.28 billion) in cash after months of negotiations, marking the latest M&A deal for an industry in the midst of a consolidation phase. The acquisition highlights how the sector’s reliable cashflow, driven by demand from online shopping, is proving attractive to private equity firms and bigger packaging players. RPC, Europe’s biggest plastic packaging maker, makes a range of products including packaging for beverages, coffee capsules and healthcare products. Apollo’s offer of 782 pence per share represents a premium of 15.6 percent to RPC’s closing price on Sept. 7, the last trading day before the offer period began. Aviva Investors, which owns a 1.93 percent stake in RPC according to Refinitiv Eikon data, said separately that it did not agree with the terms of Apollo’s offer. “In our view, this protracted bid process has not delivered fair value to RPC’s shareholders,” said David Cumming, Chief Investment Officer for Equities at Aviva Investors. The final offer price was some way behind what analysts had suggested was possible, said Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Hyett said it was not impossible for a rival bidder to emerge but plastic packaging was far from popular at the moment and with the global economy looking rocky, it might be asking a bit much to expect a rival to pay around 4 billion pounds to keep RPC out of private equity hands. He also said that with board backing and minimal regulatory concerns, he expected the deal to go through. The RPC deal is not Apollo’s first foray into the plastics and packaging industry. The private equity firm previously owned U.S.-based Berry Plastics. Other M&A deals in packaging last year included Australia's Amcor Ltd's AMC.AX agreement to buy U.S. firm Bemis Co BMS.N for $5.25 billion and DS Smith Plc's SMDS.L $2.2 billion deal to acquire Spanish rival Europac PYCE.MC. The plastics industry is facing tighter regulation in Europe and elsewhere due to environmental concerns. RPC, which operates in 33 countries and employs about 25,000 people, said in September it was in talks on a possible sale to Apollo and another private equity firm Bain Capital. The deadlines on the deal for Apollo and Bain were repeatedly extended and Bain Capital ended talks in December. RPC had said last July that shareholder pressure was preventing it from pursuing some growth opportunities. RPC had been investing heavily to take advantage of Chinese demand as well as produce more recyclable plastics, prompting fears that higher spending would hit cash flow. Apollo’s affiliate will finance the deal through a combination of equity and debt provided by a number of banks.

14.870116603749961," Buyout firm Apollo eyes deal for GE's aircraft leasing unit: sources (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N is working on an offer to acquire General Electric Co's aircraft leasing operations, which are worth as much as $40 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Apollo’s bid comes as GE’s new chief executive officer, Larry Culp, is battling to restore profits and slash debt after the industrial conglomerate lost $22.8 billion in the third quarter, mostly from its ailing power unit. GE GE.N is already pressing on with divesting several assets, including spinning off its healthcare unit and shedding its stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes BHGE.N. Apollo's offer could put pressure on GE to also sell the aircraft unit, known as GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). Apollo is looking at financing its bid partly through debt and equity provided by Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N, the annuity provider for which it provides asset management services, the sources said. Apollo's private equity funds, co-investment from Apollo's investors, and debt financing from banks will also help fund the deal, the sources added. In addition, Apollo is open to exploring a transaction for GE’s long-term-care insurance business, whose liabilities have emerged as a significant burden, according to the sources. GE has not yet agreed to a deal with Apollo, the sources said. The company could decide to explore a deal with other buyers or not sell GECAS at all, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Apollo and GE declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported on Apollo’s offer. GECAS has a fleet of more than 1,900 planes, which it provides to airlines under long-term leases. Consolidation in the sector has intensified in the last few years, as Asian competitors chip away at the market shares of GECAS and its rival AerCap Holdings NV AER.N. GECAS is a unit of GE Capital, which GE has been trimming since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2015, it clinched a deal to sell most of GE Capital's real estate assets to Blackstone Group LP BX.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N for $23 billion. Apollo has done several deals with GE. In October, Apollo agreed to buy a portfolio of $1 billion in energy investments from GE Capital. In 2015, Mubadala GE Capital, a joint venture between Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala and GE Capital, agreed to sell a $3.6 billion portfolio of corporate and real estate loans in the United States and Europe to Apollo."

5.311545362863721," Apollo finds TV station partner for Tribune Media bid: sources (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has teamed up with regional TV station owner Northwest Broadcasting in its bid to acquire another U.S. TV station owner, Tribune Media Co TRCO.N, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Tribune, which has a market value of about $3.5 billion, put itself on the auction block three months ago, after its $3.9 billion sale to peer Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc SBGI.O failed to get regulatory clearance. Apollo is now competing against Nexstar Media Group Inc NXST.O in the auction for Tribune, the sources said. Final bids were submitted earlier this week, and a deal for the sale of Tribune could come in early December, the sources added. Sinclair is currently also pursuing its own separate deal, having partnered with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd to bid for the regional sports networks that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O is selling following its deal to merge most of its assets with Walt Disney Co DIS.N, according to the sources. Should Nexstar not prevail in buying Tribune, it will turn its sights on buying 14 TV stations that privately held Cox Enterprises Inc has put up for sale, worth more than $2.5 billion, the sources said. The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Apollo, Tribune, Nexstar, Northwest Broadcasting, Sinclair, Cox and CVC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate. The FCC has yet to vote on the matter. Michigan-based Northwest Broadcasting, which is run by CEO Brian Brady, owns more than a dozen TV stations. Based in Chicago, Tribune Media owns or operates 42 local television stations reaching approximately 50 million households. It also owns national entertainment cable network WGN America, whose reach is more than 77 million households, and a variety of digital applications and websites commanding 54 million monthly unique visitors online, according to its website. Tribune has filed a lawsuit against Sinclair seeking damages of at least $1 billion for what it called Sinclair’s “misconduct” and “willful breaches” of the merger agreement. In its counterclaim in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Sinclair rejected Tribune’s allegations and suggested the companies had been very close to winning U.S. Department of Justice approval. The deal was scuttled when the FCC took the unusual step of referring it to an administrative judge for review and questioned Sinclair’s candor over the planned sale of some stations. The FCC said Sinclair did not “fully disclose facts” relating to the planned sale of three stations, including pre-existing business relationships the company had with prospective buyers."
13.125235929966694," Apollo, Leon Black say ex-partner's theft shows 'betrayal' NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N and billionaire co-founder Leon Black said on Monday they have uncovered proof that a former executive suing them for $1.5 billion stole confidential information as he prepared to bolt the private equity firm and compete with it. The allegations were made in response to a July 12 lawsuit in which the former executive, Imran Siddiqui, said Apollo and Black tried illegally to undermine his new venture, Caldera Holdings Ltd, and prevent it from competing with their ""golden goose,"" the insurer Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N. It is rare for private equity firms to accuse former executives publicly of stealing trade secrets. Apollo and Siddiqui have had multiple cases against each other, including in arbitration. In a filing with a New York state court in Manhattan, Apollo and Black said emails uncovered from early 2017 show that Siddiqui was “surreptitiously working” with a more junior Apollo colleague and two former Athene executives, and using confidential information to form a competing company. The emails are “stark and blatant examples of Siddiqui’s betrayal of Apollo and Athene” when he was still a highly paid Apollo partner and should have been loyal, the filing said. Siddiqui’s lawyer Lisa Solbakken said the emails reflect no wrongful conduct, and the new allegations should be rejected. “Apollo had released Mr. Siddiqui from any and all claims, known or unknown, prior to Feb. 21, 2018,” she said in an interview. “The reference to emails in 2017 smacks of desperation.” A hearing on Apollo’s and Athene’s effort to dismiss Caldera’s lawsuit has not been scheduled. Black, 67, is worth $6.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Athene and Caldera have battled each other for control of American Equity Investment Life Holding Co AEL.N, an annuities specialist that put itself up for sale in May, the Financial Times has reported. Apollo created Athene in 2009 to buy insurance assets that were hit hard during the global financial crisis. Athene has since become a large U.S. annuity provider, with net income nearly doubling last year to $1.45 billion. Apollo recently owned about 10 percent of Athene and controlled more than one-third of its voting power, according to a regulatory filing. Siddiqui worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Oak Hill Capital Partners before joining Apollo. Caldera has said he denied possessing confidential Apollo materials. The case is Caldera Holdings Ltd et al v Apollo Global Management LLC et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652175/2018."
9.209098326205877," Apollo extends olive branch to investors on LifePoint loan NEW YORK, Nov 16 (LPC) - US investors are taking advantage of volatility in the equity and fixed income markets to extract pricing concessions and document changes on some recent buyout loans, including a US$4.975bn financing backing Apollo Global Management’s US$5.6bn acquisition of hospital company LifePoint. Floating-rate loans have been in demand as investors seek a hedge against rising interest rates. But the US equity market selloff is feeding into the loan market, which is helping investors to push back and win more favorable terms on aggressive deals. The volatility that hit the wider markets in late October is pushing US secondary loan prices lower. The SMi100 index of the top traded loans fell to a year-long low of 98.21 after trading near the year’s highs at 98.91 as recently as October 8, according to LPC data. “The market has traded off a bit, but it’s still pretty strong overall,” a banker said. “When you see deals struggle, it’s mainly idiosyncratic with unique characteristics.” LifePoint announced on July 23 that Apollo had agreed to buy it in a deal valued at US$5.6bn and plans to merge LifePoint with its portfolio company RCCH HealthCare Partners. Citigroup led the financing with Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS. Investors’ concerns about LifePoint or the US hospital sector are secondary, however, to their feelings about Apollo, a private equity firm with a track record of playing hard ball and extracting value from investors involved in its deals. The sponsor’s aggressive negotiation skills were illustrated when Apollo tangled with investors over the restructuring of gaming company Caesars Entertainment Co in 2016 after a messy bankruptcy that resulted in losses for bondholders. “There’s definitely an Apollo premium,” a leveraged finance portfolio manager said. “We’ve been scarred. They are extremely competent but can also be brutal.” This history has left investors keen to extract concessions from Apollo when possible, especially when market volatility strengthens their negotiating hand. After some resistance from investors, Apollo agreed to increase pricing on LifePoint’s term loan to 450bp over Libor from initial guidance of 400bp over Libor. Strong demand following the concessions allowed the loan to be increased to US$3.55bn from US$3.4bn while a bond offering was cut to US$1.425bn from US$1.575bn. The bonds priced at 9.75%, at the wide end of guidance. The private equity firm also extended soft call protection of 101 to a full year from six months and added quarterly conference calls. A 50bp most favored nations clause was also added for the life of the loan and the size of restricted payments baskets was cut. The borrower also added a springing maturity provision tied to the company’s US$150m of senior unsecured notes due in 2024 during syndication. Investors described the pricing changes as secondary to the other adjustments, as they wanted to ensure that LifePoint’s loan had better investor protection than recent jumbo buyout loans for Refinitiv, formerly Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, AkzoNobel’s specialty chemicals unit and physician outsourcing company Envision Healthcare, which priced at the end of summer. Apollo’s concessions were primarily designed to ensure that LifePoint’s loan would perform well in the secondary market after the three jumbo loans were dragged lower by recent volatility. Refinitiv was quoted at 98-98.75 on Friday and Envision was at 97-97.5 after both broke for trading above par upon allocation. The loan backing the AkzoNobel deal has fared the best and is trading around 100.625-101 after it broke at 100.375-100.75. “The market and how this (LifePoint) would trade were the biggest areas of focus,” said a source familiar with the deal. LifePoint’s loan broke above its original issue discount of 99 at 99.125-99.375 on Wednesday, but had dropped to 98.5-98.875 on Thursday. “They (Apollo) definitely wanted to get a good response to the deal,” said a second banker. “They spent a lot more time than they usually spend with investors. They asked what the market wanted.” Apollo’s new investor-friendly approach and willingness to make concessions helped LifePoint’s deal to close successfully and the secondary market pricing fluctuation was attributed to market conditions, a second source familiar with the deal said. “Every lender lends to Apollo. This is a supply-and-demand market. It had nothing to do with the sponsor. The market will take advantage where they can just like they were taken advantage of on those buyout deals recently,” the second source added. The concessions may help Apollo on future deals, a third banker said. “They (Apollo) seem to be wanting to extend an olive branch of sorts and this was a way to do it,” the third banker said. Citigroup and Apollo declined comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Schwarzberg. Additional reporting by Kristen Haunss. Editing by Tessa Walsh and Michelle Sierra)"

1.1774848135167746," Asset manager Apollo's earnings miss estimates in quarter (Reuters) - Alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N reported third-quarter earnings that missed market expectations on Wednesday as the value of its private equity investments grew less than some analysts had expected. Economic net income (ENI) of 83 cents per share for the quarter was below analysts’ mean estimate for 92 cents, according to Refinitiv data. ENI, a key earnings metric for many U.S. private equity firms, was down from $1.07 a year earlier, and reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Apollo’s portfolio. In the quarter, the value of Apollo's private equity assets appreciated by 2.3 percent, compared with a 7.5 percent rise for rival Blackstone Group LP BX.N in the same period. Shares were down around 2.5 percent in midday trading, against a broadly higher U.S. stock market. Apollo's private equity portfolio also lagged the 7.2 percent rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX, viewed as a partial proxy for the value of private equity firms' illiquid assets. Chief Financial Officer Martin Kelly said the portfolio was adversely affected by struggles with comparable companies which Apollo uses to value its assets. “In PE, we look at the comps. And so for the comps that we look at, based on the companies that we own, in the quarter there were some headwinds on comp multiple compressions,” Kelly said on an earnings call, referring to when a company’s price-to-earnings multiple drops as investors become wary of its growth potential. After-tax distributable earnings, or the actual cash available for paying dividends, rose to $226 million from $173.5 million a year earlier. New York-based Apollo’s assets totaled $270.2 billion at the end of September, up slightly from $269.5 billion in the previous quarter. Apollo also declared a cash distribution of 46 cents per share for the third quarter. In a note, Credit Suisse analysts, who have a “neutral” rating on Apollo’s stock, described the earnings as “modestly negative.” ""The softer-than-expected ENI result was driven by lower-than-expected portfolio returns which was offset by a larger-than-anticipated contribution from ATH,"" the analysts wrote, referring to income from annuity service provider Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N, which was spun out of Apollo in 2016. Carlyle Group LP CG.O reported on Wednesday that its corporate private equity funds appreciated 1 percent in the three months through September."
-5.9497617100731155," Exclusive: Apollo in advanced talks to acquire Arconic - sources (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N is in advanced negotiations to acquire U.S. aluminum products maker Arconic Inc ARNC.N for more than $11 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year. It would come after U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of aluminum tariffs this year drove up some costs for Arconic, which makes aluminum components for cars and airplanes. Apollo could reach a deal with Arconic as early as next week after a competing buyout consortium comprising Blackstone Group LP BX.N, Carlyle Group LP CG.O, Onex Corp ONEX.TO and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board indicated it may need three more weeks to complete due diligence on the company, the sources said. Apollo’s offer currently stands at around $23 per share, though negotiations are ongoing and the price could change or deal talks could end unsuccessfully, added the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Apollo, Arconic, Blackstone and Carlyle declined to comment, while Onex and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Arconic, which had net debt of $4.8 billion as of the end of September, rose 7 percent to $21.08 in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday. Arconic, which was spun out of Alcoa Corp AA.N in 2016, said in February it would carry out a ""strategy and portfolio review."" It said earlier on Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings announcement that it was ""extending the scope and duration of this activity to address additional scenarios,"" and that it expected to complete its review in the fourth quarter. Arconic reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and raised its full-year earnings forecast, driven by higher demand for aluminum parts used by its airplane customers, including Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus SE AIR.PA. In August, Arconic announced it was considering selling its building and construction systems unit, which makes facades, windows and framing products. The announcement came one year after a major fire broke out at London’s Grenfell Tower apartment complex, where the company’s Reynobond PE panels were used in the cladding. More than 70 people were killed in the blaze. Arconic said on Tuesday that the sale process for the building and construction systems unit was under way and had drawn “robust interest.” Activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, which won board representation at Arconic last year following a proxy contest, has been instrumental in pushing the company to explore a sale, sources have said."

The offer is at a small premium to where Arconic shares are trading, adding pressure on the U.S. company to decide if it will remain independent after President Donald Trump’s imposition of aluminum tariffs drove up its costs this year and weighed on business prospects. Apollo’s offer values Arconic at between $23 and $24 per share, one of the sources said. Arconic shares ended trading on Monday at $21.45. Arconic had $6.3 billion in total debt and cash of $1.46 billion as of the end of June. Another bidding group, comprising buyout firms Blackstone Group LP BX.N, Carlyle Group LP CG.O, Onex Corp ONEX.TO and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, has yet to submit an offer for Arconic, and it is not clear whether it will submit a bid to rival Apollo's in the coming days, the sources said. Arconic has not yet set any firm bid deadline and no deal is imminent, though the company is hoping to reach a decision on whether it will sell itself by the time it holds its investor day next month, according to the sources. It is not clear whether more bids from other parties will emerge. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Arconic, Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board declined to comment, while Onex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Arconic’s products, which are made of aluminum, titanium or nickel, are used around the world by aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation and packaging manufacturers.

GE Capital’s equity portfolio includes about 20 investments in mostly U.S.-based energy companies that focus on renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation. GE, which replaced its Chief Executive Officer John Flannery in a surprise move earlier this month with outsider Larry Culp, has been divesting assets worth billions of dollars from its finance unit since 2015.

Financial terms of the Apollo-GE Capital deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, were not disclosed. For Apollo, the deal comes amid a recovery in energy prices, with the buyout firm reported here to have been seeking to raise more than $4 billion for its third natural resources-focused private equity fund.

-12.235410497828264," Weak private equity performance dents Apollo's second-quarter earnings (Reuters) - Alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N on Thursday posted a weaker-than-expected rebound in its second-quarter earnings per share, as the value of its private equity investments rose less than rivals. Apollo’s quarterly economic net income per share came in at 27 cents, missing analysts’ expectations of 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and compared to 46 cents a year earlier. It followed the New York-based firm’s first quarterly loss since 2016 earlier this year. Solid quarterly marks reported by peers had raised expectations Apollo would show similarly strong appreciation in its private equity portfolio. “The shortfall was primarily driven by lighter than expected private equity investment performance,” JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan, who rates the stock “market outperform”, wrote in a note. The value of Apollo's private equity portfolio rose only 1.7 percent in the three months through June, compared with a 9.5 percent appreciation at rival Blackstone Group LP BX.N, 6.7 percent at KKR & Co Inc KKR.N and 3 percent at Carlyle Group LP CG.O. The benchmark S&P 500 index .SXP rose 2.9 percent in the second quarter. “We had a couple of things related to retail and Canadian natural gas that we had to mark down but relative to the overall portfolio we’re very positive and excited about where it is,” Apollo co-founder and Senior Managing Director Josh Harris said in an investor call. Earnings were also hit by a drop in the share price of fixed annuity service provider Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N, which was spun out of Apollo in 2016 and in which it retains a stake. Apollo shares were down 3.7 percent at 11:10 a.m. ET. Overall, second-quarter economic net income, which reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Apollo’s portfolio, fell 40.9 percent from a year ago to $108.5 million. Distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - fell to $218.2 from $246.2 million a year earlier.

-16.446362052598225," Apollo to buy LifePoint in latest private equity bet on healthcare (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management will buy LifePoint Health in a $5.6 billion deal that will expand its rural U.S. hospitals business, the latest in a series of bets by private equity firms on healthcare. The deal comes as Tennessee-based LifePoint and many of its peers face higher medical costs, fewer patient admissions and changes to reimbursement policies in Medicare and Medicaid that have pressured profits. To compensate, LifePoint has been beefing up its presence in rural regions including in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and streamlining operations at healthcare facilities there. The deal will bring together LifePoint and Apollo’s RCCH HealthCare Partners, LifePoint said in a statement, confirming a Reuters report on Friday that the parties were in advanced talks for a buyout. Apollo’s deal - its biggest this year - is the latest in a recent surge of public investments by U.S. private equity, the highest since the 2007-08 global financial crisis. With a record $1 trillion in cash at their disposal, top private equity names have turned to healthcare. Just last month, KKR and Veritas Capital each snapped up publicly-listed healthcare firms in multi-billion dollar deals. Indeed, hospital operators are alluring to investors, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph France said. Because their operations are largely U.S.-based, hospital firms benefit more from lower tax rates than the average U.S. company, and are also more insulated from global trade uncertainties, France said. Apollo’s transaction value includes $2.9 billion of LifePoint’s net debt and minority interest. The combined company will be led by current LifePoint Chief Executive Officer William Carpenter III. LifePoint shares — down some 27 percent in the past year — jumped nearly 34 percent to $64 in premarket trading, $1 shy of Apollo’s all-cash offer price.

-15.63386953044596," Exclusive: Buyout firm Apollo in advanced talks to buy LifePoint Health - sources (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N is in advanced talks to acquire LifePoint Health Inc LPNT.O, in its latest bid to consolidate the rural U.S. hospital sector, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The deal could value LifePoint at close to $6 billion, including debt, the sources said. It would come as weak admission trends, pressures on Medicaid funding and increased efforts by private U.S. insurers to reduce healthcare costs are driving hospital operators to seek merger partners that will give them more scale to tackle these issues. LifePoint shares rose 36 percent to $64.85 on the news in after-hours trading on Friday. Apollo plans to merge LifePoint with another regional hospital operator that it owns, RegionalCare Hospital Partners, according to the sources. Apollo declined to comment, while LifePoint did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It would be by far the biggest acquisition for Apollo this year. LifePoint currently has a market capitalization of $1.9 billion and long-term net debt of $2.9 billion. If the negotiations are completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that it was possible talks could fail at the last minute. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Based in Brentwood, Tennessee, LifePoint operates hospitals in around 70 communities across 22 states, focusing largely on small towns and rural areas. Rural healthcare providers such as LifePoint have been challenged in recent years because their reliance on federal insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid has made them particularly vulnerable to changing reimbursement programs. In addition, hospital operating costs have been rising faster than reimbursement rate increases. Nevertheless, LifePoint has been a relatively strong performer in the rural healthcare space, buying up underperforming facilities and streamlining operations through targeted investments, according to Morningstar Inc analysts. LifePoint shares, however, have remained under pressure, losing around a quarter of their value in the past 12 months. “LifePoint has a high level of committed capital expenditures, which will weaken free cash flow and interest coverage metrics over the next 12-18 months,” Moody’s Investors Service Inc analysts wrote in a research note in March. Many healthcare providers have been bulking up through mergers and acquisitions in recent years in an effort to weather the challenges facing the sector. Recent deals have included the sale of Davita Medical Group to health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N for $4.9 billion in 2017 and the sale of Envision Healthcare to private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N for $5.5 billion earlier this year. Apollo, which raised a $24.6 billion private equity fund last year, acquired RegionalCare in 2015, and merged it with another hospital operator, Capella Healthcare, in 2016."
-12.913588575995055," Apollo Global, CEO Leon Black sued by Caldera Holdings (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management APO.N and its Chief Executive Leon Black are being sued by Caldera Holdings, a venture founded by Imran Siddiqui, a former managing director at the buyout firm, a court filing on Thursday showed. Caldera’s complaint, filed in the New York Supreme Court, alleges that Apollo pursued a campaign of “systematic defamation and interference,” including “disparaging the company in the marketplace.” Caldera is also asking for at least $1.5 billion in damages, according to the filing. “We strongly believe Caldera’s claims completely lack any merit, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously,” Apollo spokesman Charles Zehren said in an emailed statement. Caldera and Apollo's life insurance unit Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N are both bidding for control of American Equity Investment Life Holding Co AEL.N, a U.S. provider of annuities and life insurance products, according to a Financial Times report on Thursday. In May, Iowa-based American Equity said it would explore a sale, attracting interest from firms such as Athene Holding and FGL Holdings FG.N. Thursday's filing alleges that Apollo hindered Caldera from competing with Athene, causing rifts between the company and its investors. Caldera could not be reached for comment, outside regular U.S. business hours."
15.002941018812496," Athene in talks to buy GE's insurance business: FT (Reuters) - Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N, the life insurance affiliate of private equity firm Apollo Global Management APO.N, has expressed interest for buying all or parts of General Electric Co's GE.N long-term care insurance business, the Financial Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. The talks are at an early stage and GE could seek other potential buyers, according to the report here. GE did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Apollo Global and Athene declined to comment. Reuters had reported in May that GE was working with investment bankers to find ways to shed its insurance business, which has caused it to book hefty charges while sparking shareholder lawsuits and an investigation by U.S. regulators. GE said on Tuesday it will spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm Baker Hughes BHGE.N, focusing on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy."
5.13743110398565," Starboard, Apollo seek to invest $131 million in Brazil retailer: source SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Starboard Restructuring Partners and buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N, have proposed to invest in convertible bonds to be issued by Brazilian appliance retailer Maquina de Vendas SA, one source with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. According to the sources, Starboard has committed to injecting 500 million reais ($131 million) into the bonds in Maquina de Vendas, which could later be converted into an undisclosed equity stake. Maquina de Vendas, which has 800 stores in Brazil, restructured 1.5 billion reais in debt with lenders last year. Owners and the banks have been looking for investors for almost two years. Maquina de Vendas, Starboard and Apollo did not immediately comment on the matter. Newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported earlier on Friday Starboard is close to acquiring Maquina de Vendas."
14.753043041478325," Apollo Global reports first quarterly loss in two years (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N reported its first quarterly loss in two years on Thursday, as stock market jitters weighed on its holdings, including a lackluster listing of its home security business ADT Inc ADT.N. Profits have soared at private equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP BX.N in recent years, as a U.S. stock market rally allowed them to sell assets for top dollar. That rally came to an end in the first quarter, amid a trade dispute between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies. Apollo reported an economic net loss of 30 cents per share in the first quarter, steeper than analysts’ average expectations for a loss of 15 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the first quarter of 2017, Apollo reported economic net income per share of 82 cents. Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation of gains or losses in Apollo’s portfolio and is a closely watched measure of earnings for U.S. private equity firms. “Despite some volatility in Apollo’s first quarter results, primarily driven by unrealized losses in our private equity business, we believe Apollo is exceptionally well-positioned for continued long-term growth and profitability across our integrated global investment platform,” Chairman and Chief Executive Leon Black said in a statement. Apollo said its private equity funds depreciated by 2.7 percent during the quarter. By comparison, peer Blackstone disclosed last week its private equity funds appreciated by 6.4 percent in the quarter, while peer Carlyle Group LP CG.O said most of its funds generating performance fees appreciated by 3 percent on average. Apollo launched ADT’s initial public offering earlier this year after buying the company for roughly $7 billion in 2016 and merging it with Protection 1, another security company it owns. However, the IPO proved difficult and ended up pricing at $14 per share, well below target. ADT shares are currently trading at less than $9. Apollo still holds a roughly 85 percent stake in ADT, which has a current market capitalization of $6.517 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Apollo's bottom line was also hit by a the drop in the share price of fixed annuity service provider Athene ATH.N, which was spun out of Apollo in 2016. Distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - was $191.2 million in the first quarter, compared with $317.2 million in the prior quarter. New York-based Apollo’s assets totaled $247.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $248.9 billion the previous quarter, partly because of valuation dips in its private equity portfolio."

16.553906602723103," Exclusive: Apollo Global approaches Xerox about possible acquisition - sources (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox Corp XRX.N to express interest in a possible acquisition, casting new uncertainty over the U.S. printer company's $6.1 billion sale to Japan's Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The development marks the latest twist in Xerox’s saga. On Tuesday, Xerox said its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. Apollo's interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment of John Visentin as the company's new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc PSDO.O, two companies in which Apollo invested. There is no certainty that Apollo’s approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox, while the new board of the latter reviews it. The sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo and Xerox declined to comment, while Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deason declined to comment while Icahn could not be reached for comment. Xerox shares pared losses on news of Apollo’s approach, and were down 5.8 percent at $30.42 on Wednesday afternoon after plunging as much as 8 percent on news of the outcome of Icahn and Deason’s legal challenge. Xerox has a market capitalization of $7 billion. As part of the settlement with Icahn and Deason announced on Tuesday, Xerox said its board of directors would meet immediately to begin evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including ending or restructuring Xerox’s deal with Fujifilm. Icahn and Deason had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been “hopelessly conflicted” in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him. Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents."
