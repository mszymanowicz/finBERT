24.11004188578179," Spectrum Brands partners with CVC in bid for Conair - sources (Reuters) - Consumer products company Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc has partnered with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd in a bid to buy Conair Corporation in a deal which could value the hair-care appliance maker around $2 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. Spectrum Brands and CVC’s consortium is one of a number of interested bidders for Conair, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. Family-owned Conair has been working with financial advisers to explore a sale, according to the sources. CVC declined to comment. Representatives for Spectrum Brands and Conair did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stamford, Connecticut-based Conair was founded in 1959 by Leandro Rizzuto and his parents. The company says it markets its products in over 125 countries and sells personal care products including hair dryers and skin care items. In addition to its flagship Conair products, its brands include appliance maker Cuisinart and BaByliss, a maker of hair styling products. Rizzuto took Conair public in 1972 through an initial public offering, only to take it private 13 years later. He died in 2017, when he was chairman of Conair’s board of directors. Forbes estimated the net worth of the family including Rizzuto at the time around $3.5 billion. Rizzuto’s son, also called Leandro Rizzuto, worked at Conair. He was appointed by the Trump administration as principal officer at the U.S. consulate general in Hamilton, Bermuda earlier this year."
-5.871978030776047," Energizer adds Armor All, STP brands in $1.25 billion Spectrum deal (Reuters) - Consumer products company Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc SPB.N said on Thursday it would sell its global auto care (GAC) business to battery maker Energizer Holdings Inc ENR.N in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $1.25 billion. Energizer said the move will bolster its portfolio with well-known autocare brands such as Armor All, STP motor oils and A/C Pro, as it seeks to diversify and reach more retailers. Energizer will pay Spectrum $937.5 million in cash and $312.5 million in stock. Spectrum Auto Care recorded sales of $465 million in the last fiscal year, accounting for nearly 15 percent of Spectrum Brands’ total annual sales. This will be Energizer’s second deal with Spectrum this year. In January, it proposed to buy the consumer company’s battery and portable lighting business for $2 billion - a deal that is still under regulatory review. To speed up the approval process, Energizer proposed on Thursday to allay the European Commission’s concerns over the acquisition, saying it would divest Europe-based Varta consumer battery business that was part of the deal. That move is expected to reduce original deal’s value to between $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse were Spectrum Brands’ financial advisers while Evercore acted as Energizer’s financial adviser for the GAC business deal. Shares of Spectrum Brands, which makes George Foreman cookware and Remington grooming products, were up 5 percent. Energizer was trading down 1.6 pct."
