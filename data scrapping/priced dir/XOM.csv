20.575339965619563," S&P downgrades Exxon and Chevron on climate risk, dour earnings (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings on Thursday cut the credit ratings of top U.S. oil producers Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips by a notch, citing massive quarterly losses and the pressure to tackle climate change. The ratings slipped to ‘AA-,’ weeks after the agency warned it was considering downgrades for 13 of the world’s largest oil companies due to the rising risk from energy transition and volatile commodity prices. Several oil companies posted billions of dollars in losses in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic brought global travel to a standstill, slashing fuel demand and sending crude prices to historic lows. The sector is also under pressure from investors and pension funds demanding companies to disclose their carbon footprint and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy projects. While companies including Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have announced steps to tackle climate change, S&P said it does not see those “providing material credit differentiation”. Investors are also pressuring the companies to cut spending and focus on dividends and buybacks after the sector amassed massive debts to grow during shale oil’s golden era. S&P has a ‘stable’ outlook on Chevron, widely considered to have the best restraint on spending. ExxonMobil’s outlook is negative, meaning the ratings agency could downgrade its profile again. Exxon last year slashed spending on new projects by nearly a third and outlined plans to cut up to 15% of its workforce, but its debt rose by $21 billion due to expenses and restructuring. S&P expects Exxon to take more actions such as selling assets or further cutting its spending budget to manage its debt."
22.417849411468165," Breakingviews - Chexxon fantasy M&A – who would buy whom? NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron have discussed merging. In the fantasy M&A game, Exxon could in theory buy Chevron at a premium, mostly for stock. But Darren Woods may not be investors’ preferred leader for the combined group. Chevron buying Exxon might bring the right chief executive, with Mike Wirth in charge, but a deal that way around could call for too much leverage. There’s a third, way, too: a $400 billion merger of equals. Exxon is the bigger of the two companies, with a market capitalization of over $210 billion, more than 20% larger than Chevron’s. If it were to offer a 20% premium for its rival, Woods’ Texas-based company could fund the purchase almost entirely with shares and still leave its own shareholders with just over 50% of the combined company, according to a new Breakingviews calculator. And because Chevron has much less debt – and almost as much EBITDA forecast for 2021, according to Refinitiv data – Exxon could close the deal looking less leveraged than it is now. The trouble is that Chevron’s Wirth has proved a better operator, relatively speaking. Since taking the helm in February 2018, shares are off by just over 25% while Exxon’s stock is down by more than 40%. He has also earned the reputation of being a prudent dealmaker, having walked away from buying Anadarko Petroleum at what was a market high. Picking the right boss is key to a successful merger. If either company offers a meaningful premium for the other, even cutting 5% of combined operating costs, more than $3 billion a year, wouldn’t compensate, once taxed and capitalized. The chief executive of the new fossil-fuel giant would have to do more with less capital expenditure, too. But Chevron buying Exxon is a stretch. Wirth would have to issue more than $80 billion of debt so that current shareholders could maintain a majority stake. That would jack up the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at Chexxon to nearly 3 times, more than twice the current level. A merger of equals is the dream answer, ignoring real-world hurdles like antitrust concerns. The market values of the two companies have been converging. Even now they are close enough, at around 55-45, to argue for an equal union. Then it’s a question of sharing out the chief executive and chairman roles, board seats, headquarter locations, and other sensitive goodies. The closer the two get in size, the better the deal looks.

23.602605974809325," Exxon to close Australian refinery (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday it will close its 72-year-old Altona refinery in Australia, the country’s smallest, and convert it to a fuel import terminal as refiners struggle with low demand. The decision by the U.S. oil major will leave Australia with only two refineries, after BP Plc decided to shut its Kwinana facility by April. Ampol Ltd is still reviewing the future of its Lytton refinery. “ExxonMobil’s decision to close its Altona refinery in Victoria is extremely disappointing,” said Angus Taylor, the Australian minister for energy and emissions reduction, in a statement. Global lockdowns and curbs on international travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has cut demand, leaving refiners grappling with losses. Exxon said it took the decision because it was no longer economically viable to continue the refinery. Australia had offered a A$2.3 billion ($1.8 billion) fuel security package to tide over the financial hit facing refineries. Only Viva Energy, operator of what will be Australia’s largest remaining refinery as of April, accepted. Taylor said the closure of Exxon’s refinery would not negatively impact Australian fuel stockholdings. The Altona plant employs around 300 people. ($1 = 1.2922 Australian dollars)"
23.602605974809325," Hess tapped to market Guyana oil as search for partner continues (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Hess Corp has been selected to market two Guyana crude oil shipments as the emerging oil power seeks a permanent partner to handle its share of a major offshore oil find, the country’s vice president said on Tuesday. The South American country has became an oil hotspot after a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp discovered more than 8 billion barrels of oil and gas off its coast. Guyana receives a portion of the consortium’s output, which it then sells. But with no domestic refining nor state oil company, Guyana relies on private companies to market its share. President Irfaan Ali’s government re-launched an advanced search for that partner after taking power last year, receiving 29 bids in October. “The evaluation criteria we believe was set by the Department (of Energy) resulted in the evaluators having to disqualify 28 of the 29,” Guyana Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters on Tuesday, blaming “nonsensical” criteria inherited from the prior government, without elaborating. The only bidder to meet the formula was a unit of Russian oil firm Lukoil, he said, meaning a selection would not have been “competitive.” Instead, Guyana asked Hess, Exxon and China’s CNOOC Ltd - members of the consortium operating the Stabroek offshore block - to submit bids to lift crude from the Liza Destiny floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility. Hess presented the “best terms,” Jagdeo said. A Hess spokesman declined to comment, citing a practice of not publicly discussing commercial arrangements. Exxon also declined to comment and CNOOC did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Lukoil did not respond to a request for comment sent after business hours in Moscow. Guyana’s government had marketed its first three shipments through a short-term deal with Royal Dutch Shell."
24.13494871872837," Exxon says it has cut Guyana crude output due to gas compressor failure GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it had reduced crude output levels at the Liza Destiny floating platform off Guyana’s coast after a gas compressor failed. The company, which owns a 45% stake in the Stabroek block where Liza is located, did not specify current production levels. Hess Corp, one of Exxon’s partners in the block with a 30% stake, said in an earnings call last week that production had reached full capacity of 120,000 barrels per day (bpd). Exxon said it would send the compressor to Germany for repairs, where it was set to arrive on Feb. 9. “The full extent of the damage will not be known until a detailed inspection of the compressor can take place at the workshop of the manufacturer, MAN Turbo in Germany,” the company said in a statement. Exxon, which operates the Stabroek block, had last year limited output due to problems with the reinjection of natural gas. Guyanese authorities have said they expect the consortium not to routinely flare natural gas extracted alongside crude oil, heightening the importance of gas reinjection. The consortium led by Exxon, in which China’s CNOOC Ltd also has a 25% stake, has made 18 discoveries in the Stabroek block totaling more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, making the South American country the world’s newest energy hotspot. Production began in December 2019."

26.146980647069885," Pandemic pushes Exxon to historic annual loss, $20 billion cut in shale value HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Tuesday posted a historic annual loss after the COVID-19 pandemic hammered energy prices and the company reduced the value of shale gas properties by more than $20 billion. Exxon last year slashed spending on new projects by nearly a third, outlined plans to cut up to 15% of its workforce while adding $21 billion to its debt to cover spending and restructuring. The changes come amid “the most challenging market conditions Exxon has ever experienced,” said Chief Executive Darren Woods, and over time will cut costs by $6 billion a year compared to 2019. The company reported a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, on the writedown and losses in oil production and refining, compared with a full-year profit of $14.34 billion in 2019. Exxon declined to comment if it has ever had an annual loss, but the company churned out profits since Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999 and through the 1980s oil bust. The company remains under fire from environmentalists and activist investors pushing for a board overhaul and a strategy that would transition to cleaner fuels. Exxon pushed back against their calls for clean energy expertise, naming the former head of Malaysia’s state oil company, Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, to its board. It is in discussions with other candidates, the company added. Other oil majors posted losses for the year as pandemic-related travel restrictions cut fuel demand and triggered huge writedowns. Rivals BP Plc and Chevron Corp posted annual losses. Royal Dutch Shell Plc reports financial results Thursday. Exxon posted a net loss of $20.2 billion, or $4.70 per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago. Excluding the impairment and other charges, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of a one-cent gain, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Exxon shares, which have lost a quarter of their value in the past 12 months, rose 1.6% to $45.62 on Tuesday. “The turnaround story will take some time,” said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting that the company is not yet covering its dividend and capital spending with cash from operations. But with oil prices recovering, Exxon can start to cover dividend and begin paying down the $68 billion in debt on its balance sheet, Woods said. Oil is up 11% so far this year, and trading at pre-pandemic levels. Exxon still has “plenty of wood to chop” but the willingness to cut costs to pay the dividend will play well with investors, said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds. Project spending fell nearly a third last year and this year will near the bottom of the company’s $16 billion to $19 billion forecast, Woods said. Spending will rise to as much as $25 billion from 2022 through 2025, he said. Exxon’s oil and gas output was 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day in the fourth quarter, down 8% compared with a year earlier. It projects a doubling of Permian Basin output to 700,000 barrels per day by 2025, down from the million-barrel target it previously had expected to hit by 2024 in the top U.S. shale field, Woods said. Exploration and production, Exxon’s largest business, lost $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter on the natural gas asset impairments, compared with a profit of $6.1 billion the year prior. Its chemicals business earned $691 million on better margins in part from lower oil prices, up from a loss of $355 million a year ago. Refining lost $1.2 billion, compared with a profit of $898 million last year, on weak margins and lower output as the pandemic limited global travel. The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale oil and gas producer XTO Energy. The move to shake up its board comes as Exxon faces a proxy fight with hedge fund Engine No. 1, which has proposed four candidates and wants the board to include clean-energy experience. “Exxon Mobil shareholders deserve a board that works proactively to create long-term value, not defensively in the face of deteriorating returns and the threat of losing their seats,” Engine No.1 said in a statement.

31.09553774327208," U.N. bid to avert oil spill off Yemen uncertain as Houthis mull 'review' NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group has advised the United Nations to pause preparations to deploy a team to assess a decaying oil tanker threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn country’s coast, a U.N. spokesman said on Tuesday. The tanker Safer has been stranded off Yemen’s Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years, and U.N. officials have warned it could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska. Houthi authorities gave long-awaited approval in November for a visit to assess the tanker. A U.N. team, which includes a private company contracted by the world body to do the work, was aiming to travel to the tanker early next month. But U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that time line was now uncertain amid U.N. concerns about signals from the Houthis that they are considering a “review” of their formal approval of the tanker mission. “Houthi officials have advised the U.N. to pause certain preparations pending the outcome of such process, which would create further delays to the mission,” he said in a statement. He said the United Nations had so far spent $3.35 million on preparing for the mission. The world body also has to lease a technically equipped vessel, but needs a letter from the Houthis with security assurances. “We regret that, to date, we have not received a response to our multiple requests for this letter, the lack of which would increase the cost of the mission by hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Dujarric said. Houthi-run Al Masirah TV last week quoted a senior Houthi official as saying the United Nations had made additional requests that had not been part of an agreed framework. “Their new requests are related to their financial relationship with insurance firms and we will not get involved in matters that do not concern us,” the Houthi official said. Last month, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The United Nations is also reviewing whether that could affect the tanker mission. A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country’s suffering is also worsened by an economic crisis, currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic."

The rideshare-and-delivery firm is buying the online alcohol dispatch service for $1.1 billion, mostly in stock. Liquor retailers may feel the after-effects for years to come, even if the $105 billion Uber doesn’t. Uber’s shares, aided by soaring food deliveries during the pandemic, are up 50% in a year. Its enterprise value to forward sales is now a more than 40% premium to ride-sharing competitor Lyft. Drizly, which lets shoppers buy branded drinks from local retailers for rapid delivery, has also experienced a bonanza. In May, for example, sales were five times what it says it would normally expect. It makes sense that Uber would use one inflated valuation to buy another. Yet the deal could be significant. Uber’s delivery service has already brought restaurants into its sphere of influence. Drizly will add convenience stores too, giving them a new sales channel – but also more intense competition. Drizly is an add-on for Uber, but for thousands of small businesses in its target market, it could be the beginning of an altered state. (By John Foley) ACT TWO. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has found a new gig. He has formed Ross Acquisition Corp II, a blank-check company that hopes to raise up to $300 million in an initial public offering.

Another former Trumper, Gary Cohn, raked in 20% more than expected for his special-purpose acquisition company at $720 million. But he had his Goldman Sachs pedigree behind him, too, and left midway through Trump’s term. Ross, 83, was a respected billionaire who made his fortune in steel companies and auto parts.

Matt Comyn, chief executive of Australia’s largest lender Commonwealth Bank, said on Monday he hopes treating customers properly and helping shield the economy from the worst impact of the pandemic “has gone some way” to doing so. Two years after a scathing Royal Commission report lambasted the country’s banks, clients are somewhat more satisfied with them than they were in 2019, according to market research firm Roy Morgan. Even so, redemption can take a long time. U.S. watchdogs’ efforts in 2016 to tackle the crummy banking cultures that the 2008 financial crisis laid bare came just as Wells Fargo’s fake-accounts fiasco erupted.

A wandering eye can cause problems in any union. It seems to be the biggest gripe Elliott Management has with Finnish insurer Sampo, which gobbled up UK peer Hastings Insurance Services amid the pandemic last year. Paul Singer’s fund, which owns a 3% stake in the 20 billion euro insurer, laid out a list of demands on Tuesday including a call to avoid any new deals outside the Nordics. It also wants Sampo to distribute half its 4.3 billion euro stake in Nordea Bank to shareholders. The Hastings deal has done little for Sampo’s stock market rating.

The company reported a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, on the write down and losses in oil production and refining, compared with a full-year profit of $14.34 billion in 2019. Exxon shares rose 2% to $45.80% at market open. The company remains under fire from environmentalists and activist investors pushing for a board overhaul and a strategy to transition to cleaner fuels. Exxon pushed back against their calls for clean energy expertise, naming the former head of Malaysia’s state oil company, Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, to its board. It is in discussions with other candidates, the company added. Other oil majors posted losses for the year as pandemic-related travel restrictions cut fuel demand and triggered huge writedowns. Rivals BP and Chevron posted annual losses. Royal Dutch Shell reports financial results Thursday. Exxon posted a net loss of $20.2 billion, or $4.70 per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago. Excluding the impairment and other charges, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of a one-cent gain, according to Refinitiv IBES data. “The turnaround story will take some time,” said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting that the company is not yet covering its dividend and capital spending with cash from operations. Exxon’s oil and gas output was 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day in the quarter, down 8% compared with a year earlier. Exploration and production, Exxon’s largest business, lost $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter on the natural gas asset impairments, compared with a profit of $6.1 billion the year prior. Its chemicals business earned $691 million on better margins in part from lower oil prices, up from a loss of $355 million a year ago. Refining lost $1.2 billion, compared with profit of $898 million last year, on weak margins and lower output as the pandemic limited global travel. The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale oil and gas producer XTO Energy. The writedown also included properties in Argentina and Canada. The move to add a board member comes as Exxon looks to burnish its environmental credentials as hedge fund Engine No. 1 leads a proxy fight to nominate four candidates to Exxon’s board. “ExxonMobil shareholders deserve a board that works proactively to create long-term value, not defensively in the face of deteriorating returns and the threat of losing their seats,” Engine No.1 said in a statement. On Monday, Exxon said it would invest $3 billion on lower emission solutions through 2025 and created a business that will focus on commercializing its carbon capture technology. (The story corrects annual loss to previously reported net annual loss of $22.4 billion.)"

29.59053090882931," Exxon, Chevron CEOs discussed merger in early 2020 - sources (Reuters) - The chief executives of ExxonMobil Corp and Chevron Corp held preliminary talks in early 2020 to explore combining the two largest U.S. oil producers in what would have been the biggest merger of all time, according to people familiar with the matter. The discussions, which are no longer active, are indicative of the pressure the energy sector’s most dominant companies faced as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and crude prices plunged. The talks between Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted, one of the sources said. The reason the talks ended could not be learned. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment. Exxon and Chevron’s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxon’s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the company’s long-term profitability and spending decisions. In their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000. Following the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October. A proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last November’s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all. Now, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector. Biden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035. The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. News of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction. Engine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxon’s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance. Exxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results. A combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil. Despite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United States’ best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the world’s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said. Last year’s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output. U.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene. Exxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection. Yet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemic’s spread. At one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel. Exxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982."
29.59053090882931," Wall Street analysts say Chevron merger talks a sideshow before Exxon loss (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts on Monday gave little credence to the possibility of an Exxon-Chevron mega merger, as news of talks last year between the two largest U.S. oil companies leaked ahead of Exxon’s results that are expected to show the company posting its first-ever annual loss. Shares in both the companies were down in early trading in New York, despite a rising overall market and weekend gains in global crude prices. “At the depths of the market last year... a cost cutting focused merger of the two companies may have made sense and also scale matters in this industry so it would have created by far the largest integrated oil company,” said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors. However, anti-trust concerns and the new U.S. administration’s stance on big mergers make it unlikely that a deal resurfaces, Kapadia said, adding that buying smaller, hard-hit oil companies gives Exxon and Chevron more value. As oil producers in Europe adapt to investors’ push for a shift into renewables, it is also possible that Chevron or Exxon could buy the oil producing business of a European major in the coming years, Kapadia said. Exxon’s year-end results scheduled for Tuesday are expected to be marred by a charge of up to $20 billion on the value of its natural gas properties. The collapse in oil prices last April briefly pushed crude into negative territory and created a survival crisis for large parts of the U.S. industry. “Given the precipitous drop (last year)... it is not surprising that XOM and CVX had a discussion about merging,” said Mark Stoeckle, CEO of Baltimore-based Adams Funds. “The sharp snapback in prices likely cooled both companies. There would no doubt be significant cost synergies to be had, but the antitrust issues in a Biden administration would probably be too much to overcome.”"

The group, which includes pension funds, faith-based investors as well traditional money managers, came together in the two months since two activist investors called on Exxon to cut costs, invest in more profitable drilling and clean energy, the people said. The coalition worries that Exxon may not grasp the full extent of shareholder concern and believes the company must take more forceful action now, one of the sources said. Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Engine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, this week formally launched a proxy fight that it announced in early December. It nominated four directors to Exxon’s board and is pushing the company, valued at $195 billion, to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Engine No. 1 said Exxon needs independent board members “to ensure a clean break from a strategy and mindset that have led to years of value destruction.” Its campaign is being backed by the California State Teachers Retirement Fund. Exxon has been speaking with Engine No. 1 since December. Additional pressure is coming from New York-based hedge fund DE Shaw which also wants to the company to preserve its dividend by cutting spending but has stayed out of the limelight.

The company has been relying on its investment in offshore Guyana, one of the world’s most important oil and gas blocks in the last decade, which is being developed by a consortium led by oil major Exxon Mobil Corp . Hess has allotted $780 million, or 41% of its budget, to development activities in offshore Guyana. “We also will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program, with 12-15 wells planned on the Stabroek Block (offshore Guyana),” said Chief Operating Officer Greg Hill. Hess forecast net production to average about 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2021, excluding Libya, compared with 2020 estimate of 325,000 boepd. For 2020, the New York-based energy company had estimated to spend $1.8 billion. The company will also add a rig in the first quarter in North Dakota’s Bakken shale play, adding to a single rig there since May. There were six rigs in the Bakken at the start of last year before the company slashed production to cope with a oil price crash. Bakken net production is estimated to average about 170,000 boepd in 2021, which despite the addition of a rig, would be below 2020’s estimated 190,000 boepd, partly hit by a planned 45-day turnaround activity at the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter cutting output by about 7,500 boepd in 2021.

The world’s biggest oil company’s self-reported carbon footprint might nearly double, adding as much as 55 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to its annual tally, if those facilities are included, according to the report. Much of the omissions are because Aramco chooses to report data from facilities it wholly owns and ones located inside the kingdom, Bloomberg News said, while many of its refineries are joint ventures or located overseas. (bloom.bg/2Mevios) Aramco said in a statement that it uses globally accepted guidelines to report the data and has “a clear and deliberate path to increase the scope and details of this disclosure.” The company said it would disclose this year direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 from wholly-owned operations in the kingdom and worldwide, subject to verification by a third party. Aramco’s 2019 emissions would have been between 75 million tons and 113 million tons if missing emissions are included, according to Bloomberg News’ calculations based on data from a Nature Climate Change study published last year.

21.00156592369408," Exxon says latest Guyana well did not find oil in target area Jan 15 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday that its latest exploration well in the prolific Stabroek block off Guyana’s coast did not find oil in its target area, the second setback to its drilling campaign in recent months. Exxon, which operates the Stabroek block in a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, has made 18 discoveries in the area totaling more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, making the South American country the world’s newest energy hotspot. “The Hassa-1 exploration well in the Stabroek block did not encounter hydrocarbons in the primary target reservoirs,” an Exxon spokesman said in a statement, adding that the well did encounter hydrocarbons in other intervals. “We remain committed to evaluating the potential in our offshore Guyana blocks.” The disappointment at Hassa-1 comes after Exxon said in November its crude discovery at the Tanager-1 well was not financially viable on its own. The well was the first Exxon drilled in the Kaieteur block, which is adjacent to Stabroek. Production at the Liza-1 well in the Stabroek block began in December 2019. The well is currently producing some 120,000 barrels per day."
21.00156592369408," U.N. says U.S. blacklisting of Yemen group may hinder bid to avert oil spill NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations is concerned that a U.S. plan to blacklist Yemen’s Houthi movement on Tuesday will hinder its efforts to assess a decaying oil tanker that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn country’s coast. The tanker Safer has been stranded off Yemen’s Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years, and U.N. officials have warned it could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska. Houthi authorities gave long-awaited approval in November for a visit to assess the tanker. A U.N. team, which includes a private company contracted by the world body to do the work, aims to travel to the tanker early next month. “We are continuing to prepare for the Safer tanker assessment and are broadly on track with this work,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday. “However we have to look at potential impact of the (U.S. designation) on the Safer mission – there are questions about potential legal jeopardy for the people who are going to do the mission, which of course we all want to avoid,” he said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the move against the Iran-aligned Houthis on Sunday. It will come into effect next Tuesday, the last full day in office of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office next Wednesday. The designation could be revoked by Biden’s administration. The Houthis control the area where the tanker is moored and the national oil firm that owns it. The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement. U.N. officials are worried the designation will scare private-sector companies away from any business related to Yemen. When asked about the U.N. concerns about the tanker mission, a State Department spokesperson said: “We have expressed our readiness to work with relevant officials at the United Nations, with international and nongovernmental organizations, and other international donors to address sanction implications.” Washington has said it will issue licenses and exemptions to allow the United Nations and aid groups to continue working in Yemen, which the United Nations describes as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the people in need. But top U.N. officials have said little is known about possible exemptions and warned that the U.S. move would push Yemen, which relies almost solely on imports, into a large-scale famine and chill peace efforts. A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country’s suffering is also worsened by an economic crisis, currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic."
21.00156592369408," SEC launches probe of Exxon on U.S. shale asset valuation: WSJ (Reuters) - The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of Exxon Mobil Corp following a whistleblower complaint that the oil major over-valued a key asset in the top U.S. shale field, the Wall street Journal reported on Friday. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods has pinned much of the company’s growth prospects on the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, and two years ago pitted the company against rival Chevron Corp in a race to reach 1 million barrels of oil and gas per day in the field. The Exxon target grabbed the spotlight on the day Chevron was meeting with investors and analysts to make its own Permian case. Woods told investors that Exxon could earn a double-digit returns in the Permian, even at $35-per-barrel oil. Exxon shares were down 4% at $48.29 in midday trading. Several people involved in valuing the Exxon Permian asset during an internal assessment in 2019 said employees were being forced to use unrealistic assumptions about how quickly the company could drill wells there to arrive at a higher value, the report said. (on.wsj.com/2LzpVjX) “Actual and provable performance exceeded drilling plans for the Permian, and such performance has been accurately represented to the investment community,” Exxon spokesman Casey Norton told Reuters on Friday via email. “Historically, the company’s unconventional drilling performance has increased in short timeframes as engineers and planners gather more data in basins across its portfolio.” The SEC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. “It does not surprise me that there may have been some pressure to inflate assumptions in the Permian,” said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “Over the last few years there was clearly an incentive for many companies to make that play look as attractive as possible.” Some Exxon managers in 2018 had initially pegged the net present value of the Delaware Basin in Permian at about $60 billion, the Journal reported in September. But a few employees involved in Exxon’s annual development planning estimated the value was closer to $40 billion in 2019. When employees delivered the new number, they were asked to “claw back” some of the lost value by using different assumptions, including a more optimistic “learning curve” that estimated the rate at which they would improve drilling times, the WSJ report said, citing the whistleblower complaint. Some employees objected to using the new learning curve, which they viewed as unrealistic, it said. The value was ultimately adjusted to about $50 billion, the report added. At least one employee who complained was fired last year, the WSJ said, citing a person familiar with the matter. The largest U.S. oil producer posted losses in the first three quarters of 2020 on an ill-timed spending increase that collided with a downturn in fuel demand and prices. To cope, the company has cut employees and project spending. Exxon slashed 2020 spending in the Permian to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, and said it would cut the number of drilling rigs working there from 55 to 15 or fewer. Last month, Exxon also signaled a writedown of up to $20 billion, mostly related to its natural gas properties."

17.009663375064594," J.P. Morgan turns positive as Exxon cuts win back Wall Street (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan was the latest major U.S. investment bank to turn positive on Exxon Mobil on Wednesday, just months after its removal from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average capped a catastrophic year for America’s major oil producers. The shift to an “overweight” rating by the bank was the first time in seven years that J.P. Morgan had outright recommended investors bet on Exxon, dating back to the drop in oil prices below $100 in mid-2014. Since 2014, the oil major’s shares have more than halved, while the S&P 500 index has more than doubled. Morgan Stanley also upgraded the company to “overweight” on Monday, while Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo both issued positive recommendations last month, a sign of Wall Street’s approval of radical cuts the company has made in spending as well as how much its share price has fallen since last March. “Improved transparency, cost reduction actions and increased investor pressure could all serve to push Exxon to put up more consistent results,” J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh said in a note. Gresh is rated a maximum five stars for accuracy by Refinitiv and J.P. Morgan is one of 8 brokerages that rate the stock “buy” or higher, while 15 rate it “hold” and another 4 “sell” or lower. The oil sector was among the most heavily sold in last year’s coronavirus sell-off, and has struggled to recover since as a wave of bankruptcies, asset writedowns and dividend cuts shook confidence in the sector. Exxon was briefly overtaken by NextEra Energy Inc, the world’s biggest provider of wind and solar energy, to become the top energy company by market value in the United States. But global crude prices have now more than doubled from lows a year ago and analysts are beginning to believe that the worst of the bloodletting is over. Gresh and his colleagues praised Exxon’s promise to limit capital expenditure at $20 billion to $25 billion until 2025 and raised their price target for the stock to $56 from $50. Goldman Sachs had also cited upside from the oil major’s chemicals business and its operations in Guyana, as well as improved free cash flow, and constructive view on crude. Exxon’s shares were up 0.9% at $48.32."
28.439319682457047," Exxon, under investor pressure, discloses emissions from burning its fuels (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, under increasing pressure from investors and climate change activists, reported for the first time the emissions that result when customers use its products such as gasoline and jet fuel. The largest U.S. oil producer said the emissions from its product sales in 2019 were equivalent to 730 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, higher than rival oil majors. The data comes as the company has drawn the ire of an activist investor focused on its climate performance. The so-called Scope 3 data is included in its latest Energy & Carbon Summary released Tuesday, though Exxon downplayed its significance. ""Scope 3 emissions do not provide meaningful insight into the Company's emission-reduction performance,"" the report said. (Report: exxonmobil.co/3hL6Tmo) “Even to get to the point of having them disclose this has been like pulling teeth,” said Andrew Grant at think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative. “Quite a lot of the rest of the world has moved on from the disclosure to ‘What are we going to do about this?’” Most major oil companies already report Scope 3 emissions and some have reduction targets, including Occidental Petroleum, which in November set a goal to offset the impact of the use of its oil and gas by 2050. Exxon said it made the disclosure due to investor interest. “They’re seeking dollars against companies that are disclosing Scope 3,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a non-profit shareholder activist group. “I don’t think they have any choice.” By 2025, Exxon targets reducing the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions. It has not set an overall emissions target, though, so emissions could rise if production grows. Last month, activist firm Engine No. 1 called for expanded spending and pay cuts, a board shake-up and shift to cleaner fuels. Its views are supported by California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Church of England, and echoed in part by hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management."
37.74410448580133," Exxon signals up to $20 billion writedown to overwhelm 4th-qtr gains in oil, chemicals HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp signaled in a regulatory filing that higher oil and gas prices and improved chemicals margins would aid fourth quarter results, but the gains would be overshadowed by an up to $20 billion asset writedown. The largest U.S. oil producer has posted losses in the first three quarters of 2020 on an ill-timed spending increase that collided with a downturn in fuel demand and prices. It faces a proxy fight next year by an activist investor calling for deeper cuts, new directors and a refocusing on cleaner fuels. The filing after the market closed on Wednesday showed Exxon expects higher prices will sequentially lift its oil and gas operating results by between $200 million and $1 billion. That business suffered a $383 million operating loss in the third quarter. The filing also signaled another operating loss in refining, but higher chemicals margins drove operating profit in that unit by between $200 million and $400 million. In the prior quarter, refining posted a $231 million loss while chemicals turned a $661 million profit. The writedown of mostly natural gas properties was previously estimated at between $17 billion and $20 billion and the filing narrowed the range of the impairment charge. Exxon last year began providing a snapshot of its key businesses after the end of each quarter to give investors insight into operations. Many of those prior updates led Wall Street to lower profit forecasts. Official results are scheduled to be released Feb. 2. During the final quarter, the company outlined plans for deeper cost cuts that will chop capital spending by at least $10 billion this year and next, and the first stages of a 15% workforce reduction that will continue through next December. Adjusted fourth-quarter loss could hit $3.47 billion, or 61 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data, compared with a year-earlier profit of $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share.

37.56022321583307," Exxon eyes investing over $240 million in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery -governor HOUSTON (Reuters) -Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said Exxon Mobil Corp is considering investing more than $240 million in its 517,700-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. Exxon is contemplating several projects to increase flexibility in crude oils the refinery can process and to reduce pollution at the refinery, Edwards said in a statement released on Wednesday. Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said, “the projects under evaluation would enable the processing of domestic crudes and help reduce emissions.” Exxon plans to make an investment decision about the projects in 2021, Edwards said. Exxon is carrying out a multibillion-dollar expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery to run crude oil coming from the Permian Basin in Texas. Before the decision to begin the addition of an another crude distillation unit, Exxon invested in a smaller project to test its feasibility. “This suite of projects positions our site for future investment at our refinery and chemical plants in Baton Rouge,” said Plant Manager Gloria Moncada in a statement. The projects, if carried out, would add 600 construction jobs and provide an additional $5 million in sale tax and $40 million property tax revenue, Edwards said. In November 2019, Exxon broke ground on a $500-million polypropylene project at the Baton Rouge Polyolefins Plant, which adjoins the refinery."
45.4655488223687," Exxon Mobil, under pressure on climate, aims to cut emissions intensity by 2025 (Reuters) - Oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, under increasing pressure from investors and climate change campaigners, said on Monday it planned to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions over the next five years. Last Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil company’s transition to cleaner fuels. Several of Exxon’s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Exxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline. By 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows. The reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxon’s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said. Since the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxon’s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin. “We certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,” Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday. “What we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.” Further goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said. ‘NOTABLE TURN’ The targets are “encouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,” said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies. “They had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.” The new targets do not address product emissions, a “main source of risk,” said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. “At a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.” Exxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels. Last week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels.

42.35429698019684," Exxon Mobil to cut 700 jobs in Houston -government notice (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will lay off more than 700 workers in the Houston area, according to a notice it sent to the Texas Workforce Commission posted on Friday. The largest U.S. oil producer had previously said it would cut its global workforce by about 15%, or around 14,000 jobs, including deep cuts in the United States. Exxon and other oil companies have been slashing costs due to a collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic and ill-timed bets on new projects. The layoff date is Feb. 2, according to the notice. The 700 jobs are part of around 1,900 U.S. cuts anticipated, which the company has said would come mainly from its Houston-area campus, the headquarters for its U.S. oil and gas businesses. Exxon last month said it would write down the value of natural gas properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment, and slash project spending next year to its lowest level in 15 years.

42.35429698019684," Tiny activist investor's arguments against Exxon draw crowd to its side BOSTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, a giant of the energy world and once the world’s most valuable company, is being pressured by a small investment company whose campaign for spending cuts and management change has been gathering more supporters. Exxon has fended off past challenges seeking big change to its policies and leadership. But faltering returns - its shares are off 40% in the last five years and losses through September have reached $2.37 billion - could swing more holders behind the activist, say investors and analysts. Engine No. 1, a week-old, $250 million California-based firm, has called for expanded spending and pay cuts, a board shake-up and shift to cleaner fuels. Its views are supported by California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), the Church of England, and echoed in part by hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management. “Management and board members regularly engage with our shareholders on a range of topics and value their constructive perspectives,” but they do not share details of such conversations, Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said. The company supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, is working to reduce emissions and has been “encouraged by feedback” on recent plans to improve performance and returns, he added. “This firm is not making a climate change argument but a financial argument, saying your performance is terrible,” said sustainability expert Robert Eccles, a professor at Said Business School at Oxford University. “The world is moving against Exxon, and I think the activists can win this.” For CalSTRS, the second-largest U.S. pension fund with $255 billion in assets, its support of Engine No. 1 mirrors an earlier union, when it backed hedge fund Jana Partners in a successful push for Apple to add parental controls to its phones. Charles Penner, a former Jana partner who is spearheading the battle and has known CalSTRS for years, won its backing by arguing Exxon’s spending and dismissive attitude toward climate issues cost it investor support, a person familiar with his thinking said. He also wanted to make a statement with the challenge to Exxon, considering it is the biggest and worst performer among its peers, the person said. “This is not about the size of your stake but about the value and credibility of your argument,” said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer at CalSTRS. “This is a company that needs change inside the boardroom.” While Exxon’s board is diverse, having female and minority directors, it needs energy industry experts such as Engine No. 1’s candidates, she said. The Church of England, which brought climate-related and management change proposals to Exxon holders in the past, lent its support to Engine No. 1’s pitch on Thursday. New York state’s $226 billion pension fund, which has joined Church of England shareholder proposals in the past, said this week it would start pulling money out of oil and gas companies whose business plans do not align with the Paris climate accord. And D.E. Shaw sent its own letter with criticisms to Exxon. “It’s not surprising someone is pushing for change because it has been underperforming Chevron and peers for a long time. To the extent D.E. Shaw can accelerate this process, I would say it’s positive and should be helpful to shareholders,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. D.E. Shaw declined to comment. Engine No. 1 owns about $40 million in Exxon shares, a fraction of the $12 billion that Exxon’s top investor Vanguard Group,oversees. To some, that miniscule holding might put it at a disadvantage in waging a proxy contest that can costs $20 million. Exxon is valued at $184 billion and its share price has climbed to $43.46 this week. But some analysts believe the fund may have found its match in Exxon. “You can win proxy contests with very small stakes and the way you do it is by using your opponent’s weight against him,” said a person who advises companies against activists but could not be publicly identified."

The Church Commissioners, who manage the Church of England’s investment fund, said they were “pleased to lend their support” to proposals from new hedge fund Engine No 1 designed to “re-energise ExxonMobil”. Exxon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment. Engine No. 1, launched 10 days ago, sent a letter to Exxon this week outlining its plan to nominate four directors to the company’s board and asking the company to cut more costs to preserve its dividend. Investors have been unsuccessfully pressing Exxon on climate change for years now, and the Church of England, New York state’s pension fund and Legal & General Investment Management backed a call this year to split the CEO and chairman roles at the company. That proposal received 32.7% votes in May, down from 41% last year. This year, however, the pressure on Exxon has risen exponentially as the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed fuel demand and sent oil prices to record lows. On Wednesday, Reuters reported hedge fund D.E.

Engine No. 1 is being supported by pension fund California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) as it pushes the battered energy company, valued at $176 billion, to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and refresh its board. “The industry and the world it operates in are changing and ... Exxon Mobil must change as well,” Engine No. 1 wrote to Exxon’s board, adding “given the company’s long-running underperformance and the challenges it faces, it is time for shareholders to weigh in.” Exxon is reviewing the hedge fund’s letter, an Exxon spokesman said. The U.S. oil company this year reversed course on a massive oil and gas expansion program, cutting 30% from its spending plan and proposing a budget next year that is $4 billion to $7 billion below its outlays this year. It also plans to reduce its workforce by 14,000 people over the next two years as losses this year reached $2.37 billion. Engine No. 1 faces a tough road. Exxon has beaten back past activist efforts to change its climate stance and to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. But industry analysts also said the time may be right for traditional activists’ interest to overlap with climate activists’ interest and force Exxon to act. “There is a need for a fairly active reset right now,” said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a non profit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. “Everyone starts at the bottom of the hill with Exxon but Engine No. 1’s director nominees is not a list of flaky people.” The activist investment firm, launched last week by two hedge fund industry veterans, said it plans to nominate four directors to Exxon’s 10-person board who have expertise in clean technology and running energy companies: Gregory Goff, Kaisa Hietala, Alexander Karsner, and Anders Runevad. “Exxon’s refusal to adequately address climate risk is of serious concern to many shareholders and is a sign of significant governance issues. The company’s board needs overhauling. We’re looking forward to reviewing the slate of new directors,” said New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, whose fund owns a roughly $300 million stake, according to Refinitiv data. Besides pushing Exxon to add new directors with more relevant energy industry experience to the board, the investment firm also wants Exxon to cut costs on projects that are unlikely to earn money, create a better plan for success in the renewable energy sector and to overhaul management compensation to better align with shareholder value creation, the letter said. Exxon has long faced investor pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but this is the first time an activist firm is mounting a proxy contest that could resonate with both institutional investors concerned about the company’s direction and retail investors worried about dividends, analysts said. This was the first year since 1982 that Exxon has not raised its dividend and its share price has tumbled 41% in 52 weeks. Its $15 billion a year dividend should be cut because it drains cash that could restructure the business, some analysts said. Engine No. 1 is run by Chris James, best known for technology investing but who also has considerable energy investment experience, and Charles Penner, who led activist investment firm Jana Partner’s campaign against iPhone maker Apple to let parents limit children’s phone in 2018. Engine No. 1 owns roughly $40 million worth of stock in Exxon, according to a person familiar with the investment, while CalSTRS owns roughly $334 million, according to Refinitiv data.The campaign’s success will depend largely on how Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street, the country’s biggest index funds that are also Exxon’s top three shareholders, react. BlackRock and State Street are members of Climate Action 100+, an investor group pressing the largest greenhouse gas emitters to act on climate change. BlackRock this year pressured Exxon by voting against two directors and voting to split the chairman and CEO roles on the board, but the push failed. Exxon shares fell 1.9% to $40.88 in afternoon trading."
51.35380801556383," Breakingviews - Activist minnow needs bigger fish to fry Exxon NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil is the fossil fuel giant that is being attacked by a minnow. Newly formed activist fund Engine No. 1 has taken on the $176 billion oil major, demanding changes. The fund has only about a $40 million stake – or 0.02% to be precise. So Engine needs a few sharks in its corner. Given Exxon’s record of destroying capital and ignoring shareholders, that shouldn’t be hard. Once the biggest American public company, the Texas-based oil driller is now well down the list. Over the past decade, it has spent $15 billion more on dividends and capital expenditure than cash generated by its business. The result has been a steadily growing debt load and steeply underperforming stock price. The share price has declined about 40% since the start of the year alone, and the company has underperformed rival oil majors over the past five years. The firm recently begrudgingly acknowledged oil’s difficulties. Next year’s capital spending will fall to between $16 billion and $19 billion. But Chief Executive Darren Woods still says 2025 spending could surpass this year’s roughly $23 billion. And shareholders pleas to consider a greener future hasn’t been met with enthusiasm. Woods rarely joins earnings calls. An initiative passed by shareholders to produce a climate report has resulted in no substantive changes to its business. Engine No. 1 has sensible recommendations. It wants Exxon to appoint new independent directors with outside energy experience, invest only in projects with lower break-even oil and gas prices, consider using existing skills and scale to invest in growing areas such as renewable energy, and change compensation policy that has resulted in Woods’ pay increasing about 35% over the past two years, according to the activist. Still Exxon may not be inclined to give in, so Engine has to enlist others. It already has the California State Teachers’ Retirement System on board, which owns a $300 million stake in Exxon. But BlackRock could be next in line. The fund giant’s boss Larry Fink has said that climate change is fundamentally altering investing, and the investment manager voted earlier this year to split Exxon’s two top roles. That could be a big enough fish to fry Exxon."
51.35380801556383," CORRECTED-Exxon faces proxy fight launched by new activist firm Engine No. 1 (Corrects to remove “proxy firm” reference in paragraph 2) Dec 7 (Reuters) - Engine No. 1 LLC, an investment firm newly launched by hedge fund industry veteran Chris James, on Monday asked Exxon Mobil Corp to focus more on investments in clean energy and plans to nominate four directors to the oil major’s board. Engine No. 1 said it has the backing of pension investor California State Teachers’ Retirement System (Calsters), which has a stake valued over $300 million in the Irving, Texas-based Exxon. Oil and gas producers, under pressure from investors who want to see the industry operate more cleanly, have announced new emission targets this year even as they slash spending and production following a coronavirus-driven plunge in crude prices. In the letter sent to the company’s board, Engine No. 1 has called on Exxon to add independent directors with diversified energy-industry experience and reduce capex, especially on projects unlikely to break even with sustained low oil and gas prices. It also suggests the oil major should formulate a plan to invest in growing renewable energy space and realign management incentives.

48.981295492392455," Russia's Nornickel says it will spend $600 million collecting Soviet-era Arctic waste MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel, hit by a fuel spill at an Arctic power station in May, will spend $600 million by 2030 collecting Soviet-era waste around its Arctic sites, it said on Tuesday. The spill, which Greenpeace has compared to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, released 21,000 tonnes of diesel from a rusty-looking fuel tank into rivers and soil near the city of Norilsk in Siberia. “Lessons have been learned from the recent environmental incident,” Nornickel said in a statement. It cleaned up the area after the spill and set aside $2 billion for environmental damage claim by the country’s watchdog which it currently disputes in court. “A very important strategic focus will be put on the elimination of legacy pollution, including dismantling of abandoned buildings and structures, metal waste management and recycling as well as sanitary cleaning of the territory.” The legacy waste in the industrial city of Norilsk, built 300 km inside the Arctic Circle, is massive partly due to its history and lack of roads to other parts of the country. Prisoners from Stalin’s labour camps built the first smelter there 85 years ago. Nornickel’s $600 million programme will target 467 abandoned buildings and structures there in 2021-2030. More than 600,000 tonnes of scrap metal are expected to be collected. The waste collection will be part of Nornickel’s wider environment investment plans, which target a reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions in the area by 2025. Its environmental projects and output growth strategy will require more than $27 billion in total within the next 10 years, including $5.5 billion needed for the environment projects. It plans to upgrade 60% of its energy infrastructure by 2030."
48.981295492392455," Oil majors wipe $80 billion off books as epidemic, energy transition bite LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s top energy companies have slashed the value of their oil and gas assets by around $80 billion (60.05 billion pounds) in recent months after revising lower the long-term outlook for fuel prices in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic and the energy transition. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, announced on Monday it would write down the value of natural gas properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment following the sharp drop in energy prices this year. It follows similar steps by rivals including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron since late 2019. Graphic: Downsizing The so-called oil majors are “acknowledging overly optimistic commodity price views of yesteryear,” said Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint. Most of Exxon’s impairments focused on legacy assets from its $30 billion acquisition of U.S. shale producer XTO Energy in 2010, a deal former CEO Rex Tillerson had previously said was “ill-timed.” Following the impairments, companies will focus on the parts of the business that are able to withstand the lowest oil and gas prices, Clint said. “Balance sheets now reflect the lowest portfolio break-evens in two decades and therefore the most resilient to future commodity price shocks.” Exxon did not disclose its new commodity price outlook. The value of the oil majors plummeted in 2020 after energy demand collapsed due to the pandemic. The shares of Exxon, Shell and BP have lost over 45% so far this year, more than benchmark Brent oil prices that have lost around 27% and stand today near $48 a barrel. The impairments made by the European majors also came after they lowered their long-term oil prices forecasts as they prepare to increasingly switch to renewable energy in the coming decades to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. The revisions might nevertheless lead to a sharp rise in oil prices in the coming years as a result of lower investments in new projects, Clint said. “We’re staring into the abyss when it comes to supply and demand balances due to a dearth of much needed capital investment.”"
48.981295492392455," Exxon tries to put the worst behind it with $20 billion writedown HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said it would write down the value of natural gas properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment, and slash project spending next year to its lowest level in 15 years. The oil major is reeling from the sharp decline in oil demand and prices from the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of bad bets on projects when prices were much higher. New cost cuts aim to protect a $15 billion a year shareholder payout that many analysts believe is unsustainable without higher prices. The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale producer XTO Energy as natural gas prices went into a decade-long decline. The writedown also includes properties in Argentina and western Canada. While smaller than the up to $30 billion charge the company forecast a month ago, the quarterly charge to earnings reflects the company’s recent reduction in its outlook for oil and gas prices. Exxon will continue initiatives in offshore Brazil, Guyana, the Permian Basin shale field in the United States, and in performance chemicals despite plans to implement deeper spending cuts, it said. Not mentioned was its $30 billion Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which sources do not expect final investment decision on until early 2022. “Recent exploration success and reductions in development costs of strategic investments have further enhanced the value of our industry-leading investment portfolio,” said Chief Executive Darren Woods. Business conditions are continuing to show signs of improvement despite the pandemic, he said. Exxon shares fell 5% in late trading to $38.13 and are down by half in the last five years. The impairment charge “further worsens the company’s already substantial jump in financial leverage,” said Pete Speer, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. “With this charge added to the big rise in debt this year, we see ExxonMobil’s debt/capitalization rising to nearly 30%, from just over 20% at the start of 2020.” Next year’s spending will fall, to between $16 billion to $19 billion, but Exxon could increase spending by 2025 to more than this year’s about $23 billion level, Woods said. The plan to return to higher levels of capital expense struck investor Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, as unusual. “In this environment it makes no sense to me at all. What’s the hurry?” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to help them with investors.” Exxon said last month it could cut 14,000 employees, or 15% of its global workforce, by the end of 2021."

37.579809318963484," RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Exxon and Total in talks over Mozambique LNG resource-sharing deal - sources (Repeats story published late on Wednesday) JOHANNESBURG/MILAN, Nov 25 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil and Total are in negotiations over their massive LNG projects in Mozambique, with each seeking to extract more gas from a shared field that straddles the two developments and cut costs, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement. The field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects. The volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 “unitisation” - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and France’s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said. The companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique. Across the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last year’s record level of approvals for plants. Success in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now don’t expect until early 2022. The FID on Total’s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019. The current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year. It allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the “straddling” reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development. Now Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projects’ annual LNG production, according to the sources. “They want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,” said one of the sources. Asked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: “As a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.” “ExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,” he added. Total said the operators of the two projects “continue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of development”. Mozambique’s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reuters’ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nation’s energy development. The INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions. A Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxon’s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG. Instead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs. This would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovuma’s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years. Mozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase. Reuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to. A fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output. In April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices. The Mozambique government has said it expects Exxon’s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023. In response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: “We continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.” Area 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNG’s licence area. While Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023. It would mean the company wouldn’t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic. However the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projects’ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments. Analysts warn the group’s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely. One of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors. “The investment will not be viable without security,” the official said.

38.95351045058534," Exxon to cut up to 300 jobs in Canada (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday it plans to reduce up to 300 positions in Canada as part of an ongoing cost-cut plan due to a coronavirus-driven slump in oil prices. Reductions will include positions at Imperial Oil Ltd, ExxonMobil Canada Ltd and ExxonMobil Business Centre Canada ULC, the company said. Oil producers, including Exxon, have been slashing costs due to a collapse in oil demand and ill-timed bets on new projects. The top U.S. oil company had earlier outlined more than $10 billion in budget cuts this year. Suncor Energy, Canada’s second biggest oil company, said last month it would cut its workforce by up to 15% over the next year and a half. Canadian energy companies have also suffered from scarce capital due to chronic pipeline congestion and high emissions."
42.40470431313768," Oil Search sees Total's Papua LNG advancing ahead of Exxon's P'nyang MELBOURNE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Oil Search Ltd OSH.AX said on Thursday its stalled plan to expand gas output in Papua New Guinea would now focus on the Papua LNG project, led by Total SA TOTF.PA, in a change of tack following political ructions in Papua New Guinea. France’s Total had previously pushed to work with Exxon to double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the country through a twinned $13 billion expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant and development of Total’s Papua LNG project. Oil Search is a partner in both projects, which had insisted they would only go ahead together by adding three new processing units, or trains, at the PNG LNG site. Progress has been stalled by PNG Prime Minister James Marape’s push for a bigger take for the country from Exxon’s side of the project, development of the P’nyang gas field. Oil Search said it now sees Total’s Papua LNG progressing on its own, with two trains initially. “There is significant interest from all parties to simplify LNG expansion in PNG and focus on Papua LNG 2 trains,” Oil Search CEO Keiran Wulff told investors. His comments come as Marape faces a threat to his leadership, with several members of his government switching to the opposition last Friday. “Whilst PNG is certainly the land of the unexpected, recent events in PNG are worth following closely,” Wulff said. “Comments by Total, the PNG government and the PNG opposition are increasingly supportive of advancing the Papua LNG project.” Papua LNG needs to test market demand before going ahead. “We think there’s a strong increase in demand opening up in 2027” as big coal users such as Japan and South Korea seek to lower emissions, Wulff told Reuters. To meet that window, Papua LNG’s owners would have to reach a final investment decision in 2023, he said. Exxon said talks with the government on its P’nyang gas project, which was to feed a third new train at PNG LNG, are ongoing. It declined to comment on Oil Search’s remarks. “We are hopeful that we can work towards an outcome that benefits all stakeholders,” an Exxon spokesman said in emailed comments. Exxon’s PNG LNG plant has been producing at 26% above its nameplate capacity and as a result will soon need new sources of gas. As a result, P’nyang might be tapped to supply the existing PNG LNG trains instead of a third unit, Wulff said."
38.990194827249134," Exxon says its latest discovery offshore of Guyana is not financially viable (Reuters) - An oil exploration campaign led by Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N at the Tanager-1 well in the Kaieteur block off Guyana's coast discovered hydrocarbons but it does not appear to be financially viable on its own, a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday. As part of a consortium with Hess Corp HES.N and China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK, Exxon has made 18 discoveries totaling some 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas in Guyana's massive Stabroek block, southwest of Kaieteur. Production of light, sweet crude from Stabroek's Liza-1 well began last year. Exxon is also the operator of Kaieteur and holds a 35% stake in the block, where Cataleya Energy Ltd and Ratio Guyana Ltd each hold 25% stakes. Hess holds the remaining 15%. “We remain committed to evaluating the exploration potential in the Kaieteur Block,” the spokesman said. Exxon’s oil discoveries have the potential to transform the economy of Guyana, a poor South American country of some 750,000 people that has until now depended on agriculture and mining. But other oil explorers’ discoveries have not been as promising as Exxon’s finds in the Stabroek block. Westmount Energy Ltd WNRG.L, which holds shares in Cataleya and Ratio, told the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday that preliminary evaluation of the Tanager discovery indicated it contained less-valuable heavy crude. It said it expected the well to be plugged and abandoned in the coming days."
38.942964613696724," Colombia to hold bidding round for investigative fracking projects BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia will hold a second bidding round to potentially grant contracts to companies interested in exploring non-conventional oil and gas deposits, using techniques like fracking, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) said. Majority state-owned oil company Ecopetrol ECO.CN, Exxonmobil XOM.N, and Drummond already have contracts for investigative projects and may submit offers in this new round, as can other companies, the ANH said in a statement late on Tuesday. Development of non-conventional energy deposits - including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for shale gas - is highly polarizing in Colombia and commercial development of such deposits is currently not permitted. Each company can be awarded up to two contracts, the ANH said, and a maximum of four contracts will be granted. “The purpose of the pilot projects is to acquire sufficient scientific information so a decision about the use of hydraulic fracturing can be made, to take advantage of the potential of non-conventional energy sources,” ANH president Armando Zamaro said. Ecopetrol has already submitted a proposal which is under evaluation, the ANH said, and the schedule for the second round will be published shortly."
37.48423784376779," Exxon presses Australia to release aid to oil refiners by January MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N is urging the Australian government to start releasing aid to the country's oil refineries by January after a decision last week by BP plc BP.L to shut the nation's biggest refinery. Exxon owns Australia’s oldest refinery at Altona near Melbourne, which can process 90,000 barrels per day of oil, the smallest of the nation’s four refineries. The site supplies about half of the fuel for the state of Victoria, which has been subject to one of the world’s longest and tightest coronavirus lockdowns. Exxon said the prolonged lockdown “has placed unprecedented pressure” on Altona, causing the plant to run at a loss. Victoria’s government only last week eased restrictions limiting people to a 5 km (3 mile) zone around their homes and allowed shops and restaurants to reopen for the first time since Aug 2. The Australian government is in talks with the refining industry on an offer of A$2.3 billion ($1.6 billion) in incentives over 10 years to keep refineries open to bolster of national fuel security. The country's two other refiners, Viva Energy VEA.AX and Ampol ALD.AX, are considering shutting their refineries. Exxon said the proposed six-month time frame for talks with the government was “too long given the near term challenges faced by all refineries” and it was working with the refiners’ industry group and the government to get the first part of the fuel security package released by January 2021.

41.029312591517," Chevron, Exxon shrink spending as coronavirus cuts demand (Reuters) - U.S. oil majors Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp cut spending aggressively in the third quarter in a race to offset weak trends in fuel demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the former managed a slim profit. Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses on Friday and reduced spending plans for the coming year. In common with others in the sector, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as they try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions. U.S. oil prices have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, dampening demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The outlook for energy consumption “depends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don’t know when that’s going to be,” said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber. Exxon shares were down 1% to $32.62 on Friday. Chevron shares gained 1% to $69.50. Exxon shares have lost half of their value this year; Chevron’s are down 40%. Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period. Exxon posted a loss of $680 million, its third straight quarterly loss. Exxon came into the year with an ambitious spending plan driven by investments in shale and offshore discoveries, particularly off the coast of Guyana. It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020, though through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion. Now, however, Exxon is focused on preserving its dividend. Earlier this week, it announced plans to cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout. “While we see the dividend as safe over the next 12 months, the cash flow outspend is massive under current conditions,” analysts at Raymond James wrote. The largest U.S. oil producer, which has slashed costs aggressively, is also evaluating whether to hold on to other North American assets. It could write down natural gas assets valued between $25 billion to $30 billion, and possibly part of its Canadian business, Imperial Oil, it said. “It is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,” said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors. Next year, Exxon said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year. The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra. In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects oil and gas output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 565,000 boepd this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers. Exxon’s Permian output was around 401,000 boepd in the third quarter, up from the previous quarter, and it said its costs there had dropped 20%."
40.7781524176495," Exxon posts third straight quarterly loss as pandemic hits demand, prices HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N posted its third straight quarterly loss on Friday and detailed deeper spending cuts to come, as the oil major reels from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on energy demand and prices. The largest U.S. oil producer by volume said it will slash its capital spending for 2021 to between $16 billion and $19 billion, a cut of as much as 30% from this year’s plan. The move signals the company will continue to fight to protect its rich shareholder dividend payout, now yielding 11%, by delaying projects. Its 2021 spending plans are lower than rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc's RDSa.L. It also said it was reassessing its natural gas holdings in North America and could sell or take impairments on assets with a book value of as much as $25 billion to $30 billion - but only if it changes its long-term development plans. It is evaluating those assets this quarter, which include properties it added with its 2010 purchase of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time. Exxon beat expectations with an adjusted loss of 18 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 25 cents per share, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Oil companies last quarter continued to suffer from weak prices for their products, but rivals Chevron Corp CVX.N, Shell and BP Plc BP.L also posted higher-than-expected results after deep cost cuts this year. “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and the fundamentals of our business,” said Chief Executive Darren Woods, adding that Exxon would continue to protect its shareholder dividend. Exxon is looking to sell more assets and plans to hold debt at second quarter levels of around $69.5 billion, said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Swiger on a call with analysts. It has spent about $16.5 billion this year on new projects and had planned around $23 billion for the full year. The potential write down of shale gas “has been looming large for some time” and would “draw a line in the sand on the poor timing around its XTO acquisition a decade ago,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria. Exxon’s third-quarter net loss was $680 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with a profit of $3.17 billion, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Shares closed 1% lower on Friday at $32.62. Its output fell 5.8% to 3.67 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries curtailed output and the company pulled back production in other areas due to low prices. Exploration and production, Exxon’s largest business, lost $383 million, compared with a profit of $2.2 billion last year. Results were boosted by its chemicals business, which earned $661 million, up from $241 million last year on packaging demand and recovering auto and construction markets. Exxon’s chemicals business regularly generated $1 billion in quarterly profit as recently as 2018. Its refining business reported a loss of $231 million, compared with profits of $1.2 billion last year, on lower margins and weaker conditions for refiners as the pandemic eats into travel. “Exxon isn’t getting the same benefit from strong marketing as seen by some peers” and the its exploration business “continues to be weak,” said Anish Kapadia, director at London-based Palissy Advisors. Even with reduced spending plans, the company is likely to see negative free cash flow through 2021, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. “This calls into question how long the company can continue to use debt to fund its dividend,” she said, adding that it is at risk of being cut late next year. This week, Exxon said it would cut its workforce by about 15% and kept its fourth-quarter dividend flat at 87 cents a share."

The company, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, said its refinery throughput averaged 341,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down 6% year over year, but 22.7% higher sequentially, with overall utilization at 81% for the quarter. The coronavirus outbreak led to the grounding of flights and brought economies to a standstill, hurting demand for fuel but with the easing of the pandemic-induced curbs, demand has begun to pick up and crude prices have rebounded from their historic lows. However, the nascent recovery has since been threatened by new cases and fresh lockdowns. The Calgary, Alberta-based company posted a net income of C$3 million ($2.28 million) for the quarter, compared with a profit of C$424 million a year earlier. Capital expenditures for 2020 are now expected to be about C$900 million, Imperial said, below its previous guidance of C$1.1 billion to C$1.2 billion.

39.28368574430841," Exxon to cut 14,000 jobs as pandemic hits oil demand (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Thursday it could cut its global workforce by about 15%, including deep white-collar staff reductions in the United States, as the COVID-19 pandemic batters energy demand and prices. Exxon and other oil producers have been slashing costs due to a collapse in oil demand and ill-timed bets on new projects. The top U.S. oil company earlier outlined more than $10 billion in budget cuts this year. [nL1N2HK2P2] “The impact of COVID-19 on the demand for Exxon Mobil’s products has increased the urgency of the ongoing efficiency work,” the company said in a statement. An estimated 14,000 employees globally, or 15%, could lose jobs, including contractors, spokesman Casey Norton said. The figure will include loses from restructurings, retirements and performance-based exits. Exxon had about 88,300 workers, including 13,300 contractors, at the end of last year. The company is not targeting a fixed number of jobs but does expect the result of its ongoing business review to eliminate about 15% of its current staffing. Exxon, which has struggled in recent years to regain footing after misplaced bets on shale gas and Russia exploration, lost nearly $1.7 billion in the first six months of the year. It is expected to report a record-setting third straight quarterly loss on Friday, and its third-quarter loss could reach $1.19 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. Exxon said the 1,900 U.S. job cuts will come mainly from its Houston-area campus, the headquarters for its U.S. oil and gas businesses. Earlier this month, Exxon said it would cut 1,600 jobs in Europe. It has announced cuts in Australia. Exxon shares were trading 4% higher at $32.85 on Thursday. Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output in the belief a growing global middle class would demand more of its products. Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L also have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts. Chevron Corp’s CVX.N planned cuts of 10%-15% would imply a reduction of between 4,500 and 6,750 jobs.

39.34112421338868," Exxon Mobil 'very close' to disclosing U.S., Canada job cuts, says CEO HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N is ""very close"" to completing its workforce appraisals in the United States and Canada and expects to unveil job cuts, its chief executive told employees in an email on Wednesday. The second-largest U.S. oil company by market value lost nearly $1.7 billion in the first six months and analysts forecast a third-quarter $1.17 billion loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The job cuts are part of a plan unveiled this spring to redesign how Exxon works and to increase competitiveness, CEO Darren Woods said in an email to its nearly 75,000-person workforce. Exxon has exceeded a target of reducing operating expenses by $1 billion and capital budget spending by $10 billion, he wrote. But the COVID-19 pandemic has cut oil demand by about 20%, he said, delivering a “devastating impact” on the oil business. Woods told employees that “we are very close” to completing the jobs review and that they could expect details soon after the company’s board of directors is briefed. “I wish I could say we were finished, but we are not. We still have some significant headwinds, more work to do and, unfortunately, further reductions are necessary,” he said in the email. Exxon was slower than rivals to react to this year’s oil price decline and borrowed $23 billion to shore up a balance sheet strained by the losses and a nearly $15 billion annual dividend payment to shareholders. Royal Dutch Shell and BP have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts while Chevron has asked employees to reapply for their jobs. Woods said the demand loss is five times the decline of the 2008 financial crisis, but “industry under-investment today will increase the need for our products in the near future.” All oil companies face the same loss of demand, but Exxon has the burden of promising to keep its huge dividend without adding new debt, said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. U.S. oil prices must rise another $10 a barrel to cover the payout without borrowing, he estimates. “If management has to walk back their pledge” not to issue new debt to protect the dividend, “it would damage credibility,” Molchanov said. Exxon’s dividend yield, the percent of the share price paid annually to holders, was 10.3%, the largest among major oil companies and another sign of Exxon’s weak finances. Its shares fell 1.6% to $33.14 on Wednesday as oil prices declined on worries that the COVID-19 infections are on the rise globally. The stock is trading near a 18-year low."

48.5848207633594," Fact check: Trump did not say he would phone the CEO of Exxon to get him to donate millions to the presidential campaign; misses context Social media users have been sharing posts claiming that President Trump said he would call the CEO of Exxon asking him to donate $25 million to his presidential campaign. Although Trump did make the comments cited in the posts, Trump was describing a hypothetical situation at a rally, saying he could raise more money than his political opponent Joe Biden, and clarified that seeking such donations was not something he would do. The posts (  here  ,  here  ,  here  ,  here  ) include a picture of Trump speaking at a campaign rally in Arizona and a quote of him saying, “I call the head of Exxon. I’ll use a company. ‘How, how are you doing, how’s energy coming? When are doing the exploration? Oh, you need a couple of permits, huh?’ But I call the head of Exxon, I say ‘you know, I’d love you to send me $25m for the campaign.” Captions include, “This. Is. Illegal.”; “Breathtaking confession in broad daylight. Lock him up”; “We’ve been saying Trump is the most corrupt president in history for nearly four years now. He just admitted it in a campaign speech.” A Reuters story about the incident is visible  here  . Exxon tweeted to clarify the situation (here), saying there had been no phone call between its chief executive, Darren Woods, and Trump (here). Some social media users posted the Exxon tweet to claim Trump lied about getting money from Exxon, with the caption, “Today Trump bragged at one of his superspreader events that he shook down Exxon. He said that Exxon wanted some permits so he told them they would have to fork over $25 million to his campaign first. Exxon felt the need to put this out tonight.” (here) Trump did make the remarks quoted in the social media posts at the Arizona rally, referring to the money raised by the Democratic and Republican parties in the election race, as seen in this video  , tinyurl.com/y6oz3no6  , but the quote is missing key context. The full video shows that Trump said, “You know all the money that Biden’s raising […] I would be the greatest fundraiser in history, all I have to do is call up the head of every Wall Street firm, the head of every major company, the head of every major energy company. ‘Do me a favour! Send me 10 million for my campaign.’ ‘Yes sir.’” […] I would take in more money but you know what I don’t want to do that because if I do that I’m totally compromised.” Shortly after (youtu.be/axqSq24Nnvc?t=1541) he goes on to say the passage quoted in the social media posts, making it clear that he is describing a hypothetical scenario, where Exxon is just an example: “So I call some guy, the head of… Exxon, I call the head of Exxon, I don’t know what, you know, I’ll use a company.” After describing the Exxon example Trump adds, “I would raise a billion dollars in one day if I wanted to. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do it.” Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee started the last full month before the Nov. 3 election with $251.4 million in cash, after raising $247.8 million in September. The intake was about $135 million less than what Biden raised in September (here). Partly false. Trump did describe a situation in which he could raise much more money for his campaign than Biden by phoning up, for example, the CEO of Exxon, but he made it clear that this was a hypothetical situation and not something that he would want to do.

Trump, at the rally, said he could raise large sums of money if he wanted to by calling oil and Wall Street executives. He proceeded to paint a scenario of what he could do - though Trump said he would not actually make the kind of phone call he described. “We are aware of the President’s statement regarding a hypothetical call with our CEO…and just so we’re all clear, it never happened,” Exxon said on Twitter. Trump told the rally: “Don’t forget, I’m not bad at that stuff anyway, and I’m president. So I call some guy, the head of Exxon. I call the head of Exxon. I don’t know.” Trump went on to describe a hypothetical conversation: “How are you doing? How’s energy coming? When are you doing the exploration? Oh, you need a couple of permits?” “When I call the head of Exxon I say, ‘You know, I’d love (for you) to send me $25 million for the campaign.’ ‘Absolutely sir,’” Trump added. “I will hit a home run every single call,” Trump said. “I would raise a billion dollars in one day if I wanted to. I don’t want to do that.” Trump, who has been trailing Biden in opinion polls, has also been trailing his Democratic rival in fundraising. Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee started the last full month before the Nov. 3 election with $251.4 million in cash, after raising $247.8 million in September.

50.87496511217016," U.N. access to decaying Yemen tanker could take weeks, say sources DUBAI (Reuters) - A United Nations team will have to wait several weeks to access a deteriorating tanker off Yemen’s shore that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil in the Red Sea, two U.N. sources told Reuters. The United Nations has warned that the Safer, stranded since 2015, could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster near Alaska, but access to the vessel has been complicated by the war in Yemen. Yemen’s Houthi movement, which controls the area where the tanker is moored and the national oil firm that owns it, agreed in July to allow a technical team to assess the ship and conduct whatever repairs may be feasible. But the two sources said that it could take another seven weeks to finalise details of the agreement and logistics, with the coronavirus pandemic further complicating planning. The deal includes the eventual sale of the oil on board with proceeds divided between Houthi authorities and Yemen’s internationally recognised government, which the movement ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. Some diplomats say there are still doubts about the mission as Houthi officials had last year reneged on granting access. The Safer, built in 1974, is moored off the Ras Issa oil terminal, 60 km (40 miles) north of the port of Hodeidah. The area is held by the Houthis, but the high seas are controlled by a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the movement and has prevented it from selling oil. U.N. and Houthi officials say water has entered the Safer’s engine room at least twice since 2015. The latest leak in May was plugged by Safer Corp divers and Houthi naval units. While the Houthis can fix small leaks it remains unclear how long such repairs can hold, U.N. officials and experts said. Last month, Riyadh warned that an “oil spot” was seen in a shipping transit area 31 miles (50 km) west of the tanker. The United Nations says a major rupture could severely harm Red Sea ecosystems and shut Hodeidah port, Yemen’s main entry point for imports and aid."
32.038530930650374," Chevron tops Exxon Mobil market cap for first time (Reuters) - Chevron’s market value leapfrogged that of Exxon Mobil for the first time on Wednesday during a week in which it closed a $4.1 billion, all-stock deal for Noble Energy, a smaller oil and gas producer. Chevron’s market cap ended the day around $142 billion, topping Exxon Mobil’s $141.65 billion market value at the end of trade, according to Refinitiv data and Chevron SEC filings pertaining to the Nobel deal. Shares in Chevron closed up 2.047% on Wednesday and Exxon Mobile rose just 0.3%. Chevron’s finances are stronger and its shares have performed better than its larger rival. It has shifted away from costly megaprojects favored by oil majors, and moved sooner this year to cut costs amid the coronavirus-induced sharp drop in oil and gas prices. Investors have shunned fossil fuel companies and the energy sector is the worst performing on the S&P 500 year to date. Chevron’s stock is down a lesser 38% year to date compared to a 52% decline at Exxon, which this year was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a position it held since the index was created. Exxon’s weak earnings have forced it to borrow to finance its nearly $15 billion a year shareholder dividend and cover spending on new projects. In part, Chevron’s finances have benefited from its faster divesting of unwanted assets. Exxon has struggled to unload unwanted oilfields despite promising to accelerate the sales in early 2019. Exxon officials have said they are reviewing all its operations for cuts, but have signaled that major savings will not come this year."

32.037635994571716," Exxon to cut 1,600 jobs across Europe as oil rout weighs (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil XOM.N said on Monday it plans to reduce its European workforce by up to 1,600 across the company's affiliates by the end of 2021 as part of its global review. Exxon said country-specific cuts will depend on the oil major’s local business footprint and market conditions, after the COVID-19 pandemic hammered demand for its products and crude prices tanked. Oil majors are axing jobs, lowering spending and curbing dividends in order to save cash amid a dismal outlook over energy prices which are expected to remain lackluster for years. Last month, Exxon announced voluntary layoffs in Australia and said that job cuts will continue globally into 2021."
28.869766486610498," Supreme Court takes up energy companies' appeal over Baltimore climate suit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by energy companies including BP PLC, Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC contesting a lawsuit by the city of Baltimore seeking damages for the impact of global climate change. The justices will weigh whether the lawsuit must be heard in state court as the city would prefer or in federal court, which corporate defendants generally view as a more favorable venue. The suit targets 21 U.S. and foreign energy companies that extract, produce, distribute or sell fossil fuels. The outcome could affect around a dozen similar lawsuits by U.S. states, cities and counties including Rhode Island and New York City seeking to hold such companies liable for the impact of climate change. Baltimore and the other jurisdictions are seeking damages under state law for the harms they said they have sustained due to climate change, which they attribute in part to the companies’ role in producing fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The plaintiffs have said they have had to spend more on infrastructure such as flood control measures to combat sea-level rise caused by a warming climate. Climate change has been melting land-based ice sheets and glaciers. The Supreme Court in 2019 declined the companies’ emergency request to put the Baltimore litigation on hold after a federal judge ruled that the case should be heard in state court. In March, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge’s decision. In the absence of federal legislation in the bitterly divided U.S. Congress targeting climate change, the lawsuits are the latest effort to force action via litigation. The Supreme Court in a landmark 2007 ruling said that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the agency issued the first-ever regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. But efforts in Congress to enact sweeping climate change legislation have failed. The court took action in the case three days before it begins its new nine-month term short one justice after the Sept. 18 death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Donald Trump has nominated federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ginsburg."

28.869766486610498," Big Oil shares capitulate to COVID, lower carbon doubts LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and BP BP.L have lost over half of their market value so far this year, with both shares hitting 25-year lows this week, battered by weak oil prices and investor concerns over their plans to shift to low-carbon energy. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, which is set to report its third straight quarterly loss at the end of this month, has seen its shares dive 52% since the start of the year. Oil companies are squeezed by a steep drop in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic combined with growing investor pressure to align their businesses with the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming. Responding to the pressure, Europe's top companies outlined strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades, with BP and Italy's Eni ENI.MI planning to rapidly cut oil output by 2030. BP CEO Bernard Looney, reacting in a LinkedIn post to the drop in BP shares this week, said that there is “a very significant need to change bp.” “I think – if anything – the share price performance of the sector is a robust case for change in itself,” Looney wrote. (Graphic: Oil majors share performance - ) Yet investors remain sceptical. “The majors are struggling to convince any investor at the moment,” said Jason Kenney, analyst at Santander, who has a “buy” rating on all European oil majors. “There is a phenomenal give-up on the valuation of these companies... it is astonishing.” Investors are fleeing the sector because of uncertainty over the global economic recovery in the near term and doubts about the profitability of companies’ transition plans in the longer term, Kenney said. “With the COVID-19 backdrop and the uncertain economic outlook, it is challenging to be confident,” Kenney said."

In a statement issued late on Thursday, the city’s People’s Committee said the power plant would have an initial capacity of 2.25 gigawatts (GW) and that would be expanded to 4.5 GW by 2029-2030. It said the project would also include a terminal with a capacity of six million tonnes of LNG per year. Exxon Mobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In June, Vietnam’s government said it welcomed Exxon Mobil’s move to invest in the country following a phone call between Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Irtiza Sayyed, President of ExxonMobil LNG Market Development Inc. The government said in a statement at the time that a power project in Haiphong could use LNG imported from the United States or other countries. The Institute of Energy of Vietnam is drafting a new master power development plan and has compiled a list of 22 LNG power plants with a combined potential capacity of up to 108.5 GW, the first of which will be operational by 2023.

27.420748714707187," Exxon Mobil signals bigger-than-expected loss in third quarter (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N could slip into a bigger-than-expected loss in the third quarter as the U.S. oil major struggles to cope with the effects of a pandemic-driven downturn in the energy industry. The company on Thursday listed a number of factors that could impact its earnings such as oil and gas prices, refining margins and sales volumes, suggesting that Exxon’s numbers could range from a loss of 68 cents to a profit of 7 cents. The calculation was based on inputs from the company and analysts. The midpoint of the range at 30 cents loss is much wider than analysts’ estimate for a loss of 7 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. If the oil major posts another loss, it would be the first time that Exxon has reported a third straight quarterly loss in at least 36 years. The company had in July vowed to make deep spending cuts to cope with sharply lower energy demand and prices. Exxon shares fell 2% at $33.66. Higher crude prices will help Exxon’s exploration and production earnings by $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, compared with the second quarter, the company said. However, weak gas prices will weigh on the segment and could hurt earnings by as much as $500 million. Refining business will be dragged down by weak margins, knocking off $200 million to $600 million in earnings, while logistics differentials could hit the division by as much as $200 million.

22.989768581581842," Guyana nears deal with Exxon for Payara project development, minister says GEORGETOWN, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Guyana is close to reaching a deal with Exxon Mobil Corp to approve the company’s Payara project, after the company committed to stricter environmental restrictions on gas flaring and wastewater, a top government official said on Friday. Exxon, along with consortium partners Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, expects to eventually produce 220,000 barrels per day of crude from Payara, its third major oil development in the Stabroek block off the South American country’s coast. The companies have overall discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable resource off Guyana. The discovery is poised to transform the economy of the small, poor country of fewer than 800,000 people, which had no history of oil production before late last year. The breakthrough on Payara came after a months-long government review, which was delayed in part due to a contentious March election and transfer of power in August. Exxon had warned the delays put its plans to bring the project online in 2023 in jeopardy. “We are almost in the final lap to having a workable agreement for both sides,” Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat told Reuters. “Once cabinet gives the green light, there will be a public signing.” An Exxon spokesman said the company is still working with the government “to obtain final approvals for the development of the Payara offshore oil field.” “Upon receiving all required government approvals, we will seek a final investment decision to develop the field,” the spokesman said. Bharrat said Exxon had committed to limit gas flaring and treat wastewater to “international standards” before returning it to the ocean, issues the government says have plagued the early phases of crude output from the company’s flagship Liza project, which began output last December.

Parties that have signalled interest in acquiring more assets in the basin include private-equity (PE) firm HitecVision's Neo, EIG's Chrysaor and listed companies, such as EnQuest ENQ.L. Commodities trading house Mercuria, via producer Tailwind, is also considering the portfolio, two sources said on condition of anonymity. Eni ENI.MI, via its joint venture Var with HitecVision, has been buying assets in the Norwegian North Sea. “It will be interesting to see in November/December the outcome of Exxon’s UK sale as these competing forms of capital - stock market, PE Funds, Traders - assess who can get most value from this situation,” one of the sources said. Any buyer will likely seek to operate the assets, the sources said. Established independent producers in the British North Sea, such as EnQuest and Premier PMO.L, are burdened with debt. Premier is trying to raise equity to buy BP assets, whose past losses could be used to reduce future tax bills, but is also in talks with Chrysaor on alternative deals. Hitec is considering an acquisition of Suncor's SU.TO North Sea assets, one of the sources said. Most of Exxon's British operations are managed through Esso Exploration and Production UK, a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L. The portfolio under discussion, which excludes assets in the southern North Sea, produces around 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is expected to increase to just under 60,000 boe/d by around 2023, the sources said. Initially, Exxon hoped to raise over $2 billion from the sale and it was planned for late last year. In June sources told Reuters the portfolio was more likely to fetch $1 to $1.5 billion given the oil price weakness this year. HitecVision, EnQuest, Exxon, Mercuria and Chrysaor all declined comment."

The agreement comes as U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, ramps up crude output from Guyana’s massive offshore Stabroek block, a large portion of which is in waters claimed by Venezuela. “Greater security, greater capacity to understand your border space, what’s happening inside your Exclusive Economic Zone - those are all things that give Guyana sovereignty,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a joint appearance with newly-installed Guyanese President Irfaan Ali. Pompeo is using his four-nation South America tour to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a six-year economic collapse and has been indicted in the United States on narcoterrorism charges, to resign. “We know that the Maduro regime has decimated the people of Venezuela and that Maduro himself is an indicted narcotics trafficker. That means he has to leave,” Pompeo told reporters during his appearance in Georgetown with Ali. Maduro, who remains in power despite Washington’s 18-month campaign of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure, said Pompeo was “bothering the region.” “Mike Pompeo is calling for war against Venezuela, but he has failed,” Maduro said in a state television address later on Friday.

17.944952265716406," Connecticut sues Exxon for deceiving consumers about climate change WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Connecticut filed a lawsuit on Monday against oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp for misleading the public over the impacts of climate change, becoming the latest state to target the fossil fuel industry for violating state consumer protection laws. The state’s attorney general William Tong filed the lawsuit in Connecticut’s Superior Court, alleging that Exxon violated the state’s unfair trade practices act, deceiving Connecticut consumers about what the company knew about fossil fuels’ impact on climate change. “Exxon Mobil made billions of dollars during its decades-long campaign of deception that continues today,” said Attorney General Tong, adding that the state “should not have to bear the expense of fortifying our infrastructure to adapt to the very real consequences of climate change.” Over the last few months, attorneys general from Massachusetts, Minnesota, the District of Columbia and Delaware have sued members of the fossil fuel industry, accusing companies of violating state laws by deceiving consumers about harms caused by their products. Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said the company will defend itself in court and continue to invest in efforts to reduce emissions. “Legal proceedings like this waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money and do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change,” Norton said. Unlike other states’ lawsuits, which either target multiple companies or trade groups or highlight bring up other violations like fraud, Connecticut’s is focused on one company and one law. Tong will examine “all of Exxon Mobil’s deceptions dating back decades” as well as the company’s current advertising and marketing, which he says falsely portray Exxon as working to combat climate change. The state is seeking “remediation for past, present and future harm from climate change,” restitution for investments it had to make to adapt to climate change, disgorgement of corporate profits, and establishment of a “third-party controlled education fund” on climate change, among other relief."

Its lawsuit against 24 companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell PLC in the state’s Court of Common Pleas for the Ninth Judicial Circuit makes it the first city in the United States’ South to try to get the companies to cough up money for new infrastructure, like sea walls, to ride out extreme weather events growing in intensity due a changing climate.

Hess and partners Exxon Mobil Corp and CNOOC Ltd are in “close communication” with officials, Hess said at a virtual presentation to the Barclays CEO Energy-Power conference. Production in the first phase will reach full, 120,000 barrels-per-day capacity in coming weeks, he said. (Reporting by Jennifer Hiller Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"
13.303033769310254," Exxon makes 18th discovery offshore Guyana (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday it made its 18th discovery offshore Guyana, as the largest U.S. oil producer continues to develop one of the world’s most important new oil and gas blocks in the last decade. Exxon said the discovery, made at the Redtail-1 well, will add to its previous estimate of over 8 billion barrels of total oil and gas resources on the Stabroek Block. However, the company did not specify how much it estimates would be recoverable from this well and did not outline development plans for it. “Exxon has a good problem in that it has a large number of discoveries to choose from, which allows it to optimize and choose the highest return discoveries to develop,” said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at Palissy Advisors. Kapadia said Exxon could look at selling off some of the discoveries that may not be as important for it as they would be for other smaller companies. Exxon operates the Stabroek block as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd and began production on it ahead of schedule in December. The new find continues the Exxon-led consortium’s long string of discoveries in Latin America’s newest crude producing nation and underscores the importance of Guyana to Exxon for increasing its future oil output. Exxon also said it encountered high-quality oil-bearing reservoirs while drilling at its Yellowtail-2 well and was evaluating them for development."

13.303033769310254," Exclusive: Exxon downsizes global empire as Wall Street worries about dividend HOUSTON (Reuters) - Ill-timed bets on rising demand have Exxon Mobil Corp facing a shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021, according to a Reuters tally and Wall Street estimates, a situation that will require the top U.S. oil company to make deep cuts to its staff and projects. Wall Street investors are even starting to worry about the once-sacrosanct dividend at Exxon, which in the 20th Century became the world’s most valuable company using global scale, relentless expansion and strict financial controls. Exxon weathered a series of setbacks last decade and under Chief Executive Darren Woods sought to return to past prominence by big bets on U.S. shale oilfields, pipelines and global refining and plastics. It also bet big on offshore Guyana, where it discovered up to 8 billion barrels of oil, six years of production at its current rate. But Exxon’s ability to finance that global expansion is no longer assured. This year the company borrowed $23 billion to pay its bills, nearly doubling its outstanding debt. In July, it posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses ever. It faces a full-year $1.86 billion loss, according to Refinitiv, excluding asset sales or write downs. The looming shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021 was calculated using cash from operations, commitments to shareholder payouts and costs for the massive expansion program Exxon had planned. Now the company is embarking on a worldwide review of where it can cut expenses, and analysts believe the once unthinkable dividend cut has grown more likely. This year’s sharp drop in oil demand and pricing has shredded Woods’ plan to spend at least $30 billion a year through 2025 to revive production and earnings by expanding in oil processing, chemicals and production, and by taking a commanding role in U.S. shale and liquefied natural gas, markets that then looked promising. Instead, he must prepare Exxon to operate in a world of weaker demand for its oil, gas and plastics. The company has been dropped from the Dow Jones index of top U.S. industrial companies after 92 years. It is exposing up to 10% of U.S. staff to harsh reviews that could push thousands out of the company, and is taking away lavish retirement benefits that had career employees staying 30 years on average. Exxon declined to make an executive available for an interview, and a spokesman said details of cost cuts would be disclosed early next year. “We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities – investing in industry advantaged projects, paying a reliable and growing dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet,” said spokesman Casey Norton. A review of projects now underway aims to “maximize efficiency and capture additional cost savings to put us in the strongest position” as energy markets improve, he said. (For a graphic on cash from operations and asset sales, click here: ) Oil prices have dropped 35% from the start of 2020 as demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Repsol and others have cut billions of dollars off the value of their oil and gas properties, something Exxon has yet to do. The European majors also are adding renewable energy and electricity to their portfolios, a hedge against permanently reduced oil and gas demand. BP plans by 2030 to reduce its fossil fuel production by 40%. It plans to sell even more fossil fuel properties if oil prices have a sustained rally. Exxon’s cash from operations - estimated to be about $17.4 billion this year - is $20 billion below the funds needed for this year’s already pared investment plan and shareholder dividend, a Reuters analysis showed. The company’s stock price closed Friday at $39.08, off 56% since Woods became CEO. He raised $23.19 billion in new debt this year to bolster finances, but has vowed not to borrow more and as recently as July insisted the dividend was sacrosanct. Investors say the commitments will be difficult to keep. “At $41 or $42 [per barrel] crude, you can’t put those puzzle pieces together and have them make sense,” said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, which holds about $70 million in Exxon shares. Exxon must cut its dividend if the share price remains depressed, Stoeckle said. “Something has to give. Wherever the give comes hurts management credibility,” he said. A cut would be “cataclysmic” for Exxon’s stock, said equity analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research, given that executives in July reiterated its importance. Exxon’s weak cash flow worries investors that hold the stock for its nearly 9% dividend. Matrix Asset Advisors has it on a “watch list in terms of our conviction and their ability to defend and grow the dividend,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at the New York firm. Exxon will slash spending in the Permian Basin shale field this year to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates. The company has said it plans to reduce the number of drilling rigs there to 15 or fewer, from 55 early this year, and the company’s pullback “will continue,” senior vice president Neil Chapman said in a July call. Spending on refining and chemicals plants that take years to design and complete, “is really a question of deferral,” he added. A $10 billion chemical plant in China remains subject to permits, the Exxon spokesman said. Spending limits will further constrain its oil, refining and plastics businesses and could revive pressure on the company to divest some operations. “Each of our core businesses could be a powerhouse in its own right,” Woods said when he rolled out the vision in early 2017. At the time, he was pushing back at calls to spin off businesses to boost lagging returns. Woods stuck to the growth targets last year, putting this year’s potential earnings at $25.1 billion with oil at $60 a barrel and assuming flat refining and chemical margins. That forecast included 2020 cash flow and asset sales targets that have become unreachable since the pandemic hit. (For a graphic of Exxon's capital and exploration spending, go here: ) Analysts said that Woods must dial back. Project outlays next year could drop to between $10.4 billion and $15 billion, according to ScotiaBank and RBC Capital Markets, half the original outlook. Some project schedules are being quietly stretched to save costs. Construction at a $10 billion-plus LNG facility in Texas where Exxon holds a 30% stake already was moving slowly and now “there isn’t the urgency,” said Alex Munton, with consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. He expects its startup will be delayed a year, to 2025 at the earliest. A massive LNG project in Mozambique likely will not get a final investment decision until 2023, as an expansion of Exxon LNG exports in Papua, New Guinea, is delayed by government talks and low LNG prices, Munton said. “The reality is that Exxon is not moving forward with either of those in the near term,” Munton said. In Mexico, Exxon will likely reduce offshore activity after its first well was not commercial, according to people familiar with its operations. It will instead focus on fuel imports and retail sales, they said. Exxon has begun exploration drilling in Brazil, where the company returned in 2017 to become second only to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA in holdings of offshore exploration acreage. But “spend and activity deferrals cannot be ruled out as part of any cost-cutting,” said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director at Welligence Energy Analytics. Other projects already begun, including the $1.9 billion expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery, face an up to one year postponement. Exxon declined to comment on the LNG, Mexico or Brazil spending. Other than Guyana, “there will be no other sacred cow in the near-term budget,” said analyst Paul Cheng of ScotiaBank."

4.37257733159047," Exxon weighs global job cuts after unveiling Australian lay-off plan MELBOURNE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Wednesday it is assessing worldwide job cuts as the global coronavirus pandemic slices into fuel demand, with the largest U.S. oil company announcing voluntary layoffs in Australia in the latest in a wave of cost cutting. Exxon and other oil majors are axing jobs spurred by a historic collapse in fuel demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Exxon’s job cuts will continue globally into 2021, with Australia the first country outside the United States where it has completed a review of its businesses, according to a person familiar with the process. Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output and turn around sagging profits on a bet that a growing global middle class would demand more of its products. However, the company has instead slashed capital spending by 30% this year and warned of deeper cuts in 2021, as it tries to defend a dividend paying nearly 9%. Exxon in July delivered the first back-to-back quarterly losses in at least 36 years. “We have evaluations underway on a country-by-country basis to assess possible additional efficiencies to right-size our business and make it stronger for the future,” spokesman Casey Norton, said in emailed comments to Reuters. Exxon initially said it had no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic, but on its latest earnings call on July 31, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said that given reduced activity, it was evaluating its workforce requirements and looking at reductions “business by business and country by country.” In Australia, Exxon said on Wednesday it had completed a review of its current and future project work in the country and was seeking volunteers to quit the company. “This program will ensure the company manages through these unprecedented market conditions,” it said in a statement. The company did not say what percentage of its workforce it was seeking to cut, but said in Australia it would consider all employees who expressed an interest in voluntary redundancy. “Until other study work is complete, it would be premature to draw conclusions for other countries,” Norton said. In the United States, professional employees went through evaluations, with those ranked in the bottom category given 30 days to decide if they want to try to meet their manager’s goals or leave the company. Exxon changed the system late last year so that more workers might land in that bottom category, with 8% to 10% of employees going through the process, up from 3% last year. Employees can choose to leave with 90 days pay or are given 90 days to improve. The 30-day decision window is closing for many workers, so some are starting to leave Exxon, according to a person familiar with the evaluations. The layoffs in Australia come as Exxon is looking to sell its 50% stake in the Bass Strait oil and gas joint venture, which analysts have estimated could fetch up to $3 billion. Analysts have speculated it could also sell or close its Altona plant in Melbourne, Australia’s oldest refinery."

3.5723155417097816," Exxon presses for government approval of third Guyana oil project GEORGETOWN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is pressing Guyana’s newly-installed government for approval of its third offshore oil project, which has been under a months-long review that coincided with political turmoil in the South American country. Exxon, which operates the Stabroek block as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, has discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable resource of Guyana’s coast. It had previously stated it planned to make a final investment decision on the Payara project around September. After taking office in early August after a months-long recount of a disputed March election, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali appointed a team of Canadian consultants, including former Alberta premier Alison Redford, to review Exxon’s proposal to develop the field. “The timely approval of additional proposed projects, including Payara, will ensure that the local workforce and the utilization of local suppliers will continue to grow,” Exxon’s new country head in Guyana, Alistair Routledge, said in a Wednesday statement. Exxon initially planned for the project to come online in 2023 but has warned it could be delayed. During the campaign, Ali criticized the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) his predecessor signed with Exxon - which included a 2% royalty and 50% profit share - as too generous. He has pledged to enact stricter rules requiring the company to use more local content and hire more Guyanese labor. In an interview with Reuters, Ali declined to go into details about which particular parts of Exxon’s proposed Payara development plan were under scrutiny. “There has to be a comprehensive review,” Ali said. “We have to look at international best practices, we have to look at some of the best PSAs around, we have to look at what we have - the gap - and then in the review come up with possible scenarios.” (The story corrects spelling of Alistair Routledge)"

President Irfaan Ali’s government scrapped a previous, similar process initiated by Ali’s predecessor shortly after taking office in August. The government is seeking a 12-month contract that would involve five crude cargoes of around 1 million barrels each, according to the Sunday notice. Exxon and its partners in Guyana’s Stabroek block, Hess Corp and China’s Cnooc Ltd have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable resource. The consortium began producing crude in December, a development set to transform Guyana’s agriculture- and mining-dependent economy. Under its deal with Exxon, the government is entitled to a portion of the crude produced by the consortium, but with no domestic refining capacity nor state oil company, the state needs a private company to market its share. So far, the government has been marketing its crude through a short-term deal with Royal Dutch Shell. This tender is for a longer-term contract. Former President David Granger’s government short-listed 19 of the more than 30 companies that submitted bids in a search process launched earlier this year, in the midst of a lengthy recount following a disputed March presidential election. Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said last week that the new government would scrap the previous process, arguing companies should not have submitted bids to an “illegal” government. Bids for the re-launched tender are due on Sept. 22, according to the notice. (Reporting by Luc Cohen in New York; Editing by Chris Reese and Andrea Ricci)"

1.8304860985031497," Storebrand divests out of Exxon, others over climate lobbying * Also sells out of Chevron, BASF, Rio Tinto * First time Storebrand has divested over lobbying * Says companies should not lobby against climate regulation OSLO/LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Storebrand, Norway’s largest private asset manager, has divested from ExxonMobil, Chevron, Rio Tinto and BASF citing their lobbying practices regarding climate. The stakes were small compared to Storebrand’s $91 billion in assets under management but their sale marks an escalation from the company’s historical preference to engage with companies over such issues. The move comes amid growing concern about trade groups lobbying to soften green finance rules in Europe. “If you have corporates that are spending a lot of resources and energy to try to avoid that regulation that is required, that is clearly not supportive and not in the long-term interest of anybody, if you want to reach the climate goals or the (United Nations’) sustainable development goals,” Storebrand Asset Management CEO Jan Erik Saugestad told Reuters. Governments across the world are tightening rules on carbon dioxide emissions as they aim to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate. Storebrand said it had sold its $12.3 million stake in ExxonMobil, a $10.4 million stake in Chevron, a $3.8 million stake in miner Rio Tinto and its $2.7 million holding in chemicals company BASF. Chevron said its board of directors was considering a recent shareholder proposal calling for increased disclosure on climate change-related lobbying and was working to take appropriate action to address shareholders’ concerns about this “important issue”. “Chevron engages with numerous third-party organizations that take positions on a range of issues, including climate change,” a company spokesman told Reuters. “We are not always aligned with all the views of those organisations, but it’s important for us to be part of conversations on challenging issues where there are multiple points of view.” ExxonMobil said “society faces a dual challenge of increasing supplies of energy to meet the demand of a growing world population while also addressing the risks of climate change. “Our company plays an important role in addressing both aspects of that challenge,” the company said in a statement. Rio Tinto declined to comment on Storebrand’s decision. It says on its website that each industry association it joins is different and include a range of different views which may differ from Rio Tinto’s views. “We believe that diverse and differing views should be heard and are an important step in finding compromise that allows progress to be made,” it said. BASF was not immediately available for comment. (Editing by Jason Neely)"
-7.751202775421118," Exxon limits Guyana crude output due to more gas injection issues (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is limiting output at its flagship offshore project in Guyana to 100,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) due to more issues with the reinjection of natural gas, the South American country’s environmental regulator said on Friday. Exxon, which operates the Stabroek block in a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, had initially planned to ramp up output for this first phase of the Liza project to its full capacity of 120,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) in August, Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said in a July earnings call. But mechanical issues with gas compressing equipment are preventing Exxon from reinjecting all of the natural gas produced alongside the light, sweet Liza crude, prompting the company to limit output so as to not flare an excessive amount of the gas, Guyana Environmental Protection Agency executive director Vincent Adams told Reuters. “We know that they’re doing their best to try to fix it, but the bottom line is it’s not fixed,” Adams said. Natural gas flaring is a significant source of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Guyanese authorities say Exxon should eliminate all flaring except for a “pilot” flame, necessary for safety. The first phase of the Liza field “demonstrated” its full capacity of 120,000 bpd in the second quarter, Chapman said in July. But in June, the company slashed output to around 30,000 bpd due to gas reinjection issues, before ramping back up to around 90,000 bpd. “We continue to safely complete final commissioning of the gas handling system,” an Exxon spokesperson said on Friday. “Once the system is fully commissioned, we will be able to produce at full capacity.” Exxon and its partners have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas off Guyana’s coast, which is expected to transform the poor country’s economy."

The Beaumont United Steelworkers (USW) union is the third USW local planning to demand bargaining on the issue, sources said, after locals in Baytown, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, made similar demands. If their demands are refused, the unions can file grievances. If those are declined, the unions can then file complaints with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board. Exxon said last week it would suspend the corporate 401K contribution, which is equal to 7% of an employee’s pay when an employee contributes 6% of their pay, in early October due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Asked about the Beaumont union’s plans, Exxon spokeswoman Ashley Alemayehu said, “Exxon Mobil’s total remuneration remains competitive despite the suspension.” Exxon has not said if the contributions will resume."

Employees blasted the decision by the largest U.S. oil company, which last week vowed to deepen cost cuts after posting back-to-back quarterly losses for the first time in its history. It has already cut outlays on big projects by 30% and operating expenses by at least $1 billion. A review of operations and staffing identified “significant potential” for additional savings, executives said last week. “Given the current business environment, the corporation is taking steps to reduce costs,” the company said in a message to employees seen by Reuters on Tuesday. “The company intends to suspend the company match contribution to the U.S. Exxon Mobil Savings Plan for all employees covered by the Savings Plan, effective around Oct. 1, 2020.” Exxon spokeswoman Ashley Alemayehu said the suspension was part of the company’s effort to reduce costs in response to the impact of the pandemic. “There is potential for further reductions based on long-term structural efficiencies, reduced activity and an evaluation of workforce requirements,” she said in an email to Reuters. In a statement, the United Steelworkers union (USW) said it was unfair for the company to cut the employer contribution to 401K programs of workers keeping refineries and chemical plants in operation through the pandemic. “Our members have continued to operate and maintain the facilities through the COVID-19 pandemic as essential workers,” the USW said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are assessing our options and will be doing all we can to protect our members’ benefits.” Exxon did not reply to questions about cuts in benefits for top executives. During a conference call with investors on Friday, Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said the company was planning both capital and operating expense cuts to defend its dividend. Under the savings plan, the company matches a 6% contribution by an employee with a contribution equal to 7% of the employee’s pay. Exxon will suspend the contribution beginning in early October. “As business conditions continue to evolve, company match contributions to the savings plan will be reassessed,” Exxon told employees on Tuesday. At Exxon’s Baytown, Texas, refinery and chemical plant, the local USW union plans to file a demand to negotiate over the change, said four sources familiar with the matter. At Exxon’s refineries and chemical plants in Beaumont, Texas, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Billings, Montana, no decision had been made on how to proceed, said the sources who are familiar with the union’s plans."

-20.951712442121405," Exxon posts second straight quarterly loss on demand, price plunge HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Friday reported a $1.1 billion second-quarter loss on sharply lower energy demand and prices from the COVID-19 pandemic, and confirmed plans to make deeper spending cuts. It was Exxon’s first back-to-back quarterly loss in at least 36 years, but was small in comparison to rivals who took giant charges last quarter. The top U.S. oil producer took no asset write-downs during the quarter, and got a 44-cent-a-share boost to earnings by increasing the value of inventories. Chevron Corp CVX.N, Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and Eni ENI.MI each wrote down their oil and gas properties last quarter by several billion dollars apiece, while BP BP.L signaled an up to $17.5 billion hit. Exxon slashed capital spending 30% this year to around $23 billion, and Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said it expects to spend less than $19 billion in next year. That would be the lowest spending for the company since at least 2005. It plans both capital and operating expense cuts to defend its dividend, Chapman said on a call with analysts, adding that investors “come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income.” It will not take on more debt and sees spending cuts as short term “to manage the current situation,” Chapman said. Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output and turn around sagging profits on a bet that a growing global middle class would demand more of its products. The plan to significantly raise production and boost cash by selling assets has faltered, leading Exxon to slash costs to preserve an 8% shareholder dividend. Exxon has identified an “undertaking a comprehensive evaluation,” of its global businesses, it said, without providing details. Exxon’s oil and gas production business fell to a loss and its refining unit was hit by lower demand and weaker prices. The U.S. oil major reported a loss of $1.08 billion, or 26 cents per share, compared with a profit of $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding inventory adjustments, the loss would have been $3 billion, it said. On that adjusted basis, its per share loss of 70 cents missed Wall Street’s estimate of 61 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. Exxon’s oil and gas output fell 7% to 3.6 million barrels per day during the quarter as it curtailed production due to the oil price crash. Rival Chevron on Friday reported an $8.3 billion loss on asset writedowns, plummeting fuel prices, and expenses tied to thousands of jobs cuts. Exxon’s production business reported a nearly $1.7 billion loss on lower output prices, compared with a $3.3 billion gain last year. Refining generated a $976 million operating profit despite lower margins and volumes. The unit’s gain came from an about $3.5 billion boost from non-cash inventory revaluations and by reversing a prior quarter’s impairment. Chemical operating profit was $467 million, up from $188 million last year, and was “resilient” in a tough environment, said analyst Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited. The company is running out of capacity to add debt “without jeopardizing the strength of its balance sheet,” said analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones. The losses call into question “how long Exxon can continue to fund its dividend if the macro environment doesn’t substantially improve.” Shares closed up a fraction at $42.08."

It was unclear how extensive the cuts will be. The largest U.S. oil company slashed this year’s budget by 30% in April, but Chief Executive Darren Woods’s turnaround through rebounding demand and increased asset sales have not panned out and losses are climbing. On Friday, Exxon is expected to report a $2.63 billion second-quarter loss, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, on sharply lower prices and weaker production, the first back-to-back quarterly losses in at least 36 years. Shares are down 35% so far this year as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed fuel demand. The latest cost cuts are needed to preserve the company’s nearly $15 billion annual payout to shareholders in the face of rising losses, the people said. Exxon will not generate enough cash from production operations to cover this year’s dividend, analysts have said. It borrowed $18 billion earlier this year to bolster cash. (For a graphic on Exxon's quarterly results, click: tmsnrt.rs/3fbJW8P) Woods so far this year held to the view that oil, natural gas and petrochemicals demand would rebound following an historic crash that saw global consumption fall by roughly one-third and U.S. prices plunge into negative territory in April. Rivals BP Plc BP.L, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Total TOTF.PA have slashed up to $45 billion in the combined value of their oil and gas properties. Meanwhile, Exxon's 2019 plan to raise $15 billion by 2021 through asset sales has gotten off to a slow start, fizzling this year due to lackluster demand from potential buyers. With energy prices expected to remain lackluster for years, Woods has turned to spending and staff cuts, and a business restructuring to salvage the payout. Rival Chevron Corp CVX.N has stood out as producing enough cash from operations to cover its dividend. Even if it does retain its full dividend this year, a cut is “a real possibility in 2021,” given the outlook for oil, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. “There is only so much Exxon can continue to lean on its balance sheet before they start to jeopardize” the payout, Rowland said. The dividend, which yields about 8% at Wednesday’s closing price of $44.03 a share, is sacrosanct at Exxon, which until this year raised the payout annually for 37 years. Its market value, however, has dropped by half since Woods took over in January 2017. Exxon has no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic and no percentage targets to reduce its workforce through this year’s employee reviews, said spokesman Casey Norton. “We are continually monitoring market conditions and our deep portfolio has flexibility to adjust our plans,” Norton said. Still, Exxon late last year changed its employee review system, internally referred to as forced ranking. The revision could increase the number of workers who land in the bottom category - to between 8% and 10% up from 3% last year. Those in the bottom category can either strive to meet their manager’s performance goals or leave with 90 days’ pay, person familiar with the matter said. The ranking applies only to its professional staff. It has 74,900 employees worldwide. In April, Exxon slashed this year’s capital spending budget to $23 billion, down $10 billion from the start of the year and to the lowest in four years. At the time, Woods said he could further revise spending this year or next. Prior to the pandemic, Woods had vowed investments in new fields, new and expanded chemical and refining operations would revive Exxon’s earnings and production. In early 2019, he predicted investments in production and refining could produce a $4 billion increase in earnings this year over last and reach up to $21.5 billion by 2025 at $40 a barrel oil, slightly below the current price. Woods also set a target to bring in $15 billion from asset sales between 2019 through 2021. Last year, it the sales brought in nearly $3.7 billion but proceeds this year are only $86 million. “It has fallen a bit behind schedule but there have been reports there are several packages out,” said Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman, who expects Exxon to reiterate the asset sale target on Friday. Wall Street will watch for new capital and operating expense cuts “and other available levers to defend the dividend,” Gabelman said."

Oil producers BP Plc BP.L, Occidental Petroleum OXY.N , and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L have cut billions of dollars off their assets in recent weeks. The oil industry “is clearly altering its view on the value of assets and we would not be surprised if Exxon followed suit,” said Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman by email. The size of any impairment is unclear, he said. Exxon will “start to lose credibility if they don’t take a writedown soon,” said Jennifer Rowland, an oil and gas analyst with Edward Jones, in an email. She did not estimate the size of any charge. While Exxon does not disclose the prices it uses to test for impairments, “I suspect they are still testing the balance sheet,” said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Europe Ltd, in an email. Exxon on Thursday signaled weak oil and gas and refining profits, prompting several analysts to say losses could be higher than they anticipated. For the first time, Exxon added language to an investor update saying it “may not account for all adjustments and charges required to fully reflect the changes in industry conditions.” A company spokesman called it “standard legal and accounting language,” however, and did not reply to a question about a possible write-down. Exxon rivals have aggressively reduced book values, with BP signaling an up to $17.5 billion write-down, Occidental up to $9 billion and Shell up to $22 billion this quarter."
-23.705480351331," Exxon signals second quarterly loss in a row on production, refining hits HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N oil and gas producing and refining businesses will report operating losses in the second quarter, it said in a regulatory filing on Thursday, setting the stage for the company to post another quarterly loss this year. Oil prices are down 35% since January as the COVID-19 pandemic slashed demand and a global glut forced widespread production cuts. Rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L have disclosed massive spending cuts and writedowns due to the price drop. Exxon faces a loss for the quarter of $2.3 billion, or 57 cents per share, according to estimates from Refinitiv IBES. It would be the second this year after a $610 million first-quarter deficit. Results are due out July 31. (For a graphic on results by quarter, click here: tmsnrt.rs/3gdqWI9) The filing did not refer to asset writedowns. However, in a change from prior quarterly updates, Exxon noted the list may not include all charges. Shell outlined an up to $22 billion charge and BP an up to $17.5 billion writedown on the oil demand and price drops. Exxon’s oil and gas operations will swing to a loss compared with the first quarter because of sharply lower prices. That drop reduced the unit’s operating profit by between $2.5 billion and $3.1 billion, the company said in its investor snapshot of operations. Refining results will fall by between $800 million and $1.l billion compared with the first quarter on weaker margins and logistics differentials, it said. The second quarter for all companies will be “dismal” due to oil and gas prices, refining margins and production, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. Exxon last quarter cut output by up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) and capital spending by 30%, much of it in its shale business. Shares have fallen about 38% this year. They were up 47 cents at $44.18 in premarket trading on Thursday."

-21.719003500382733," India's top gas importer close to long-term deal around spot prices NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top gas importer Petronet LNG will soon finalise a deal to import at least 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas with prices near the spot markets, its chief executive Prabhat Singh said on Tuesday. India wants to raise the share of natural gas in its energy mix from to 15% by 2030 from 6.2% now and is seeking affordable gas for its price-sensitive customers. “We are now in a position to come to a stage where very quickly we will be coming to nation with virtually spot pricing for a long-term deal,” Singh told a news conference. Earlier this year, Petronet invited bids to buy 1 mtpa of LNG for 10 years with pricing linked to Henry Hub natural gas futures in the United States and Dutch TTF gas futures and shipped on a delivered ex-ship basis. Singh said Petronet has received 13 offers and would soon finalise the deal, but did not give a specific time. LNG prices under Petronet’s current long-term deals cost about $3.5-$4.5/million British thermal units (mmBtu) compared to a spot price of about $2/mmBtu, Singh said. Petronet has a deal to buy 7.5 mtpa of LNG from Qatar and 1.44 mtpa from Exxon Mobil Corp’s Gorgon project in Australia. Petronet declared force majeure in March for supplies under long-term deals when a nationwide lockdown to contain COVID-19 reduced demand. Petronet’s head of finance V.K. Mishra said Qatargas and Exxon objected to the force majeure, which waives contractual obligations. Petronet invoked the clause on eight LNG cargoes from Qatar and one from Exxon for loading from March to May, Mishra said. “We are trying to convince them and hopefully we will work out a solution because as per contract this is admissible,” Mishra said. Qatargas did not immediately reply to emails from Reuters requesting comment. Exxon said in an email it did not comment “on the details of commercial matters”. Mishra and Singh also said Petronet was in talks with Qatargas to renegotiate gas pricing under its long-term deals as spot prices have declined."

Petronet has a deal to buy 7.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG from Qatar and 1.44 mtpa from Exxon’s Gorgon project in Australia. Petronet invoked the force majeure on eight LNG cargoes of Qatar and one from Exxon for loading from March to May, its head of finance V.K. Mishra told an analyst conference. Force majeure is a clause in commercial contracts allowing companies to not fulfill contracts because of event outside their control. “They have objected to this force majeure, we are trying to convince them and hopefully we will work out a solution because as per contract this is admissible,” Mishra said. “They have objected to it but they have not given any reason why this is not a force majeure.” Exxon Mobil and Qatargas did not immediately reply to emails from Reuters requesting comment on their objections to the force majeure. Mishra also said Petronet is in talks with Qatargas to renegotiate gas pricing under its long-term deals as spot prices have declined. Indian gas demand has recovered now and the company’s Dahej LNG terminal, which can bring in 17.5 mtpa, is now operating at about 100% capacity, Mishra said. He hoped the Dahej terminal will continue to fully operate for the remainder of the fiscal year to March 2021, while capacity use at the 5-mtpa Kochi terminal will improve after a key pipeline linking customers is ready this year. Petronet’s non-binding memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in Tellurian Inc’s Driftwood LNG project expired in May, Mishra said, adding his firm may renew the pact."
-21.7990292905826," District of Columbia sues four oil majors for misleading consumers on climate change WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The attorney general for the District of Columbia on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corp , BP Plc, Chevron Corp, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc for “systematically and intentionally misleading” consumers about the role their products play in causing climate change, the latest action by a U.S. attorney general against the oil and gas industry. The lawsuit brought by Attorney General Karl Racine comes a day after Minnesota AG Keith Ellison filed a lawsuit against the American Petroleum Institute, Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries for violating state laws barring consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices and false advertising. “The defendants violated the District’s consumer protection law by concealing the fact that using fossil fuels threatens the health of District residents and the environment,” Racine said in a statement. The intent of the legal action is to “end these disinformation campaigns and to hold these companies accountable for their deceptive practices,” he said. Casey Norton, a spokesman for Exxon, said the lawsuit is part of a “coordinated, politically motivated” campaign against energy companies. “The claims are baseless and without merit. We look forward to defending the company in court,” he said. Sean Comey, a spokesman for Chevron echoed claims about the merit of the case and said the litigation “distracts” from its efforts to address climate change. Anna Arata, a spokeswoman for Shell, said in a statement that “we’re committed to playing our part” with regards to addressing climate change and that lawsuits “impede the collaboration needed for meaningful change.” Shell set goal this year of achieving “net-zero” emissions by 2050. Racine told reporters on Thursday that his office only learned of Minnesota’s lawsuit when it was filed yesterday and had been preparing this long before. Minnesota and D.C.’s lawsuits are the latest in a string of legal challenges by states, cities, and citizen groups targeting fossil fuel companies over their role in global warming. Counterparts in California, New York and Massachusetts also filed lawsuits against oil majors but the Minnesota and D.C. lawsuits focus on consumer protection. Racine said the named companies “sought to create a false picture” about the environmental harm that fossil fuels cause, even as they “pivot their marketing efforts” to portray their products as clean."

Output at the Liza field, which Exxon operates in a consortium with Hess Corp and CNOOC Ltd, has fallen to between 25,000-30,000 barrels per day within the past week, according to Vincent Adams, head of Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency. That was down from between 75,000-80,000 bpd in early May, when authorities had anticipated that output from the field - which began production in December, raising hopes for increased prosperity in the impoverished country - would rise to 120,000 bpd by June. Without the compressor fully functioning in order to reinject gas produced alongside the crude into the reservoir, Exxon had to reduce crude output to avoid exceeding a 15 million-cubic feet per day limit agreed to with authorities for gas flaring, Adams said. Exxon said in a statement that it was continuing to complete final commissioning of the gas handling system. “The current situation is a temporary, unplanned event related to project startup,” Exxon said. “Once the system is fully commissioned, we will be able to produce at full capacity.” Oil companies worldwide are seeking to reduce gas flaring from their operations in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

-20.229041027246634," Exxon weighs letting Beaumont, Texas, refinery expansion slip into 2023: sources HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is considering slipping the completion of an expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery by up to a year into 2023 because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil demand, said sources familiar with the company’s plans. “Exxon Mobil is evaluating all appropriate steps to significantly reduce capital and operating expenses in the near term as a result of market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity price decreases,” Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said on Friday. Eikenberry declined to comment on the Beaumont refinery expansion project, which will add a 250,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit (CDU), boosting the refinery’s capacity to 619,000 bpd. Exxon said in April that it would slow spending on its $20 billion “Growing the Gulf Initiative,” to expand downstream manufacturing in Texas and Louisiana, including the Beaumont refinery expansion. The new CDU would make the Beaumont refinery the largest in the United States, surpassing the 607,000-bpd Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas, refinery by 12,000 bpd if the Motiva plant does not expand before the Exxon Beaumont project is completed. The expansion, when formally announced in January 2019, was planned to take advantage of new crude supplies from Exxon’s newly developed oil fields in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. In April, Exxon announced it would also slow spending in development of the Permian. Exxon began preparing the site of the new CDU in 2018, before the final decision to build the unit was made. The CDU is being built in modules that will be assembled at the Beaumont refinery, the sources said. CDUs do the initial breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks for all other production units in the refinery, as well as producing unfinished motor fuels."
-18.518927804033968," Exclusive: Exxon set to revive North Sea sale after months of delays - sources LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N is preparing to restart the sale of its British North Sea assets after weaker oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak led to months of delay, industry and banking sources said. The sale process, initially planned for late last year, is expected to raise less than originally expected after a 40% drop in oil prices since January and their weakened long-term outlook. The top U.S. oil company has in recent weeks held talks with a number of potential North Sea buyers to gauge interest in the portfolio, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said on condition of anonymity. Exxon is unlikely to officially launch the sale process if it finds there is insufficient interest, the sources said. Exxon declined to comment. “As a matter of practice, ExxonMobil does not comment on market rumours or speculation about our business plans,” Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said. Most of Exxon's British operations are managed through Esso Exploration and Production UK, a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields. The JV, one of the industry’s oldest, has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976. The portfolio’s value, however, is unclear. Initially, Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon hoped to raise over $2 billion from the sale, according to the sources. They said $1 to $1.5 billion was more likely now given the oil market’s weakness. A spokeswoman for investment bank Jefferies, which is running the sale process, declined to comment. With many of the assets approaching the end of their lives, their value will depend largely on how the buyer and Exxon agree to manage the costs of plugging wells and removing unused platforms, a process known as decommissioning. Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor and NEO Exploration & Production. HitecVision, which owns NEO, and Chrysaor declined to comment. Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, roughly 5% of Britain’s daily demand, its website says. Exxon plans to sell up to $25 billion of assets globally over the coming years to release cash to focus on a handful of mega-projects, three banking sources said. Last month Exxon also revived the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan’s largest oil field, sources told Reuters."

It said another project could be for a 3,000-MW LNG power plant in the Mekong Delta province of Long An. The plants would use LNG imported from the United States or from some other countries, it said, without elaborating. “Importing LNG from the U.S. will help balance trade between Vietnam and the U.S.,” the statement said."

Prime Minister James Marape came to power a year ago on a platform to lift the country out of poverty by getting a bigger share of wealth from the country’s energy and minerals. His government this week secured an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund. The country would not break legitimate exploration or development contracts or agreements, Marape said in a posting on his Facebook page after the legislation was passed on Wednesday. “I can assure our investors that we know they must make money for their shareholders too, so we will not be greedy, but we (are) just asking for a fair share, if they want to harvest our resources,” Marape wrote. The government also plans to put in place a production sharing regime to take effect from 2025, he said. Marape’s push for more benefits for PNG has held up talks on Exxon’s P’nyang gas development, key to a $13 billion plan to double the country’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said the amended law could pose challenges for the project. “The move may signal the PNG government’s resolve to maintain a tough approach to fiscal terms negotiations,” Kavonic said in a note. Exxon said in an emailed statement: “We are hopeful that we can continue to work towards an outcome that benefits all stakeholders.” The mining law changes deal with the government’s rights to take back tenements where a lease has lapsed or been cancelled. That follows the government’s refusal to extend an expired lease over the Porgera gold mine, mainly owned by a joint venture of Barrick Gold Corp and China’s Zijin Mining Group. Newcrest Mining, which is looking to develop the Wafi Golpu gold project, said the changes would not affect its operations."

BlackRock is the company’s second largest institutional owner with about 6.7% of Exxon shares outstanding. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on the BlackRock votes, but pointed to CEO Darren Woods’ remarks that Exxon recognizes the importance of addressing climate risks and has focused on developing technologies to address them. BlackRock said it also voted against Exxon directors Angela Braly, the former CEO of health insurer WellPoint, and Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co, over Exxon’s “insufficient progress” on climate-related financial disclosures and related action. Both directors were reelected. “We continue to see a gap in the company’s disclosure and action with regard to several components of its climate risk management,” BlackRock wrote of its votes."

-7.1299210267372," Exclusive: Exxon revives sale of stake in giant Azeri oilfield LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N has relaunched the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan's largest oilfield, the company said on Tuesday, as banking and industry sources said the move was drawing interest from large Asian oil and gas companies seeking to capitalize on the recent collapse in oil prices. The top U.S. oil and gas company first tried to sell its 6.8% stake in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea in 2018, as rival Chevron CVX.N launched the sale of its own 9.57% stake in the field. While Exxon's sale process was never officially suspended, it was put on the backburner when Chevron started negotiations with Hungarian energy firm MOL MOLB.BU for the sale of its assets last year, which led to a $1.57 billion deal in November. Exxon’s process, run by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, was recently relaunched despite oil prices halving to around $30 a barrel after a historic collapse in oil consumption due to coronavirus-linked lockdowns that restricted people’s movement. “Exxon Mobil is testing market interest for its non-operated producing assets in Azerbaijan,” Exxon spokeswoman Julie King told Reuters. Exxon routinely evaluates its producing portfolio and “if other companies find more value in an asset, we will sell,” she added. A number of Asian national oil companies, including China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), India’s ONGC and Indonesia’s Pertamina, have shown interest in the stake recently, hoping to clinch a deal at a lower price than before, according to four industry and banking sources. It was unclear how much Exxon was seeking to raise from the sale, but it is likely to be valued significantly lower than Chevron’s stake, the sources said. A spokesman for SOCAR, Azerbaijan’s national oil company declined to comment. BAML declined to comment, and Pertamina did not respond to requests for comment. ONGC did not respond to a request for comment. An Indian industry source said, however, that ONGC, which holds a stake in ACG, had yet to decide whether to bid for Exxon’s stake and was in talks with other partners in the field. China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK and parent company China National Offshore Oil Company, or CNOOC, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The sharp drop in oil prices pushed Exxon into its first quarterly loss in decades in the first three months of the year and the Irving, Texas-based company cut its spending by 30%. Exxon last year launched a plan to divest up to $25 billion of oil and gas fields in Europe, Asia and Africa as it sharpened its focus on a handful of mega projects at home and abroad. The effort so far has fallen short of returning asset sale proceeds to a prior average of $5 billion a year. Exxon has sold assets in Norway for $4.5 billion and has launched processes in Australia, Malaysia and Nigeria. The launch of a number of processes, including the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas portfolio have been put on hold following the collapse in oil prices, according to sources. For Exxon, the sale of its operations in Azerbaijan would mark the end of a 25-year involvement. Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan’s current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994. The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the “the contract of the century” thanks to the field’s large reserves and hopes for future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas."

Exxon’s broad rejection of climate proposals, challenging sponsors and rebuffing ballot measures as either micromanaging or unneeded, has accelerated under Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods. This year, it blocked six climate resolution from appearing on the proxy ballot at its May 27 shareholder meeting. U.S. oil majors face less government pressure to curb greenhouse gas emissions and have lagged European rivals in striking deals with activists. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA and BP Plc have each moved to slash carbon emissions and meet global accords. New York state’s pension fund, Church Commissioners for England, and Legal & General Investment Management, which all battled Exxon over global warming and lobbying disclosures have this year taken up a call to split the CEO and chairman roles, expecting a better reception from an outsider. “The company has been a laggard on financial performance, climate risk management and lobbying disclosure for quite some time now,” said Thomas DiNapoli, New York state comptroller and head of the state’s biggest pension fund. “Its peers in Europe, many of whom have independent board chairs, are outperforming Exxon on all these,” he said. California Public Employees Retirement System, which holds 9.6 million Exxon shares, just behind New York’s 10.2 million shares, last week came out in favor of splitting the two roles. Proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co separately called for splitting the two roles. On Tuesday, Institutional Shareholder Services urged holders to vote “against” creating an independent chairman, reversing its stance from a year ago. Exxon’s naming of a lead director able to meet with shareholders changed its view, ISS wrote. Exxon management is under scrutiny after reporting the first loss in three decades. Under CEO Woods, Exxon spent heavily in the last three years for new oil and natural gas supplies, a move that has so far backfired as prices collapsed. In a sign of how seriously it takes the challenge, Exxon on Wednesday issued a four page rebuttal to Glass Lewis, challenging the advisory firm on the peer group used to measure executive pay, and praising CEO Woods’ “in-depth knowledge of ExxonMobil and its integrated, multinational operations.” Climate measures elsewhere are gaining. Three climate proposals this year have won majority votes, including at oil firms’ Phillips 66 and Ovintiv Inc. While not all results from the 15 are in yet, last year none received a majority, according to data compiled by the Sustainable Investments Institute. Activists are smarting from a 2017 vote. That year, 62% of shareholders approved a measure led by New York state and calling for Exxon to disclose business impacts from complying with climate policies. After agreeing not to pursue the topic the following year, New York officials were disappointed by the resulting report. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment, pointing to rebuttals that note it has increased the lead director’s power. Combining the chairman and CEO roles “ensures items of greatest importance for the business” are quickly brought to the board, Exxon told shareholders in urging a vote against the measure. It also pointed to $10 billion in lower-emissions investments it has made over a decade. The proposal for an independent board chairman would not take effect under Woods, but would be phased in for future CEOs. As at other big companies, shareholder support for an independent chairman has never gotten far at Exxon. Last year, 40.7% of Exxon shareholders supported the measure, up from 38.7% in 2018. A measure calling for the company to report on its lobbying activities also failed. But both were “within striking distance of getting a majority,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England.

ISS came out in favor of proposals calling for reports on the company’s political contributions and on its lobbying payments. Both would help Exxon owners assess the risks and benefits from the activities, ISS wrote. The adviser said Exxon’s lobbying disclosures are “insufficiently transparent,” and said it does not provide a list of payments to nor membership in trade groups or organizations that may make political contributions. In its proxy statements, Exxon called for “no” votes for both measures, describing its political donation reports as “sufficiently transparent” and noting its lobbying expense information was enhanced this year. ISS joined Exxon in opposing a proposal seeking a report on the public health risks of expanding its petrochemical operations in flood prone areas, and another seeking a cost benefit analysis of the company’s voluntary climate activities.

Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which has $1.5 trillion under management and owns about 0.5% of Exxon or shares worth about $1 billion, said the U.S. company had not disclosed its full greenhouse gas emissions and had failed to set company-wide emissions reduction targets. U.S. majors lag European rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell or BP in making climate-related commitments. A group of investors representing $19 trillion sees Shell and Eni taking a lead among oil majors on climate issues but says even their targets fall short of goals needed to hit targets in the 2015 Paris climate deal. “We remain concerned by the Exxon’s lack of strategic ambition around climate change,” said Meryam Omi, LGIM Head of Sustainability and Responsible Investment Strategy. She said LGIM would vote against re-electing Darren Woods as chair of the company at the shareholders’ meeting on May 27. Woods is also the company’s chief executive. Exxon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reflecting its concerns, LGIM divested Exxon shares last year from its Future World Funds, which focuses on environment, social and governance performance. “We are seeing many of Exxon’s peers step up, and reaffirm their sustainability ambitions even amid the current testing circumstances. The world, and Exxon’s investors, cannot afford the company to fall behind,” Omi said. LGIM is also opposed companies combining the role of chief executive and chair, a practice followed at Exxon and many other U.S. companies. “We believe that the separation of combined CEO and board chair roles provides a better balance of authority and responsibility,” Omi said. “In addition, if companies spend investors’ money on lobbying governments, we expect them to account for how and why they do this,” she added. BP and Norway’s Equinor have recently withdrawn from trading and lobbying groups over climate-related policies."
-4.109423159272402," Exxon pursues cost cuts at Russia's Sakhalin-1 project MOSCOW (Reuters) - Exxon Neftegaz Ltd (ENL) is adjusting the schedule and scope of some of its activities at the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in far eastern Russia as it moves to cut spending in response to the coronavirus crisis and weak oil prices, it said on Friday. The subsidiary of U.S. oil company Exxon Mobil Corp declined to give further details. Exxon, like other international energy majors, has been forced to scale back production and investments due to the economic fallout from the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and a crash in oil prices. “In response to challenges posed by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and the current global oil price environment, ENL is adjusting the schedule and scope of certain Sakhalin-1 activities,” ENL said in emailed comments to Reuters. Exxon posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, due to an almost $3 billion inventory writedown, reflecting lower margins and prices. The company has cut this year’s project spending by $10 billion and expects to reduce oil and gas output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with rivals. Russia has also undertaken to cut its oil production by around 20% as part of a global deal aimed at improving oil markets, where prices have slumped to two decade lows amid oversupply and a plunge in demand due to coronavirus lockdowns. It is not yet clear if foreign-led projects in the country are a party to that reduction, as oil majors have been haggling with national governments over how to share out deep production cuts. “ENL, as Sakhalin-1 operator, is looking to reduce spending in response to market conditions, and evaluating all appropriate steps to reduce capital and operating expenses in the near term,” the company said. “We are not commenting on the status of individual projects at this time.” Four companies - Russian energy giant Rosneft (20%), Exxon (30%), Japan’s SODECO (30%) and India’s ONGC Videsh (20%) - are partners in the Sakhalin-1 group of fields. In 2018, Sakhalin-1 produced over 11.6 million tonnes (230,000 bpd) of oil and gas condensate. It set its daily production record of 300,000 bpd that year."

-1.263681949786321," Guyana has no plans to cut crude output despite price drop: official (Reuters) - Guyana has no plans to cut crude output despite a plunge in oil prices, the government’s top energy official said on Monday, adding that shutting down production could prove costly and harm future output. Mark Bynoe, the director of the Department of Energy, said the country’s crude production averages between 75,000-80,000 barrels per day (bpd) and is expected to ramp up to 120,000 bpd by early June. The production and storage vessel at the offshore Liza field has storage capacity of 1.6 million barrels, he said. A drop in oil consumption due to the coronavirus outbreak has led to oversupply and a price collapse, just as a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp ramps up production at Liza, where Guyana began producing crude for the first time in its history in December. Exxon operates the Stabroek block, which includes the Liza field, in a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd. Bynoe told reporters that despite the drop in demand, the country was not having trouble finding vessels for exports. When asked about the possibility of buying storage space aboard vessels, Bynoe said that the government would consider all options but that floating storage is expensive. “This is a time to keep current production as is and do nothing that could jeopardize the operational integrity of Liza,” Bynoe said. “Shutting down existing production can prove costly and detrimental to any future production.” The South American country has no onshore crude storage capacity. Exxon said last week that challenges rotating crews due to the impact of COVID-19 “temporarily slowed” its drilling campaign in Guyana, and that it now expected to reach its production objective of 750,000 bpd by 2026, rather than 2025. Bynoe acknowledged that coronavirus-related restrictions were impacting drilling. He said there were currently two active drilling rigs operating in the country’s waters, and two on standby. Exxon also said development of its Payara field, the consortium’s third major project in the Stabroek block, was delayed due to political uncertainty. Guyana held presidential elections on March 2, but is currently awaiting a recount after the opposition questioned the integrity of the results. Bynoe said the government had sent Exxon several “matters to be addressed” before it approves the company’s Payara field development plan, though he declined to discuss specific issues. “This is not just a case of politics,” Bynoe said. “There are some other improvements to be made.”"

The director, Lee Raymond, who is up for re-election at the bank’s annual meeting on May 19, had earlier asked the board to start a formal process to find a successor for the lead independent director role, JPMorgan said previously. But in a securities filing on Thursday JPMorgan said it plans to name a new lead independent director “by end of summer 2020.” A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment beyond the language in the filings. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city’s pension fund and whose office last month began a campaign to vote out Raymond, in a statement sent by a spokeswoman called the change “a tremendous victory for shareholders and for the planet.” Stringer’s office in its campaign against Raymond had cited JPMorgan’s lending to fossil fuel companies and Raymond’s long tenure on JPMorgan’s board. Raymond has been on the board of JPMorgan and a predecessor since 1987. Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday had recommended investors back all JPMorgan directors, but called its support for Raymond “cautionary” in order “to convey that additional, new independent oversight is necessary as the process to find his successor unfolds.”[nL1N2CJ03L]"

Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world’s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70% this year to under $20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever. Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts. “We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,” Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview. The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output. Exxon’s biggest cuts will come in the Permian, “where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted,” said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is “beneficial in long term” to ensure “we’re bringing those high production rates into a market that’s more conducive.” Exxon will sideline 75% of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working. The company posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year. (For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: ) Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years. Even though their results topped Wall Street’s reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7% to $43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8% to $89.44. Chevron’s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it “a defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas,” said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. Exxon’s balance sheet “is strong enough to withstand the current environment,” but it needs oil prices around $75 per barrel this year to break even versus around $50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited. U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around $26 per barrel. Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends. Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc’s first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record."

Exxon Mobil has a new hot commodity: hand sanitizer. The $200 billion oil giant said it’s reconfiguring manufacturing facilities in Louisiana to produce highly sought after medical-grade alcohol-based liquid cleaner for donation. At one point it was selling for as much as $138 a bottle on eBay, according to The Atlantic. That is the type of scarcity the oil company run by Darren Woods could only dream of. Last week, regional oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate went negative for the first time in history as Covid-19 punctured demand and stockpile storage filled up. Exxon has high hopes that demand for the commodity will return. With renewable energy and other supply shocks also part of the equation, Woods might consider keeping those assembly lines flexible. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin) PACKING ESSENTIALS. Clorox is cleaning up. Sales for the quarter ending March 31 rose an eye-popping 15% year-over-year to nearly $2 billion as people snapped up bleach and Pine-Sol products to disinfect their homes. The last time the company saw such a double-digit boost in revenue was in 2008. But in this downturn, the $23 billion maker of Glad garbage bags, Brita water filters and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing will likely see the sales streak continue. Chances are high that well after lockdowns ease, people will still be in scrubbing mode. The Covid-19 crisis has imprinted on consumers the importance of diligent handwashing and wiping down work desks and computers. Clorox will benefit from lasting good habits. (By Amanda Gomez) BAETEN BACK. Facing reality can be tough in the midst of a crisis. Just ask Allianz’s boss Oliver Baete, who on Friday said he expects a 30% year-on-year fall in first-quarter earnings. He also scrapped an annual target of achieving between 11.5 billion euros and 12.5 billion euros of operating profit. It’s an about-turn for the 70 billion euro insurer. Allianz had been fairly optimistic in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, standing by its dividend and share buyback scheme. Its shares trade at nearly 10 times forward earnings, compared with less than 7 times for France’s AXA. The dividend is still intact, but the sheen may come off when Baete gives a more detailed outlook for 2020 in less than two weeks. Shares fell 3% on Friday. Germany’s insurance giant may be succumbing to gravity. (By Aimee Donnellan) PROFITS OF DOOM. Airline CEOs are falling over each other to paint the darkest picture for their low-flying industry.

Carsten Spohr, O’Leary’s counterpart at German giant Deutsche Lufthansa, went further in a speech to shareholders published late on Thursday, saying demand won’t “find its new balance”, whatever that means, until 2023. Such projections should be taken with an in-flight sachet of salt. Neither airline is offering guidance for this year, let alone the ones after that. The doom and gloom probably has a more immediate function. Spohr is trying to convince Berlin of the need for a 9 billion euro bailout. O’Leary, who likens state aid to “doping”, needs to justify massive job cuts. (By Ed Cropley) UK’S BROKEN BUSINESS BAROMETER. Royal Bank of Scotland is having a much better crisis than last time. The 14 billion pound lender, whose shares rose 2% after results on Friday, generated 331 million pounds of earnings in the first quarter and had a chunky 16.6% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. That compares with a tsunami of losses and a bailout in 2008. Eschewing investment banking and focusing on British business lending and mortgages helped. But Chief Executive Alison Rose’s 2020 outlook is disconcerting for UK economy-watchers. Bad-debt charges spiked to 0.9% of loans in the first quarter. They’ll be “meaningfully higher” over the full year than previous expectations of up to 0.4% of loans, but Rose can’t say by how much. The statement notes that the efficacy of government support programmes is “yet to be proven”. Gulp. (By Liam Proud)"
-0.565818902049949," WRAPUP 1-Exxon, Chevron slam brakes on shale as oil demand tumbles HOUSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on U.S. shale oil production at a time when crude prices and fuel demand have plunged due to global lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in output and investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world’s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter ahead of planned cuts. Each had been racing to hit 1 million barrels per day of production in the Permian. But fuel demand sank nearly a third this year as travel and business lockdowns collided with a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hitting the market when those countries abandoned production cuts. Prices for U.S. crude have dropped nearly 70% this year, and actually settled in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever. On Friday, Exxon and Chevron, the two top U.S. oil producers, announced shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter, much of it from their U.S. shale units. The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output. Both companies have been rapidly sidelining Permian drilling equipment since prices crashed starting in March. “We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,” said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber in an interview.

-0.565818902049949," Exxon posts first loss in 30 years on writedown, oil price plunge HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Friday posted its first quarterly loss in three decades on plunging oil demand and collapsing prices, reporting a $610 million quarterly deficit after a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown. Global fuel demand has tumbled by a third on coronavirus-related lockdowns and business shutdowns. Oil giants largely have reported losses on weaker margins and writedowns from an oil glut that has sent prices to historic lows. All of Exxon’s businesses posted lower year-over-year profits or wider losses on declining prices and margins. Despite a deep spending cut and its first quarterly loss since 1988, the company believes a growing global middle will ultimately lift demand. “The long-term fundamentals that drive our business have not changed,” said Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. However, he conceded, “It’s going to be a very challenging summer.” Exxon's results echoed those of rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and BP BP.L, though Chevron CVX.N reported a first-quarter profit gain due to asset sales. The largest oil companies have largely sought to protect investor payouts by increasing borrowing or cutting expenses. Exxon, BP, and Chevron maintained their quarterly payouts while Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two. Exxon has cut this year’s project spending by $10 billion and expects to reduce oil and gas output by 400,000 barrel per day in line with rivals. Chevron also plans to cut as much as 300,000 bpd this month and up to 400,000 in June. (For a chart on Exxon's quarterly results, click here: tmsnrt.rs/3aTTnrp) Exxon posted a loss of $610 million, or 14 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $2.35 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges, adjusted profit was 53 cents a share, beating Wall Street’s forecast for an adjusted profit of 18 cents. Earnings from oil and gas production fell 91% from a year ago on weak oil prices. Exxon’s volumes were higher, with its U.S. shale production up 56% from a year-ago. (For a chart on Exxon's oil output, click here: tmsnrt.rs/35rdBrC) Its refining business swung to a $611 million operating loss on weak demand and inventory charges. Lower costs and gains from trading helped limit losses, the company said. The chemical unit posted a profit of $144 million, down 75% from a year ago but up from a fourth-quarter loss. “The downstream in particular came in ahead of our expectations,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria. The chemicals unit “was a better result than any time in 2019,” he added. Its shares were down 3% at $45.03 in morning trading. The stock is down 34% this year. Exxon’s production rose slightly to about 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from 3.98 million boepd. A goal of producing 750,000 bpd from Guyana discoveries by 2025 would be pushed back a year, Exxon said."

-0.565818902049949," In bare-knuckle negotiations, Exxon slants view of pandemic to suit its aims HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is using the coronavirus to increase its leverage in labor and real estate negotiations by alternately doomsaying and dismissing the pandemic’s consequences, labor sources and lawyers dealing with the company said. The largest U.S. oil and gas producer this month told workers in Texas and New Jersey to accept contract offers because they would not find other jobs. In California, Exxon rejected a request to delay a property deal, arguing business could proceed normally despite the pandemic, and threatened to keep the buyer’s down payment when it asked for more time due to the lockdown. Exxon said it has not used the pandemic to enhance its bargaining position. “We reject these unwarranted claims and any assertions to the contrary are baseless and without merit,” said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler. Exxon is known as a tough negotiator. But the coronavirus has provided new talking points during contract disputes, unions said. “They said, ‘Take a look out there. If you strike or we lock you out, there are no jobs out there,’” said Ricky Brooks, the head of a United Steelworkers local that represents about 800 refinery, chemical plant and laboratory workers at an Exxon facility in Baytown, Texas. In New Jersey, negotiators representing employees at Exxon’s Paulsboro Lube Oil Manufacturing plant were told the same thing, said an Independent Oil Workers union member who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “Exxon has blatantly and intentionally leveraged COVID-19 as a means to get what they want,” said USW official Brooks. The company offered Baytown union workers 3.5% and 4% annual raises in the first two years of a three-year contract, said Brooks. The union workers in the refinery and laboratory rejected the deal because Exxon proposed new workers wait 4-1/2 years to achieve pay parity with other workers. It now takes four years. Philip Hilder, a former federal prosecutor who has faced Exxon in negotiations, said the company has “the ability to wear down their opponents financially and mentally” using its deep pockets to avoid settling. The approach, which he described as “a take-no-prisoners’ view of litigation” is designed to deter opponents and win any contest. Exxon lawyers this month threatened to cancel a California property deal and keep the down payment when a buyer invoked force majeure to postpone a closing date due to the pandemic. Force majeure clauses are common in the energy industry as a way to suspend contracts during natural and man-man disasters. The prospective buyer, Pacific Collective LLC, had sought to delay the $4.2 million purchase of the site of a former service station until county, Culver City and Los Angeles’ stay-at-home directives were lifted. Exxon on Wednesday filed to move the developer’s breach of contract lawsuit to a federal court. “There are no conditions to closing that exist in the Agreement that cannot be met,” Exxon wrote in a filing submitted to Los Angeles County Superior Court, noting that property permits, inspections and transfers were essential businesses and able to operate. “The Title Company has also confirmed that, at this time, it is able to close the transaction,” they added."

5.206525038863184," Algeria's Sonatrach signs MOU with Exxon to boost partnership ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria’s Sonatrach has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Exxon Mobil Corp to pave the way for talks on exploration opportunities in the OPEC member North African country, the state-owned firm said in a statement on Monday. Algeria has been seeking foreign partnerships to boost output and exports which have dropped in recent years due to growing domestic demand and a lack of foreign investment. The export volumes fall and a sharp drop in global crude oil prices have significantly hit the country’s energy earnings, the main source of state finances. The latest oil price crash that followed the novel coronavirus outbreak forced the government to cut public spending by 30%, delay economic and social projects and halve Sonatrach’s planned investment for 2019 to $7 billion. In a bid to attract foreign investors, Algeria late last year approved a new energy law offering incentives including easing the tax burden. “The signature... (on the MOU) shows the interest of the parties in evaluating the options for collaboration following the promulgation of the new hydrocarbons law,” Sonatrach said in its statement."
5.879069117230185," Exxon raises $9.5 billion to load up on cash while debt market still open to new deals NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday raised $9.5 billion in new debt, with the largest U.S. oil producer seeking to bolster its finances while debt markets remain open to new deals. Exxon paid a lower price to borrow than it did in a similar debt deal almost four weeks ago, a sign of how investor confidence is gradually returning after a rout in energy prices and a stock market collapse fueled by the coronavirus outbreak. Nevertheless, borrowing costs for Exxon were still higher than prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Exxon raised $9.5 billion by selling five different bonds with a variety of durations ranging from five years to 31 years, up from $9 billion which it had originally planned to raise, indicating robust investor demand. In an example of how the company’s borrowing costs have come down in recent weeks, it priced a 10.5-year bond worth $2 billion at a 185 basis-point premium to U.S. Treasuries with a 2.61% yield. On March 17, Exxon sold $2 billion in debt with a 10-year duration where the premium to U.S. Treasuries was 240 basis points and the yield was 3.482%. In August last year, Exxon raised $1.25 billion through a 10-year bond with a premium to U.S. Treasuries of just 75 basis points and a yield of 2.44%. The new issue by Exxon comes as highly rated U.S. companies have been tapping debt markets for cash at a record clip, stocking up on cash due to the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact from coronavirus. The logic behind Exxon’s deal was to stock up further on cash while the market is still open to issuers of new debt, according to a person familiar with the matter. Exxon’s stock has been hammered this year by the collapse in oil prices, with its share price down 38.7% so far in 2020, a steeper fall than the 14.5% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. In a regulatory filing, Exxon said it planned to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes.” Oil prices were mixed on Monday, as the historic production-cut deal signed by major global oil producers was not enough to assuage existing worries about the demand destruction brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Other companies to issue new debt on Monday included U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co, drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and movie theater operator Cinemark Holdings Inc."
1.7005402448338596," Shell, Exxon halt some Gulf of Mexico output due to Exxon pipeline leak (Reuters) - A leak in a pipeline that carries oil from U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore facilities has halted production at two fields, Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell said on Monday. Shell said it temporarily halted production on its 100,000-barrel-per-day deepwater Perdido production hub last Thursday after a subsurface leak was discovered on Exxon’s Hoover Offshore Oil Pipeline System (HOOPS). Production on Exxon’s Hoover platform also was halted because of the leak, Exxon said. The HOOPS pipeline has been closed for repairs, a spokeswoman for Shell said. Exxon has notified government agencies and shippers and has responded to an onshore release of crude oil at a facility in Freeport, Texas, spokesman Todd Spitler said on Monday. “We anticipate resuming flow on the line in a timely manner once it is safe to do so,” he said. Exxon did not say what caused the leak or how much production was affected. HOOPS connects the Exxon-operated Hoover, Marshall and Madison offshore fields, which combined produce about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, according to a 2018 marketing brochure. Shell’s Perdido hub is moored in some 8,000 feet (2,438 m) of water about 200 miles (322 km) south of Galveston, Texas, and is a joint venture among Shell, BP Plc and Chevron Corp. The 153-mile (246-km) HOOPS pipeline brings oil from several offshore oilfields to the Quintana Terminal near Freeport, according to an Exxon website."

-2.244498367902642," California developer says virus an act of God, sues Exxon over stalled deal (Reuters) - A California retail developer claims the state’s coronavirus lockdown was an act of God that prevented it from completing a $4.2 million property acquisition, asking a court to prevent owner Exxon Mobil Corp from selling to any other buyers. Pacific Collective LLC invoked force majeure in its bid to delay an Exxon property acquisition, according to a suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The legal clause refers to unexpected events that prevent one party to a contract from meeting its obligations. Sometimes referred to as the act of God clause, force majeure is being invoked elsewhere in energy contracts. BP this month cited force majeure for a one-year delay on a natural gas project, and three Indian refiners have cited it in rejecting crude oil imports. An Exxon spokesman declined immediate comment, citing pending litigation. Pacific Collective did not reply to a request for comment and an attorney for the firm declined to comment. The retail property developer’s lawsuit seeks $7.9 million in damages for alleged breach of contract and an injunction prohibiting Exxon from selling the property to someone else. Pacific Collective invoked force majeure on March 30, a day before the acquisition was to close. Three days later Exxon notified the developer it would cancel the sale and keep the company’s deposit, according to the lawsuit. Exxon’s insistence on the scheduled closing required “acts that would qualify as crimes under the current California and County of LA Stay-at-Home Orders,” Pacific Collective’s complaint said. Coronavirus could constitute a legal force majeure as long as a company can show it is effectively impossible to perform contractual duties as a result of the outbreak, said legal experts. The case is Pacific Collective LLC V Exxon Mobil, Los Angeles County Superior Court, No. 20-STCV-13294."
-2.244498367902642," ExxonMobil tests new technologies to slash methane emissions (Reuters) - Oil major Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it is conducting field trials of eight methane detection technologies, including satellite monitoring, to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. The company said the pilot project is being carried out at nearly 1,000 sites in Texas and New Mexico using drones, planes, helicopters, ground-based mobile and fixed-position sensors. “We are applying scientific rigor and taking aggressive steps to find commercially scalable and affordable solutions for all operators,” said Staale Gjervik, senior vice president at ExxonMobil Upstream Oil and Gas Co. All technologies and deployment methods will be used to detect leaks and identify solutions that can be shared with other oil and gas operators, the company added. Last month, several oil and gas companies and trade associations in Texas, the biggest oil producing state in the United States, formed a coalition to develop and recommend solutions to minimize flaring and methane emissions. Exxon Mobil had also called for tighter regulation of methane and offered up its own in-house rules as a model for companies and lawmakers worldwide. The company laid out the guidelines it follows - some of which have been rolled back by the Trump administration - at a time when the industry faces growing pressure from investors to reduce its environmental footprint."
-2.244498367902642," Exxon used economic uncertainty to push for Paulsboro, N.J., contract: sources HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N used economic uncertainty tied to the coronavirus pandemic to urge workers at its lubricants and packaging plant in Paulsboro, New Jersey, to vote for a proposed contract, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Workers at the plant on Wednesday rejected the contract in a 62-11 vote, however, said the two sources. The workers are represented by the Independent Oil Workers union (IOW) in Paulsboro. Officials at the IOW office did not reply to a phone message. The sources said the proposal would have put Exxon, not the union, in charge of choosing safety officers and overturned gains won by the union in past arbitration with the company. “They used our fears to try to decimate this contract,” one of the sources said. Exxon Mobil spokesman Todd Spitler said the claims were not justified. “We reject these unwarranted claims,” Spitler said. “One only has to look at current market conditions to realize that this is simply not true.” Spitler said Exxon’s goal is to continue to negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement with the IOW. “Exxon Mobil’s primary focus remains the safety and health of our workforce and to do our part to manage the impact of the novel coronavirus in the community,” he said. An official with the United Steelworkers union (USW) at Exxon’s Baytown, Texas, refinery said last Friday that the company was using economic uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus pandemic to push workers to accept a new contract. Like most employees in petrochemical manufacturing, workers at the Paulsboro plant cannot do their jobs from home and must work in shared production areas.

0.288389946834721," Exxon Mobil opposes Texas production cuts: letter (Reuters) - The largest U.S. oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp on Wednesday said it opposes Texas energy regulators mandating any oil production cuts in the face of plunging energy prices. Exxon is the latest large oil company to oppose the idea of curtailing oil output, calling the free market “the most efficient means of sorting out the extreme supply and demand imbalances we are now experiencing,” in a letter from Staale Gjervik, president of Exxon’s shale division to state regulators. Chevron Corp and Occidental Petroleum have also opposed a coordinated pullback in Texas oil production. U.S. energy companies are losing money on oil production, cutting tens of thousands of workers, and some are struggling to obtain financing. Texas producers have been hurt as oil prices have crashed two-thirds this year. Last month alone, prices fell by half, to near $20 a barrel, as the coronavirus slashed fuel demand. The state’s Railroad Commission, which has the authority to mandate production curbs in the state, will consider next week a proposal to require larger oil producers to cut output by 20% beginning May 1. The proposal was submitted by shale producers Parsley Energy Inc and Pioneer Natural Resources Co, and backed by Commissioner Ryan Sitton, who has said the idea should be considered as a way to curb a free fall in crude oil prices, stabilize the industry and prevent smaller firms from being locked out of storage and the sales by the largest oil companies. The state’s two other commissioners took to Twitter last week to distance themselves from Sitton, saying they had not yet made up their minds. Passage requires two of three to agree on curbs, which would be the first by the state in nearly 50 years. Over the past few years, Texas regulators championed the state’s soaring oil and gas output as Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut production to bolster global prices. State law allows Texas to take steps to limit local production, but it has not done so since the 1970s. “Proposals to impose quotas or mandatory production cuts will lead to unintended consequences for the state to the benefit of competing states in the U.S. and countries abroad,” Gjervik said."
0.288389946834721," Exxon Mobil opposes Texas production cuts - letter April 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil producer, on Wednesday said it opposes Texas energy regulators’ mandating any oil production cuts in the face of plunging energy prices. Exxon called the free market “the most efficient means of sorting out the extreme supply and demand imbalances we are now experiencing,” in a letter from Staale Gjervik, president of Exxon’s shale division, to state regulators. The state’s Railroad Commission, which has the authority to mandate production curbs in the state, will consider next week a proposal to require larger oil producers to cut output by 20% beginning May 1. The proposal was submitted by shale producers Parsley Energy Inc and Pioneer Natural Resources Co, and backed by Commissioner Ryan Sitton, who has said the idea should be considered as a way to curb a free fall in crude oil prices and stabilize the industry. The state’s two other commissioners took to Twitter last week to distance themselves from Sitton, saying they had not yet made up their minds. Passage requires two of three to agree on curbs, which would be the first by the state in nearly 50 years."
6.882610287618493," Exxon could delay third Guyana project as government review drags on (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Tuesday that production at the Payara project, its third development in Guyana, could be postponed due to delays in government approvals as the company scales back spending elsewhere due to the crude price crash. Payara’s startup had been slated for “as early as 2023” and was expected to eventually produce some 220,000 barrels per day of crude, according to Exxon’s website. The firm and its partners Hess Corp HES.N and China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the South American country, which has no history of production. The Exxon-led consortium in January produced some 56,320 bpd of crude at Phase 1 of its Liza project. Phase 2 of the same venture, at the prolific Stabroek block, is the next project expected to bring production online. The company said on Tuesday current operations at Liza were unaffected by a 30% cut in planned capital spending this year as the coronavirus pandemic saps energy demand and oil prices. Startup of the second phase of Liza also remains on track for 2022. But at neighboring Payara, where Exxon and partners are still awaiting approval from the government to send a third vessel needed to start offshore production, some activities planned for this year are being deferred, Exxon said, potentially delaying its startup by 6-12 months. Guyana is an integral part of Exxon’s growth plans, Chief Executive Darren Woods said. The company’s shares were up 3.9% at $42.06 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as investors cheered the spending cuts. Guyana’s Director of Energy Mark Bynoe said on Tuesday the government’s evaluation of Exxon’s Payara field development plan “is continuing, but has been impacted by factors outside the control of the Department of Energy,” referring to Guyana’s inconclusive March 2 election. Worldwide oil demand has dropped by as much as 30% in recent weeks, coinciding with an oversupply of Middle Eastern crude, sending prices to multi-decade lows. That has put projects to develop up to 16 billion barrels of oil in Latin America at risk of cancellation or delay, consultancy IHS Markit said this week in a report. That includes some of Guyana’s offshore projects, as their breakeven prices are estimated between $20 and $30 per barrel."
6.882610287618493," Exxon lops 30% off 2020 spending, deeper and later than rivals HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Tuesday throttled back investment in shale, natural gas and deep water production, cutting planned capital spending by 30% this year as the coronavirus pandemic saps energy demand and oil prices tumble. Oil companies have pulled back 2020 spending plans by an average of 22% as countries limit air travel, order businesses closed and tell residents to stay home to combat the pandemic that has killed more than 76,000 worldwide. In a one-two punch, crude prices have sunk nearly 60% this year on lower demand for fuel spurred by the pandemic-driven economic hit and an oil price war. “We haven’t seen anything like what we’re experiencing today,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on Tuesday as he detailed spending cuts on a conference call. Exxon was the last of the oil majors to move, and its spending cut was deeper than those of most rivals. The largest U.S. oil producer set 2020 capital expenditure at $23 billion, down $10 billion from its earlier plan and the lowest in four years. Spending could drop even further and continue into next year if required, Woods said. For a graphic on the top oil producers' spending cuts, please click here: reut.rs/39u1Dh3. Graphic - Oil Majors Cut Capex: The company took no action on its shareholder dividend, which analysts had been closely watching for any reduction. Exxon spent $14.8 billion last year on shareholder payouts. “We view these moves favorably as it helps reduce its cash flow shortfall and supports the dividend,” said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland. Exxon’s cuts will weigh the heaviest on U.S. shale, where it had plunked down $6 billion in 2017 for drilling leases and boosted output in a drive to pump around 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year. Its output there this year will be around 15,000 bpd lower than planned and up to 150,000 bpd lower next year, Woods said. Exxon did not detail its Permian spending cuts, where it recently had 58 drilling rigs at work. RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria estimated it was spending up to $6 billion a year in the Permian, “and we see no reason why capex and the rig count cannot be reduced by 50% at a minimum in 2020.” Exxon expects world oil demand to tumble by 25% to 30% in the short term, Woods said. “Storage is becoming very tight. Logistics are becoming tight,” Woods said, forecasting widespread oil-well “shut-ins across the industry.” It delayed an investment decision to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique and some spending in offshore Guyana, where it has made one of the world’s largest oil discoveries in years. Current operations in Guyana are not affected, it said. First-quarter results, due out May 1, will be hurt by an earnings drop of about $1.4 billion in oil and gas, and about $800 million in refining, both compared with the fourth quarter, the company said. Chemical earnings will swing to a profit of about $100 million, according to figures released on Tuesday. Exxon had set an ambitious growth plan two years ago to revive earnings and output, and Woods reiterated the company’s belief that global demand for oil would grow. “Populations and energy demand will continue to grow,” he said. “The economy will rebound despite the shocks from the pandemic.” Exxon’s 30% cut in spending exceeds that of oil majors’ BP PLC, Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Aramco, which have made 20%-25% reductions. BP and Chevron also cut deeply into their shale oil businesses. The nine major oil companies have slashed a combined $38 billion, or 22%, from their initial 2020 spending plans for $175 billion. Overall, oil companies have cut $54 billion in planned project investments. The U.S. oil major’s shares surged nearly 5% to $42.44 in late morning trading. Exxon’s market value has slumped 42% this year as the oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has taken a toll on the energy sector. However, its stock has been a laggard for years, dropping 54% over the last five years compared with an 18% gain in the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index."

15.406010781145607," Exxon plays on virus worries in Baytown contract talks: union official HOUSTON (Reuters) - A union official accused Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday of using “scare” tactics and exploiting economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic in negotiations with workers at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, allegations the company denied. Exxon has begun meeting with small groups of union-represented employees after rejecting two contract extension proposals from the union, said Ricky Brooks, president of United Steelworkers union local 13-2001, which represents hourly workers at Baytown. “They’ve begun in-house scare and misinformation meetings, leveraging the uncertainty of COVID-19 to get all of their issues and force the union to forego all of its issues,” Brooks said. “They have held the pattern wages hostage if the union moves to go to the table.” Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the company’s focus was on the safety of its workforce. “While our goal is to continue to negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement, Exxon Mobil’s primary focus remains the safety and health of our workforce and to do our part to manage the impact of the novel coronavirus in the community,” Spitler said. “We reject these unwarranted claims. One only has to look at current market conditions to realize that this is simply not true.” Plummeting demand for oil due to the pandemic, coupled with a flood of supply resulting from a Saudi-Russia price war, led U.S. oil futures prices to crash 54% in March. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Pattern wages refers to the national pattern agreement reached in January 2019 between the USW International and U.S. refiners that sets wage increases for all USW-represented workers. Under the proposal rejected in January, pay was set to go up 3.5% in the first year and 4% in the second year. In the third year, the increase would match the pay hike in the new national agreement the USW will negotiate for oil industry workers with energy companies in January 2022. Brooks said the company has suggested the pay proposals would be less if the two sides go back to the bargaining table. Negotiations for a new contract to replace the current pact that expires on May 15 began in December with a company-proposed three-year extension that was rejected in January by workers in the 560,500 barrel-per-day refinery and the complex’s laboratory. Chemical plant workers accepted the extension. The sticking point for refinery and lab workers is Exxon’s proposal to lengthen by six months the time before a new workers’ wages reach the same level as veteran workers. Even though the current contract expires on May 15, the refinery and lab workers could not walk off their jobs for 60 days nor could Exxon lock them out under an agreement between the company and the union."

11.224452730281396," UPDATE 2-Oil price fall has had no impact on Guyana output -Exxon (Adds estimate of Guyana lifting costs, analyst comment) GEORGETOWN, April 2 (Reuters) - The recent plunge in crude oil prices has had no impact on production at Guyana’s flagship Liza project, operated by Exxon Mobil Corp, but the company plans to make adjustments as necessary, a spokeswoman said. A price war between the world’s oil powerhouses and fast-declining crude demand have left many producers in Latin America struggling to cover production costs, boosting the chances of output cuts. Production at the offshore Liza well, which Exxon and partners Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC brought online in December, is expected to reach some 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) in its first phase. “We are managing production rates to ensure safe and responsible operations,” Janelle Persaud, Exxon’s public and government affairs adviser in Guyana, said in a statement. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make adjustments as necessary.” Exxon would have to engage with the Guyanese government before making any adjustments to its operations, the country’s director of energy, Mark Bynoe, told Reuters. Crude prices climbed on Thursday, with Brent futures approaching $30 a barrel after U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce a major oil production cut. Projected lifting costs for Liza partners will be just over $10 per barrel of oil for the full year, said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director of research at Houston-based consultancy Welligence. “I can’t see them shutting down production,” Montgomery said. “It is complex and costly to shut down production and you don’t want to mess around with the reservoir in that way. They’re designed for continual production.” Bynoe said he remained hopeful the government will be able to find a marketing agent to sell its share of Liza crude, despite delays in the search process caused by political turmoil after a disputed presidential election and the coronavirus outbreak. Guyana’s government several months ago awarded a contract to Royal Dutch Shell to sell its first three cargoes of oil produced at Liza, or about 3 million barrels in total. Shell has so far exported one of the three cargoes, according to Bynoe. The next lift allocated to the government and sold to the Anglo-Dutch firm, is scheduled for May, he said.

To balance the shutdown of the 90,000-bpd PSLA-7 CDU, Exxon plans to boost production on the 210,000-bpd PSLA-10 CDU, the largest at the refinery, sources said. Overall refinery production will be about 420,000 bpd. Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry declined to discuss the level of production at the Baton Rouge refinery. However, he said the refinery was still operational and meeting contractual commitments. Exxon cut the production at the refinery by 62,500 bpd on March 21 because of demand destruction as Americans stay at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. After shutting PSLA-7 and boosting throughput on PSLA-10, production at the refinery will be down an additional 20,000 bpd, sources added. There are two 90,000 bpd CDUs at the refinery. The 90,000-bpd PSLA-8 CDU remains operational as does the 110,000 bpd PSLA-9, according to the sources. At the Baton Rouge refinery, the restart of 78,000-bpd catalytic reformer continued on Monday, the sources said. The unit had been shut since a Feb. 12 fire idled the entire refinery. CDUs do the primary breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks for all other production units at the refinery. There are four CDUs at the Baton Rouge refinery.

The General Commander of Mozambique’s police, Bernardino Rafael, said the insurgents attacked Mocimboa da Praia and its army barracks before dawn on Monday, wounding dozens of people. Mocimboa da Praia is about 350 km (220 miles) by road from the city of Pemba in Mozambique’s northernmost province of Cabo Delgado and is just south of the Afungi peninsula, where gas projects worth $60 billion are located. The town is strategically important to the projects. Until recently it was the main airport for workers travelling to the site, before a landing strip was built at Afungi itself, and its port is also used for some cargo deliveries for the projects. “Mocimboa da Praia is currently an active combat zone,” Rafael told reporters at the police headquarters in Maputo. The army was doing all it could to restore security, he said warning people to stay away. Security analysts said parts of the town, including the army barracks, were reportedly occupied by the attackers. The insurgents started staging attacks in Cabo Delgado in 2017, threatening security in a nation set to become a global gas exporter following one of the biggest gas finds in a decade offshore Cabo Delgado. Little is known about the insurgents, though initial attacks were claimed by a group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama. More recently, Islamic State has claimed a number of attacks. More than 900 people have been reported killed in the province since 2017, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, an NGO. The frequency of attacks has been increasing, leaving some analysts concerned that the insurgency could be a growing threat and that it could cause disrupt the gas boom. Alexandre Raymakers, Senior Africa Analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said the attack highlighted serious gaps in security and raised questions about Mozambique’s ability to defend the developments. While Raymakers said the LNG infrastructure and personnel will remain “aspirational targets” for now, the insurgents will likely be emboldened by their successes and seek to increase the tempo of their operations. Total said it was aware of the developing situation in Mocimboa do Praia, but the Afungi site remained secure and all of members of its team accounted for. Both Exxon and Total said the safety of their employees was a priority and they were monitoring developments and working with the relevant authorities on security. Reuters reported in January that the oil companies had requested more government troops be bought in to protect the site amid a rise in the number of attacks."

43.162868627535836," Exclusive: Coronavirus, gas slump put brakes on Exxon's giant Mozambique LNG plan JOHANNESBURG/MILAN (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is likely to delay the greenlighting of its $30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique as the coronavirus disrupts early works and a depressed gas market makes investors wary, six sources told Reuters. Top U.S. oil and gas company Exxon said on Tuesday it was evaluating “significant” cuts to capital spending and operating expenses. Energy firms worldwide have slashed spending this month as oil prices plummeted to 18-year lows after global travel curbs and reduced economic activity destroyed demand. The coronavirus pandemic is forcing delays to projects worldwide. Qatar, the world’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is delaying a big expansion in which Exxon is a major partner. The Rovuma LNG project, which will produce from a deepwater block off Mozambique containing more than 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, was expected to get the go-ahead in the first half of 2020. But three sources familiar with the project told Reuters that Exxon’s partners want to push back a final investment decision (FID). A further three sources said the pandemic is disrupting work on the project to such a degree that FID before the second half is unlikely. Any delay would leave Exxon’s project further behind rival Total, which took FID last June on its neighboring project. Exxon might be left with no choice. “COVID-19 is affecting guys going into Mozambique, it’s affecting Chinese and Korean financiers, and clearly you’ve had the arse drop out of the oil market,” said a source with knowledge of the project. The pandemic is causing delays to the financing needed for the project, the source added. Rovuma LNG is managed by Mozambique Rovuma Venture, a joint venture owned 35.7% each by Exxon and Eni with the remaining stake of 28.6% held by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). LNG prices hit a record low of $2.7 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last month, and Rovuma requires an average price of $7 per mmBtu throughout its life to be profitable, according to Bernstein analysts. Another source with knowledge of internal discussions said with the energy outlook uncertain and LNG supplies set to rise sharply by 2025, some of the project partners want to “cool Exxon’s heels” and delay. Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler declined to discuss whether partners are seeking to push back the FID. “This is a complex project that will be developed over several years,” he said. China’s CNPC did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment and Eni declined to comment. Mozambique’s state oil firm ENH, Galp Energia and KOGAS, which each have 10% stakes in the project, either did not provide a comment or referred Reuters to Exxon. Exxon has already committed to $500 million in initial investment, and FID is the next stage in funding based on which banks can extend lines of credit. But early works are being disrupted by coronavirus travel restrictions. International workers travel regularly to the project site on the Afungi peninsula in Cabo Delgado province, where they live cheek-by-jowl and share a canteen for six- or eight-week stints. Many hail from countries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus and have put in place travel restrictions. Mozambique has imposed a 14-day quarantine for those entering the country. That has left key personnel unable to reach the site. “It seems as though they are electing to postpone some of the early stage works and contracts for now,” another source familiar with the matter said. “I doubt we can expect their FID before the end of 2020.” Exxon’s Spitler said employees’ health and safety was a priority and declined to comment on the day-to-day details of its operations."

The 4.05 trillion British thermal unit (TBtu) cargo is for loading on April 25, they added. Details of the buyer could not immediately be confirmed and companies typically do not comment on spot trades. The cargo sold by the Papua New Guinea plant is a jump of almost 40 cents per mmBtu, or about 11%, from a deal concluded in Singapore on Tuesday, traders said. Commodities trader Vitol sold a 3.3-3.5 TBtu cargo to Diamond Gas International at $3.60 per mmBtu on Tuesday during price agency S&P Global Platt’s pricing process known as market-on-close, according to Platts data. Bigger cargoes typically command a premium, trade sources said, indicating the latest deal does not necessarily reflect a big jump in prices. But overall demand from China, the world’s second-largest LNG importer, is improving, which could stoke spot prices, traders said."
44.41348844593564," Exxon pays more to borrow amid market turmoil (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N paid a big premium to raise $8.5 billion in new debt on Tuesday, as a rout in energy prices and stock market jitters fueled by the coronavirus outbreak eroded investor confidence in the largest U.S. oil producer. Exxon was among nine major companies that took advantage of a window opening in the U.S. credit markets on Tuesday to issue bonds, after the Federal Reserve announced new measures to boost liquidity in the financial system, including the purchase of short-term corporate debt. Exxon, which is rated Aaa/AA by credit rating agencies, issued its debt at a 60 basis point premium to PepsiCo Inc PEP.O, which has a lower investment-grade rating of A1/A+. “Exxon had to pay a huge premium to where the bonds should have been, because they are in an industry that is viewed very negatively right now,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. Saudi Arabia is locked in an oil price war with Russia following the collapse earlier this month of an output deal between OPEC and its allies that has wiped 30% off energy prices. Compounding Exxon’s woes is the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 196,000 people around the world and killed more than 7,800, and caused severe business and travel disruptions across the globe, fueling fears of an economic downturn. On Monday, Exxon said it would make “significant” cuts to spending in the face of the unprecedented slide. The company just two weeks ago had pledged to “lean in” to the market drop and maintain outlays in a belief oil demand would rise in the long run. Despite the higher cost of the new debt, Exxon will be relieved to have been able to raise the funds, according to Bill Zox, chief investment officer of fixed income at Diamond Hill Capital Management “In an environment like this, it’s all about access to capital, not cost of capital,” Zox said. Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s debt pile totaled $46.9 billion as of the end of December. A host of investment-grade companies had been deliberating on a day-by-day basis when to issue bonds and were waiting for supportive markets. After days of no or limited issuance, the nine companies, which also included U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Progressive CorpPGR.N, took advantage of improved investor sentiment to raise a combined $25 billion, according to Refinitiv IFR data."

29.133729671429375," Exxon pledges 'significant' spending cuts amid coronavirus, oil slide HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N on Monday said it will make ""significant"" cuts to spending in the face of the unprecedented slide in oil prices due to the global coronavirus outbreak, which sent its shares to a 17-year low. It was a stunning reversal for the largest U.S. oil producer, which two weeks ago pledged to “lean in” to the market drop and maintain outlays in a belief oil demand would rise in the long run. Other major oil companies have slashed costs amid falling demand and newly unbridled output by top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia. U.S. shale firms have outlined plans to cut expenses by 25% to 30% to cope with this year’s massive drop in oil prices and demand. U.S. crude futures on Monday settled under $29 a barrel, down from $61 at the start of the year. The decline has cut new drilling and led producers to seek price cuts from suppliers. Weaker demand and rising supply could lead to a 6 million barrel per day surplus by April, further pressuring prices. Exxon shares fell on Monday to $34.49, a level last touched in 2003, and sent its dividend yield to a record 10.1%. The stock gained $1 in late trading on the expense cuts. “We are evaluating all appropriate steps to significantly reduce capital and operating expenses in the near term,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement. “We remain focused on being a safe, low-cost operator and creating long-term value for shareholders.” His statement did not address whether cuts would affect Exxon’s shareholder dividend, which consumed $14.65 billion last year. A spokesman declined to comment on any change to the payout. The company earlier budgeted between $30 billion and $33 billion for projects this year, sharply up from the $23 billion it spent in 2017, Woods’ first year as CEO. Exxon could cut 10% to 12% from its outlays and reduce this year’s capital spending to between $28 billion and $29 billion, said Matt Murphy, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. “Protecting the balance sheet and dividend is the priority for this company,” said Murphy, who assigned a low probability to a dividend cut. Exxon could quickly lower spending in U.S. shale, where it plunked down $6 billion in 2017 for drilling leases in the Permian Basin and where it has run 58 drilling rigs, analysts said. It aimed to pump 1 million barrels a day from the field by 2024. The company also is spending billions of dollars on oil exploration and production off the coast of Guyana, on liquefied natural gas production, and to boost chemicals output along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Exxon has asked non-essential employees at several locations to work from home to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus among its offices and refineries. The world's largest publicly traded oil company, Saudi Aramco, last week outlined plans to cut spending by $2.8 billion to $7.8 billion. BP BP.L and Chevron CVX.N also promised unspecified expense cuts."

18.940506397882114," From Exxon to Royal Caribbean Cruises, U.S. companies rush to hoard cash NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America is gearing up for leaner times. From Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N, companies rushed to borrow more money and boost their cash coffers on Tuesday, as the market turmoil fueled by a plunge in oil prices and the global coronavirus outbreak raised the prospect of an economic downturn. “It’s companies loading up on cash when you can get it. They are effectively building up that war chest,” said Jeremy Swan, managing principal at accounting and tax advisory firm CohnReznick LLP. Royal Caribbean said on Tuesday it increased its credit capacity by $550 million to boost liquidity. The company’s stock plunged this month, amid concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would curtail travel. “These are extraordinary times and we are taking these steps to manage the company prudently and conservatively,” Royal Caribbean Cruises Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Fain said in a statement. Exxon, which has one of the corporate world's strongest balance sheets, filed paperwork on Tuesday for an unspecified board offering for what it called general corporate purposes, as the oil major grapples with the collapse in Brent crude LCOc1 prices. Oreo maker Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O on Monday announced a $2.5 billion credit facility, in addition to a similar agreement worth $1.5 billion agreed less than two weeks ago. United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O also said on Tuesday it had raised an extra $2 billion in financing while slashing its 2020 capital expenditures by more than a third. “We also believe we have good options to raise additional liquidity in the weeks to come, if needed,” United President Scott Kirby said. Other companies which chose not to raise new funds yet touted their financial strength to calm investors. In an investor presentation on Tuesday, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O flagged more than $7.3 billion in cash and unused bank lending in reserve. “American Airlines has more liquidity than any other airline in the world, which is exactly where we want to be in an environment like this and exactly why indeed we’ve held so much for so long,” American Airlines Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said at a conference on Tuesday. Debt-laden companies in service sectors hit by reduced tourism and discretionary spending, such as airlines, cruise lines, movie theaters, gaming companies and hotel chains, are particularly vulnerable, according to Fitch Ratings. “What we’ve seen in this market is that stability today isn’t necessarily stability tomorrow,” Swan said."

7.980815634526609," U.S. oil boom vs Europe's renewables focus? Big Oil's gap widens -- in words NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon and Chevron boasted to investors this week about booming U.S. oil production, illustrating how the gap has widened - at least in words - between top American oil and gas companies and their European rivals over efforts to transition to clean energy and fight climate change. World crude oil and natural gas production is running at an all-time high, bolstered by big increases in recent years in the United States, Brazil and other nations. At the same time, a growing climate movement is pressuring governments and corporations to lower emissions as the world warms. U.S.-based Exxon Mobil and Chevron this week focused their investor outlooks on sharp growth in oil and gas output, a stark contrast from their European rivals including BP and Italy’s Eni which last month unveiled plans to trim their traditional business and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But as of yet, no European major invests above 10% of its total spending on renewable energy. All the world’s oil majors still plan investments in new fossil fuel production, underpinned by forecasts for years of rising demand for oil and gas. “These companies all have very similar business models,” said Ben Ratner of the Environmental Defense Fund. “The differences we’re seeing now are largely about what they’re saying.” The industry faces mounting pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Publicly, the European companies have been more vocal about their plans to cut carbon emissions. BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Norway’s Equinor and Spain’s Repsol have all agreed to reshape themselves by increasing spending on renewable energy and setting varying ambitions to reduce carbon emissions. “We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society’s expectations from us,” BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said in his a speech on Feb. 12, one week after taking office, where he presented a vision to “re-invent” BP by slashing carbon emissions and lowering oil and gas output by 2050. Italy’s Eni last week pledged to reduce its oil production from 2025 and slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% and in one of the sector’s most ambitious clean-up drives. But Exxon CEO Darren Woods, when asked about setting targets for carbon emissions on Thursday, said the company was focused on reducing emissions and would not engage in a “beauty match” with its peers over how its investments appear when looking at a broader societal problem. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth appeared to question the Europeans’ strategy. “Whether or not there’s a pathway to some of these long-term aspirations remains a question,” Wirth said this week. Wirth returned to those remarks at an annual investor conference on Tuesday in New York, noting that while European companies have greater long-term aspirations, Chevron has released a set of shorter term emissions targets that “are very tangible here and now.” Before 2025, Eni’s oil and gas output is also set to rise by 3.5% per year. And BP vowed to stick to its financial plans in the short term. (Graphic: Going green? png - ) Chevron and No. 1 oil company Exxon this week laid out plans to sharply grow output in shale oil basins and around the world. Chevron vowed to return to shareholders $80 billion by 2025. Exxon plans on increasing spending this year to $33 billion, sticking to plans to “lean in” on capital expenditures. “The fact remains that Exxon still provides investors no assurance that it has a strategy consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and continues to lag behind its peers,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners for England, who co-leads climate talks with Exxon. Chevron is not pursuing renewables as a standalone business, but sees investments in wind and solar that can provide power to its oil field operations. It set short-term climate targets, saying it would drop greenhouse gas and emissions intensity by 2023. (Graphic: Oil Majors' Carbon emissions png - )"
7.980815634526609," Exxon to push ahead with spending plans despite investor concerns NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two years into an ambitious growth plan to revive earnings at the largest U.S. oil company, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Thursday it would stick to its plans to ""lean in"" to spending even as its shares have lagged those of competitors, which are cutting costs. Oil prices have fallen more than 20% this year, natural gas is at its lowest price since the 1990s and the industry’s long-term outlook is clouded by a push toward cleaner fuels. The entire oil industry has fallen out of favor with investors, but Exxon, once the industry’s cash flow and profit leader, has tumbled particularly hard. The company is “mindful of the current market environment,” but will stay with its strategy of “leaning in to this market when others have pulled back,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said at the company’s annual investor day meeting. He first laid out plans to improve profit through investment in 2018, and Thursday’s message did not diverge from that. The industry faces a drop in demand for its products this year as the coronavirus spreads globally, but “the longer term horizon is more clear,” Woods said, arguing that improving living standards mean the world will need more oil. But Exxon's total share return is minus 26% over the last five years, far behind the other global oil majors, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, while the broader S&P 500 Index .SPX has returned 49%. The company plans to spend between $30 billion and $35 billion a year through 2025. Spending will rise from $31 billion last year to about $33 billion this year, though Woods said that number could dip if the company needs to adjust for market conditions or if costs come in lower. Exxon is “playing the long game,” said Anish Kapadia of Palissy Advisors, hoping that its peers’ underinvestment means commodity prices will rise and it will profit. “However, this is not a strategy that investors are going to buy in to today as they are more focused on where commodity prices are at currently,” Kapadia said, adding, “There is a fear in the market that global demand for hydrocarbons will stagnate or fall” given investor focus on climate. Investors, including the world’s top asset manager BlackRock, have warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change. Exxon is “pursuing a strategy that is destructive of both shareholder value and the planet,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England who co-leads climate talks with Exxon and attended Thursday’s meeting. Some European oil companies have set ambitious climate goals, but Woods said Exxon was focused on reducing its own emissions and would not engage in a “beauty match” with its peers. Exxon is likely “in for another tough year,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Europe Limited. With weak oil and gas prices and muted refining margins, Exxon will “barely” cover its capital spending with free cash flow and its dividend coverage will be “the worst” among the major oil companies, he said. Its growth plans include a big bet on U.S. shale, where output has surged, making the United States the world’s largest oil producer, and on Guyana, where an Exxon-led consortium has made one of the biggest discoveries in years. In the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, Exxon has been expanding production rapidly and expects to produce around 360,000 barrels per day this year. It slightly slowed its aggressive pace, the first such move by an oil major in the field as smaller companies slash budgets and lay down equipment. Exxon has 58 drilling rigs at work now, but said it will drop that number by 20% this year as it picks up drilling speed. It is racing its closest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp CVX.N, to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day there, and Exxon said it still will surpass that target by 2024. On Tuesday, Chevron said it had up to $80 billion in its war chest that it could use for shareholder returns over the next five years, regardless of oil prices."

The pipeline supplied natural gas to the refinery’s four CDUs. Also beginning to restart on Friday is a 39,000 bpd reformer, the sources said. An Exxon spokesman was not immediately available to discuss operations at the Baton Rouge refinery. After PSLA-10 restarts, Exxon plans to start-up a 110,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU), a 45,000-bpd coker, an 18,750-bpd alkylation unit, a light-ends unit and a sulfur recovery unit, according to the sources. After PSLA-10 restarts and as early as this weekend, Exxon plans to restart the second-largest CDU, the 110,000 bpd PSLA-9, the sources said. Early next week, Exxon plans to restart a 40,000 bpd hydrotreater, the sources said. Later next week, the company plans to complete restarting the 90,000 bpd PSLA-7 CDU and its twin, the 90,000 bpd PSLA-8 as well as a 27,500 bpd coker, according to the sources."
-11.714456261532773," Guyana government launches search for company to market its crude (Reuters) - Guyana’s government on Wednesday launched a search for a company to market its share of crude produced at the offshore Liza well, where an Exxon Mobil Corp-led consortium began producing oil in December. The government is entitled to a share of the oil produced, and has said it was seeking a marketing agent to help it export the crude. In a statement on its website, Guyana’s Department of Energy said companies wishing to participate should submit an expression of interest by March 12. The discovery of oil in the Stabroek block, which is expected to produce some 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude by 2025, is set to transform the economy of Guyana, a poor South American country with no history of oil production. Most of the crude will be lifted by Exxon and its partners, Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd , with the Guyanese government taking the rest. But without any domestic refining capacity or a national oil company, it must sell the crude on the open market. The government has already tapped Royal Dutch Shell to lift its first three cargoes. The current search is for a longer-term deal for a marketing agent, which Energy Director Mark Bynoe has said could be a commodities trading firm or an international energy company. According to the statement, the marketing agent would be expected to lift five cargoes of around 1 million barrels each per year, and the duration of the contract would be 12 months. The firm must have at least five years of experience in oil marketing and trading. The launch of the search comes ahead of a March 2 presidential election in Guyana. The opposition People’s Progressive Party has pledged to review oil contracts signed under President David Granger’s government should it win the vote. The Energy Department said it would accept questions from interested parties and post its responses on its website by March 7. It said it would not accept any face-to-face meetings with companies considering a bid."
-13.652839260766179," Oil Search works to revive Exxon, Papua New Guinea talks on LNG expansion MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Oil Search Ltd is pressing to revive talks between Exxon Mobil Corp and the Papua New Guinea government over a $13 billion plan to double the country’s natural gas exports, the company’s new boss said on Tuesday. Oil Search’s new Chief Executive Officer Keiran Wulff said he hoped negotiations could resume “within weeks” between its partner Exxon and the state. The government ditched talks in January with Exxon on terms for developing the P’nyang gas field to feed an expansion of Exxon’s PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, amid a push to reap more benefits from resources projects for the impoverished South Pacific nation. Oil Search’s veteran boss Peter Botten, who just retired as CEO but is still working for the company, is sounding out the government this week on what it would need to resume talks, Wulff said. “We would hope to see some sort of formal negotiations recommence between Exxon and the state negotiating team within a reasonable period of time,” Wulff told Reuters in an interview after the company released earnings earlier on Tuesday. “We’re hopeful that it’s weeks. We don’t think it’ll be months,” he said. Oil Search reported an 8% fall in annual net profit to $312.4 million, hit by weaker oil and LNG prices, missing analysts’ forecasts of around $339 million, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates. Oil Search’s growth prospects are largely tied to a combined plan to develop P’nyang and Papua LNG, led by France’s Total SA, to feed three new processing units, called trains, at Exxon’s PNG LNG plant. All the partners want a three-train development, Oil Search said, as sharing infrastructure would be the most efficient way to develop P’nyang and Papua LNG. “For us we’re strongly behind the operator to pursue a three-train development, which is as much in the joint venture’s interest as it is in the state’s,” Wulff said. He said they would only consider a two-train development without P’nyang “after all options were exhausted”. Exxon Mobil had no immediate comment, but Chief Executive Darren Woods said earlier this month the company hoped to revive talks on P’nyang to get to a “win-win proposition”. The coronavirus has dampened demand for LNG from China, but Oil Search said it expected that only to be a short term issue. “We are confident in our ability to secure LNG offtake agreements once we resume discussions with potential Asian buyers, due to the attractiveness of LNG from PNG,” Botten said in a statement. If an agreement is reached on P’nyang and early engineering work on a three-train development begins in 2020, Oil Search expects its capital spending this year will be in the range of $710 million to $845 million."

The 240,000 bpd PSLA 10 CDU and the 50,000 bpd coker were shut on Feb. 12 following a natural gas pipeline fire that idled most of the production units at the refinery, the sources said. Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said on Monday operations were continuing at the Baton Rouge refinery and adjoining chemical plant. He declined to discuss the status of individual units. PSLA 10 and the coker could restart as early as the middle of this week, if all goes as planned, the sources said. Three of the four CDUs at the refinery were shut by the fire. The pipeline that caught on fire supplies natural gas that fuels boilers on the units, the sources said. The CDUs do the primary breakdown of crude oil into the hydrocarbon feedstocks, from which motor fuels like gasoline and diesel and plastics are made in other production units at the refinery. Restarting PSLA 10 has been a top goal with for Exxon since the fire, the sources said. Restart efforts depend on restoring the natural gas feed to the unit. Returning the refinery to production is expected to take at least a month from the date of the fire, sources have said. The coker converts residual crude oil from distillation units into feedstock for motor fuels or petroleum coke, a coal substitute."
-22.813775196299474," UPDATE 1-Guyana produced 35,607 bpd of oil in December -finance ministry (Adds industry details, market background) GEORGETOWN, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Guyana produced 35,607 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in December, following inauguration of production in the country by a consortium led by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, the finance ministry said in a report. Exxon has discovered more than 8 billion barrels off the coast of Guyana, a poor South American country with no history of oil production. Output at the Stabroek block began on Dec. 20, and Exxon began exporting crude in January. The government chose to receive its 2% royalty from the oil output in cash. The ministry said the consortium - which also includes Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd - would pay the royalty later this year from its share of profit oil, a reference to the value of the crude the companies produce beyond cost recovery. Total production in December was 427,282 barrels, the ministry said in the report.

-22.813775196299474," UPDATE 1-Romania's Romgaz interested in 20% stake in Neptun Deep offshore gas project (Adds comment, details) BUCHAREST, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Romania’s Romgaz said it has agreed with OMV Petrom and Poland’s PGNiG to make a joint offer for Exxon Mobil’s 50% stake in a long-stalled offshore natural gas project in the Black Sea if the U.S. company decides to sell. State-owned Romgaz would then be interested in holding a 20% stake in the Neptun Deep project, Chief Executive Adrian Volintiru said. Exxon confirmed in January it was weighing an exit from the Neptun Deep project. The other half of the project is owned by Romania’s OMV Petrom, which is majority-controlled by Austria’s OMV. “We have the appetite to acquire 20% of Neptun Deep should Exxon decide to sell,” Volintiru told an energy seminar organised by financial daily Ziarul Financiar, and said Romgaz had signed a joint binding agreement with OMV Petrom and PGNiG to partner in buying Exxon’s stake. Romania’s economy minister said on Monday he was confident Romgaz would be part of a consortium to buy Exxon’s stake. Romgaz also holds a 12.2% stake in a separate offshore joint venture in the Black Sea led by Russia’s Lukoil. Several gas producers have spent a decade and billions of dollars preparing to tap Romania’s Black Sea gas, but they were blindsided by price caps, taxes and export restrictions pushed forward by a previous centre-left government. Romania’s current Liberal minority government is running the European Union country on an interim basis after it lost a no confidence vote earlier this month. Prior to the no confidence vote, it had begun undoing some of the legal and tax changes that had raised concerns with investors. Whereas Neptun Deep is still awaiting an investment decision pending legal changes, another Black Sea oil project, Black Sea Oil & Gas (BSOG), controlled by private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, has been almost finalised. It could start producing roughly 1 billion cubic metres of gas per year in 2021 with some delays, BSOG told the same seminar. “It’s vital to us that by the time we start producing first gas these things (tax and legal changes) will be resolved,” BSOG chief executive Mark Beacom told the conference. “We have two years to get this sorted.” Meanwhile, Romgaz’s Volintiru said the company was also hopeful about new onshore gas discoveries. In 2017, Romgaz announced its biggest find in three decades in the Caragele field, in the central Romanian county of Buzau, with an estimated 25-27 billion cubic metres of gas. “We have hopes that somewhere in Bucovina in eastern Romania there could be a very large field, comparable to Caragele, but we need to do some more digging to confirm,” Volintiru said.

Some units remain in operation at the refinery including a crude distillation unit (CDU), gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) and a coker, the sources said. A blaze on Wednesday cut output at Exxon’s 502,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. It was the third Exxon petrochemical plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast to suffer damage in less than a year. 2 No injuries were reported because of the fire that broke out from a natural gas pipeline shortly before midnight on Tuesday and burned for about seven hours on Wednesday, the sources said. The blaze affected pipes laid on racks 50 feet in the air, and forced the shutdown of multiple units at the oil refinery and adjoining chemical plant, the sources said. The fire forced the shutdown of three CDUs and an FCCU, but was confined to the pipe bundle where it broke out. Operations at the refinery and chemical plant continue, Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said on Thursday. He declined to discuss the status of individual processing units. Exxon was meeting contractual commitments and expected to meet all customer commitments, he said. The company and other refiners are suffering from weak margins due to excess supplies and falling demand for some fuels. Exxon U.S. refining profits fell 42% last year over 2018 due to weak margins and higher maintenance costs. CDUs are the heart of the refining process, providing the primary breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks that other production units convert into motor fuels and feedstocks for plastics. Traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange attributed a jump in gasoline futures since on Wednesday and Thursday to the combined impact of an FCCU outage last week at the Phillips 66 Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and the Baton Rouge fire. U.S. gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 0.18%, or 0.28 cents at $1.5838 per gallon on Thursday. On Wednesday, it rose 4.4%, or 6.68 cents. The blaze was the third major fire to hit Exxon’s U.S. operations since last March when a fire broke out in a Baytown, Texas, refinery unit. In July, a fire in Exxon’s Baytown Olefins plant injured 37 workers."

The tanker Cap Philippe, which is approaching Guyanese waters, is expected to load 1 million barrels of the light sweet crude. The cargo, along with another two to come, was sold by Guyana to Royal Dutch Shell RDSA.L in a December tender. The government of the South American nation, which late last year became an oil producer, is expected to receive at least five cargoes of crude produced by the Exxon-led consortium this year, or about 13,700 barrels per day (bpd), the Energy Department’s director, Mark Bynoe, said in a statement. Guyana plans to call oil firms to a competitive process later this month to select the ‘marketing agent’ that will be in charge of trading the government’s share of oil produced. The terms of the process have not yet been published. Exxon, U.S. Hess Corp HES.N and a unit of China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK on Dec. 20 inaugurated output at their massive 26,800-square kilometer Stabroek block. It has since then produced about 52,000 bpd, according to the government, and it is expected to reach 120,000 bpd by year end. Guyana’s first-ever crude export, entitled to Exxon, set sail in January bound for the U.S. Gulf Coast on tanker Yannis P. The oil was processed at the energy firm’s refining system. A second cargo also chartered by Exxon is underway to Panama. Bynoe said earlier this week that talks with the Exxon-led consortium were expected to be completed in the coming days to reach an agreement on pricing before the first cargo entitled to the government set sail."

The fire broke out in a natural gas pipeline supplying the units before midnight on Tuesday, the sources said. The fire was put out on Wednesday morning, the company said. No injuries were reported. Exxon had made preliminary plans to restart the Baton Rouge refinery’s large CDU, the 210,000 bpd PSLA-10, before the fire was extinguished, the sources said. The unit cannot be restarted until the natural gas supply is restored. Most of the refinery’s units, including the three CDUs, were shut early on Wednesday, the sources said. Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry declined on Wednesday to discuss the status of units at the refinery. He did say operations were continuing at the refinery and adjoining chemical plant. Eikenberry also said Exxon would continue to meet its contractual commitments.

-25.038171392607545," Ahead of Guyana presidential election, group revives debate over Exxon's deal GEORGETOWN, Feb. 3 (Reuters) - A report by a nonprofit watchdog group critical of Exxon Mobil Corp’s oil contract with Guyana has rekindled a debate over whether the deal is too generous to the company, just a month before a crucial presidential election. In a report here published Monday, London-based anti-corruption group Global Witness said the U.S. oil major's 40-year deal to produce crude in the offshore Stabroek block would deprive the government of up to $55 billion in revenue over the life of the contract, compared with deals in other countries. The discovery of more than 8 billion barrels of oil and gas offshore Guyana by an Exxon-led consortium, which includes Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC, will transform the economy of the poor South American country. With fewer than 800,000 inhabitants, the former British colony is seen as a test for whether oil revenue can spur sustainable development in a country lacking strong institutions. Global Witness’ finding could boost the opposition People’s Progressive Party’s (PPP) contention that President David Granger’s government was too generous in a 2016 contract re-negotiation with the consortium, which resulted in a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share for the state. The group had previously sent individuals named in the report summaries, and before publication Granger’s allies sought to limit damage ahead of the March 2 election, which will decide which party oversees the first five years of an oil boom. “You have to decide whether you are going to be fooled a couple of days before the elections by some set of jokers,” Foreign Secretary Carl Greenidge said last week at a rally in the eastern town of New Amsterdam for Granger’s APNU-AFC coalition, calling Global Witness a “very controversial NGO.” Global Witness said 52% of oil revenues would flow to state coffers in Guyana, below the 65%-85% range it said International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveys showed was “normal.” It said Guyana would receive $168 billion over the life of the deal, rather than the $223 billion it considered fair. A 2012 IMF paper here found government shares of oil revenues tended to fall in that range, and policies raising less ""may be cause for concern."" A 2019 IMF report here on Guyana said the country's macroeconomic outlook was ""very favorable"" and that oil revenues would improve infrastructure and development. The government and Exxon both argue favorable fiscal terms were needed to attract investment into an unproven oil play, but the PPP and Global Witness say the government had the upper hand during the 2016 re-negotiation given that Exxon made commercial discoveries in 2015. “The conclusions are misleading in that they compare Guyana deep water with mature hydrocarbon-producing provinces which naturally have evolved fiscal frameworks reflecting maturity and lower risk profiles,” Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said of the report. ‘WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE MONEYS’ To be sure, it is unlikely the election will spur changes to the Exxon deal, as the PPP has stopped short of saying it would renegotiate the contract terms. Hess Chief Executive John Hess said in an investor call last week that both parties were “pretty clear” they would honor the deal. But the PPP has pledged to improve “contract administration” by requiring Exxon hire more local firms, and promises to re-examine deals with other companies. Opposition leader Bharrat Jagdeo slammed Greenidge’s comments and said the government “sold out our interests.” “This is very worrying, that Carl Greenidge will go on an APNU platform in New Amsterdam and try to run down a global organization that tackles corruption, and they talk about clean government and honest government?” Jagdeo, a former president, told reporters last Thursday. Finance Minister Winston Jordan said Exxon’s discovery of oil before the renegotiation of the original agreement - signed during PPP leadership in 1999 - was not the only factor that should be taken into account. The country has a century-long border dispute with neighboring Venezuela, and in 2013 Venezuela’s navy seized a ship exploring for oil on behalf of U.S. oil company Anadarko. That incident added risk, Jordan said. Venezuela in late 2018 halted an Exxon ship conducting a seismic survey. “We can compare today, tomorrow, about what we got and what we didn’t get, but it seems we don’t want to compare objective conditions,” Jordan said in a late January interview. Global Witness said in its report it did not believe the Venezuela dispute “can be used to adequately justify the exploitative nature of Exxon’s Stabroek deal.” Guyana will receive $280 million-$300 million in oil revenues this year, Jordan said. By comparison, total government revenue in 2018 was just $1 billion. “More energy should be put into what do we do with the moneys,” he said. “That discussion has to take precedence.” (Reporting by Luc Cohen and Neil Marks in Georgetown Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston Editing by Leslie Adler)"

Irving, Texas-based Exxon’s results missed Wall Street’s recently lowered estimates, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion(4.27 billion pounds) from $6 billion a year ago as weak oil and gas prices, sliding refining and chemicals profit margins offset a sharp increase in oil and gas production. Exxon CEO Darren Woods described the margin weakness as “a short-term impact”. But Goldman said its decision to downgrade Exxon from “neutral” stemmed from “lack of free cashflow limiting capital returns, and risk to long-term return on capital employed (ROCE)targets”. Goldman said it saw “clear downside” to Exxon’s target of reaching 15% ROCE by 2025, with its own modelling now showing 8% ROCE due to lower downstream margins, lower crude oil prices and risks to execution of projects. Goldman lowered Exxon’s share price target from $72 to $59. Exxon shares closed at $62.1 on Friday. (Graphic: Exxon vs Shell 2019 - ) (Oil Majors' cashflow - )"
-25.038171392607545," Papua New Guinea LNG expansion plans in limbo after talks collapse MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Plans to double gas exports from Papua New Guinea within the next four years are in doubt after the government walked away from talks with Exxon Mobil Corp on a key gas project needed for the $13 billion expansion. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Friday called off negotiations with Exxon on the P’nyang field, blaming the energy giant for failing to budge on a proposed deal that was “out of the money”. The expansion of liquefied natural gas exports is crucial for the impoverished Pacific nation, but is vying with several proposed LNG projects in Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, Russia and the United States. One of Exxon’s partners in the PNG project, Oil Search Ltd, said on Monday the terms the government had sought would have made the project unprofitable. “Under the terms proposed by the State, the joint venture partners were unable to obtain a return on their investment that made the project investable and bankable,” Oil Search said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange. Shares in Oil Search fell as much as 11.5% early on Monday in their first session since the collapse of the talks, on track for their worst one-day fall in more than four years. The P’nyang agreement was one of two agreements needed for Exxon and its partners to go ahead with a $13 billion plan to double LNG exports from the Pacific nation. The other agreement, the Papua LNG pact, was sealed with France’s Total SA in September. The government was seeking terms on P’nyang that would give the state more than the 45%-50% take that PNG is set to reap on the returns from the Papua LNG project, and well above the terms Exxon negotiated in 2008 for its PNG LNG project, a person close to the negotiations said. P’nyang and Total’s Papua LNG project were designed to feed three new processing units, called trains, at Exxon’s PNG LNG plant, with the two projects sharing infrastructure in order to save $2 billion to $3 billion dollars on construction costs. Oil Search said on Monday it would now focus its attention on the Papua LNG project, which will feed two new trains, adding 5.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to the plant’s 8 mtpa capacity. Joint venture partners are set to meet “in the short term” to plan their next steps, it said. Bank of America analysts estimated that separating the projects would pare the cost savings by a third and delay first production from Papua LNG by 18 months to 2026. “The two projects are rather entwined. There’s a bit of uncertainty now. Everything’s going to be delayed for quite a period of time,” said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments, which owns Oil Search shares. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on Friday the company hoped to revive talks on P’nyang to get to a “win-win proposition” but flagged that the company was in no hurry as it had other projects it could advance elsewhere. “But I also think we’ve got some time given all the other opportunities in front of us and, frankly, given where we’re at today in the supply-demand balance of LNG,” Woods told analysts on the company’s quarterly earnings call last Friday. A global glut of LNG has driven spot LNG prices to more than 10-year lows below $4 per million BTUs (mmBTU), posing challenges for projects looking to line up long-term customers. PNG Prime minister James Marape, who came to power last May on a pledge to reap more benefits from the country’s abundant mineral and energy resources, on Sunday said he was comfortable with the hard line he had taken. “I am sorry but if you show little respect to our motive to gain extra for the country, you will lose my support,” Marape said in a post on Facebook. Total has made no comment on the collapse of the P’nyang talks."

Members of the United Steelworkers (USW) local 13-2001 in the refinery and laboratory voted down the three-year extension because it included a 6-month expansion of the current four-year period that starting workers must wait before their pay reaches parity with veteran hourly employees, the sources said. An Exxon spokesman was not available on Sunday night. USW representatives were also unavailable. USW-represented workers in the adjoining Exxon Baytown chemical plant accepted the extension, according to the sources. “The refinery and lab were unwilling to sell out future new hires for a $2,000 one-time, lump-sum bonus,” said one of the sources. “It would have cost new hires a lot of money over the course of their career.” The contract proposal would raise pay by 3.5% in the first year and 4% in the second year. In the third year, the increase would match the pay hike in the new national agreement the USW will negotiate for oil industry workers with energy companies in January 2022, according to the sources. The current contract for workers at the Exxon Baytown refinery and laboratory expires on May 15. The 560,500 barrel-per-day Baytown refinery is Exxon’s largest in the United States."
-29.556759357028433," Oil majors request more Mozambique troops after Islamist attacks: sources JOHANNESBURG/PARIS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Total TOTF.PA have asked Mozambique to send more troops to guard their operations in the far north after a surge of attacks by Islamist militants, an industry source and two security consultants said. Mozambique’s northern province of Cabo Delgado is home to one of the world’s biggest gas finds in the past decade, and both oil majors are working on massive LNG projects that could transform the economy. The area is also the center of an Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds since 2017. Fighters have destroyed villages, clashed with soldiers and often beheaded captives. (reut.rs/31cmuDh) The three sources said that the companies were negotiating with the government to try to increase the number of soldiers protecting their operations. One of the security consultants said there were around 500 troops in the region and the companies wanted another 300. An industry source with knowledge of the situation and another security consultant said more security had been requested, but did not provide numbers. Exxon said it did not comment on discussions with the government, and referred Reuters to Mozambique’s Ministry of National Defence. Mozambique’s government communications department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside usual business hours, while calls to the department and ministry of defense went unanswered Total declined to comment on whether it had requested an increase in troops, but said the safety of its employees was paramount. “We continue to monitor conditions closely and work with the relevant authorities and other stakeholders to provide a safe and secure working environment for our workforce and local communities,” it said it a statement. The militants called themselves Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama when they started launching attacks in 2017. More recently, Islamic State has claimed responsibility via its media outlets, though there has been no independent confirmation of a link. The fighters - who tout their brand of Islam as an antidote to what they describe as a corrupt ruling elite - have been stepping up operations in Cabo Delgado, analysts say. There are concerns they might also be moving south after an assault in the district of Quissanga last week. One of the security consultants said the oil and gas companies were no longer satisfied with the security provided, and were requesting more support in response to a changing threat."

The government said Exxon had refused to budge on the financial terms for developing the gas field and failed to come up with an offer it could accept. The P’nyang field was key to helping feed the expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant, which it operates with partners Oil Search and Santos, among others. The P’nyang agreement is one of two agreements needed for Exxon and its partners to go ahead with their $13 billion plan to expand LNG exports. The other agreement, the Papua LNG pact, was sealed with Total in September. “Exxon Mobil’s offer had barely changed from its opening offer presented last November,” Prime Minister James Marape said in a statement, adding that it was not “substantially different” from a recent LNG agreement with Total. The country is hoping Total will still go ahead with its Papua LNG project, a person close to the negotiations said. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil told Reuters the company was disappointed an agreement could not be reached. “We are hopeful that we can continue to work toward an outcome that benefits all stakeholders,” the spokesman said in an email. The country’s petroleum minister had said last year that the government would press Exxon for “far better” terms on the P’nyang project than it had with the Total agreement. The government was seeking terms that would give the state more than the 45-50% take that the country is set to reap on the value of Total’s Papua LNG project, the person said, adding that the share was much less than the 80% take that governments such as Malaysia and Indonesia have on gas projects in their countries."

-24.119210783417795," Exxon quarterly profit falls 5.2% on weak refining, chemical margins HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Friday reported a 5.2% drop in fourth-quarter profit on weaknesses in chemicals and refining and flat oil and gas output, with asset sales helping to stem the decline. Oil companies last quarter suffered from weaker prices for their products, and in Exxon’s case it has been spending heavily to boost its oil output to reverse production declines. Shares were down 3% to $62.86 in early trading. The stock has dropped about 29% since Chief Executive Darren Woods took over three years ago. Exxon’s full-year profits of $14.3 billion fell short of the potential $25 billion that Woods forecast last March at the company’s investor day. “There’s no doubt that 2019 was a challenging year for a number of our businesses,” Woods said on a Friday morning call with analysts, noting that prices and margins are near or at 10-year lows for natural gas, refining and chemicals. Exxon is betting that a growing global middle class will drive demand for its products despite what Woods called the “short-term impact” of excess supply. “We believe strongly that investing in the trough of this cycle has some real advantages,” he said. Its production in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale field, was up 54% from a year ago to around 294,000 barrels of oil and gas daily. But quarterly profits on U.S. production were down 74% as the company spent heavily to boost output and suffered from lower natural gas prices. Overall, the exploration and production business, its largest, benefited the most from the sale of production assets in Norway for $4.5 billion to Vår Energi AS. Analysts said the weakness across its businesses means Exxon will still have to borrow to cover its shareholder dividend. Investors have been pushing oil companies to improve their returns by increasing dividends or share buybacks. Exxon has frozen its share repurchases except for offsetting dilution for employee awards. “Unlike its peers, the company is not generating free cash flow given its large capital spending program,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. Exxon’s $355 million loss in chemicals mirrors that of rival Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and was the first loss in that business in at least 13 years, said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, adding “we do not expect a significant recovery” in 2020. Oil majors have added and expanded plants to boost plastics production but now face a global chemicals glut and tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Exxon’s chemicals business regularly generated $1 billion in quarterly profit as recently as 2018. Its refining business earned $898 million, down 67% from last year, on lower margins. Net income attributable to Exxon fell to $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share in the quarter from $6 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, per share earnings were 41 cents, below Wall Streets expectation of 43 cents, according to Refinitiv. Analysts earlier this month had slashed estimates from 71 cents after the company warned of weakness in chemicals and refining. The largest U.S. oil producer’s oil and gas output rose less than 1% to 4.02 million barrels per day in the quarter, the sixth quarter in a row of year-over year gains. Earlier this week, the company raised its Guyana oil estimates by 2 billion barrels, bringing total recoverable oil and gas resources from the discovery to more than 8 billion barrels."

-29.44221848639276," At Exxon, CEO's promised turnaround sapped by chemicals, refining HOUSTON (Reuters) - At Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, CEO Darren Woods' plan to revive earnings at the largest U.S. oil and gas company is being sidetracked by the two businesses he knows best: chemicals and refining. Another year of poor profit could require Exxon to re-evaluate its bold spending plans or weaken its ability to weather the next oil-price downturn, say oil analysts. Exxon already must borrow or sell assets to help cover shareholder dividends. The world’s biggest publicly traded oil firm after Saudi Arabian Oil Co 2222.SE, Exxon was long considered one of the best-managed majors and most capable of coping with volatile prices due to its size. Those advantages have slipped in recent years, however, with the drop in once-steady earnings from chemicals. Its total shareholder returns of negative 13% in the five years through this month compare with a 25% gain at Chevron Corp CVX.N and 82% at BP Plc BP.L, according to Refinitiv. Two years ago, CEO Woods promised to restore flagging earnings by heavily investing in operations even as rivals cut spending. The plan to crank up chemicals, refining and increase oil output pushes capital expenditures to as much as $35 billion this year, up from $19 billion in 2016, the year before Woods took over as CEO after running Exxon’s refining and chemical businesses. Last March, he forecast potential earnings could hit $25 billion this year and nearly $31 billion in 2021, close to the $32.5 billion it earned in 2014 before the oil-price collapse. The hoped-for payoff, however, has run headlong into a global chemicals glut, tariffs on U.S. exports to China, and lower margins in fuels. Exxon’s refining profit last year fell on equipment outages. The company declined to comment ahead of quarterly earnings, expected on Friday. On Monday, Exxon shares traded under $65 - close to their level of 10 years ago. The company recently telegraphed weak fourth-quarter results because of chemicals and refining businesses. Wall Street cut profit forecasts through 2021 on the sour outlook for both. Exxon “seems to be tracking way behind their own expectations,” said Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson, who slashed his quarterly forecast by a third, to 55 cents a share. To see a graphic on Exxon's chemicals and refining profit, please click here - In chemicals, Woods expanded the company’s output of polyethylene, a business where it has 9% of global production capacity, to benefit from demand for plastic bags, food packaging and consumer goods. Output rose last summer at the depth of the U.S.-China trade dispute, and industry margins for a key polyethylene fell 30% compared with levels between 2016 and 2018, said James Wilson, analyst at pricing provider ICIS. “The industry ended up overbuilding,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with investment firm Raymond James. “Exxon, of course, is among the companies that led that build-out.” In refining, outages and higher maintenance costs at Exxon refineries in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia hurt profit, according to regulatory filings. Crude oil prices and slack global demand from the trade dispute are squeezing profit across the industry, said Garfield Miller, chief executive at Aegis Energy Advisors. This month, an Exxon regulatory filing implied a loss in chemicals of about $200 million for the fourth quarter, and refining earnings of just $400 million. In contrast, chemicals and refining delivered $7 billion to $11 billion annually for Exxon between 2013 and 2018. In the first nine months of last year, the combined profit was $2.37 billion. Exxon’s regulatory filing indicates 2019 earnings for the two at about $2.52 billion, the lowest in at least a decade. Woods has halted the company’s oil output declines by ramping up in shale. Oil volume has risen year-over-year for five straight quarters, reversing annual declines between 2016 and 2018. To see a graphic on the company's oil and gas output, please click here - Ending the trade dispute represents the biggest challenge. Global demand for the plastic resins and pellets that Exxon makes is rising, said Marc Levine, chief executive of Plantgistix, which provides logistics for U.S. plastic manufacturers. “This is the first time in my lifetime and in the plastics industry’s lifetime where we make plastics resin for export,” said Levine. China in 2018 placed an additional 25% tariff on U.S. polyethylene imports, a move that helped send North American margins to the lowest levels since 2011, said Joel Morales, a polymers analyst at consultancy IHS Markit. “Imagine having a lot of something and your biggest, easiest consumer you can’t do business with,” Morales said. The January U.S.-China agreement does not remove Chinese or U.S. tariffs on chemicals, plastics or oil. Exxon has ramped up asset sales, aiming to collect $15 billion by next year to balance spending. So far, results have been tepid. It expects to receive about $3.6 billion from selling Norwegian oil and gas production assets. Weak demand for those assets comes as rivals have written off the value of their own properties. BP, Chevron, Equinor ASA EQNR.OL, Repsol SA REP.MC and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L last year cut a total of $22 billion primarily on U.S. assets due to sharply lower gas prices. Exxon has not signaled whether it expects any writedowns."

The deals involve a minimum investment of $332 million, the ministry said in a statement. Exxon Mobil announced the acquisition of more than 1.7 million acres last month. The first agreement is for exploration in the North East Amriya block, with a minimum investment of $220 million, the ministry said. The second is for the North Marakia block, with a minimum investment of $112 million. The discovery of the giant Mediterranean field of Zohr by Italy’s Eni in 2015 sparked increasing interest and investment in Egypt’s energy sector. The country is trying to position itself as an energy hub in the eastern Mediterranean, importing gas from Israel and exporting to Jordan and potentially to Europe and Asia.

-31.154117859394407," Exxon's new discovery boosts Guyana oil estimate to over 8 billion bbls (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday raised its Guyana oil estimates by 2 billion barrels with disclosure of a new discovery, as it continues to develop one of the world’s most important new oil and gas blocks in the last decade. The new find continues an Exxon-led consortium’s long string of discoveries in Latin America’s newest crude producing nation and underscores the importance of Guyana to Exxon for increasing its future oil output. Exxon and partners Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC started production at the Stabroek block ahead of schedule in December. The latest discovery, the 16th by the group, brings total recoverable oil and gas resources to more than 8 billion barrels. Recoverable oil is accessible by existing drilling technologies and is profitable to pump at current prices. The new discovery would be added to official resource estimates at a later date, Exxon said. Following Guyana’s first-ever oil export earlier this month, another vessel - the Suezmax tanker Eagle San Antonio - is scheduled to approach Exxon’s offshore producing vessel in coming days for loading the second cargo of Liza light sweet crude for exports, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The Yannis P, carrying Guyana’s first crude cargo, is underway to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where Exxon plans to discharge the vessel into its refining network. The shipment marked the tiny South American nation’s long-awaited debut as an oil exporter. Production from the Liza Phase 1 development is currently ramping up and it will produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day in the coming months, the company said. While Exxon plans to refine Liza crude itself in the short term, Guyana’s government recently awarded Royal Dutch Shell a tender for its first three cargoes and it plans to launch next month a competitive process to choose a marketing agent to trade and export its share of production. Exxon is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings later this week on Jan. 31."

-38.520216765435244," Guyana opposition candidate pledges to keep Exxon contract intact ANNA REGINA, Guyana (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil’s oil contract with Guyana won’t be renegotiated if the opposition wins the March 2 election, the party’s top candidate said, adding that he would administer the deal better after reviewing terms. While his People’s Progressive Party (PPP) has criticized President David Granger’s 2016 deal with Exxon as too generous, Irfaan Ali called the company - whose 1 million barrel cargo of Guyana’s first-ever crude production set sail on Monday - a “pioneer” in an interview over the weekend. The PPP’s platform pledged to “immediately engage the oil and gas companies in better contract administration/re-negotiation.” Other companies exploring off the South American country’s coast include Britain’s Tullow Oil, Spain’s Repsol SA and France’s Total. “Exxon is a different case,” Ali told Reuters after a campaign rally in the western Essequibo region, where thousands of red-shirted supporters listened to him and his allies promise to use oil revenue to lower taxes, raise pensions and wages, and help struggling sugar and rice farmers. “Exxon was a pioneering investment,” Ali said. “But those that came after that time they were not pioneering, so they have to be examined in totality.” The U.S. major, which operates a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, has discovered more than 6 billion recoverable barrels of oil and gas offshore, turning a country with no history of crude production into one of the world’s energy hotspots. Others have not yet confirmed commercial finds. Tullow has made several discoveries in the past year, but the company has yet to find enough reserves to make the project work. In a Monday night Facebook post in response to this story, Ali said the terms of the other deals must be renegotiated because they are “even more lopsided” than Exxon’s contract. But he said the administration of the Exxon contract should be improved, and that the company should use more Guyanese goods and services. “As such we will review that contract to ensure that the administration of the contract brings greater benefit to Guyana,” he wrote. Granger’s government has defended its deal with Exxon, which includes a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share after the company recoups its costs, noting that attractive terms were needed to secure investment in a risky new location. That will bring Guyana around $230 million in government revenue in 2020 and nearly $2 billion total by 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a substantial boost for an underdeveloped country of less than 800,000 people whose central government spent just $1.2 billion in 2018. Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said “the negotiated terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource development phase.” A Tullow spokesman declined to comment.

-38.190006076658825," Guyana's first-ever oil cargo to be refined by Exxon in the U.S. (Reuters) - A vessel carrying Guyana’s first-ever shipment of crude set sail on Monday bound for the U.S. Gulf Coast, oil major Exxon Mobil Corp said, marking the tiny South American nation’s long-awaited debut as an oil exporter. The Suezmax vessel Yannis P, loaded with about 1 million barrels of Liza light sweet crude was bound for Galveston, Texas, according to tracking service TankerTrackers.com, and departed from the floating platform Liza Destiny off Guyana. Exxon and partners Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC started production at Guyana’s promising Stabroek block in December, ahead of schedule, after finding more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas. Exxon had said on Friday that the project’s first crude shipment would load during the weekend and head for its refining network. The U.S. company operates refineries in Louisiana and Texas in addition to plants inland in Montana and Illinois. All commercial oil resources in Guyana, an impoverished nation whose economy is expected to be transformed by its emerging oil industry, have been found at the Stabroek offshore block, where Exxon and its partners have disclosed 15 large discoveries so far. The Exxon-led venture alone expects to produce at least 750,000 barrels per day of crude by 2025, enough for Guyana to become an oil power alongside neighboring Venezuela and Brazil. Guyana’s transition to an oil-producing country has sparked a political controversy in the nation’s ongoing presidential campaign over the way the government gave exploration and production rights and designed its royalty framework. Guyana’s People’s Progressive Party (PPP) has criticized President David Granger’s 2016 deal with Exxon as too generous and pledged to “immediately engage the oil and gas companies in better contract administration/re-negotiation.” Exxon said the negotiated terms of the contracts “are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource development phase.” Exxon is expected to export both its first two cargoes of Guyanese oil. Another of the first shipments from the Liza field is scheduled to be taken by U.S.-based Hess in February, with others earmarked for sale by the Guyanese government through an open-market tender won by Royal Dutch Shell."
-38.190006076658825," Guyana opposition candidate pledges to keep Exxon contract intact ANNA REGINA, Guyana, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil’s oil contract with Guyana would be exempt from a review of the South American nation’s deals if the opposition wins the March 2 election, the party’s top candidate said. While his People’s Progressive Party (PPP) has criticized President David Granger’s 2016 deal with Exxon as too generous, Irfaan Ali called the company - whose 1 million barrel cargo of Guyana’s first-ever crude production set sail on Monday - a “pioneer” in an interview over the weekend. The PPP’s platform pledged to “immediately engage the oil and gas companies in better contract administration/re-negotiation.” Other companies exploring off Guyana’s coast include Britain’s Tullow Oil, Spain’s Repsol SA and France’s Total. “Exxon is a different case,” Ali told Reuters after a campaign rally in the western Essequibo region, where thousands of red-shirted supporters listened to him and his allies promise to use oil revenue to lower taxes, raise pensions and wages, and help struggling sugar and rice farmers. “Exxon was a pioneering investment,” Ali said. “But those that came after that time they were not pioneering, so they have to be examined in totality.” The U.S. major, which operates a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, has discovered more than 6 billion recoverable barrels of oil and gas offshore, turning a country with no history of crude production into one of the world’s energy hotspots. Others have not yet confirmed commercial finds. Tullow has made several discoveries in the past year, but the company has yet to find enough reserves to make the project work. Granger’s government has defended its deal with Exxon, which includes a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share after the company recoups its costs, noting that attractive terms were needed to secure investment in a risky new location. That will bring Guyana around $230 million in government revenue in 2020 and nearly $2 billion total by 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a substantial boost for an underdeveloped country of less than 800,000 people whose central government spent just $1.2 billion in 2018. Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said “the negotiated terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource development phase.” A Tullow spokesman declined to comment. Repsol and Total did not respond to requests for comment. Ali, a former housing minister, said it would be premature to say which parts of the other contracts need changing.

Exxon has so far made 15 discoveries of oil reserves in Guyana, turning a risky exploration venture into one of the world’s most promising oil mega-projects. The company is entitled to the first two crude cargoes to be exported from the Liza field, which it shares with U.S.-based Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC. The Exxon-led consortium has discovered more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources off Guyana’s coast, which could eventually produce 750,000 barrels per day. Those finds are turning Guyana, an impoverished nation with no history of crude output that borders longtime producers Venezuela and Brazil, into a hot property for oil investment. The tanker Yannis P, flagged by the Marshall Islands, arrived on Friday in Guyanese waters. It plans to transport up to 1 million barrels of Guyana’s Liza crude, which would arrive into the United Kingdom in late January, according to Refinitiv Eikon’s vessel tracking data. The shipments following the two Exxon cargoes are to be taken in February by Hess and Guyana’s government. The government already awarded its first three cargoes of Liza crude to Royal Dutch Shell through an open-market tender. Guyana’s first crude production started in December, ahead of schedule.

-35.751078382279," Exxon Mobil confirms may exit Romanian offshore gas project BUCHAREST (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil confirmed late on Tuesday it is weighing an exit from a long-stalled Romanian natural gas venture and has begun providing information to potential buyers. The company holds a 50% stake in the Neptun Deep offshore project located in the Black Sea with Romanian OMV Petrom, majority-controlled by Austria’s OMV, but the venture has been fraught with delays over the tax regime and regulations. No buyer has been identified and no agreements reached with outside groups, Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said. While entertaining talks over its holdings, “we plan to continue to perform our role as operator in advancing the project, including continuing to pursue permits,” Spitler said. Reports of Exxon’s exit plans first emerged last year, but neither the company nor the Romanian government would officially confirm them. Earlier this week, Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said state gas producer Romgaz would be interested in joining a consortium alongside OMV Petrom and a third company to develop Neptun Deep. He also said Russia’s Lukoil had requested information about the sale. “Should Exxon decide to sell, we want a serious partner, one that comes from the region of our partnerships, the European Union, NATO,” Orban told private television station Digi24. “We can’t decide for Exxon to whom it will sell its participation, but there are other offers.” A sale of Exxon’s stake, which requires Romanian government approval, would help edge the oil producer toward its goal of raising $15 billion in proceeds from asset sales by 2021. In November, people familiar with the matter estimated Exxon’s stake in Neptun Deep could be worth about $250 million. The company has stepped up a divestment campaign to offset heavy spending in U.S. shale, refining and chemicals, and deep water oil exploration in Guyana and Brazil. Exxon recently sold Norwegian assets to Var Energi AS, a majority owned unit of Italy’s ENI SpA. That sale is expected to provide up to $3.6 billion in cash during the latest quarter. Several gas producers have spent about a decade and billions of dollars preparing to tap Romania’s Black Sea gas, but they were blindsided by price caps, taxes and export restrictions pushed forward by the previous Social Democrat government. Orban’s Liberal minority cabinet is moving to undo some of the measures."

-43.44816048531135," Exxon signals fourth quarter weakness in chemicals and refining, offset by asset sale HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N fourth quarter operating results will decline from a year ago due to weakness in chemicals and refining, according to a regulatory filing and analyst comments on Friday. Some analysts slashed earnings projections to about 50 cents per share, down from the average earlier estimate of 71 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. The estimates exclude gains from asset sales. Exxon on Friday provided its expectations for fourth-quarter results compared with the prior quarter. It will officially report results for the latest quarter on Jan. 31. The update “is like Groundhog’s day - once again chemicals and downstream weakness will drag down overall earnings,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones. Exxon in the filing projected a loss in chemicals and a sharply lower operating profit in refining, two of its three major businesses. The company earned about $1 billion per quarter in chemicals as recently as 2017. Operating profit in its largest business, oil and gas production, could be $2.3 billion based on the midpoint of its estimate, up from the third quarter but down from a year ago, according to the filing. Offsetting the weak results, Exxon will report a gain of as much as $3.6 billion from the sale of its Norwegian oil and gas production, part of a plan to divest about $15 billion in assets by 2021. “The asset sale proceeds will help cover the dividend, but that’s not a sustainable strategy,” Rowland said. Exxon did not disclose any asset impairments or write downs in its filing. Since October, rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, Chevron CVX.N, BP BP.L, Equinor ENQR.OS and Spain's Repsol REP.MC all wrote down a total more than $20 billion, primarily in U.S. shale gas assets due to lower long-term gas prices. Cowen & Co cut its quarterly earnings estimate for Exxon to 49 cents per share from 71 cents. Simmons Energy lowered its estimate to 52 cents from 78 cents. Exxon’s refining and chemicals businesses “remain a material headwind to cash flow” as there is no sign it will slow spending on new investments, Simmons Energy said in a note to clients."

President David Granger hailed the development in an address to the nation, predicting the revenues from oil would prove “transformative” for the underdeveloped economy. The Exxon-led consortium, which also includes Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC, plans to produce 120,000 barrels-per-day (bdp) from the Liza well in the coming months. The Stabroek block, where the well is located, is expected to produce 750,000 bpd by 2025, Exxon said. Guyana’s president said the first oil output would usher in a “decade of development” and that the government would manage oil resources prudently. “Petroleum production has brought the prospects of a higher quality of life closer to our households and neighbourhoods. It is a momentous event,” Granger said. “Every Guyanese will benefit from petroleum production. No one will be left behind.” Exxon said it expected to sell the first cargo from the Liza well in the next several weeks. The Guyanese government is separately conducting an tender process to sell the first three cargoes of the oil it is entitled to under its contract with the consortium.

-38.25016638269598," Exxon Mobil scores win in New York climate change lawsuit NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp won a major victory in a closely-watched lawsuit on Tuesday when a judge ruled that the company did not defraud investors out of up to $1.6 billion by hiding the true cost of climate change regulation. The ruling by Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court followed a trial featuring testimony from investors, experts and former Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson. The judge found that the New York State Attorney General’s case failed to produce evidence that investors were misled. It was the first of several climate change lawsuits against major oil companies to go to trial. Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that her office “will continue to fight to ensure companies are held responsible for actions that undermine and jeopardize the financial health and safety of Americans.” She did not say whether she would appeal. Exxon said that the ruling affirmed the company’s position that the investigation was “baseless.” “We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change,” spokesman Casey Norton said in a statement. The state’s 2018 lawsuit said Exxon Mobil caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion by falsely telling them it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business. It said Exxon told investors it was projecting the impact of future regulations by using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions in wealthy countries by 2040, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all. Exxon Mobil countered that the proxy cost and the internal greenhouse gas costs were distinct and used for different purposes. Ostrager’s decision said the evidence supported the company’s argument that the two types of projected costs were “different metrics.” “What the evidence at trial revealed is that Exxon Mobil executives and employees were uniformly committed to rigorously discharging their duties in the most comprehensive and meticulous manner possible,” the judge wrote. In October, as the New York trial was getting underway, Massachusetts announced its own lawsuit against Exxon, including allegations about proxy costs similar to those Ostrager rejected. Unlike New York’s lawsuit, Massachusetts accuses Exxon of misleading consumers, not just investors. Cities and counties across the United States have also sued Exxon and other oil companies seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels caused by climate change. The companies have denied liability."
-36.239191708481286," Exxon, Hess to export first oil from Guyana in early 2020: sources (Reuters) - U.S. producers Exxon Mobil Corp and Hess Corp plan to export the first-ever shipments of crude oil from Guyana between January and February, a milestone for Latin America’s newest oil producer, sources with knowledge of the plans said. A consortium including both companies and a unit of China’s CNOOC Ltd have so far discovered more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources off Guyana’s coast, which could eventually produce 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) for a country that has no history of crude output. Those finds are turning Guyana, an impoverished nation bordering longtime producers Venezuela and Brazil, into a hot property for oil investment. Exxon’s Guyana spokeswoman last week told Reuters that “key activities” on its giant Stabroek block, including early production, were running ahead of schedule. He said that coming weeks would be critical as progress could be impacted by weather and other factors. The U.S. company did not provide additional details. Hess declined to comment. CNOOC and Guyana’s government were not immediately available for comment. Liza will be the first Guyanese crude grade produced and offered to the oil market. It has 32 API degrees of density and 0.5 percent of sulfur content, according to Exxon’s assay seen by Reuters. Exxon is planning on shipping two 1-million-barrel cargoes of Liza crude in January, to be followed by similarly sized shipments from Hess and Guyana’s government in February. Exxon plans to process the oil at its refineries, while Hess could offer it for spot sales. CNOOC, which has not yet scheduled exports, would ship it to China, whose refiners like using similar medium sweet grades, the sources said. Interested buyers are exploring options to co-load Liza crude with other South American crudes bound for Asia, mainly Brazilian grades. Starting in March, very large crude carriers (VLCCs) could lift up to 2 million barrels each, depending on weather conditions, the sources added. “We are expecting Liza to be traded at $4-$6 over Brent crude prices during the first three months of exports. First buyers would test it, and then prices could go up a little,” a trader interested in purchases said. The Liza project is expected to produce up to 120,000 bpd of oil in 2020-2022 and reach 750,000 bpd by 2025. Exxon had initially planned first production to come in early 2020, but in November it said it could be available in December. Exxon and its partners have made 14 large discoveries at the Stabroek block since 2015."

The sell-off would be a marked acceleration of the U.S. oil major’s previous divestment plans. It would represent an ambitious attempt by Chief Executive Darren Woods to catch up with competitors who carried out sweeping portfolio reviews and sold swathes of assets following the 2014 market crash. Exxon’s shares have underperformed its major rivals’ in recent years. The disposals would help the company increase spending on new developments and appease investors unhappy with weak cash generation and oil output, which flatlined under Woods’ predecessor Rex Tillerson. The sales would see Exxon effectively quit its upstream oil and gas business in Europe, according to the three banking sources with direct knowledge of the plans. They would free up cash to invest in new developments in Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Brazil and the United States. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on specific assets offered for sale but noted it has told Wall Street its asset sales could reach $25 billion through 2025. Shares in the world’s top listed energy company rose following the Reuters report and were up 1.5% at 1816 GMT. In recent months, the Texas-based company has drawn up an extensive list of assets that it wants to divest, spanning at least 11 countries, the sources said. The list, details of which have not been previously reported, would easily exceed its current divestment target which envisages it selling about $15 billion of assets by 2021. Exxon has struck a number of deals in recent months including a $4.5 billion exit from Norway, and is also already offering assets in Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia. The expanded plan will see Exxon also sell out of operations in the British North Sea, Germany and Romania, according to the sources. In Europe, that would leave it with production only in the Netherlands, where it holds a stake with Royal Dutch Shell in the giant Groningen gas field which the government plans to shut down in 2022. The new plan would also see Exxon significantly pare back operations in Southeast Asia with the sale of its assets in Indonesia and Malaysia, the sources said. In Africa, Exxon wants to sell its operations in Chad, Equatorial Guinea as well as parts of its Nigerian assets. While Exxon is set to ramp up its spending sharply in the coming years to develop new oil and gas projects, most of its peers have more cautious spending plans due to an uncertain outlook for oil prices and growing pressure from investors to diversify away from fossil fuels toward renewables. For a factbox on the asset sales Exxon responded more slowly to the 2014 oil price crash than some of its rivals that sharply cut spending, putting it under pressure from shareholders to reduce costs. Exxon’s shares heavily underperformed relative to other Oil Majors over the past five years. tmsnrt.rs/2LsEuoy Unlike rivals such as Shell and BP, Exxon did not carry out major review of its portfolio in recent decades. BP sold over $65 billion of assets following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico while Shell sold over $30 billion after acquiring rival BG Group in 2016. Under Woods, Exxon is set to sharply increase its spending in the coming years as it launches new, large oil and gas developments. In its 2019 investor day, the company said it planned to boost its annual capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30-$35 billion between 2021 and 2025. Building up its coffers via asset sales could help allay concerns that Exxon will ramp up its debt levels to fund new projects, particularly with oil prices remaining stubbornly close to $60 a barrel. Moody’s Investor Service on Tuesday changed Exxon’s outlook to negative from stable due to its negative free cash flow and anticipated use of debt to fund its future capital spending. Moody’s has forecast negative free cash flow of about $7 billion this year and $9 billion next year. It warned the company’s debt rating could be lowered next year if Exxon’s financial metrics weaken further. By contrast, Exxon’s biggest rival Shell has generated $21 billion in free cash flows so far this year and the figure is expected to rise further in the fourth quarter. “The company’s high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given ExxonMobil’s substantial dividend payout, absent meaningfully higher commodity prices and earnings from downstream and chemicals,” Moody’s said."

The P’Nyang project will help feed an expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant, in which Australia’s Oil Search and Santos Ltd are also stakeholders. Talks over the project were put on hold earlier this year, when the government sought to revise a separate LNG agreement it has with French energy firm Total, in which Exxon is also involved. That deal was finally endorsed in early September, with minor concessions from Total. Kua had earlier told Reuters the state would seek “far better” terms for P’Nyang than those with Total. “We look forward to working with the Government of PNG to progress the required gas agreement for the P’nyang project ahead of potential decisions on FEED for the three train development at the existing LNG plant site,” Exxon said in a statement emailed to Reuters."

Warren said companies and executives could face criminal liability for false information they knowingly provide to U.S. agencies, leading to up to $250,000 in fines or jail time. “No one would be liable for mistakes, for submitting research in good faith that turns out to be wrong, or for raising honest disagreements,” Warren wrote on the website Medium. “But where companies engage in egregious and intentional efforts to mislead agencies in an effort to prevent our government from understanding and acting on facts, they will face criminal liability,” she added. An Exxon spokesman said the company has supported climate research in conjunction with governments and academic institutions for nearly 40 years, with a “commitment to helping address this important societal challenge.” “ExxonMobil has continuously and publicly researched and discussed the risks of climate change, carbon life-cycle analysis and emissions reductions,” Exxon’s Scott Silvestri said. Warren, one of 17 Democrats vying to take on President Donald Trump in November 2020, has made anti-corruption efforts a centerpiece of her White House bid. The Massachusetts senator has previously detailed how she would crack down on the so-called revolving door in Washington between the government and lobbying firms, mandate that elected officials release their tax returns and beef up government ethics rules. In her plan released Tuesday, Warren also said she would ban agencies and courts from considering industry-funded research that has not been peer reviewed. Warren noted in the early 2000s, Exxon paid nearly a third of the annual budget of the group Frontiers of Freedom, which promoted industry-friendly research minimizing climate change risks. Tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris MO.N and RJ Reynolds also provided the limited-government group with financial support. “My plan would require industry actors who submit non-peer-reviewed research to agencies to disclose how that research was funded, whether those funders influenced the research’s findings, and the nature of any past or ongoing financial relationships,” Warren wrote. Silvestri said Exxon’s research had resulted in nearly 150 public papers, including more than 50 in peer-reviewed publications. Warren cited recent congressional testimony by a former Exxon consultant that the company knew of serious risks posed by climate change in the early 1980s. In 2009, a group of industry groups that included Exxon filed a regulatory comment with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that stated the effects of climate change were “almost non-existent and engulfed in an extremely high degree of uncertainty.” Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive from 2006 to 2017, served as Trump’s secretary of state from February 2017 to March 2018.

-13.141162805204084," Factbox: Lawsuits over climate change proliferate across the United States (Reuters) - A trial in which Exxon Mobil Corp stands accused of defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion by hiding the true cost of climate change regulation is expected to wrap up this week. It is one of dozens of lawsuits in the United States brought against oil companies and local and state governments over global warming. The following is a summary of how this litigation is playing out across the country: ** Exxon is the first case to go to trial against a major oil company over climate change. ** The New York attorney general has accused the Texas-based company of using two sets of books to hide the true cost of climate change from investors. ** Exxon has assailed the lawsuit as political. The company has said the two sets of figures used to calculate dollars per ton of carbon emissions served different purposes - evaluating global demand and planning for specific capital projects. ** The Massachusetts attorney general filed a similar lawsuit in October accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels played in climate change. Exxon has denied the allegations. ** If the New York and Massachusetts lawsuits are successful, other attorneys general could bring similar cases, said Robert Percival, who heads the environmental law program at the University of Maryland. ** In addition to the litigation by attorneys general, Baltimore, Rhode Island and about a dozen local governments have sued oil and gas companies including BP Plc and Chevron Corp over climate change. The lawsuits claim the companies created a public nuisance by producing the fossil fuels that contributed to global warming. They seek funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and rising sea levels brought on by climate change. ** The companies deny the claims. They say the lawsuits will do nothing to stop climate change and that they are working to address the issue. ** Meanwhile, teenagers across the country have filed more than half a dozen lawsuits accusing states and, in one case, the U.S. government of violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by failing to implement policies that curb climate change. Governments have argued there is no constitutional right to a clean environment and that Congress and the White House, not the courts, should set climate change policy."
-13.141162805204084," Exxon's lawyer calls lawsuit a 'cruel joke' as climate change fraud trial ends NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for New York state and Exxon Mobil Corp delivered closing arguments in a closely watched trial accusing the oil company of hiding from investors the true cost of addressing climate change. The case, filed in October 2018 in Manhattan state court, was the first of several climate-related lawsuits against major oil companies to go to trial. It featured testimony from investors, experts and former Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who denied the allegations against the company. New York’s attorney general alleges that Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion by falsely telling them it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business. A verdict is expected within the next 40 days. Exxon’s lawyer said on Thursday the case was “meritless” and that the state failed to offer testimony from any investor who was misled. “The case is almost a joke,” Theodore Wells said. “But it’s a cruel joke, your honor, because the reputations of a lot of people have been hurt and disparaged by the bringing of the complaint.” A lawyer for the state said the case came down to whether Exxon had adequately disclosed the cost of climate change. “The question here isn’t whether Exxon employees are good people or even were trying their best,” Jonathan Zweig said. He told the court that the state was dropping two of its four fraud claims and would limit its closing argument to claims brought under the Martin Act, a law that gives the New York attorney general’s office broad power to pursue securities fraud cases without having to prove intent to defraud. “The question in this case is whether Exxon’s disclosures were accurate, and the evidence shows they were not,” Zweig said. The attorney general has said the company used a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions in wealthy countries by 2040, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all. Tillerson testified that the proxy cost represented “macro level” assessment of the likely effect of future carbon regulations around the world on demand for fossil fuels, and was incorporated into a data guide used throughout Exxon. Separately, he said, the company evaluated greenhouse gas costs at a “micro level” for specific projects, when appropriate. Wells said the attorney general’s case wrongly conflated proxy costs with those separate, project-specific costs. Last month, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change. Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.

-12.398553684541529," Kazakh energy minister says new Tengiz expansion cost too high NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) - Kazakhstan believes an increased cost estimate for the Tengiz oilfield expansion is too high and wants oil majors Chevron CVX.N and ExxonMobil XOM.N to review it, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Wednesday. Chevron, which leads the consortium developing one of the Central Asian nation’s biggest oilfields, said last week that cost overruns would balloon project expenses by 25% to $45.2 billion. It blamed a one-year delay and higher construction and equipment costs.. “Generally, we told them that in our opinion the sum is too high,” Bozumbayev told reporters when asked about Tengiz costs. “This means poor planning.” Chevron and ExxonMobil have sent experts to Kazakhstan to review the project and it was too early to talk about the final figures, he added. Kazakh state energy firm KazMunayGaz KMGZ.KZ and Russia's LUKOIL LKOH.MM are partners in the Tengiz joint venture. Additional expenses would need to be compensated from future revenue, eating into Kazakhstan’s share of profits. The Kazakh government has repeatedly locked horns with its partners in giant projects such as Tengiz, Kashagan and Karachaganak, with a $1.6 billion dispute regarding the latter in arbitration. Oil is the former Soviet republic’s main export, the bulk of which comes from three large fields developed mostly by Western energy majors. The Tengiz expansion is set to increase the field’s output by 12 million tonnes a year by 2025/26 from the current 29 million tonnes a year."
-9.670749592985405," Exxon, Chevron earnings fall on lower oil and gas prices HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Friday posted sharply lower quarterly results despite increases in oil and gas production as lower energy prices soured earnings for most oil majors. The two U.S. oil majors credited higher production in the top U.S. shale field for similar 3% volume increases, while warning that sizeable cost overruns at a giant oil field in Kazakhstan, where both are partners, would affect future earnings. Results mirrored weaker quarterly earnings at BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which indicated they might delay dividend increases or a buyback program if current low prices continue. In the third quarter, global benchmark Brent crude fell 8.7%, the worst quarterly drop since the fourth quarter of 2018, while U.S. crude dropped 7.5% as concerns about the trade war between the United States and China plunged global economic growth to its lowest levels in a decade. Investors have fled the energy sector in recent years due to returns that significantly lag market indexes. Exxon’s share performance in the last three years was down 6.9% while Chevron’s rose 20.4%, both well below the 44.6% gain in Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Exxon’s profit was nearly halved to $3.17 billion, or 75 cents per share, beating analysts’ recently reduced estimate of 67 cents a share, according to Refinitiv IBES. The results included a favorable tax impact of 7 cents a share. Operating profits in each of Exxon’s major businesses fell compared with the same period a year ago. For a graphic on Exxon's profits by quarter, please click here: tmsnrt.rs/2oD2kU5 Chevron’s earnings fell 36% to $2.58 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the quarter. Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.55 per share, exceeding the $1.45 expected by analysts. The two are partners in the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakstan, where the operator, Chevron, said on Friday that overruns will balloon project expenses by 25% to $45.2 billion. It blamed a one-year delay in an expansion project and higher construction and equipment costs. “If you take away the initial contingencies that they have baked in, it’s almost a 50% cost increase to the project,” said Anish Kapadia, a director at London-based Palissy Advisors. Exxon shares were up 2.5% at $69.24 on Friday afternoon while Chevron’s were flat at $116.14. Exxon and Chevron are racing in the top U.S. shale field to reach 1 million barrels per day of production within a few years. Chevron’s Permian Basin production rose 35% from the same period a year ago to 455,000 barrels of oil and gas daily, while Exxon’s daily output reached 293,0000 barrels, up more than 70% in a year. Smaller oil and gas companies in the field are struggling to generate profits, prompting speculation that the majors will scoop up smaller rivals at bargain-basement prices. “There’s a lot of things to consider,” said Neil Hansen, Exxon vice president, on a call with analysts. “It’s just a question of whether or not we can transact at the right value.”"

Earnings fell to $3.17 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.24 billion, or $1.46 per share, a year earlier, the company reported on Friday.(bit.ly/2WxMI0q) It beat analysts’ recently reduced expectations for earnings of 67 cents per share. The company last month warned results would be hurt by weaker chemicals and lower oil prices, prompting analysts to reduce estimates from 86 cents per share. “Maybe expectations were a little bit weak going in, but I think overall it is probably slightly negative relative to expectation,” said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors. Analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co called Friday’s results “neutral for the stock.” Exxon shares were up 1.3% in early trading on Friday. Exxon’s results mirrored weaker earnings at rivals BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell, which earlier this week indicated they might delay dividend increases or a buyback program because of low prices. Chevron Corp on Friday reported a 36% drop in third-quarter profit. Prices have fallen for oil and gas as U.S. shale producers keep pumping more oil amid slowing global consumption growth. Exxon has been investing in major projects to boost production at a time when investors have been pressing oil companies to cut spending and increase returns to shareholders. It spent $7.7 billion in the third quarter, up from $6.6 billion the same period the year prior and higher than what analysts expected. Exxon’s cash flow, a closely watched metric by investors, fell 24% from a year ago. Investors have been looking for the company to improve cash flow to cover its dividends and capital expenses. Despite rising output from U.S. shale, profits in Exxon’s oil and gas production unit were down 49% to $2.17 billion on weaker prices, its lowest earnings in two years. Its refining business earned $1.23 billion, down 25% from last year, on lower margins for its gasoline and diesel. Its chemicals business was down 66% year-over-year. Results have been weaker because of global overcapacity in plastics and higher project expenses. Exxon’s oil equivalent production rose about 3% to 3.89 million barrels per day, the fourth quarter in a row of year-over year gains. Its production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, rose 7% from the second quarter to around 293,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily."

-4.677048406986914," Somalia says Shell, Exxon agree to pay $1.7 million for oil blocks lease MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil have paid $1.7 million to Somalia to lease offshore blocks for 30 years, the country’s state news agency reported on Friday. “Shell/Exxon Mobil have paid $1.7 million to Somalia as the preliminary rent for 30 years,” SONNA reported. Shell and Exxon Mobil had a joint venture on five offshore blocks in Somalia prior to the toppling of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in the early 1990s. A Shell spokesman said that the payment was for retrospective charges and that operations on the blocks remain suspended in what is known as a force majeure. The country has been mired in insecurity since Barre left and is battling Islamist group al Shabaab that frequently carries out bombings in the capital Mogadishu and elsewhere in the country. In June, the oil ministry announced that the two companies were looking to return to Somalia ahead of an oil block bid round later this year."
-4.677048406986914," Trump suggestion of taking Syrian oil draws rebukes (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion on Sunday that Exxon Mobil or another U.S. oil company operate Syrian oil fields drew rebukes from legal and energy experts. “What I intend to do, perhaps, is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly ... and spread out the wealth,” Trump said during a news conference about the U.S. special forces operation that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, the two largest U.S. oil companies operating in the Middle East, declined to comment on his remarks. “International law seeks to protect against exactly this sort of exploitation,” said Laurie Blank, an Emory Law School professor and director of its Center for International and Comparative Law. “It is not only a dubious legal move, it sends a message to the whole region and the world that America wants to steal the oil,” said Bruce Riedel, a former national security advisor and now senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think-tank. “The idea that the United States would ‘keep the oil’ in the hands of ExxonMobil or some other U.S. company is immoral and possibly illegal,” said Jeff Colgan, an associate professor of political science and international studies at Brown University. Colgan also said U.S. companies would face “a host of practical challenges” to operate in Syria. Even getting Exxon or another major oil company to develop Syrian oil would be a “hard sell” given its relatively limited infrastructure and small output, said Ellen R. Wald, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center. Syria produced around 380,000 barrels of oil per day before the country’s civil war erupted. An International Monetary Fund working paper in 2016 estimated that production had declined to just 40,000 barrels per day. Still, the United States should be concerned about the fate of the Syrian oil fields, said Alex Cranberg, chairman of energy firm Aspect Holdings LLC, which has explored production in Iraqi Kurdistan but no longer has active projects in the region. “It’s not that the oil itself matters much to the U.S., but that its misuse could fund future problems for us” if it falls into the wrong hands, Cranberg said, noting his company has not been approached by the White House. “U.S. control over the disposition of the fields and the hard currency they offer would provide a significant influence over the shape of Syria’s future,” he said. Robert O’Brien, a U.S. National Security advisor to the president, said a U.S. military presence will be required to protect the Syrian oilfields, suggesting it also should have a say on their proceeds. “We’re going to be there for a period of time to maintain control of those and make sure that there is not a resurgence of ISIS and make sure that the Kurds have some revenue from those oil fields,” O’Brien said, speaking to NBC News’ Meet the Press with Chuck Todd."

Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, the two largest U.S. oil companies operating in the Middle East, declined to comment on the President’s remarks. “International law seeks to protect against exactly this sort of exploitation,” said Laurie Blank, an Emory Law School professor and director of its Center for International and Comparative Law. “It is not only a dubious legal move, it sends a message to the whole region and the world that America wants to steal the oil,” said Bruce Riedel, a former national security advisor and now senior fellow at think-tank Brookings Institution. “The idea that the United States would ‘keep the oil’ in the hands of ExxonMobil or some other U.S. company is immoral and possibly illegal,” said Jeff Colgan, an associate professor of political science and international studies at Brown University. Colgan also said U.S. companies would face “a host of practical challenges” to operate in Syria. Even getting Exxon or another major oil company to develop Syrian oil would be a “hard sell” given its relatively limited infrastructure and small output, said Ellen R. Wald, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center. Still, the United States should be concerned about the fate of the Syrian oil fields, said Alex Cranberg, chairman of energy firm Aspect Holdings LLC, which has explored production in Iraqi Kurdistan but no longer has active projects in the region. “It’s not that the oil itself matters much to the U.S., but that its misuse could fund future problems for us” if it falls into the wrong hands, Cranberg said, noting his company has not been approached by the White House. “U.S. control over the disposition of the fields and the hard currency they offer would provide a significant influence over the shape of Syria’s future,” he said. Robert O’Brien, a U.S. National Security advisor to the president, said a U.S. military presence will be required to protect the Syrian oilfields, suggesting it also should have a say on their proceeds. “We’re going to be there for a period of time to maintain control of those and make sure that there is not a resurgence of ISIS and make sure that the Kurds have some revenue from those oil fields,” O’Brien said speaking to NBC News’ Meet the Press with Chuck Todd."

Representatives for large refiners, including Valero Energy Corp VLO.N and Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N, have toured the refinery, two of the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is private. Ultimately a smaller refiner could be a more likely buyer of the plant, one of the sources said. Exxon and Valero could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for Marathon declined to comment, but pointed to recent comments from Chief Executive Gary Heminger that the company is mulling portfolio optimization and divestitures. Exxon was said to discuss plans to sell the plant to PBF Energy in 2016, Reuters reported at the time. In those talks, Exxon wanted to unload both the Billings plant and its Joliet, Illinois refinery to PBF, but the smaller refiner wanted only the Billings plant, scuttling the deal, according to people familiar with the plans. Four years ago, Exxon was asking about $500 million for Billings. The plant is still expected to fetch the same amount, the sources said. Exxon is looking to unload the refinery to direct investment towards its three Gulf Coast refineries at Baytown and Beaumont, Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana."

-2.851628923769479," Massachusetts accuses Exxon in lawsuit of climate change deceit BOSTON (Reuters) - The state of Massachusetts sued Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Thursday, accusing the oil giant of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change. Attorney General Maura Healey filed the lawsuit shortly after Exxon lost a bid to delay the filing until after it is done defending itself in a trial that began Tuesday over similar allegations brought by the state of New York. The lawsuit in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston alleged Exxon systematically misled investors about climate-driven risks to its business and deceived auto drivers and other consumers about the role fossil fuel products play in causing climate change. “Our goal here is simple: to stop Exxon from engaging in this deception and penalize it for this conduct,” Healey told reporters. Her lawsuit, the culmination of a three-year investigation, was filed two hours after a judge rejected a last-minute bid by Exxon to force Healey to hold-off from moving forward with her plans to sue it. In court papers, Exxon called the decision by Healey to sue now “gamesmanship” to distract its lawyers amid the New York trial and part of a “partisan” campaign against it. “We look forward to refuting the meritless allegations in court,” Exxon said in a statement. Healey, a Democrat, and her New York counterpart launched investigations into Exxon following news reports in 2015 saying company scientists determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those news reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. Healey in 2016 issued a so-called civil investigative demand to Exxon seeking documents to determine whether it had violated Massachusetts consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products. The company fought the records request, and while courts have sided with Healey, the company to this day has not provided her office any records. The state built its lawsuit on evidence from other sources, including New York’s case, Healey said. In its 2018 lawsuit, New York accuses Exxon of falsely telling investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business, defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion. Exxon denies wrongdoing and says it has a robust system to manage the risk of increasing climate change."

-3.117949288347928," Exxon, New York prosecutors face off in climate change fraud trial (Reuters) - A lawyer for New York's attorney general on Tuesday told a state judge Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N used two sets of books to hide the true cost of climate change regulations from investors, while an attorney for the oil major assailed the claims as false and politically motivated. The lawyers’ opening statements kicked off a long-awaited trial in a civil lawsuit filed by the attorney general last year accusing Exxon of defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion. The trial, expected to last up to three weeks, will take place before Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court without a jury and could feature testimony from Rex Tillerson, who served as Exxon chief executive officer and U.S. Secretary of State. It is the first of several lawsuits currently pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial. The attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York state law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud. The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all. “Exxon only ever told its investors about a single set of assumptions,” Kevin Wallace, acting chief of the New York Attorney General’s Investor Protection Bureau, told Ostrager Tuesday. “What we are saying, and the law demands, is that Exxon not mislead its investors,” he said. Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a “robust system” to manage the risk of increasing climate change. He said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a “global,” “macro level” assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects. “There is no document that says ... proxy costs and GHG costs were one and the same,” he said. Wells also accused former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of bringing the case for political reasons. “They didn’t stay in their lane of objectivity and fairness,” he said. Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change. Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

1.8297869368679283," Exxon, Trafigura tap lower shipping rates as U.S.-Asia arb reopens HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. crude exports to Asia, which have slumped due to record freight costs, stirred on Thursday as rates slid and the premium in Asia for Russia’s ESPO Blend oil sent buyers back to U.S. grades, according to market sources. Oil shipping costs for United States Gulf Coast to Asia cooled this week from record highs on the prospect of more vessels becoming available. Nearly 300 oil tankers globally were placed off limits due to U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Seventeen supertankers returned to service in October after being sidelined for overhauls, as 11 entered drydocks. That was the first overall increase in available ships since May, according to shipbroker McQuilling Services. Exxon Mobil Corp provisionally chartered the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) KHK Empress to transport crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Singapore for $11.5 million, or $5.75 a barrel, according to four market sources. Exxon declined to comment. Trafigura AG also tentatively booked the Ascona to ship U.S. crude to South Korea for $12.9 million, or $6.45 a barrel, three market sources said. Trafigura had no immediate comment on the charter. Both were below rates of between $16 million and $17.5 million, or $8 to $8.50 per barrel, quoted earlier in the week for U.S. to Asia routes, shipbrokers said. Assessed rates peaked on Friday around $11 a barrel. Arbitration opportunities to ship U.S. crude to Asia also have emerged with Russia’s ESPO Blend crude climbing to record premiums in the last month, dragging other grades sold in Asia higher, traders said. The price of WTI delivered into Singapore was assessed on Thursday at more than $5 a barrel over dated Brent, covering freight costs and providing some margin, traders said. “Asia needs oil. It’s the shortest region globally. They will pull (the arbitration window) open,” a U.S. trader said. In addition to U.S. sanctions on Chinese tankers that crimped supply, some vessels have been drydocked awaiting exhaust scrubbers to meet regulations that take effect on Jan. 1. Those regulations ban ocean-going vessels from using fuel with sulfur content above 0.5% unless they are equipped with the scrubbers. The return of some tankers into service could signal a further drop in global oil freight rates. Another factor affecting demand was refiners including China’s Sinopec cut runs and a series of failed charters adding to available tonnage, said Oliver Ge, a senior advisor at McQuilling Services."

The memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed late Monday, will be later signed as a definitive deal after Exxon studies the blocks of the company, one of the sources told Reuters. Lately, India is generating a lot of interest worldwide in its oil and gas operations, as growing demand amid a global slowdown and government policies have made investments and returns attractive.

ONGC and ExxonMobil will also jointly identify areas to submit bids for more exploration assets in India, he added. ONGC is currently developing deep water oil and gas blocks in India’s east coast, which are expected to come onstream by 2020 and produce 15 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas at its peak. On Monday, Exxon signed another memorandum with India's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp Ltd IOC.NS to explore ways to supply liquefied natural gas to meet India's 1burgeoning gas demand. French energy major Total SA TOTF.PA also announced that it would buy around 35% stake in India's Adani Gas Ltd. “It is a non-binding agreement. It is a technical tie up.

Those it has offered or sold include production in Norway, Australia, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and Britain. In Malaysia, Exxon operates 35 oil and gas platforms in 12 offshore fields and has working interests in another 10 platforms in five fields in the South China Sea, according to its website. The operations produce 15% of Malaysia’s oil output of 600,000 barrels per day and half of its natural gas output of over 2 billion cubic feet per day. The fields are operated under a 50% and 78% stake in two large production sharing contracts (PSC), consultancy WoodMackenzie said in a note. “The Malaysian assets are both operated and generally highly mature, with a significant amount of ageing infrastructure. A buyer will need to have strong operating credentials, and be recognised by (Malaysian national oil company) Petronas to be a suitably qualified and reputable operator,” one banker said. Exxon, which has operated in Malaysia for more than 125 years, will continue to operate other businesses in the country after any sale.

Both Chevron and its larger U.S. rival Exxon Mobil XOM.N are seeking to sell their stakes in the BP-operated Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea. This marks the retreat of the U.S. majors from the central Asian state after 25 years as they refocus on domestic production. MOL was initially interested in both oil companies’ stakes in the field but decided to bid only for Chevron’s 9.57% holding, the sources told Reuters. Chevron and MOL both declined to comment. The discussions come as the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seeking to develop closer relations with central Asian countries.

The U.S. oil company’s $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, jointly operated with Italy’s Eni, has a capacity of more than 15 million tonnes a year (mtpa) and is set pump much-needed cash into the southern African nation’s ailing economy. “The Area 4 partners will advance midstream and upstream area project activities of more than $500 million as initial investments,” Exxon head of power and gas marketing Peter Clarke told a ceremony in Mozambique’s capital Maputo on Tuesday. Construction of onshore facilities has been awarded to a consortium led by Japan’s JGC, U.K firm TechnipFMC and U.S. company Fluor Corp. “These EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts cover the construction of two natural gas production trains with a total capacity of 15.2 million tons per annum, as well as associated onshore facilities,” Clarke said. Final investment decisions, a term used by the oil industry to mean the commercial and regulatory aspects of a project are finalised, would be made in 2020, Clarke said. Mozambique, among the poorest countries in the world, holds presidential elections on Oct. 15, and the investments stand to boost President Filipe Nyusi’s popularity and ease growing frustrations over unemployment and poverty. The Exxon project, along with Total’s $20 billion 13 mtpa facility and Eni’s $8 billion 3.4 mtpa floating plant, mean Mozambique will have the ability to export 31 mtpa of natural gas, about 10% of today’s global market.

Mozambique’s government said on Sunday Exxon would finalize the project at a signing ceremony in the capital Maputo. Instead, the company and its partners, Italy’s Eni, Korea Gas Corp and state-owned China National Petroleum Corp, will announce a consortia of contractors for the project, enabling it to begin some building, the source said. Local media reported Exxon has delayed the FID while other media reported that the FID will take place on Tuesday. “It’s contractor selection and the issue of Limited Notice To Proceed to them,” said the source when asked what will take place at the event. “The FID will be later, but it’s a step forward before the elections,” the source said referring to a presidential election to be held next week. “I expect they will give a target (on FID timing) on Tuesday.” Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Exxon said in May it would take the FID, a term used by the oil industry to mean that the commercial and regulatory aspects of a project are finalised, paving the way for investment in the construction phase, “later this year”. Industry sources previously said Exxon had done well to progress the project this far so quickly given it had taken it over in December 2017 after a $2.8 billion deal with Eni. Exxon’s project is located next to another huge LNG facility that is being built by oil major Total after its previous owner, Anadarko, took the FID in June. Anadarko has since been taken over by Occidental Petroleum. Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world, is holding a presidential election on Oct. 15. Sources previously said the government of President Filipe Nyusi hoped both projects would get a FID before the vote. The two projects, and a third smaller one approved in 2017, will turn Mozambique into a global gas exporter by the mid-2020s - potentially enriching the southern African nation of 30 million people with a gross domestic product of $12 billion. Exxon’s project has a capacity of 15 million tonnes a year(mtpa), which with Total’s $20 billion 13 mtpa facility and Eni’s $8 billion 3.4 mtpa floating plant, will give Mozambique the ability to export 31 mtpa, 10% of today’s global market."

State television news channel TVM on Sunday said the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy would host a signing ceremony with Exxon and other firms in the capital Maputo on Tuesday. Exxon has said it expects 17,000 tons of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) per year during the production phase, with the signing of an initial investment decision paving the way for the massive infrastructure project to begin. The gas fields are located off the coast of the northern Cabo Delgado province, which for the last two years has seen intensifying attacks on surrounding communities and government buildings by an extreme Islamist militant group. In February Texas-based petroleum firm Anadarko said one worker was killed and several others injured in two related attacks in the Cabo Delgado area where it is building a 17,000-acre liquefaction complex."
3.201653448964331," Exxon Mobil bars use of oil tankers linked to Venezuela: sources LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp this week banned the use of vessels linked to oil flows from Venezuela in the last year, according to four people familiar with the matter, putting new pressure on the U.S. sanctioned country and on global crude freight rates. Washington has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Venezuela this year to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been dismissed by the United States and dozens of other countries as a sham. Some measures have led tanker operators to stop carrying oil for Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA oil firm. The decision by world’s largest publicly-traded oil producer to ban the Venezuela-linked tankers should affect about 250 vessels, two of the people familiar with the matter estimated. Exxon declined to comment. PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Over 25 foreign vessels reach Venezuelan ports per month, according to PDVSA and Refinitiv Eikon data. Some are known to turn their transponders off to avoid detection amid the tough U.S. sanctions targeting Venezuela’s oil industry. Average freight earnings for supertankers on the closely-watched U.S.-China route jumped over $20,000 on Friday to $87,625 a day, the highest level since rates for the route were first published in March, Baltic Exchange data showed. “The VLCC pool here (in the Caribbean) has been very thin for some while, and this week rates pushed to levels not seen for many a year - $12 million now to the Far East and it’s almost ‘name your price,’” E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd said in a report on Friday. Another ship broker who declined to be identified to avoid upsetting clients said Exxon’s directive may have a limited impact on freight rates. But he said those rates could go higher “if it spreads to other charterers beyond Exxon.” A lack of vessels willing to carry Venezuelan oil exports is hurting Cuba, the crisis-torn country’s main political ally, which imposed fresh austerity measures last month due to power cuts and an acute shortage of fuel."

4.704581207983376," Chevron's shale allies are its secret weapon in Exxon race MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron Corp CVX.N is turning to joint ventures and drilling alliances in its bid to dominate the Permian Basin after abandoning a takeover that would have made it the leading producer in the world's biggest shale field. It is now in a race with Exxon Mobil XOM.N to be the first to pump a million barrels of shale oil a day from the field in the U.S. southwest, using a strategy that depends on a host of partners sharing their expertise and their output. Chevron's joint venture with Cimarex Energy XEC.N, one of the few Permian operators that has been consistently profitable since late 2016, is well known. But it also has dozens of other agreements with companies including Concho Resources CXO.N, Devon Energy DVN.N, EOG Resources EOG.N, and even arch-rivals Exxon and Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. “We’re partners with all of the great operators,” said Scott Neal, a Chevron exploration executive. He declined to name any partners, besides Cimarex. Concho, Devon, EOG, Occidental and Exxon declined to comment. Chevron’s deals, ranging from large-scale joint ventures to small deals where it has leased land to other operators, give it a share of the oil its partners produce. They also provide data from thousands of wells stretching back years, allowing Chevron to hone drilling strategies. In return, partners get access to areas adjacent to their wells and pipelines, reducing their costs. Shale drilling has helped the United States reverse decades of declines in output to become the world’s largest oil producer and all the major U.S. oil companies have jumped on the shale bandwagon to boost their own production. Unlike conventional oil fields, however, shale wells decline quickly, producing most of their oil in the first few years, so fields such as the Permian Basin require constant, and costly, drilling just to keep production steady. “If there’s a downside, that’s the downside,” said Jeff Gustavson, who oversees Chevron’s Permian operations. “You’re always having to put more in.” At a site near Midland, Texas, know-how gleaned from Cimarex and other partners is helping Chevron drill a series of ultra-deep wells - named after the mythical three-headed hound Cerberus - to reach an oil-rich layer more than a mile underground. The alliances and vast land holdings Chevron can tap allow it to drill longer wells than some rivals, giving it an edge as long wells generally pump more oil and save money. Chevron said its Permian wells average nearly 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) this year, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the industry average is 8,500 feet. Next year, its wells will stretch almost 10,000 feet on average. In one formation near Midland, Chevron’s peak average production rate runs at 760 barrels per day (bpd) for each well while rivals are producing at 705 bpd, according to IHS Markit. Shale drilling combines horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing, the process of pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to crack rocks that hold oil and gas. Those wells and partnerships in the Permian, the fastest growing shale field, are critical to Chevron’s future. It missed the first phase of the shale boom early this decade but reversed course in 2014 when it drilled its first horizontal well in Permian and embarked on an investment spree to try to become the world’s largest shale oil producer. It has been shedding assets in the North Sea, Africa and Asia and expects to sell up to another $10 billion worth of properties to focus on projects including the Permian, where it has controlled some of the best and cheapest acreage since the 1920s. Those holdings helped lift Chevron’s oil and gas output to a record high in the second quarter. In the Permian, output leapt 56% from a year earlier to 421,000 bpd and Chevron’s goal is to pump 900,000 bpd from the oilfield by 2023. Chevron’s Gustavson said its long-standing relationships provide it with “all of the data, all of the cost information” from wells across the basin. “It’s a huge advantage. Huge.” For a chart of the top Permian drillers: Chevron is not the only energy company claiming a unique position in the Permian Basin. Occidental outbid Chevron for Anadarko Petroleum in a takeover battle this year, spending $38 billion and vowing to use its technology to squeeze more oil from the deal which gave it a combined 3 million Permian acres. Exxon, meanwhile, spent $6.6 billion two years ago to buy more Permian land and is now running nearly three times more rigs than Chevron in a race to reach its target of producing 1 million bpd of shale by 2024. But Chevron has two key advantages: it holds 2.2 million Permian acres, second only to the Occidental-Anadarko trove, and it owns mineral rights on much of its land so it doesn’t pay the 20%-25% production royalties most rivals face. Chevron’s Permian oil and gas output last quarter was second to Occidental’s 533,000 bpd, but rising faster. Exxon is in the top 10 with production of 274,000 bpd. For a chart of the top Permian land holders: Chevron’s mineral rights reduce its breakeven, or the oil price it needs to make a profit, while other savings come from drilling ventures. Chevron operates 20 rigs, far fewer than the 56 Exxon operated in June and Occidental-Anadarko’s 27. But Chevron estimates its partners contributed the equivalent of another seven to 10 rigs. Cimarex struck a small deal with Chevron in 2009 to drill on its land and share data, and then broadened the agreement in 2013, said Michael DeShazer, Permian manager at Cimarex. He said the two companies were able to learn faster, deploy faster and, by sharing resources, they could more easily invest in infrastructure such as pipelines, roads and electricity. Shale output drops sharply the first year and declines 80% to 90% over two to three years, but Chevron has been able to slow the decrease. In the formation near Midland, Chevron’s wells lost 52% of their output after the first 12 months compared with an average decline of 70% for rivals, according to IHS Markit. Output from Chevron’s wells in the first two years was also 40% higher. While most shale firms have spent heavily but failed to deliver the returns demanded by investors, Chevron’s “slow and steady” approach to the Permian is welcomed by investor Matrix Asset Advisors, which holds 55,000 Chevron shares. “They’ve got a game plan. They’re executing on the plan,” said Matrix President David Katz."
6.857875628128705," Analysts cut estimates for Exxon's third-quarter profit on weaker oil prices HOUSTON (Reuters) - Analysts on Wednesday trimmed their profit estimates for Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N after the largest publicly traded oil producer pointed to weaker third-quarter results in a regulatory filing due to weaker oil prices and chemicals margins. Exxon’s summary of business changes during the quarter ended Sept. 30 showed it “continues to struggle to generate strong earnings,” analysts at Mizuho Securities USA wrote in a client note. The company this year began disclosing quarter-to-quarter comparisons of prices, taxes and refining margins to deliver information on its businesses to investors soon after a quarter ends. The consensus estimate prior to Tuesday’s filing was for profit of 86 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon. But after Exxon signaled weaker oil prices and chemicals margins, several brokerage houses cut their earnings forecasts. Edward Jones lowered its per share estimate to 65 cents from 85 cents previously. Mizuho also cut its forecast to 65 cents, from $1.04 and slashed its full year projection to $2.86 a share from $3.27. Exxon earned $1.46 a share in the year-earlier third quarter. Exxon shares were down 2.6% to $67.18 in mid-day trading. “We expect the company to continue to outspend its cash flow as it invests heavily over the next few years,” said Jennifer Rowland, an equity analyst with Edward Jones. Exxon’s range of impacts indicate per-share earnings of between 54 and 67 cents, RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote. Margins in the company’s chemicals business “remain extremely weak, driven by trade-war related issues and ample supply,” said RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria. JP Morgan left its 65 cents a share estimate unchanged, but noted that the company does not provide insight into unplanned outages in its refining and chemicals units. The quarter’s outages could put “EPS closer to 60 cents at the midpoint,” it wrote. Exxon earlier this year warned analysts it was spending heavily to replace production, with major investments that include the Permian Basin shale fields in the U.S. and offshore Guyana. In the second quarter, Exxon reported a 21% drop in quarterly profit, its third period in a row of weaker year-over-year results, as sharply higher oil production was offset by weaker refining and chemicals business."
6.857875628128705," Weak oil prices hit Exxon's third-quarter earnings: filing HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N operating profits fell last quarter for the fourth consecutive period, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday that showed all three of its major businesses slumping from a year ago. Lower oil prices, weaker results in its chemical business and the lack of a tax benefit from the year-ago period combined to cut earnings to about $4 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, according to a securities filing. Exxon this year began disclosing quarterly comparisons just after the period ended to deliver more timely information on its businesses to investors. Official results are due Oct. 31. The biggest hit to profits came from weaker oil prices. Earnings in the company’s oil and gas production unit are expected to fall about 45% from last year’s $4.23 billion in operating profit, Exxon’s data showed. Its refining business had improved margins that were offset by higher logistics costs, the filing showed. That business is expected to report profits fell about 18% from last year’s $1.64 billion. Its chemicals unit earnings were projected to fall about 72% from the year ago’s $713 million. Exxon shares fell 2.4% on Tuesday to $68.95. The company had warned analysts it was spending heavily to replace production and will not reach its profit goals until next year. Last quarter the company posted a 21% drop in profit as sharply higher oil production was offset by weakness in its refining and chemicals businesses."

-0.41366274915729184," Algeria's Sonatrach says it discussed partnerships with Exxon Mobil ALGIERS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Algeria’s state-owned Sonatrach held meetings with Exxon Mobil last week to discuss possible partnerships, a Sonatrach statement said on Monday, a week after it said it had talked with Chevron Corp. Sonatrach gave no further details of the September 25 and 26 meetings but the energy producer has said it wants to boost output to increase revenues after a decline in prices hit its budget. Some 95% of Algeria’s foreign revenue comes from oil and gas sales. Since energy prices dropped in 2014, its foreign exchange reserves have fallen to $72.6 billion from $178 billion. The talks with foreign oil majors come at a sensitive time for Algeria after mass protests in February unseated veteran president Abdleaziz Bouteflika, creating a constitutional limbo that the army hopes to resolve with an election in December. Algeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a major gas supplier to Europe, has struggled to lift production to meet rising domestic demand, while foreign investors have often baulked at contract terms. Sonatrach has a deal with Britain’s BP and Norway’s Equinor to develop Algeria’s shale gas reserves, but industry sources said in March that talks with Exxon on developing a gas field had stalled. Algeria is expected to amend its energy law to encourage foreign investors but without ending a rule that maintains majority local ownership."

-1.0452537986046193," Exxon to sell Norway assets to Eni's Var Energi for $4.5 billion MILAN (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has agreed to sell its Norwegian oil and gas assets to Var Energi AS for $4.5 billion, ending its production in a country where it started operations more than a century ago. The deal includes ownership interests in more than 20 producing fields mostly operated by local producer Equinor with a combined production of about 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019. ExxonMobil, which will hang on to its refining operations and retail network in the country, said the sale was expected to close in the last quarter of this year. The transaction is part of the U.S. major’s plans to divest about $15 billion in nonstrategic assets by 2021. Reuters had exclusively reported earlier this month that Exxon had agreed to sell its Norwegian assets. In a separate statement, Var Energi, 69.6% owned by Italian major Eni SpA, said the acquisition would make it the No. 2 exploration and production company in the area with overall resources of 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Total production is expected to be around 300,000 boe per day in 2019 and will grow to more than 350,000 in 2023 as it invests some $7 billion in development projects. “The acquired assets complement and strengthen Var Energi in core areas ... and open up new opportunities for growth,” said Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi. Eni set up the unit, which is 30.4% owned by Norwegian private equity HitecVision, at the end of 2018. A source familiar with the matter said the deal meant Eni would have an equity production from operations of 220,000 boe per day, double what it had forecast a year ago. Var Energi said it would fund the deal with existing cash resources and a loan fully underwritten by BNP Paribas."

0.008109706791521752," PNG to seek more from Exxon on P'nyang deal than Total's Papua LNG TOKYO (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea will press Exxon Mobil Corp for “far better” terms on its P’nyang gas project than the government secured in a recent agreement with Total SA for its Papua LNG project, the country’s petroleum minister said. The P’nyang field will help feed an expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant. If negotiations for the project are protracted, that could delay Exxon’s $13 billion plan with Total’s Papua LNG to double the country’s liquefied natural gas exports by 2024. Talks on P’nyang were put on hold earlier this year when the government sought to revise Total’s Papua LNG agreement. That deal was finally endorsed in early September, with minor concessions from Total. Formal talks on the P’nyang project have yet to begin, with the government waiting for information from Exxon, PNG Petroleum Minister Kerenga Kua told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual LNG Producer-Consumer conference in Tokyo. Asked whether the government would seek the same terms from Exxon on the P’nyang project as it secured from Total, Kua said: “It has to be better. It has to be far better. That’s the key point.” Exxon Mobil, which is also a partner in the Papua LNG project, said it is looking forward to working with the PNG government to conclude the gas agreement for the P’nyang project ahead of decisions on design work for the addition of three new processing units, called trains, at PNG LNG. “The verification of the gas agreement for the Papua LNG project confirms the commitment of all parties to make the project a success and provide value for all stakeholders,” an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said in emailed response to Reuters when asked to comment on Kua’s remarks. The push to extract more benefits from the P’nyang project is part of a wider effort by PNG’s new government to reap more rewards from the country’s mineral and petroleum resources to lift the country out of poverty. Kua said the government would begin working with foreign investors next year to review natural resource extraction laws, which mostly stem from before PNG won independence in 1975. The country is already in the process of revising its Mining Act, and next year will look to update its petroleum legislation to match regulations in other nations that produce LNG. “In early 2020 the government will look at such changes in our regulatory set-up in close consultation with our development partners,” Kua said at the conference. “This consultation is necessary to ensure Papua New Guinea is walking forward in lock-step with its investors,” he said. “Whilst attracting FDI (foreign direct investment) in the oil and gas sector, reaping and sharing the rewards involving this valuable resource must be equitable to our development partners, investors, and the host government and its people.”"

-1.3757403135524353," Oil rises about 1% on concerns about return of Saudi output NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil ended about 1% higher on Monday after a volatile trading session as traders focused on when Saudi Arabia would be able to restore full output following the Sept. 14 attack on its facilities. Brent futures gained 49 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $64.77 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 55 cents, or 1%, to settle at $58.64. “We’ve seen futures trade on both sides of unchanged today. The market is hesitant to drive too much higher at this point until it gets more facts. But I think the bullish news outweighs the bearish news and that is why we are up at the end of the day,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Brent futures started the session at a high of $65.50 on a report in the Wall Street Journal that it could take Saudi Arabia months longer than its Aramco oil company anticipates to repair damage from the Sept. 14 attacks. The global benchmark, however, fell to a low of $63.53 after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia could restore production by early next week. A source briefed on the latest developments told Reuters that Saudi Arabia has restored more than 75% of crude output lost after attacks that knocked down 5.7 million barrels per day, or more than half of the kingdom’s oil production, and will return to full volumes by early next week. “Although it’s not a foregone conclusion that a response against Iran will occur, the uncertainly about what that may entail is keeping a level of risk premium in prices,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Analysts projected U.S. inventories will likely remain below the five-year average in coming weeks as the country boosts exports to help fill the Saudi void. Tension in the Middle East has escalated since the Saudi attack. The Pentagon has ordered additional U.S. troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defenses. Britain believes Iran was responsible for the attack and will work with the United States and European allies on a joint response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. The United States and Saudi Arabia have also blamed Iran, which denies responsibility. In a move that could cool tensions, Iran said the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero is “free to leave.” Iran seized the ship on July 19, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar."
-1.7987326412279254," Exxon Mobil, Shell among groups picked to build five Pakistan LNG terminals ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has selected groups that include Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell to build five liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals as it aims to triple imports and ease gas shortages. The terminals could be in operation within two to three years, Omar Ayub Khan, Pakistan’s minister of power and petroleum, said in an interview on Friday. Pakistan is chronically short of gas for power production and to supply manufacturers such as fertilizer makers, hobbling the country’s economy. “It will make a significant dent in the gas shortage,” Khan said. The groups selected to build terminals are Tabeer Energy, a unit of Mitsubishi Corp; Exxon and Energas; Trafigura Group and Pakistan GasPort; Shell and Engro Corp; and Gunvor Group and Fatima. It was not immediately clear if the companies involved had made final investment decisions to proceed. The five must submit plan details to the ministry of ports and shipping by Nov. 5 for approval, but cabinet has already approved them, Khan said. Pakistan’s two LNG terminals currently have 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity, and a third expected to come on line next year will add 600 million cubic feet per day, Khan said. The country has sought bids for a 10-year LNG supply tender for the current terminals and the results will be announced in two to three weeks, Khan said. It was unclear what capacity the five new terminals will have, but Khan said they could collectively triple Pakistan’s LNG import capacity. The arrests this summer of two LNG industry executives by the National Accountability Bureau raised some concerns about the risks of investing in Pakistan. But Khan said the interest of five investment groups speaks for itself. “That is a ringing endorsement that (Pakistan’s) policies are clear and transparent,” he said. “It’s a competitive market.” The cost of building the terminals and finding buyers for the gas will be up to the groups, and they will pay Pakistan a royalty based on volume, Khan said. Pakistan’s contribution will be funding construction of a $2 billion north-south pipeline to distribute the gas, and storage facilities, he said. Pakistan’s fertilizer industry has coped in the past year with a steep increase in government-set natural gas prices, Sher Shah Malik, executive director of Fertilizer Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council, said in an interview on Thursday. Gas is the main ingredient in production of urea fertilizer. Two of Pakistan’s urea plants lack gas to run regularly, and one closed last year, forcing Pakistan to import fertilizer. Since LNG is often too expensive for making fertilizer, the government should also expand domestic gas exploration before reserves are depleted, Malik said. “We are heading for very difficult times,” he said. “If nothing happens, we’ll be high and dry.”"

-2.8939527905700766," Exxon Mobil puts Australian Bass Strait oil, gas assets up for sale MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday it was looking to sell its 50% stake in the Gippsland Basin oil and gas development in Australia’s Bass Strait as part of a broader review of its global portfolio of assets. The sale could fetch up to $3 billion, however decommissioning costs for the aging fields could dent the price tag, analysts and bankers said. The Gippsland Basin joint venture, off the state of Victoria, has long been the mainstay oil and gas supplier for southeastern Australia, but output is in decline. “As a pivotal producer on the east coast...we would expect interest to be strong from domestic players that wish to gain greater exposure to rising gas prices,” said Angus Rodger, research director at consultants Wood Mackenzie. Operator Exxon’s 50-50 joint venture partner is BHP Group. The Melbourne-headquartered miner BHP declined to comment on whether it might sell its own stake or be interested in buying Exxon’s assets. “Exxon Mobil will be testing market interest for a number of assets worldwide, including its operated producing assets in Australia,” the company said in an emailed statement. “No agreements have been reached and no buyer has been identified,” it said, without disclosing any targeted value for a deal. Operations will continue as normal in the meantime, it said. The statement was released after the Gippsland Times newspaper reported company workers in Gippsland had been told by Exxon Mobil Australia Chairman Nathan Fay that the assets were on the market. Exxon said earlier this year it was looking to raise $15 billion from asset sales worldwide through 2021. BHP said in an emailed comment that it had been notified by Exxon of the latter’s plan to put its interests in the Gippsland Basin joint venture (GBJV) up for sale. “BHP recognizes the importance of GBJV to the reliable supply of gas to the east coast domestic market and we remain committed to maintaining that supply,” a BHP spokesman said in an emailed comment. BHP reported its share of output in the year to June 30 at 112 billion cubic feet of gas, 5.2 million barrels oil equivalent (mmboe) of crude oil and condensate and 5.4 mmboe of natural gas liquids. Potential bidders are likely to include other companies with assets in the Bass Strait, including Japan’s Mitsui & Co, Beach Energy and Cooper Energy, analysts and bankers said. Given the price, analysts said companies might bid in a consortium. Beach and Cooper declined to comment. Mitsui was not available for immediate comment. A purchase by Beach would be a “monster acquisition” and establish it “as a dominant east coast gas market leader”, Credit Suisse said in a note in January. Exxon’s move to sell its Gippsland Basin assets follows a disappointing drilling campaign in the Bass Strait last year in what had been seen as a promising gas prospect, and comes amid plans to drill more wells. “It’s not a major vote of confidence, because it would suggest they think the chances of adding to the reserves are fairly low,” said Graeme Bethune, chief executive of EnergyQuest, an industry consultancy. Exxon’s other producing asset in Australia is a 25% stake in the giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas project run by Chevron Corp in Western Australia, which is not part of the sale process. It sold its 50% stake in the undeveloped Scarborough gas project off Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum for up to $744 million last year."

-3.0208627893399673," Brazil sells rights in minor oil areas to Exxon, Murphy, locals RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Brazil auctioned off the exploration rights to 33 minor onshore and offshore oil and gas blocs on Tuesday, in what authorities framed as a bid to boost the industry outside of the nation’s core, offshore pre-salt play. At an event in downtown Rio de Janeiro, firms ranging from the Brazilian unit of Exxon Mobil Corp to domestic startups paid a total of 15.32 million reais ($3.74 million) for the rights to explore the areas in question. The companies also pledged a minimum level of investment in the areas, all of which either failed to receive bids in previous auctions or were returned to the state after unsuccessful exploration. The auction was the first round of what the government is calling a “permanent offer,” in which firms have the right to bid on a rotating basis for certain blocs that have been previously passed up or returned to the state. A consortium composed of Exxon (50%), Murphy Oil Corp (20%) and Enauta Participacoes SA (30% ) was the main bidder, agreeing to pay roughly 7.85 million reais for three deepwater blocs off the coast of Sergipe and Alagoas states. Eneva SA, a Brazilian energy firm, scooped up several onshore fields in the northeastern state of Maranhao for about 3.5 million reais. In a subsequent process, the government also sold the rights to 12 blocs with “marginal” proven reserves of oil or gas, mainly to small independent firms. The total signing bonuses for those blocs came to 6.98 million reais."

The deal would be a boon to Exxon’s plans to accelerate asset sales, as it seeks to raise cash to return to shareholders and fund major projects. Suppressed oil prices have weighed on the appetite of oil majors to buy such assets. There is no certainty a deal will be agreed, the sources said. The transaction would require approval from partners in the assets, who may have preferential rights to buy them, said two of the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Exxon and Repsol declined to comment. Exxon began the process to jettison Gulf of Mexico assets last year with advice from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Reuters reported last October. According to a document seen by Reuters dated Fall/Winter 2018, Exxon was marketing nine assets. These included its 50% stake in the large Julia oil field, which it operates, as well a 9.4% piece of the Heidelberg field and 23% of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are now operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp. The exact number of assets that Exxon would sell to Repsol could not be learned. The Irving, Texas-based company is trimming its portfolio to focus on promising acreage in offshore areas such as Guyana and Brazil, and onshore in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. This includes in the Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production. Exxon’s Chief Executive Darren Woods said earlier this year the company was targeting $15 billion through 2021 from asset sales, although securing divestments has been difficult at a time when many oil developers, especially in the United States, are eschewing purchases to focus on existing portfolios. However, the world’s largest publicly traded energy company said last week it was in exclusive talks with Var Energi in relation to Exxon’s Norwegian upstream assets, confirming a Reuters story that the duo were close to a $4 billion deal."
-0.820116268549431," ExxonMobil confirms exclusivity agreement with Var Energi OSLO (Reuters) - Oil major ExxonMobil said on Friday it had signed an exclusivity agreement with Var Energi for negotiations regarding a possible sale of Exxon’s Norwegian upstream assets. An acquisition of Exxon’s production assets in Norway would cement Var Energi’s position as the second largest petroleum producer in Norway after Equinor, excluding state-owned Petoro, which manages government stakes in offshore licenses. Reuters reported on Sept. 5 that Exxon had agreed to sell its stakes in around 20 partner-operated fields, two years after selling its operated assets. Exxon confirmed the exclusive talks to Reuters on Friday and said that a final sales agreement has yet to be signed. In 2018, Exxon’s net production from fields off Norway was 158,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd), data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate showed. Var Energi, almost 70% owned by Eni, produced net 169,000 boepd from five operated and 14 partner-operated fields last year, the company has said. Var, which was established last year by merging Eni’s assets in Norway with Norwegian oil firm Point Resources, has previously said it aimed to boost its net output to 250,000 boepd in the early 2020s. Exxon is also considering selling its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years, industry sources told Reuters last month. The oil major has been focusing more in recent years to growing its onshore U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian basin, as well as developing large oil discoveries in Guyana."

LONDON/ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N has agreed to sell its Norwegian oil and gas assets for up to $4 billion, ending its production in a country where it started operations more than a century ago, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. U.S. oil major Exxon said in June it was looking to sell its Norwegian upstream portfolio, which comprises minority stakes in more than 20 fields, operated by local producer Equinor EQNR.OL and Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L. Norwegian daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported after the Reuters report that the buyer was Var Energi, citing anonymous sources. The deal was due to be announced at the end of September, it added. An Exxon spokeswoman said: “As a matter of practice, we don’t comment on commercial discussions.” Var declined to comment. Shares in Exxon, the world’s biggest publicly traded oil company, rose 1.7% to a session high in New York after Reuters reported a sale had been agreed. The Irving, Texas-based company has held talks in recent weeks with a number of interested parties including Oslo-listed companies Equinor, Aker BP AKERBP.OL, and DNO DNO.OL, Stockholm-listed Lundin Petroleum LUPE.ST as well as Var Energi, backed by Italy's Eni ENI.MI, and private equity firm HitecVision, industry sources said. Equinor, Lundin and DNO were not immediately available to comment. The three sources told Reuters that Exxon had closed the sale process in recent days with one buyer after agreeing on the terms of a sale. Exxon hired investment bank Jefferies to run the sale process, banking sources told Reuters last month. Jefferies declined to comment. In 2017, Exxon’s net production from fields off Norway was around 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to its website. The sale, if approved by regulators and completed, comes after Exxon focused in recent years on growing its onshore U.S. shale production, particularly in the Permian basin, as well as developing huge oil discoveries in Guyana. Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy said in a note in June that as of Jan 1, 2019, Exxon held 530 million barrels of oil equivalent on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. “The profile is mature and declining, but nevertheless sizeable in terms of current production. A portfolio generating high cash flow and with limited tax balances, given the Norwegian fiscal regime with 90% nominal tax relief on investment, will be highly attractive for any E&P company without sufficient revenue,” Rystad analyst Simon Sjothun said. Exxon is also considering selling its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years, industry sources told Reuters last month."

U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan cited public policy and due process considerations in deciding not to enforce the October 2011 award against Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), which was subsequently set aside by courts in Nigeria. “While this court may have inherent authority to fashion appropriate relief in certain circumstances, exercising that authority to create a $1.8 billion judgment is a bridge too far,” Pauley wrote in a 50-page decision. The companies said last November that the award had grown to $2.67 billion, including interest. Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based company disagreed with the decision and was evaluating its next steps. Shell and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “NNPC is very pleased with the decision, and was always confident that there was no basis for a U.S. court to confirm the award,” its lawyer Cecilia Moss said in an interview. According to court papers, the 1993 contract anticipated that Exxon and Shell affiliates would invest billions of dollars to extract oil from the Erha field, about 60 miles (97 km) off Nigeria’s coast, and share profits with NNPC. But the affiliates, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co Ltd, accused NNPC of unilaterally “lifting” more oil than was contractually allowed, at the behest of Nigeria’s government, depriving them of billions of dollars of oil. Pauley said Exxon and Shell still have “multiple appeals pending” in Nigeria, and rejected their argument that it might be difficult to collect there. Exxon and Shell “executed a contract in Nigeria with another Nigerian corporation containing an arbitration clause requiring any arbitration to be held in Nigeria under Nigerian law, and it then sought to confirm the award in Nigeria,” Pauley wrote. “[They] cannot now reasonably complain that [their] efforts to collect will be frustrated in Nigeria.” In an Aug. 7 regulatory filing, Exxon said it did not expect the case to materially affect its operations or financial condition.

0.2711942908931871," Exxon, Chevron see consolidation in top U.S. shale field (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. oil and gas companies on Tuesday left the door open for more acquisitions in the country’s top shale field. Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N expects to see industry consolidation to happen ""over some period of time,"" in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico, Chief Executive Darren Woods told investors at a Barclays energy conference in New York. If Exxon sees an opportunity it has the balance sheet to “be in a position to transact on that,” Woods said, but he added that “time’s on our side.” Chevron Corp CVX.N also will take an ""opportunistic"" approach in the basin, said Jeff Gustavson, vice president of Chevron's Mid-Continent business, at the Barclays conference. “We’re always looking,” but Gustavson said the company is not under “any pressure to transact.” ""I think we demonstrated that earlier this year,"" Gustavson added. Chevron had struck a deal this spring to buy Anadarko Petroleum APC.N, which ultimately accepted a higher offer from Occidental Petroleum OXY.N. Chevron did not make a second bid for Anadarko and its Permian Basin holdings. Woods this year set a target of raising $15 billion by trimming Exxon’s portfolio through 2021 above the average $3.3 billion a year rate between 2013 and 2017. Sales so far have been sluggish. But Exxon could increase its planned $15 billion divestment program if “if we continue to capture more attractive opportunities,” Woods said Tuesday."

He was asked to comment on what terms Osaka Gas was seeking to change in its long-term sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with PNG LNG, in which Oil Search is a partner.

-1.169321389852765," UPDATE 1-Exxon says production shut at Hibernia oil platform after power outage (Adds details of size of spill, cause of problem) Aug 19 (Reuters) - Production is shut down at the 220,000-barrel-per-day Hibernia oil platform off the coast of eastern Canada, Hibernia’s largest shareholder ExxonMobil Corp said on Monday, after a temporary power cut led to oil and water leaking into the ocean. Exxon estimated around 14 barrels of oil leaked. It is the second spill in a month from the platform, and comes just days after Hibernia resumed production following the mid-July leak. The platform has been producing oil since 1997 and sits roughly 315 km (200 miles) east of St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Hibernia experienced a temporary loss of power on the evening of Aug. 17 that shut down the compressed air system, Exxon said in a statement. That resulted in air pressure declines that ultimately led to the platform’s drain system overflowing and releasing oil and water into the ocean. Power was restored but production remains shut down and an investigation is ongoing. Exxon said four vessels have been deployed to help clean up the spill and surveillance flights and satellite imagery are being used to spot surface oil. Wildlife observation and water sampling is underway. ExxonMobil owns the largest stake in the project, followed by Chevron Canada and Suncor Energy Inc.

-1.2204107260693007," Exclusive: After 50 years in UK North Sea, Exxon eyes the exit - sources LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N is considering a sale of its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years in the oil and gas basin as it focuses on U.S. shale production and new projects. The world’s largest publicly traded energy company has held talks with a number of North Sea operators in recent weeks to gauge interest in some or all of its assets, which could fetch up to $2 billion, according to three industry sources with knowledge of the matter. Exxon declined to comment. Leaving the British North Sea would mark a major retreat from Europe for Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon, which has already put its Norwegian offshore assets on the block. It would follow similar moves by U.S. rivals Chevron and ConocoPhillips which earlier this year sold the bulk of their North Sea operations. Most of Exxon's operations are managed through a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, known as Esso Exploration and Production UK, and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields. Shell declined to comment. Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, according to its website. Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor or Neptune which have acquired portfolios from veteran producers in recent years. Assigning a value to oil and gas assets in the North Sea is complicated because many fields and infrastructure are nearing the end of their lives and require dismantling, or decommissioning, an expensive process which can offset years of production revenue. Neivan Boroujerdi, North Sea analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said an Exxon exit was expected, valuing it at around $2 billion. “Combined with its Norwegian assets, which ExxonMobil recently announced its intention to market, could see the supermajor reach one-third of the way to meeting its $15 billion divestment target,” Boroujerdi said. Exxon’s UK business “is attractive. It is highly cash generative, with operating costs around half of the UK average.” The North Sea has seen a revival in production in recent years due to new fields coming on line and improved performance by operators following the 2014 oil price collapse. Still, the basin’s production is expected to decline over the next decade, according to the UK Oil and Gas Authority. Should the direct discussions with potential buyers not yield a result, Exxon will consider appointing an external bank to run a formal sale process, two of the sources added. It was unclear if a sale of assets would require breaking up the Esso joint venture. Esso has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976, including from the Brent field, which is eponymous with the global crude benchmark and is now being decommissioned. Exxon’s operational focal point in recent years has turned to the United States, where it is rapidly ramping up oil production in the Permian Basin, as well as in Guyana, where it is developing huge, untapped fields."

An agreement with Britain’s BP and Italy’s Eni was not part of the $53 billion, 30-year mega-project. It covered the building of two seabed oil pipelines for exports through the Gulf, the ministry said. Reuters on Thursday cited five senior Iraqi oil officials as saying that Iraq was close to reaching a deal with BP and Eni for an export pipeline project that was initially planned as part of the mega-deal with ExxonMobil. “The ministry affirms that its negotiations with U.S. company ExxonMobil are ongoing,” the ministry said in a statement. “...Not reaching an agreement or signing a deal between both parties does not mean the end of negotiations or the ‘exclusion’ of ExxonMobil from the project as reported by news agencies citing officials they did not name.” The deal with Eni and BP was limited to the two seabed oil pipelines, it said. Large strategic projects required more time to research, negotiate, and study, it added. The southern mega-deal involves several projects including developing oil fields, expanding storage, transport, and export infrastructure, and building byproduct gas treatment units."

Exxon said in June that it was looking to test market interest for its Norwegian upstream portfolio, which includes minority stakes in more than 20 other fields, operated by local producer Equinor and Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell. The bank has now instructed Jefferies to help with the process, three sources said, to accelerate its exit from the northern European country where it has been operating for more than 125 years. Interested parties are expected to receive a presentation of the available assets later in August, one of the sources said. Exxon and Jefferies declined to comment. A number of private equity-backed firms, including Okea, and independent oil companies Aker BP and DNO, have said they were looking to buy more assets on the Norwegian continental shelf. Var Energi, jointly owned by Italy’s Eni and Norwegian private equity fund HitecVision, is likely to show an interest, having previously bought Norwegian assets from Exxon in 2017, a second source said. The North Sea offshore basin, which started production in the 1970s, has undergone a broad change of guard in recent years as veteran producers have been replaced by smaller players that say they can squeeze more oil and gas from the fields. U.S. major Chevron transferred its last stake in a Norwegian offshore license last year, while ConocoPhillips still operates Ekofisk, the first big oil discovery off Norway. In 2017 Exxon Mobil’s net production from fields off Norway was about 168,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its total net reserves in the producing fields stood at 422 million barrels of oil equivalent by the end of 2018."
-1.790413493906031," Exxon Mobil profit sinks, Chevron rises as both boost output HOUSTON (Reuters) - Weaker second-quarter refining and chemicals profits offset surging U.S. shale production at U.S. oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.N, the two reported on Friday. Exxon’s topped analysts’ reduced estimates for the quarter but net fell 21% from a year earlier, its third quarter in a row of weaker year-over-year profit, despite a near doubling in Permian shale oil output. Chevron earnings rose 26%, in line with forecasts, as it benefited from a one-time, $1-billion breakup fee from Anadarko Petroleum APC.N, which accepted a higher bid from Occidental Petroleum OXY.N after agreeing to sell itself to Chevron. Shares of both companies fell on Friday with Exxon off 1% at $71.75 a share and Chevron down a penny at $120.73 as the market fell on U.S.-China trade concerns. Exxon's weaker earnings mirrored those at rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Total SA TOTF.PA, and both U.S. companies said natural gas prices and chemical margins fell from a year-earlier. Shell’s profit was its smallest in 30 months, due to weaker chemicals, refining and tumbling natural gas prices. Total also cited weaker natural gas and refining operations for earnings that fell 19% from a year ago. Exxon’s net income fell to $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $3.95 billion, or 92 cents per share, last year. Analysts had slashed their estimates last month after the company disclosed weaker results in natural gas, chemicals and refining. “Pretty weak quarter from them once again,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. After spending on major projects and dividends, Exxon had a free cash flow shortfall of $2.7 billion, she said. Investors closely watch that measure as a sign of the company’s financial health. Exxon’s chemicals business fell to a loss in the United States for the first time in at least three years and earnings have declined for five quarters in a row. It collected lower profits from refining due to higher costs and lost production at several plants. The largest U.S. oil producer by volume has been investing in major projects to boost production at a time when investors have been pressing oil companies to cut spending and increase returns to shareholders. In a call with analysts, Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said despite weak market conditions in three of the company’s businesses, “on the whole, our businesses performance extremely well.” He pointed to the company’s 90% year-over-year in Permian production and a 7% overall increase in its oil and gas production. Exxon remains on track to increase its drilling in the top U.S. shale field and had its “eyes wide open” for potential acquisitions there, Chapman said. It remains committed to selling about $15 billion in assets through 2021, although proceeds this year have totaled $140 million, down from $1.75 billion a year earlier. Chevron’s Permian Basin production rose 50% from the same period a year ago and is overall output hit 3.08 million barrels per day, up 9% from a year ago and a record level. Chevron does not “need to do a deal” in the Permian, said Pierre Breber, chief financial officer, who noted that the company has moved in the past when it saw an opportunity."
-1.790413493906031," Exxon Mobil profit sinks on weakness in chemicals, refining HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Friday reported a 21% drop in quarterly profit, its third period in a row of weaker year-over-year results, as sharply higher oil production was offset by weaker refining and chemicals business. Shares slipped 1.6 percent to $71.34 in early trading even though its 73 cents a share profit topped analysts' recently-lowered estimates. Analysts had reduced estimates to 66 cents per share after Exxon last month guided to lower year-over-year profit. Exxon’s weaker earnings mirrored those at rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, Equinor EQNR.OL and Total SA TOTF.PA. Shell posted its smallest profit in 30 months on weaker margins in chemicals, a loss in refining and tumbling natural gas prices. Total also cited weaker natural gas and refining operations for earnings that fell 19% from a year ago, while Equinor’s profit fell 27% on weaker oil and gas prices. A bright spot for Exxon was oil and gas production rising 7% to 3.9 million barrels per day. Output in the top U.S. shale field, the Permian Basin, rose to 274,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 90% from a year ago. “Three of our businesses were at lows in their cycles,” said Neil Chapman, an Exxon senior vice president, adding the company historically invests during downturns for long-term returns. The largest U.S. oil producer’s net income fell to $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $3.95 billion, or 92 cents per share, last year. “Pretty weak quarter from them once again,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. After capital spending and dividends, Exxon had a free cash flow shortfall of $2.7 billion, similar to last quarter, Rowland added. Exxon has made “limited progress on asset sales,” though, analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said in a note to clients. Exxon’s Chapman said the company remains committed to selling $15 billion worth of assets through 2021. The sales are needed to finance shareholder returns and major projects, but Exxon reported just $33 million in asset sales for the period, the lowest in at least 12 quarters. That follows proceeds from sales of $107 million in the first quarter. Exxon’s chemicals business fell to a loss in the United States for the first time in at least three years. Lower margins and downtime drove refining profits down 88 percent over last year. Exxon had been investing in major projects to boost production at a time when investors have been pressing oil companies to cut back on spending and increase returns to shareholders. The company said it has its best portfolio since the merger of Exxon and Mobil and does not “have to do anything” in terms of adding assets, Chapman said. But in the Permian Basin, where the company holds 1.6 million acres and plans to use its size and scale as a competitive advantage, Chapman said it remains, “eyes wide open” about mergers and acquisitions. Exxon boosted its estimated recoverable reserves in its offshore Guyana project to more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, from 5.5 billion barrels."
-1.790413493906031," Exxon's U.S. refineries suffer greater outages in second quarter over year ago, data shows HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N's U.S. second-quarter refining profits bounced back from a loss earlier this year but remain below past levels in part because of a wave of production outages, according to an examination of data from Reuters and energy industry intelligence service Genscape. On Friday, the company reported its U.S. refining and marketing business earned $310 million last quarter, less than half the $695 million in the same period in 2018. Its overall downstream profit fell to $451 million versus $724 million in 2018. Outages at three refineries, including Exxon’s Baytown, Texas, plant reduced overall profits by $150 million in the June quarter, the company said. Baytown resumed normal operations but two others - in Canada and in Saudi Arabia - are expected to remain at reduced levels through year-end, officials said. The production losses “are not systemic to our overall performance,” Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said in a conference call, describing the three outages as isolated. Exxon has forecast higher than usual maintenance at its refineries this year as it prepares for a shipping industry shift to low sulfur fuels. In April, it said second quarter planned downtime would be similar to the first. A fire this week that struck a plastics unit at its Baytown chemical plant also temporarily reduced production at the adjacent refinery, said people familiar with the matter. During the second quarter of this year, the company’s U.S. crude distillation unit (CDU) outages cost it 16.4 million barrels of lost production, compared to 9.65 million barrels in the second quarter of 2018, according to Reuters calculations. The totals reflect the capacity of each shut unit and the number of lost production days. CDUs do the initial breakdown of crude oil coming into a refinery, providing feedstocks for all other units in the refinery and producing unfinished motor fuels. During the second quarter of this year the 238,000 bpd CDU at Exxon’s Joliet, Illinois, refinery was shut for nearly two months as part of extensive multi-unit overhaul. That outage accounted for about three-quarters of Exxon’s lost CDU production last quarter. The next largest amount of lost production was at the Baytown refinery when another CDU was shut for eight days in June because of heavy rainfall. That same plant a year earlier undertook a 47-day overhaul of another CDU that hurt output."

-1.790413493906031," Texas county sues Exxon over air pollution from petrochemical fire: official HOUSTON (Reuters) - Harris County, Texas sued Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday over pollution from a fire a day earlier at the company’s Baytown Olefins Plant, according to an attorney for the county. The fire was being investigated by federal and state agencies. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) were at the scene to determine the cause of a blaze that raged for hours and raised a column of black smoke over the area. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which is authorized to probe industrial chemical accidents, will not investigate the Baytown Olefins Plant fire, said spokeswoman Hillary Cohen in a statement. The suit by Harris County, which includes Baytown, is the second lawsuit this year against the company involving fires at the plant. The suit seeks court orders to prevent future fires at the Baytown plant, said Rock Owens, managing attorney for the environmental practice in the Harris County Attorney’s Office. “It’s disappointing to me for a company to have these kinds of problems with the potential for some kind of disaster,” he said. He said Harris County also is also asking the state court to order an investigation to determine the root cause of the fire in a propylene recovery unit. The county is seeking similar orders in connection with a lawsuit filed in March over a hydrotreater fire in the Baytown refinery. Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the company is reviewing the lawsuit. Exxon’s giant Baytown refining and petrochemical complex accounts for about 9% of total U.S. polypropylene, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Polypropylene is a component in plastics. In a statement on Thursday, Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said the fire has been extinguished and all employees affected by the fire were cleared to return to work. The company has not said what triggered the blaze. Because of the fire, production at Exxon’s 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown refinery remains cut back, the company confirmed. It did not say by how much production was affected. Jason Duncan, manager of the Baytown Olefins Plant, said on Wednesday afternoon that 37 workers were treated for minor injuries including burns. Later, Exxon said a total of 66 workers had been examined at a clinic for possible injuries but not all were treated. Officials ordered Baytown residents to remain indoors on Wednesday with their air conditioning turned off for about four hours after an explosion set off the fire."
-2.7527030671064265," Fire under control at Exxon petrochemical plant; some workers suffer minor burns BAYTOWN, Texas (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp brought under control a fire that erupted on Wednesday at its Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex, injuring 37 workers, none seriously. Emergency crews worked to extinguish the fire into the evening, the company said in a statement. The cause of the blaze was not disclosed, but an investigation was under way and Exxon said it was cooperating with authorities. The injured workers were treated for minor burns, none requiring hospitalization, plant manager Jason Duncan told a news briefing. The fire, which was put down by the company’s employees, sent black smoke into the air over the complex in Baytown, a city of 75,000 which is located about 30 miles (48 km) east of Houston. Firefighters and equipment from the city entered the plant at midday to assist, an official said. Firefighters continued to spray water on a charred column where the fire began late Wednesday. Residents around the plant were told to close windows and doors, turn off air conditioning and remain in their homes, schools or offices. A shelter in place order was lifted after several hours. “We are cooperating with regulatory agencies. We deeply regret any disruption or inconvenience that this incident may have caused the community,” Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said in a statement. Available air monitoring information from the inside the Baytown Olefins Plant’s grounds and outside monitoring sources recorded no adverse impacts, she said. The fire burned residual fuel contained in a large column on Wednesday. The Baytown complex that includes the olefins plant where the fire occurred employs about 7,000 people among four manufacturing sites that cover 3,400 acres (13.8 square kilometers). It sits along the Houston Ship Channel, the nation’s largest and busiest energy port. Duncan declined to comment on the fire’s impact on production at Exxon’s adjacent 560,500 barrels-per-day oil refinery. Two people familiar with its operations said Exxon reduced some production at the refinery, which provides feedstocks to the unit that caught fire. Aerial footage during the blaze showed flames and heavy smoke emanating from a large column at the facility, which Exxon identified as part of its production of olefins, a component of plastic. Emergency vehicles and people were massing around the edge of the complex. The company said a total of 66 staff and contract workers were examined and released during the day at a nearby health clinic which provides first aid. Exxon last year completed the construction of a multi-billion-dollar ethane cracker at the Baytown Olefins Plant. The cracker can produce 1.5 million tons per year, and provides feedstock to two other production lines at its Mont Belvieu, Texas, plastics plant."

-8.00139903757748," Oil firm DNO looking at Exxon Mobil's Norwegian assets OSLO (Reuters) - Oil firm DNO DNO.OL is casting an eye over Exxon Mobil's XOM.N Norwegian assets as it looks for more deals after buying London-based peer Faroe earlier this year, its executive chairman said on Wednesday. Exxon Mobil said in June it was seeking bids for its stakes in fields run by other operators on the Norwegian continental shelf, including Equinor's EQNR.OL Snorre oilfield and the Shell-operated RDSa.L Ormen Lange gas field. “After the Faroe acquisition we are looking at more to do. There are assets available in Norway and the UK. We expect to remain active in these markets,” DNO’s Executive Chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani told a quarterly result presentation. He told Reuters later that the company was also looking at the assets Exxon Mobil is seeking to sell. “We are looking because that gives us market information, and maybe opportunities (to buy),” he said. DNO completed its $780 million purchase of Faroe Petroleum in March 2019, and said it had a $574 million cash balance at the end of the second quarter. It said it would focus on buying assets which are already producing or under development as it seeks to increase its North Sea output to 50,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd) in 2021 from around 14,692 boepd in the second quarter. “It’s an ambitious target, but it’s doable. It could be a combination of organic and non-organic growth,” Mossavar-Rahmani told analysts. DNO’s combined Company Working Interest production in the North Sea and the Kurdistan region of Iraq stood at 103,900 boepd in the second quarter, up from 74,470 boepd the same period a year ago. Shares of the Middle East and North Sea-focused company rose by more than 5% on Wednesday after it reported a rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to $177 million in the second quarter from $105 million in the same period a year ago. Analysts at brokers DNB Markets and Pareto Securities said the result beat their forecasts, partly due to lower than expected exploration expenses. DNO repeated its 2019 capital spending guidance of $375 million, and reiterated that spending including exploration would amount to $440 million. Its shares were trading up 3.3% at 1032 GMT, outperforming the wider European oil and gas index .SXEP, which was up 0.3%."
-9.008593328317627," Exxon Mobil's second-quarter results expected to sag, spotlighting need for asset sales HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N plan to accelerate asset sales, a way of delivering needed cash to finance shareholder returns and major projects, is getting off to a slow start as oil companies pull back on big deals. On Friday, the largest U.S. oil company is expected to report a 79-cents-a-share profit, down from 92 cents a year earlier, according to data provider Refinitiv. With little cash from asset sales and a third straight quarter of weaker year-over-year earnings, Exxon cannot resume share buybacks sought by investors this year, said analysts. Chief Executive Darren Woods this year set a target of raising $15 billion by trimming its portfolio through 2021, above the average $3.3 billion a year rate between 2017 and 2013. The sales could include more oil-producing properties, compared with prior deals mostly in refining and marketing, he said. But those goals are proving difficult. In its first quarter, proceeds from sales were just $107 million, the lowest in at least 11 quarters, and analysts expect the second quarter to come in at a similar level. Exxon last quarter agreed to sell a U.S. Gulf of Mexico property for $200 million. “There’s not enough cash flow for buybacks, which is what people want to see,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones, who has a “hold” rating on Exxon. Exxon may have to use debt to help fund its shareholder dividend, she said. A package of offshore Gulf of Mexico oilfields that Exxon put on the market last autumn has languished, said analysts. More recently, the company has begun to market offshore properties in Nigeria and Norway, according to analysts and people familiar with the matter. Any one could raise several billion dollars in a sale, the people said. Stephen Greenlee, who oversees divestitures as president of Exxon’s Upstream Business Development group, was not available to address the asset sales, an Exxon spokesman said. Exxon shares are rated a ""buy"" by just 23% of analysts, below BP PLC's BP.L at 71%, Chevron Corp's CVX.N 74%, Royal Dutch Shell's RDSa.L 80% and Total SA's TOTF.PA 89%, according to Refinitiv. “The market is not ready to pay what Exxon thinks these assets are worth,” William Turner, a vice president at researcher Welligence, said of the offshore U.S. properties. “A lot of the recent transactions in the Gulf of Mexico have been going at discounted valuations.” Exxon’s pitches are not the only going unanswered, said a U.S. merger and acquisition advisor who requested anonymity speaking about M&A matters. “There has been less activity. I’m not sure if it is the bid/ask or something else; but they just aren’t there,” the person said. There is no doubt Exxon’s cash could use a boost. Analysts slashed earnings forecasts to 79 cents a share from 97 cents after the company disclosed operating unit expectations this month. ""We expect another large funding gap this quarter,” wrote Cowen COWN.O analyst Jason Gabelman, who estimated Exxon's organic free cash flow this quarter will not cover the $3.7 billion needed for dividends. The two areas expected to show improved margins during the period, crude sales and refining, were offset by weaker natural gas prices and higher maintenance costs. The result was “another disappointing quarter,” wrote Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a client note. Exxon has been investing to boost production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, and in offshore Guyana. Exxon “is always countercyclical” and “has to be viewed in the long term,” said John Groton, director of equity research at Thrivent Asset Management, which holds Exxon shares. Exxon’s shares are up less than 1% over the last 10 years."

-9.961709651642863," Nigeria's NNPC says it paid debts owed to Mobil Producing Nigeria LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian state oil company NNPC on Wednesday said it had fully settled its debts to ExxonMobil’s local subsidiary with a payment of $833.57 million. NNPC said the money to Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) settled long-standing debts owed via “cash calls,” or costs that it is obligated to pay to joint-venture partners in oil and gas exploration and production. As of late last year, NNPC said it still had to make up payments of $3.95 billion to oil companies as part of the cash call debt. The outgoing head of NNPC, Maikanti Baru, said the debt had been paid with incremental production, and “would invariably lead to an increase in revenue to the government.” In June, ratings agency Fitch said the cash call backlog clearance was constraining Nigeria’s budget receipts from oil and gas extraction. The debts to Mobil and other producers have also curtailed investments in the sector.

-8.82013804306116," Exxon quarterly profit to feel pinch of weaker natural gas, chemical earnings (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Monday lower natural gas and chemical margins in its second quarter would offset improved crude and refining operations, pointing to flat profits sequentially and down from a year-earlier. The U.S. oil major said in a securities filing bit.ly/2RL5hMp it expected improved crude prices to boost second-quarter profit by $400 million to $600 million. However, natural gas NGc1 prices which have dropped to multi-year lows in the face of tepid demand, were expected to offset it by an equal measure. RBC Capital Markets analysts in a note said the magnitude of weakness across refining, chemicals and natural gas and the lack of sequential improvement, “leaves us heading into another disappointing quarter for Exxon’s earnings momentum.” Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones, expects second-quarter upstream earnings to be weaker compared with a year ago. She lowered the brokerage’s profit estimates to 88 cents per share from 95 cents previously. That is below Wall Street’s mean estimates of 97 cents and the year-ago quarter’s 92 cents a share. “We have to be more patient with their turnaround plan,” said Rowland. Exxon said weaker margins in its chemical business is expected to reduce second-quarter profit by $100 million to $300 million over the first quarter. It also estimated a potential gain of $200 million over the first quarter from a lack of impairment charges. The company is scheduled to release its results on July 26. Rowland expects refining and marketing to return to profitability due to higher margins while chemicals should continue to post weaker results given lower margins and scheduled maintenance. In April, the company reported first-quarter profit that slumped 49% to $2.4 billion and missed analysts’ estimates due to a weakness across its major businesses. Exxon shares, which have risen about 12% this year to Friday's close, ended the day off 7 cents a share at $76.56 compared with a 0.1% rise in the S&P 500 Energy index .SPNY as a result of oil prices that steadied as OPEC extended supply cuts until March 2020 during a meeting in Vienna."

Shell and Exxon Mobil had a joint venture on five offshore blocks in Somalia prior to the toppling of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in the early 1990s. The country has experienced instability since Barre left and is battling al Shabaab, an Islamist group that frequently carries out bombings in the capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere in the country. The exploration and development of the five offshore blocks was suspended in 1990 under what is known as a “force majeure”, but Shell and Exxon have accrued rentals to the government since then, Shell said in a statement. Exxon declined to comment and referred inquiries to Shell. The country currently does not produce any oil but production could transform the economy as early stage seismic data has shown there could be significant oil reserves offshore. “(An) agreement was signed in Amsterdam on June 21st 2019 and settles issues relating to surface rentals and other incurred obligations on offshore blocks,” the ministry said. The force majeure remains in place, regardless of the recent development, Shell added. The parties have also agreed to hold talks to convert their old contracts in line with a new petroleum bill that was passed earlier this year. Somalia hopes to allocate 15 offshore blocks with a potential bid date schedule for November. A road show is being organized in Houston, Texas in late September or early October.

Treasurer Sam Basil said the country also needs better forecasts from Exxon and Total on the expected income flow from a $13 billion plan to double the country’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Basil was appointed earlier this month by Prime Minister James Marape, who led a revolt against former prime minister Peter O’Neill in May. France’s Total is leading the Papua LNG project, which will develop the Elk-Antelope gas fields to feed two new LNG production units to be sited at the PNG LNG plant, run by Exxon. At the same time, Exxon and its partners plan to add a third new unit at PNG LNG, which will partly be fed by another new field, P’nyang. Total recently reached an agreement with the government setting terms for its Papua LNG project, while Exxon is in the process of negotiating a separate agreement with the government for P’nyang. Treasurer Basil said the projects should all be treated as one, rather than “under the cloak of separate joint ventures”. “I am putting each of the project partners in all of these projects on notice that the concerns of our people must be addressed through dialogue and negotiations with the state and that we expect all parties to contribute to a fair and equitable outcome,” he said. Exxon’s original $19 billion PNG LNG project is the biggest foreign investment in the country and crucial to the economy, but the plant has been a disappointing contributor since it started exporting LNG in 2014. Last year’s earthquake which forced a shutdown of PNG LNG dented the government’s take from the project more than Exxon had expected it would. The 2019 budget had assumed that oil and gas sector revenue would fall by 9.4 pct from 2018, but it actually fell by 16.4 percent, Basil said. He plans to ask the Treasury and Exxon to come up with new detailed forecasts of future cash flows from the project to the national and provincial governments and local landowners. He also said the government would put on hold talks with the owners of the Wafi Golpu gold project, Newcrest and South Africa’s Harmony Gold, until the state negotiating team has talked to the Morobe provincial government about its aspirations for the project. “Our future prosperity depends on delivering these projects and delivering them well. But we must now find a way to ensure that these major resource project agreements capture enough value to the state and to our people,” he said. Exxon and Total were not immediately available to comment. Newcrest had no immediate comment. (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Tom Hogue)"
-5.287586549771214," Linde plans $1.4 billion Singapore expansion, signs Exxon supply deal SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Industrial gases group Linde said on Tuesday it will spend $1.4 billion to boost its Singapore gasification facilities to support the planned expansion of Exxon Mobil Corp’s nearby integrated refining complex. The investment will enable Linde’s facility on Jurong Island to supply additional hydrogen and synthesis gas to Exxon’s Singapore refinery, the company said in a statement. Exxon’s expansion project, which is expected to come online in 2023, would convert fuel oil and other residual crude products into higher-value lube base stocks and distillates to help meet stricter emissions rules. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is introducing new rules on marine fuels from 2020, limiting the sulphur content to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent, to curb pollution from ships. Linde’s project will include building and operating four additional gasifiers, a 1,200 metric tonne per day air separation plant and downstream gas processing units and sulphur recovery plants, the company said. When completed, Linde will also be able to supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and synthesis gas to other customers on Jurong Island, it said. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2019, with start-up due in 2023. Linde Plc was created from the merger of Linde AG and rival Praxair."

Two years ago the U.S. major - the world’s largest oil company - sold its operated assets in the area. But it has retained stakes in more than 20 other fields, including Equinor-operated Snorre and Shell-operated Ormen Lange. “Following interest expressed by several parties, Exxon Mobil has decided to open a data room to test the market interest for the upstream portfolio in Norway,” Anne Fougner said, adding that no decision to sell had yet been made. A number of private-equity backed firms, including Okea, and independent oil firms Aker BP and DNO, have this year said they were looking to buy more assets on the Norwegian continental shelf. Fougner’s remarks confirmed a report in local newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv. She declined to comment on the value of the assets, which the business daily quoted an unnamed industry expert as saying could be worth $3-4 billion. In 2017, Exxon Mobil’s net production from fields off Norway was around 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to its website. Erik Haugane, Okea’s chief executive, told Reuters this week he expected all oil majors except Norway’s Equinor to exit the Norwegian continental shelf in a decade. Another Norwegian oil firm, Det norske - controlled by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke - bought BP’s Norwegian assets in 2016, with BP getting a 30% stake in the new company, Aker BP. U.S. major Chevron transferred its last stake in a Norwegian offshore license last year, while ConocoPhillips still operates Ekofisk, the first major oil discovery off Norway."

LGIM said meeting the 2015 Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would mean cutting fossil fuel use by a third by 2040. Some institutional investors have pressed Exxon to define a path toward meeting the Paris agreement, but the company has not committed to any such targets. Exxon said it was committed to improving efficiency and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in its operations and that it discloses its so-called scope one and scope two emissions. Scope one encompasses direct emissions from a company’s operations which it can control, while scope two relates to indirect emissions from the electricity used by a company. “We’re also providing solutions to consumers to help them reduce their emissions and are developing next-generation lower-emissions solutions, like carbon capture and storage and advanced biofuels,” spokesman Scott Silvestri said. “We’re on track to meet greenhouse gas reduction measures we announced last year, which are expected to help significantly to improve emissions performance. They include a 15% decrease in methane emissions and a 25% reduction in flaring by 2020.” Last month, shareholders defeated measures calling for a special board committee on climate change and for a report on the climate risks. LGIM said Exxon lagged behind European peers such as Equinor, BP and Shell which better disclose their company’s potential climate risks. Hormel Foods, Korea Electric Power, U.S. retailer Kroger and U.S. insurance company Metlife also failed to meet LGIM’s criteria on climate-related risk disclosure, it said."

-1.5222374940958396," Exxon Mobil, SABIC to start construction of $9 bln petrochemical plant in Texas June 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Saudi Basic Industries Corp said on Thursday they would start construction of a $9 billion petrochemical plant in Texas in the third quarter that would have the world’s largest ethane processing capacity. The 50/50 joint venture, called Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, will have the ability to produce 1.8 million metric tons a year, and will house a monoethylene glycol unit and two polyethylene units, the companies said. The project, located north of Corpus Christi, is expected to be operational by 2022. Building the world’s largest steam cracker on the doorstep of rapidly growing Permian production gives this project significant scale and feedstock advantages, Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said. Oil producers and refiners see petrochemicals as a growing market for their crude as demand for motor fuels is expected to plateau with the advent of electric cars and more efficient homes and offices. The project is expected to create more than 600 permanent jobs, the companies said, adding that the facility will produce materials used in the manufacturing of various consumer products such as automotive coolants, packaging and construction materials. Construction of the project will be led primarily by Wood Group, McDermott & Turner Industries Group, Chiyoda & Kiewit, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Zachry Group, according to the statement.

The project will include 90 wells, a central production facility and export infrastructure connected to a pipeline and refineries, the company said. Exxon began a pilot project in the 99,000-acre Bajo del Choique-La Invernada block, located about 114 miles northwest of Neuquén city, in 2016 after successful results from an initial exploration. The company’s development in Argentina has been slow due to several reasons, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government controls on natural gas prices. However, the country last month awarded permits for hydrocarbon exploration in 18 areas off its southern coast to companies, including Exxon, to boost its reserves, which fell in the last decade due to regulations that discouraged foreign investment in the energy sector. If the expansion is successful, Exxon said it could invest in a second phase in the block, which would produce up to 75,000 boepd. ExxonMobil Exploration Argentina operates the block and holds a 90 percent interest, while Gas y Petróleo del Neuquén holds the rest."

-3.3616750069204677," Oil Search CEO says new PNG leader unlikely to demand big concessions on gas deals SYDNEY (Reuters) - The head of Papua New Guinea-focused energy firm Oil Search Ltd said he did not expect to make any significant new concessions on a gas deal it and ExxonMobil Corp hope to strike with the South Pacific nation’s new leader. Commodity and energy firms with projects in the resource-rich archipelago like Oil Search have been closely watching the agenda of Prime Minister James Marape since his election by parliament last week on a platform of economic reform. A policy speech Marape made on Wednesday offered investors some relief as he said changes would be slow. Oil Search managing director Peter Botten told the Sydney Mining Club at a lunchtime address that the P’nyang gas agreement, which has yet to be finalised, would resemble a deal already brokered on the Papua LNG project led by Total. “I don’t envisage there will be any changes to the Papua LNG gas agreement,” Botten said, meaning the P’nyang agreement would be unlikely to see major change either. “I am confident about that (but) I’m not 100-percent confident because I need to sit down with the government, as does Total as operator.” Oil Search has previously said it hopes to agree terms for P’nyang this month. Marape, a former finance minister, has promised he would be “taking back” the economy and revising resource-sector laws after the resignation of his predecessor, Peter O’Neill. Marape said on Wednesday that he wanted to increase the amount of revenue flowing from resource projects, after years of underwhelming returns most notably from the gargantuan PNG LNG project, run by Exxon in partnership with Oil Search and others. But changes would be gradual, Marape said, and unlikely to take effect before 2025. Papua LNG, operated by Total, plans to develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields to feed two new liquefied natural gas processing units, called trains, at the PNG LNG plant. Oil Search and Exxon also plan to add a third new train at the plant, partly fed by gas from the P’nyang field."

-3.666152357524144," ExxonMobil backs LNG imports to world's biggest exporter BRISBANE (Reuters) - Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Australia - the world’s biggest LNG exporter - now appear “highly realistic” as the country struggles to fill a looming gas shortage, U.S. energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday. The assessment will add to the sense of urgency in the industry, which experts say needs at least A$10 billion ($6.9 billion) in new developments to meet longer term gas demand and bring down high prices that are crippling many manufacturers. As recently as a year ago, many thought importing LNG to Australia would be irrational, but shortages are expected as soon as 2022 and there are now five import proposals on the table, including one from ExxonMobil. “Just given the nature of growth in demand and where the outlook for supply is, at least for a period LNG import terminals look highly realistic,” Exxon Mobil’s new chairman for Australia, Nathan Fay, told an industry conference. Exxon Mobil and its partner BHP Group are the dominant suppliers into the southeastern gas market, and imports would be complementary to further development of offshore fields in the Gippsland Basin, Fay said. The start-up of three LNG export plants in northeastern Australia has sapped gas from the local market and also led to higher prices, as most of the new supply is from higher cost coal seam gas wells. At the same time, drilling bans in the southeastern states of Victoria and New South Wales have curbed new supply to fill a gap as the offshore fields that meet about 40 percent of the southern states’ needs are drying up. If supply doesn’t improve and prices fail to come down, manufacturers dependent on gas will shut, Australian competition regulator warned on Thursday in its latest report on the east coast gas market. The latest casualty of the gas crunch was an ageing chemicals plant in Melbourne, which a unit of Dow Inc said this week it would be shutting, partly due to high gas prices. That followed the closure of a maker of polystyrene coffee cups in Sydney and a brick and clay paver maker in Queensland, both of which partly blamed high gas prices, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. Gas prices to manufacturers are now around A$9 to A$11 per gigajoule (GJ), or half the price they were two years ago after the government pushed east coast exporters to release more gas for domestic purposes, but prices are still more than triple the level manufacturers paid five years ago. “I think at A$7 gas many of the manufacturing plants can survive. The problem is if they don’t get that soon, they just won’t be here,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims told reporters at the conference. However, analysts said imported LNG was unlikely to be this cheap given the distance it has to travel, with new local supplies needed to bring certainty of supply and potentially cheaper prices. “We are going to have a shortfall from 2021, and new infrastructure in some form is going to be needed to service that,” said Nicholas Mumford, managing director of Mumford Commercial Consulting."
-3.666152357524144," Exxon shareholders reject resolutions on climate and splitting CEO, chairman roles DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp shareholders on Wednesday rejected a proposal to split the chief executive officer and board chairman roles that some had promoted to protest a decision to strike an unrelated climate change resolution from the ballot. Two institutional shareholders had urged a vote in favor of the role split after Exxon got the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to strike a climate change measure from its ballot. The protest fizzled, with about 41% of the votes supporting the separation at the company’s annual meeting, little more than the more than the 38% approval votes that similar resolutions garnered in recent years. Shareholders also defeated measures calling for a special board committee on climate change and for a report on the risks of climate change to Exxon’s U.S. Gulf Coast chemical plants. At Chevron Corp’s annual meeting on Wednesday, a proposal to create an independent chairman received just 26% of votes, and only 8% of votes favored a board committee on climate change. In contrast, 99% of shareholders at BP Plc last week favored a resolution calling for the British oil company to meet a climate accord seeking to curb a rise in global temperatures. Royal Dutch Shell last year agreed to set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and link them to executive pay. New York state’s pension fund and the Church Commissioners for England, the endowment fund of the Church of England, had backed the independent chairman’s proposal at Exxon after their resolution seeking emissions goals was struck from the ballot. The 41% approval for the independent board chair proposal was the largest in the last seven times such a proposal has been considered. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement that “Exxon would ignore this level of support for an independent board chair at its own risk.” Exxon has been in “open conflict about climate strategy and disclosure” with its investors, said Edward Mason, who represented the Church of England and presented two climate resolutions that failed to gain majority support. Shareholders in recent years have pressed Exxon to define a path toward meeting the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming, but the company has not committed to any targets. “Engagement on climate is important, but working on solutions through fundamental research and development for new technologies is also important,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said at the meeting. Exxon has multi-billion-dollar expansion programs to find and produce new reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as to expand its refining and chemical footprint. It has projected shale production of 1 million barrels per day in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, as early as 2024. Woods said the company would continue to engage with shareholders as part of a “a years-long process.” More than 50 people organized by environmental group 350 Dallas held signs and chanted outside the hotel entrance to protest Exxon’s climate policies. “The climate crisis is real and they have contributed to it,” said Olinka Green, 50, of Dallas, who held a sign saying, “There is no Planet B.” Shares of Exxon were down 0.62% at $72.16 on Wednesday. Exxon is pushing ahead in China despite the trade war between the two countries, and Woods said its plans have not been interrupted. Last year it was approved for an about $9 billion liquefied natural gas terminal and a massive chemicals project in China, the second foreign firm after Germany’s BASF to gain approval to operate such a plant without a local sponsor. “That is a lifelong investment, a 50- to 100-year timeline investment,” Woods said. “While we’re sensitive to what we’re seeing in the current environment and the implications, and we’re making sure that we understand how issues can play themselves out, we’re also trying to put that in the context of this long-term time horizon we’re trying to manage.”"

Iraqi oil officials say Exxon evacuated all of its foreign staff from the West Qurna 1 field on Friday and Saturday, about 60 people. The U.S. oil major has a long term contract to improve the field. Its evacuation came days after Washington sent non-essential staff home from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad over what it said was a security alert caused by threats from Iran, which has close ties to Shi’ite militia groups operating in Iraq. The United States is ramping up sanctions pressure on Iran, especially over oil exports. Iraq relies heavily on natural gas from Iran for its electricity supply, which is stretched during hot summer months. Ghadhban said there were a number of ways Iraq could compensate in case Iranian gas supplies were reduced, including using gas oil stores in some power plants, but so far there had been no change in supplies. Ghadhban separately said Iraq has almost 5 million barrels per day of oil capacity, with a current surplus capacity of around 400,000 bpd “We are [producing] around 4.5 mln bpd, which is our production rate that we agreed to in December last year,” he said."
-7.3724993239688645," Exxon evacuates foreign staff from Iraqi oilfield BASRA, Iraq/DUBAI (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has evacuated all of its foreign staff, around 60 people, from Iraq’s West Qurna 1 oilfield and is flying them out to Dubai, a senior Iraqi official and three other sources told Reuters on Saturday. The evacuation came just days after the United States withdrew non-essential staff from its embassy in Baghdad, citing a threat from neighboring Iran, which has close ties to Iraqi Shi’ite militia. Production at the oilfield was not affected by the evacuation and work is continuing normally, overseen by Iraqi engineers, said the chief of Iraq’s state-owned South Oil Company which owns the oil field, Ihsan Abdul Jabbar. He added that production remains at 440,000 barrels per day (bpd). “Exxon Mobil’s evacuation is a precautionary and temporary measure. We have no indication over any dangers, the situation is secure and very stable at the oilfield which is running at full capacity and producing 440,000 bpd,” he said. “The foreign engineers will provide advice and perform their duties from the company’s Dubai offices and we have no concerns at all,” Jabbar said, adding that production is managed by Iraqi engineers and the foreign staff were there mainly as advisers. Exxon Mobil is the lead contractor in a long-term deal with Iraq’s South Oil Company to develop and rehabilitate the oil field to increase its production. Exxon declined to confirm the evacuation. “As a matter of practice, we don’t share specifics related to operational staffing at our facilities,” said spokeswoman Julie King. “ExxonMobil has programs and measures in place to provide security to protect its people, operations and facilities. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees and contractors at all of our facilities around the world.” Exxon Mobil’s staff were evacuated in several phases late on Friday and early on Saturday, either straight to Dubai or to the main camp housing foreign oil company employees in Basra province. Those in the camp were en route to the airport on Saturday morning, sources - including an employee at a security company contracted by Exxon, said Iraqi oil officials and a staff member of a foreign oil company. “Last night 28 employees were evacuated to the airport and the rest were sent to the camp. This morning they were evacuated to the airport and no (foreign) staff remain in the field,” said a private security company official who oversaw the evacuation. Iraq sent an official letter to Exxon asking about the work hours of staff in Dubai and when they would return to the oilfield, because their absence affects costs and salaries, Abdul Jabbar said in an interview. “There are over 1,700 people working in the oilfield, 1,300 are South Oil Company staff and 400 are Iraqis working with foreign companies. Only around 60 people have left and they’re all advisors, administrators and finance staff.” Days of saber rattling between Washington and Tehran have heightened tensions in the region amid concerns about a potential U.S.-Iran conflict. Washington has increased economic sanctions and said it was building up its military presence in the region, accusing Iran of threats to U.S. troops and interests. Tehran has described those steps as “psychological warfare” and a “political game”. Separately, Abdul Jabbar said that Iraq’s oil exports from its southern ports had reached 3.5 million bpd by Saturday."

The deal helps smooth the way for the planned expansion of PNG LNG, roughly aligning Santos’ 13.5% stake in the LNG project and the new gas field. “The arrangements we announce today mark an important step toward the proposed expansion at the PNG LNG plant via a 2.7 metric tonnes per annum third LNG train fed by existing Project resources and P’nyang,” said Santos’ Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher. Oil Search said it would receive roughly $21.6 million for relinquishing a 1.65% stake in P’nyang to Santos, bringing its holding to 36.86%. Exxon will hold a similar stake in the venture after the deal, having relinquished about 12.1% of its stake to Santos. Santos’ shares rose as much as 2% to a two-week high after the announcement, in a slightly stronger broader market. The P’nyang partners are waiting to seal an agreement with the government for development of the field, but the signing has been delayed amid political ructions in Papua New Guinea. The government of Prime Minister Peter O’Neill faces a possible vote of no-confidence later this month. Adding to the pressure a watchdog - in findings O’Neill disputes - said the PM acted improperly when arranging for the South Pacific nation to borrow A$1.2 billion ($830 million) from Swiss bank UBS in 2014. The Ombudsman Commission said in a December report leaked this week that O’Neill failed to follow correct legal procedures and bypassed parliament in deciding to borrow the money, used to buy shares in oil and gas producer Oil Search Ltd. “The leak of the document is clearly political by some in the opposition playing a very dirty game in a desperate attempt to gain support for a change of government,” O’Neill said in a press release late on Wednesday. PNG’s opposition is maneuvering to call a vote of no confidence after a string of high-profile defections from O’Neill’s government, including finance minister James Marape. Marape told Papua New Guinea’s National newspaper on Wednesday that he quit because April’s Papua LNG gas agreement with France’s Total and its partners gave too much ground to the majors."

-10.846959479620462," Hungary will have to buy Russian natural gas if Exxon waits on offshore project: minister HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Wednesday his country would again turn to Russia for natural gas supplies if Exxon Mobil Corp has not decided by September whether to invest in a massive Black Sea offshore project. Romania’s Black Sea reserves pose a potential challenge to Russian Gazprom’s dominant role supplying Central and Eastern Europe, according to consultancy Deloitte. Tapping those fields could diversify the region’s gas supplies and bring the Romanian government revenue of $26 billion by 2040. “Exxon Mobil can be the game changer in the energy supply of Europe. But they should finally make their final investment decision,” Szijjarto told Reuters during an interview in Houston where he was opening a consulate office. “If they don’t make that decision until September, I will have to make another long-term agreement with the Russians.” Exxon and Austrian energy group OMV’s Romanian subsidiary, OMV Petrom SA, have put on hold a decision on tapping the natural gas field pending legal framework revisions. The field has been estimated to hold 1.5 trillion to 3 trillion cubic feet (42 billion to 84 billion cubic meters) of natural gas. Exxon is weighing several factors while deciding whether to invest in the Neptun Deep project in Romania, spokeswoman Julie King said on Wednesday. A decision would require “competitive and stable fiscal terms, a liberalized Romanian gas market that enables free trade, and sufficient interconnectivity with neighboring free and liquid markets, in each case, for the duration of our concession agreement,” King said. Hungary’s landlocked location in Central Europe puts it at a disadvantage in getting access to needed imports of natural gas, which is used by 85 percent of the households in the country, Szijjarto said. “The question of whether we will be able to diversify gas resources depends on four allies of ours: Croatia, Romania, the United States and Austria,” he said. “It’s a strange situation where we are encouraged by our friends and allies to diversify, but basically it’s up to them.” Development of a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal on the Croatian island of Krk, would help it diversify from the current, east-to-west logistics system established during the Cold War when the Soviet Union dominated Eastern and Central Europe, Szijjarto said."

The 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 2 (FCCU 2) was shut by a March 16 fire on Hydrofining Unit-9 (HU 9), which removes sulfur from the gasoline. Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry declined to comment. The company is building a new heater for HU 9, which was severely damaged in the March 16 fire. The new heater is not expected to arrive for a month, the sources said. Exxon attempted to partially restart HU 9 in April, but according to the sources, operating one processing train on the unit was not possible. The company also canceled plans to operate FCCU 2 without HU 9. Without HU 9 removing sulfur from the gasoline produced by FCCU 2, the gasoline will not be in specification for sale, the sources said."

Golden Pass is designed to produce around 16 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, equivalent to about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Qatar Petroleum owns 70 percent of the project, while Exxon owns 30 percent. Enable Midstream Partners LP has said it expects to complete the Gulf Run pipeline to transport gas to Golden Pass in late 2022. Golden Pass selected McDermott International Inc, Chiyoda Corp and Zachry Group to build the project. After exporting no LNG at the start of 2016, the United States is expected to become the third biggest LNG exporter in the world in 2019 behind Australia and Qatar. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected U.S. LNG exports will rise to an average of 5.3 bcfd in 2019 and 7.4 bcfd in 2020 from 3.0 bcfd in 2018. LNG exports in 2018 were worth about $3.5 billion. Looking at just the terminals under construction, total U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to increase to 7.4 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10 bcfd by the end of 2020, up from 5.2 bcfd now."

-7.0540849033394695," Siemens spins off struggling gas and power in smart digital shift MUNICH (Reuters) - Siemens is spinning off its gas and power business, which has dragged on the German engineering firm’s performance as the rise of renewable power hits demand for gas turbines. The new firm would be a “major player” in energy with revenues of 27 billion euros ($30 billion) and more than 80,000 employees, Siemens said on Tuesday, adding that it would now focus on its Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure businesses. Siemens said the Gas and Power division, which includes its oil and gas, conventional power generation, power transmission and related services businesses, will be set up as a standalone company with the aim of a public listing by September 2020. Last week Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that Siemens was considering carving out the unit, whose 2018 profit fell by 75 percent to 377 million euros ($421 million) as revenue dropped 19 percent. “The new company won’t have to compete for resources with higher margin business like smart infrastructure and digital industries,” Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser told reporters. Siemens also plans to include its 59 percent stake in wind energy company Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy in Gas and Power. The decision to separate the business, which will be led by Gas and Power head Lisa Davis, was approved by Siemens supervisory board, which met on Tuesday ahead of its second quarter figures on Wednesday. The Munich-based company said it would remain an anchor shareholder in Gas and Power with between 25 and 50 percent. “It’s the right thing to do; it’s necessary and courageous to trigger the planned changes when the company is doing well,” Siemens chairman Jim Hagemann Snabe said. Unions also supported the decision, saying the business was better off outside Siemens. “If the unit were to stay part of Siemens, investments would be further reduced. Thus the business would literally be starved to death,” Siemens works council head Birgit Steinborn, who is also deputy chairwoman of the company, said in a statement. “With the planned initial public offering in Germany, co-determination will be maintained and Siemens remains committed to keeping jobs in Germany and Europe. In a joint venture, for example with a Japanese competitor, we would have seen that at great risk,” she added. Siemens is targeting cost cuts of 2.2 billion by 2023 by cutting 10,400 jobs - mainly administration and support roles - at its remaining core units, including 3,000 at Smart Infrastructure and 4,900 at Digital Industries. The company will shed at least 10,400 jobs in the overhaul. At the same time, Siemens plans to create 20,500 jobs by 2023, resulting in a net increase. For its Smart Infrastructure unit - which makes fire safety and security products, grid control or energy storage systems for buildings - Siemens is now targeting a profit margin of 13-15 percent by 2023. Digital Industries - which among other products offers industrial software and automation solutions for companies - is targeting a margin of 17-23 percent. Kaeser stressed that Siemens has many options and plenty of time available for its rail unit Siemens Mobility. Siemens tried to combine Mobility with listed peer Alstom, but scrapped the deal earlier this year as antitrust concerns mounted. Analysts expect that Siemens will eventually opt for a stock market listing for the unit."
-7.0540849033394695," Iraq close to signing $53 billion deal with Exxon, PetroChina; denies Iran link BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq is close to signing a $53 billion, 30-year energy agreement with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday, denying any link between the mega-project and U.S. permission for Iraq to do business with Iran. Iraq expects to make $400 billion over the 30 years the deal will be in effect, the prime minister said. The southern mega-project involves the development of the Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi oilfields and raising production from the two fields to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from around 125,000 bpd now, Abdul Mahdi said. The project is crucial to supplying water to oilfields in the south in order to boost pressure and keep production steady. Media reports had quoted Iran’s ambassador in London on Monday saying the United States would grant waivers to Iraq allowing it to deal with Iran economically, in exchange for Baghdad signing an oil deal with Washington. “Talks now between the oil ministry and Exxon Mobil and PetroChina are focused on how to split profits if oil prices rise or decline,” Abdul Mahdi said in response to a Reuters question on the obstacles holding up a final agreement. “The deal lasts for 30 years and such financial details are sensitive and should be given more discussions,” he added. Iraq is the second largest oil exporter in OPEC and has long-term aims to boost output curtailed by decades of war and sanctions. Such projects are among the most valuable prizes in the world for international oil companies. An initial agreement would be a big boost for Exxon Mobil’s plans to expand in Iraq. It is also one of the only countries in the world to have friendly relations with both the United States and Iran. Tehran and Washington, arch enemies elsewhere, are Baghdad’s main allies and vye for influence there. Exxon Mobil and PetroChina will build a water injection project to feed oil wells in the south, as well as rehabilitate and build new export pipelines, Abdul Mahdi said. The project also aims to process 100 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Artawi and Nahr Bin Umar fields. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out last year from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, and reinstated sanctions against Tehran. Washington has told buyers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions. Iraq does not import oil and has a waiver from the United States allowing it to import Iranian natural gas. “The U.S. sanctions are against countries that buy Iranian oil only, and Iraq doesn’t buy any Iranian crude. For gas, as far as I know (waivers ending) won’t affect (gas imports) right now. The waiver for gas still stands,” an Iraqi oil official told Reuters on Monday."

The Church Commissioners for England (CCE), the endowment fund of the Church of England, as well as New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who manages the state’s pension fund, also urged other shareholders to vote in favor of an independent chairman. ExxonMobil’s inadequate responses to climate change indicated its board was not functioning effectively due to the absence of an independent chairman, the two shareholders said in a filing. Exxon Mobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for DiNapoli declined immediate comment on Friday. The filing comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission said earlier in April that Exxon Mobil was not required to let investors vote on a shareholder submission calling on the company to set emissions targets beginning next year. Exxon had called the resolution misleading, substantially implemented and an attempt to interfere with its management responsibilities. The proposal, which would have asked the oil company to set emissions targets “aligned with the greenhouse gas reduction goals established by the Paris climate agreement,” was rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."

The company expects 2,000 jobs will be created during the construction at the Baytown petrochemical complex, which includes the nation’s third-largest crude oil refinery. It is another step in Exxon’s pivot to take advantage of light sweet crude being produced in the Permian Basin of Texas. Exxon is also expanding its 365,644-barrel-per-day Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a 250,000-bpd crude distillation unit to process crude from the Permian.

-5.991433058745557," Exxon Mobil, Chevron dogged by refining, chemicals troubles HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Friday reported lower profits, citing lower margins and refining weaknesses, areas that have plagued the two oil companies off and on for more than a year. Exxon posted the first loss in its refining business since 2009, citing the worst refining margins on gasoline and other profits it had seen in a decade. Chevron reported its refining and chemical profits fell 65 percent. Both reported top-line figures that missed Wall Street expectations and were lower than year-ago levels due to weaker crude pricing. Exxon’s 49 percent drop in first-quarter profit showed the turnaround at the largest U.S. oil producer remains a work in progress. “It was a tough market environment for us this quarter,” Exxon Senior Vice President Jack Williams said on a call with analysts. Exxon continued to spend heavily to boost output, with capital spending up 42 percent over a year ago as it poured new investment into its shale and offshore operations. Investors have been pressing oil companies to cut back on spending and increase returns to shareholders. Its first-quarter profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $4.65 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year ago. Analysts had expected Exxon to earn 70 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon estimates. “Clearly, the corner is further away than we expected and we expect this to lead to underperformance in the near term,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a client note. At Chevron, investors ignored earnings that beat estimates and focused on its $33 billion bid for rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Occidental Petroleum Corp on Wednesday sought to derail Chevron’s offer with a unsolicited, $38 billion bid for Anadarko. Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth told analysts on Friday joint integration planning to combine the two companies had begun. He declined to say if it would raise its offer for Anadarko, saying it had a signed agreement with Anadarko. “We would not be surprised to see Chevron raise its offer,” wrote analysts at Edward Jones in a research note, saying they believed the company’s bid will “ultimately be the successful one.” Chevron’s production rose and achieved higher profit from its U.S. shale business, offsetting some of the drop in international oil and gas earnings. But sharp declines in overall refining and chemicals knocked first-quarter net to $2.65 billion, or $1.39 per share, from $3.64 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street had expected $1.30 per share. Chevron’s daily production of oil and gas rose to 3.04 billion of barrels, from 2.85 billions of barrels in the year-ago period, boosted by a 55 percent increase in its Permian output. The Anadarko takeover battle prompted analysts to ask Exxon about new acquisitions in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field. “I would be surprised if over time we did not pick up some more Permian acreage,” Williams said. He added that Exxon “doesn’t need to.” Growing output in the Permian Basin was a bright spot at Exxon, rising to 226,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It remains on track to produce 1 million barrels by 2024, and would use half of its existing inventory by then, he said. Exxon’s oil and gas production rose 2 percent overall to 4 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon dipped 2.1 percent to close at $80.49 Friday. Shares of San Ramona, California-based Chevron slipped less than 1 percent to close at $117.10."

The largest U.S. oil producer posted its first loss in its refining business since 2009 on higher maintenance costs and reported lower profits in chemicals and oil and gas. “It was a tough market environment for us this quarter,” Exxon Senior Vice President Jack Williams said on a call with analysts. First-quarter profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $4.65 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year ago. Cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion was offset by capital spending and dividend payments of $10.4 billion. “They had a large $2 billion cash flow shortfall that I don’t think investors will be comfortable with,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. Exxon continues to spend heavily to boost its oil and gas output, which had been on a years-long slide. Chief Executive Darren Woods has said he believes the company has an opportunity to invest even as peers have focused more on improving cash flow and share buybacks. Shares fell 2.1 percent to close at $80.49 on Friday. Analysts had expected Exxon to earn 70 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon estimates. Maintenance and production curtailments in its Canadian oil production, as well as weak oil and natural gas prices, pushed profits down in its oil and gas unit by 10.3 percent, the company said. “Clearly, the corner is further away than we expected and we expect this to lead to underperformance in the near term,” RBC Capital Markets said in a client note. Exxon’s oil and gas production rose 2 percent overall to 4 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. The company’s growing output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, was a bright spot, rising to 226,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter. It said it remains on track to produce 1 million boepd by 2024. Rivals Chevron Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp are battling to take over Anadarko Petroleum Corp . “I would be surprised if over time we did not pick up some more Permian acreage,” Williams said when an analyst asked about possible acquisitions, but added that Exxon “doesn’t need to.” Exxon’s refining business lost $256 million in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $940 million in the same period last year. Its chemicals business earned $518 million, down 53 percent from profits of $1.1 billion during the same period last year, while its upstream business, which pumps oil and gas, had a profit of $2.9 billion, down 18 percent.

Namibia has in recent years attracted interest from oil and gas companies keen to explore its offshore potential, which has been likened to Brazil’s prolific Santos basin. ExxonMobil signed an agreement with the state-owned National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (NAMCOR) for the addition of about 28,000 square km for exploration by the U.S. oil and gas giant. “These agreements provide ExxonMobil with an opportunity to explore for hydrocarbons using advanced technology in the frontier Namibia basin,” Mike Cousins, senior vice president of exploration and new ventures at ExxonMobil said in a statement. ExxonMobil will operate blocks 1710 and 1810 and hold a 90 percent interest while NAMCOR will hold a 10 percent interest. As part of the deal, ExxonMobil will assign 5 percent of its interest to a local Namibian company that has yet to be identified. Last October, Independent oil and Gas Company, Chariot Oil and Gas, became the latest company which failed in its bid to find oil offshore Namibia.

A combination of lower oil prices, weakness in liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolios and lackluster refinery margins could hurt integrated oil companies across the board, analysts said ahead of results announcements on Friday. “We’re not looking for a great first quarter for the group,” said Blake Fernandez, senior research analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co’s Simmons Energy. Still, shares of both companies have performed well in recent months amid extensive efforts to boost investment in the Permian region of west Texas and New Mexico, where heavy production has driven U.S. crude output to an all-time record of more than 12 million barrels per day. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp have rallied about 20 percent since the start of the year, while Chevron Corp stock has risen roughly 10 percent. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, is expected to earn 69 cents a share, down from $1.09 a year ago. Revenues are expected to come in at $64.8 billion, down 5 percent from a year ago, according to Refinitiv Eikon estimates. Chevron is forecast to earn $1.30 a share, down from $1.90 a year ago, even as revenue is expected to rise by 1.7 percent to $38.4 billion, Refinitiv data shows. Weakness in the sector’s shipping and chemical businesses could weigh on results in coming quarters, as those units “could become more challenging in 2019,” J.P. Morgan said in a note on Exxon this month. The bank has a neutral rating on Exxon. Exxon’s fourth-quarter Permian oil and gas output was 300,000 bpd; it plans to boost that to more than 1 million bpd by 2024, it said last month. Chevron has bid $33 billion to take over Anadarko Petroleum to expand its reach. On Wednesday, rival Occidental bid $38 billion on Anadarko, kicking off the first takeover battle for an oil company in years. U.S. oil prices are up more than 40 percent since late last year and refinery margins have improved, which could help position the majors for better results ahead, said Fernandez of Piper Jaffray & Co’s Simmons Energy. “If you get some weak results, shares might trade weaker on that day, but I think investors are largely going to be able to brush that off,” Fernandez said."
-8.57046640988543," ExxonMobil agrees 20-year LNG deal with China's Zhejiang Energy SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said it has signed a 20-year agreement to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China’s Zhejiang Energy, as the U.S. oil and gas giant steps up marketing of the fuel in China, the world’s second-largest buyer. Under the sales and purchase agreement, Exxon Mobil will supply 1 million tonnes a year of the super-chilled fuel to the provincial government-backed Zhejiang Energy, Exxon said in a statement late on Monday. The agreement, which follows a framework deal announced last October, did not give details on price or timing, or say where the supplies will be sourced. Exxon Mobil said last year it would deliver the LNG starting in the early 2020s, while LNG supplies to China would come from its global portfolio. The U.S. firm has been expanding its portfolio of LNG, including from upcoming projects in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and Golden Pass in the United States. Zhejiang Energy is building a 9 billion yuan ($1.34 billion) receiving terminal for the fuel in Wenzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, with annual handling capacity of 3 million tonnes. Chinese state oil and gas major Sinopec will be a partner in the terminal. Chen Zhu, managing director at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, said the Exxon-Zhejiang deal was separate from U.S.- China trade negotiations under which Chinese firms are expected to eventually boost purchases of U.S. gas. “The gas supplies to the Zhejiang firm will come from Exxon’s portfolio production outside the U.S.,” Chen said, adding that the Wenzhou terminal is likely to be operational in 2022 or 2023. Exxon already has two long-term LNG supply agreements in China, one each with Sinopec and CNPC, China’s largest state oil group, she said."

-5.418300379306369," Exxon Mobil wins three exploration blocks offshore Argentina (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday its unit and an affiliate of Qatar Petroleum had won three exploration blocks offshore Argentina. The three blocks will add about 2.6 million net acres to Exxon’s existing holdings in Argentina, the company said. The blocks are located in the Malvinas basin, about 200 miles (320 kms) offshore Tierra del Fuego. Exxon’s existing Argentina holdings include 315,000 net acres spread over seven blocks in the onshore Neuquén Basin of the Vaca Muerta unconventional oilfield and a business support center in Buenos Aires. ExxonMobil will have a 70 percent stake, while Qatar Petroleum’s affiliate will hold the rest. The Argentine government issued a statement on Tuesday saying it received offers for the exploration of three offshore oil and gas basins from 13 companies for a total of $995 million. The country’s energy secretariat was expected to confirm which companies were awarded which areas next month. Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with Exxon Mobil in June to buy a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon’s affiliates in Argentina, giving Qatar’s state-owned entity access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country. Exxon has been investing heavily in its U.S. shale operations and in Guyana. Its development in Argentina has been slow due to several reasons, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government controls on natural gas prices. The U.S. oil company also invested in Brazil’s prolific offshore oilfields throughout 2018, clinching numerous blocks in partnership with other companies. Exxon and Qatar Petroleum International landed Brazil’s Tita area, locking in key real estate in the prized Santos basin. The two companies have also partnered on three of Exxon’s offshore exploration blocks in Mozambique’s Angoche and Zambezi basins."

Oil Search said in a statement that the agreement would allow the parties to start activities related to so-called Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) such as contractor selection for Papua LNG - a project led by Total, with Exxon and Oil Search as minority partners. “FEED is expected to result in a Final Investment Decision in 2020, which will ensure that first production from ... LNG trains is available in 2024,” said Oil Search’s managing director, Peter Botten. Oil Search had initially hoped the project, to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant, would be approved in 2018, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country. The project intends to develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields to feed two new processing units, or trains, to be built at the PNG LNG plant run by Exxon Mobil. Exxon Mobil is also looking to sign-off on the development of a third new train to be supplied from its existing PNG LNG fields and the new P’nyang field. All together, the developments are expected to double the PNG LNG plant’s output to around 16 million tonnes a year, with analysts estimating the overall expansion will cost around $13 billion. Shares of Oil Search and sector peers such as Santos were over 2 percent higher against a slightly lower benchmark index. (Reporting by Devika Syamnath in Bengaluru; Editing by Joseph Radford)"

-4.429936475517034," Exxon, Repsol and Ecopetrol sign deals for Colombia offshore oil exploration blocks BOGOTA (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA have each signed joint contracts with Spain’s Repsol SA to explore for oil in offshore blocks in the Caribbean, the Colombian government said on Wednesday. The Andean country recently modified contractual terms for offshore exploration and launched a permanent bidding process in an effort to boost its long-stagnant oil sector. Companies including Shell, Noble and Parex have since signed on to operate new blocks. The two contracts will generate some $700 million in investment, the national hydrocarbons agency (ANH) said in a statement. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, and Repsol will split participation in the COL-4 block, located about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Bolivar province, but the Spanish company will be the operator, the ANH said. Repsol will also operate the GUA-OFF-1 block, located 78 kilometers (48 miles) north of La Guajira province, which it will split evenly with Ecopetrol, the ANH said. Both blocks have an area of 400,000 hectares (988,000 acres). “From Repsol the signing of these contracts shows our interest in continuing exploration activities in the Colombian Caribbean and in contributing to maintaining the energy sustainability of the country,” Giancarlo Ariza Merello, Repsol’s director of exploration for Colombia and the western Caribbean said in a statement. The contract for GUA-OFF-1 is the second new offshore deal Ecopetrol has inked with the Colombian government this year and its fifth offshore block in the country."

Exxon in late January asked the SEC for permission to bar a shareholder submission calling on the company to set emissions targets beginning next year that “aligned with the greenhouse gas reduction goals established by the Paris climate agreement.” Exxon argued the resolution was misleading, substantially implemented and an attempt to interfere with its management responsibilities. “The proposal would micromanage the company by seeking to impose specific methods for implementing complex policies in place of the ongoing judgments of management,” SEC Special Counsel Courtney Haseley wrote. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on the decision, and pointed to the company’s letter to the SEC for its rationale. Church Commissioners for England and the New York State comptroller’s office, which submitted the proposal and previously submitted other climate-change resolutions to the company, said they are considering their next steps. “The SEC’s ruling is a bump in the road, but as long-term investors determined to protect the value of our portfolio, we are not going away. We will continue to press Exxon, and others, on climate risk and consider all options available to us in our next steps,” New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said in a statement. The group could seek to modify and resubmit the proposal before the 2020 annual meeting, appeal the SEC ruling, or call on shareholders to vote against Exxon directors.

-5.888474806766935," Exxon offers first glimpse of results from expanded trading unit HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has offered a glimpse of the scale of its nascent energy trading operation, disclosing operating profit and losses of about $230 million during each quarter last year, the first time it has revealed the figures. The world’s largest publicly traded oil producer last year launched a major push into energy trading, hiring veterans from Glencore, Noble Group, BP Plc and elsewhere in the United States, Europe and Asia. It also recruited market analysts and specialists with experience in crude, natural gas, gas-liquids and gasoline. The trading unit’s pre-tax gains and losses averaged $230 million in each quarter of 2018, according to a presentation delivered to analysts last week at the Scotia Howard Weil investor conference. For the full year, trading provided an operating profit of $10 million, up from a $99 million loss in the prior year, according to a regulatory filing. The profit was a fraction of Exxon’s $20.8 billion in earnings last year. But the disclosure of even an range of operating profit was a milestone in shedding light on its fledging business. Rivals Royal Dutch Shell and BP, which have larger commodities trading businesses, traditionally also have not provided detailed results for that activity. Shell for instance wraps its trading results in with its oil refining business. BP also includes its trading as part of its downstream operations. Comparing the majors’ operations are difficult because of the lack of consistent and specific financial disclosures, said Lysle Brinker, executive director of upstream equity research and analysis at energy consultancy IHSMarkit. “Exxon Mobil has not historically been into that business, but they’re getting into it now,” Brinker said. “They realize now they probably can be just as successful as the other guys.” An Exxon spokesman declined comment, pointing to the quarterly range figures in the presentation and full-year results in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under Chief Executive Darren Woods, Exxon has sought to use trading to boost earnings, applying its knowledge of regional oil and gas prices, and its extensive array of pipelines, storage terminals, ships and railcars to profit from price differentials around the globe. It also has bulked up its risk management systems."

-5.888474806766935," Exclusive: Exxon weighs sale of Nigerian oil and gas fields for up to $3 billion LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil recently held talks on the sale of a suite of oil and gas fields in Nigeria as the company focuses on new developments in U.S. shale and Guyana, industry and banking sources told Reuters. The potential disposals are expected to include stakes in onshore and offshore fields and could raise up to $3 billion, two sources said. “Exxon is actively divesting in Nigeria,” one source who was briefed on the divestment plans said. Exxon declined to comment. The Irving, Texas-based company is one of the largest oil and gas producers in Nigeria, with 106 operated platforms. Its oil output in the West African country reached 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, its website says. Exxon officials have held talks in recent weeks with several Nigerian companies to gauge their interest in the fields. One source said Exxon was soon due to open a “data room” - which would provide technical information on the fields, such as seismic and production details - in Nigeria. The discussions focused on a number of onshore fields Exxon shares in joint ventures with Nigerian state oil firm NNPC, including oil mining leases 66, 68, 70 and 104, one source said. Exxon’s share of oil production in those fields reached 120,000 bpd in 2017, the last year for which data was available. Exxon is also weighing the possible sale of stakes in offshore fields in Nigeria, two sources said. It is looking into offering for sale assets in Equatorial Guinea and Chad, according to two sources. The Nigerian government has in the last decade supported a drive by domestic firms such as Oando, Seplat and privately held Aiteo to expand their operations in the country as international companies including Royal Dutch Shell sought to lower their presence due to oil spills resulting from pipeline sabotage. Exxon recently launched the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan’s largest oilfield, which would mark its retreat from the former Soviet state after 25 years. Exxon announced earlier this year plans to boost its capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30 billion in 2019 and up to $35 billion next year as it seeks to develop oilfields in Guyana and the U.S. Permian basin as well as gas projects in Mozambique and the U.S. Gulf Coast. In an analyst presentation last month, Exxon said it would accelerate its divestments to around $15 billion by 2021."
-5.888474806766935," Exxon makes final investment decision on Singapore complex expansion (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday it had made a final investment decision on a multi-billion dollar expansion of its integrated manufacturing complex in Singapore that would help it increase production of cleaner fuels with lower-sulfur content. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is introducing new rules on marine fuels from 2020, limiting the sulfur content to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent, to curb pollution from ships. The shipping and oil refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were announced in 2016. Exxon’s expansion project, which is expected to come online in 2023, would convert fuel oil and other residual crude products into higher-value lube base stocks and distillates, the company said in a statement. The company said the expansion would increase its capacity to produce cleaner fuels with lower-sulfur content by 48,000 barrels per day, including high-quality marine fuels. Exxon did not specify the amount it plans to invest in the expansion project. The Singapore refinery is Exxon’s largest with a capacity of about 592,000 barrels per day. Singapore is also home to the oil giant’s biggest integrated petrochemical complex. The company said the expansion project is part of a plan to further enhance the competitiveness of its Singapore facility, which includes the world’s only steam cracker capable of cracking crude oil."

-4.5443111560098535," Exxon to report plastic pellet spills, shareholder says HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp agreed to start reporting spills of plastic pellets from its chemical plants this year, according to an activist shareholder group that pressed the company on the issue. Activist group As You Sow said on Wednesday that it would withdraw a resolution it had asked Exxon to present to investors at the company’s annual shareholder meeting this spring. Plastic pellets, which are building blocks for most plastics products, are a major source of ocean pollution, environmentalist say. Exxon “will provide details about where, how, and when it monitors for pellet spills, describe pellet management systems it has in place, and report on spills that occurred,” the group said in a statement. Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The information on plastic pellet spills will be included in a sustainability report later this year, As You Sow said. Exxon has sought to block a separate investor proposal that calls on the world’s largest publicly-traded oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. Activist investors have been pressing oil companies to commit to fixed emissions targets and align with the Paris climate agreement that limits global temperature warming to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the turn of the century. The efforts, part of a wave of climate-related proxy resolutions, are planned for spring 2019 annual shareholder meetings."
-3.473170060157651," Exxon says high-sulfur fuel oil demand to decline 25 percent (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp expects high-sulfur fuel oil demand to fall 25 percent by 2025, as a new set of emission regulations kick in next year, a top-level official at the U.S. oil and gas company said on Monday.

Exxon’s forecast comes as its refining business is struggling to find enough heavy crude to make fuel oil and other distillates, in the face of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude. Heavy crude accounts for nearly two-thirds of U.S. oil imports. Of this, Venezuela’s oil accounted for 10 percent of heavy crude imports in 2018 and about 13 percent in 2017, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.

-4.712081421782481," Exxon's talks to tap Algeria shale gas falter due to unrest -sources ALGIERS/LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between Exxon Mobil and Algeria to develop a natural gas field in the North African country have stalled because of unrest, industry sources said, the first economic fallout from the almost month-long anti-government protests. Irving, Texas-based Exxon entered talks with Algeria’s national oil company Sonatrach several months ago to develop a field in the southwestern Ahnet basin, the sources close to the discussions said. The talks were part of a deepening of ties between the two companies that followed Sonatrach’s acquisition last May of Exxon’s Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy. Last week, officials from the two sides held talks in Houston, Texas to hammer out details but Exxon opted to suspend the discussions, temporarily at least, due to the wave of protests in Algeria over President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s 20-year rule, the sources said. Exxon and Sonatrach declined to comment. The refinery acquisition and increased cooperation between the two companies were seen as key for Sonatrach’s efforts to modernize its business and reduce reliance on fuel imports under Chief Executive Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour. The collapse of the talks follows years of attempts by Sonatrach to attract foreign companies to develop its vast oil and natural gas resources. Bouteflika had appointed Kaddour in March 2017 to turn around a state company hit by fraud scandals, lethargy and red tape. He has since then managed to rebuild ties with oil majors, some of which had shunned Algeria previously due to tough terms and bureaucracy. But Kaddour’s fate is tied to Bouteflika, who has been facing increasing pressure to step down from street protests, energy and political sources say. Kaddour was previously jailed in a murky power struggle typical for Algeria before being rehabilitated by Bouteflika. “The minute Bouteflika would leave power, Ould Kaddour would be sacked,” a reliable source familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. Sonatrach hopes to tap foreign experience in fracking, a drilling technique that led to the rapid expansion of U.S. oil and gas production, to develop its own shale reserves, estimated at 22 trillion cubic meters, the world’s third largest. Algeria is a leading gas supplier to Europe but exports have suffered from delays to several projects and a steep rise in the use of subsidized gas at home as the population has grown. To make Algeria attractive for investors, Kaddour, a U.S.-trained engineer, has also resolved a series of disputes with oil majors including France’s Total, Italy’s ENI and Spain’s Repsol that had blocked investments. He has also been pushing the government to finalize energy legislation that has been in the works for years to offer better terms for investors."
-4.712081421782481," Oil majors rush to dominate U.S. shale as independents scale back EDDY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO (Reuters) - In New Mexico’s Chihuahuan Desert, Exxon Mobil Corp is building a massive shale oil project that its executives boast will allow it to ride out the industry’s notorious boom-and-bust cycles. Workers at its Remuda lease near Carlsbad - part of a staff of 5,000 spread across New Mexico and Texas - are drilling wells, operating fleets of hydraulic pumps and digging trenches for pipelines. The sprawling site reflects the massive commitment to the Permian Basin by oil majors, who have spent an estimated $10 billion buying acreage in the top U.S. shale field since the beginning of 2017, according to research firm Drillinginfo Inc. The rising investment also reflects a recognition that Exxon, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the Permian shale bonanza while more nimble independent producers, who pioneered shale drilling technology, leased Permian acreage on the cheap. Now that the field has made the U.S. the world’s top oil producer, Exxon and other majors are moving aggressively to dominate the Permian and use the oil to feed their sprawling pipeline, trading, logistics, refining and chemicals businesses. The majors have 75 drilling rigs here this month, up from 31 in 2017, according to Drillinginfo. Exxon operates 48 of those rigs and plans to add seven more this year. The majors’ expansion comes as smaller independent producers, who profit only from selling the oil, are slowing exploration and cutting staff and budgets amid investor pressure to control spending and boost returns. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on March 6 that Exxon would change “the way that game is played” in shale. Its size and businesses could allow Exxon to earn double-digit percentage returns in the Permian even if oil prices - now above $58 per barrel - crashed to below $35, added Senior Vice President Neil Chapman. Exxon’s 1.6 million acres in the Permian means it can approach the field as a “megaproject,” said Staale Gjervik, the head of shale subsidiary XTO Resources, whose headquarters was recently relocated to share space with its logistics and refining businesses. The firm also recently outlined plans to nearly double the capacity of a Gulf Coast refinery to process shale oil. “It sets us up to take a longer-term view,” Gjervik said. The majors’ Permian investments position the field to compete with Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil-producing region and solidifies the United States as a powerhouse in global oil markets, said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and vice chairman of consultancy IHS Markit. “A decade ago, capital investment was leaving the U.S.,” he said. “Now it’s coming home in a very big way.” The Permian is expected to generate 5.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2023 - more than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) other than Saudi Arabia, according to IHS Markit. Production this month, at about 4 million bpd, will about double that of two years ago. Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP now hold about 4.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, according to Drillinginfo. Chevron and Exxon are poised to become the biggest producers in the field, leapfrogging independent producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources. Pioneer recently dropped a pledge to hit 1 million bpd by 2026 amid pressure from investors to boost returns. It shifted its emphasis to generating cash flow and replaced its chief executive after posting fourth quarter profit that missed Wall Street earnings targets by 36 cents a share. Shell, meanwhile, is considering a multi-billion dollar deal to purchase independent producer Endeavor Energy Resources, according to people familiar with the talks. Shell declined to comment and Endeavor did not respond to a request. Chevron said it would produce 900,000 bpd by 2023, while Exxon forecast pumping 1 million barrels per day by about 2024. That would give the two companies one-third of Permian production within five years. At first, the rise of the Permian was driven largely by nimble explorers that pioneered new technology for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling to unlock oil from shale rock, slashing production costs. The advances by smaller companies initially left the majors behind. Now, those technologies are easily copied and widely available from service firms. Surging Permian production has overwhelmed pipelines and forced producers to sell crude at a deep discount, sapping cash and profits of independents who, unlike the majors, don’t own their own pipeline networks. Even as the majors have ramped up operations, the total number of drilling rigs at work in the Permian has dropped to 464, from 493 in November, as independent producers have slowed production, according to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes. Shell, by contrast, plans to keep expanding even if prices fall further, said Amir Gerges, Shell’s Permian general manager. “We have a bit more resilience” than the independents, Gerges said. In west Texas, the firm drills four to six wells at a time next to one another, a process called cube development that targets multiple layers of shale as deep as 8,000 feet. Cube development is expensive and can take months, making it an option only for the majors and the largest independent producers. Shell has used the tactic to double production in two years, to 145,000 bpd. The largest oil firms can also take advantage of their volume-buying power even if service companies raise prices for supplies or drilling and fracking crews, said Andrew Dittmar, a Drillinginfo analyst. “It’s like buying at Costco versus a neighborhood market,” Dittmar said. The majors’ rush into the market means smaller companies are going to struggle to compete for service contracts and pay higher prices, said Roy Martin, analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “When you’re sitting across the negotiating table from the majors, the chips are stacked on their side,” he said. The revival of interest in the Permian marks a reversal from the late 1990s, when production had been falling for two decades. “All the majors and all the companies with names you’ve heard left with their employees,” said Karr Ingham, an oil and gas economist. “Conventional wisdom was this place was going to dry up.” Chevron was the only major that stayed in the Permian. It holds 2.3 million acres and owns most of its mineral rights, too, but until recently left drilling to others. But this month, Chief Executive Mike Wirth called the Permian its best bet for delivering profits “north of 30 percent at low oil prices.” “There’s nothing we can invest in that delivers higher rates of return,” Wirth said this month at its annual investor meeting in New York. ‘HUNGER AND FEAR’ Matt Gallagher, CEO of Parsley Energy Inc, calls the majors’ investments “the best form of flattery” for independents operating here. Parsley holds 192,000 Permian acres - most of which was snatched up on the cheap during oil busts - and sees its smaller size as an advantage in shale. “We’re not finished yet,” Gallagher said. “We can move very quickly.” The majors have greater infrastructure, but independents continue to innovate and design better wells, said Allen Gilmer, a co-founder of Drillinginfo. “Nothing is a bigger motivator than, ‘Am I going to be alive tomorrow?’” Gilmer said. “Hunger and fear is something that every independent oil-and-gas person knows - and that something no major oil-and-gas person has ever felt in their career.”"
-4.712081421782481," Exxon's talks to tap Algeria shale gas falter due to unrest - sources * Exxon, Sonatrach met in Houston to discuss Ahnet field * Exxon opted to suspend process due to violence in Algeria * Discussions part of tightening ties between companies ALGIERS/LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Talks between Exxon Mobil and Algeria to develop a natural gas field in the North African country have stalled because of domestic unrest, industry sources said. Irving, Texas-based Exxon entered talks with Algeria’s national oil company Sonatrach several months ago to develop a field in the southwestern Ahnet basin, the sources close to the discussions said. The talks were part of a deepening of ties between the two companies that followed Sonatrach’s acquisition last May of Exxon’s Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy. Last week, officials from the two sides held talks in Houston, Texas to hammer out details but Exxon opted to suspend the discussions, temporarily at least, due to the recent protests in Algeria over President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s 20-year rule, the sources said. Exxon and Sonatrach declined to comment. The refinery acquisition and increased cooperation between the two companies were seen as key for Sonatrach’s efforts to modernise its business and reduce reliance on fuel imports under Chief Executive Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour. The collapse of the talks follows years of attempts by Sonatrach to attract foreign companies to develop its vast oil and natural gas resources. Sonatrach hopes to tap foreign experience in fracking, a drilling technique that led to the rapid expansion of U.S. oil and gas production, to develop its own shale reserves, estimated at 22 trillion cubic metres, the world’s third largest. The North African country is a leading gas supplier to Europe, but exports have suffered from delays to several projects and a steep rise in the use of subsidised gas at home as the population has grown.

-4.712081421782481," RPT=INSIGHT-Oil majors rush to dominate US shale as independents scale back (Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) EDDY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, March 20 (Reuters) - In New Mexico’s Chihuahuan Desert, Exxon Mobil Corp is building a massive shale oil project that its executives boast will allow it to ride out the industry’s notorious boom-and-bust cycles. Workers at its Remuda lease near Carlsbad - part of a staff of 5,000 spread across New Mexico and Texas - are drilling wells, operating fleets of hydraulic pumps and digging trenches for pipelines. The sprawling site reflects the massive commitment to the Permian Basin by oil majors, who have spent an estimated $10 billion buying acreage in the top U.S. shale field since the beginning of 2017, according to research firm Drillinginfo Inc. The rising investment also reflects a recognition that Exxon, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the Permian shale bonanza while more nimble independent producers, who pioneered shale drilling technology, leased Permian acreage on the cheap. Now that the field has made the U.S. the world’s top oil producer, Exxon and other majors are moving aggressively to dominate the Permian and use the oil to feed their sprawling pipeline, trading, logistics, refining and chemicals businesses. The majors have 75 drilling rigs here this month, up from 31 in 2017, according to Drillinginfo. Exxon operates 48 of those rigs and plans to add seven more this year. The majors’ expansion comes as smaller independent producers, who profit only from selling the oil, are slowing exploration and cutting staff and budgets amid investor pressure to control spending and boost returns. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on March 6 that Exxon would change “the way that game is played” in shale. Its size and businesses could allow Exxon to earn double-digit percentage returns in the Permian even if oil prices - now above $58 per barrel - crashed to below $35, added Senior Vice President Neil Chapman. Exxon’s 1.6 million acres in the Permian means it can approach the field as a “megaproject,” said Staale Gjervik, the head of shale subsidiary XTO Resources, whose headquarters was recently relocated to share space with its logistics and refining businesses. The firm also recently outlined plans to nearly double the capacity of a Gulf Coast refinery to process shale oil. “It sets us up to take a longer-term view,” Gjervik said. The majors’ Permian investments position the field to compete with Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil-producing region and solidifies the United States as a powerhouse in global oil markets, said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and vice chairman of consultancy IHS Markit. “A decade ago, capital investment was leaving the U.S.,” he said. “Now it’s coming home in a very big way.” The Permian is expected to generate 5.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2023 - more than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) other than Saudi Arabia, according to IHS Markit. Production this month, at about 4 million bpd, will about double that of two years ago. Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP now hold about 4.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, according to Drillinginfo. Chevron and Exxon are poised to become the biggest producers in the field, leapfrogging independent producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources. Pioneer recently dropped a pledge to hit 1 million bpd by 2026 amid pressure from investors to boost returns. It shifted its emphasis to generating cash flow and replaced its chief executive after posting fourth quarter profit that missed Wall Street earnings targets by 36 cents a share. Shell, meanwhile, is considering a multi-billion dollar deal to purchase independent producer Endeavor Energy Resources, according to people familiar with the talks. Shell declined to comment and Endeavor did not respond to a request. Chevron said it would produce 900,000 bpd by 2023, while Exxon forecast pumping 1 million barrels per day by about 2024. That would give the two companies one-third of Permian production within five years. At first, the rise of the Permian was driven largely by nimble explorers that pioneered new technology for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling to unlock oil from shale rock, slashing production costs. The advances by smaller companies initially left the majors behind. Now, those technologies are easily copied and widely available from service firms. Surging Permian production has overwhelmed pipelines and forced producers to sell crude at a deep discount, sapping cash and profits of independents who, unlike the majors, don’t own their own pipeline networks. Even as the majors have ramped up operations, the total number of drilling rigs at work in the Permian has dropped to 464, from 493 in November, as independent producers have slowed production, according to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes . Shell, by contrast, plans to keep expanding even if prices fall further, said Amir Gerges, Shell’s Permian general manager. “We have a bit more resilience” than the independents, Gerges said. In west Texas, the firm drills four to six wells at a time next to one another, a process called cube development that targets multiple layers of shale as deep as 8,000 feet. Cube development is expensive and can take months, making it an option only for the majors and the largest independent producers. Shell has used the tactic to double production in two years, to 145,000 bpd. The largest oil firms can also take advantage of their volume-buying power even if service companies raise prices for supplies or drilling and fracking crews, said Andrew Dittmar, a Drillinginfo analyst. “It’s like buying at Costco versus a neighborhood market,” Dittmar said. The majors’ rush into the market means smaller companies are going to struggle to compete for service contracts and pay higher prices, said Roy Martin, analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “When you’re sitting across the negotiating table from the majors, the chips are stacked on their side,” he said.

-6.410581113141872," Exclusive: Exxon eyes Israel gas bid in major Middle East shift HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is considering exploring for oil and gas in Israel, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, in what would make Exxon the first oil major to operate in the country still technically at war with Gulf Arab states. A number of large gas discoveries offshore Israel and in nearby eastern Mediterranean waters in the last decade have made Israel a potentially lucrative prospect for big energy firms. The region is emerging as a new hot spot for gas exploration and production. Until those discoveries, Israel was believed to be sitting on scant oil and gas reserves. There was little reason for energy firms to explore for energy in Israel and risk complicating operations and future investments in nearby Arab countries that hold some of the world’s largest energy reserves. Exxon executives held talks with Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz in Houston this week about bidding for the right to explore and pump oil from offshore blocks in an auction that Israel will hold in June, said the person with direct knowledge. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, recently acquired a $50,000 data package from the Israeli energy ministry for the auction, the person said. An Exxon team also visited a data center set up by the ministry in Jerusalem, the source said. That center holds detailed information about the geology of the sub-sea rocks, believed to hold up to 75 trillion cubic feet of gas and 6.6 billion barrels of oil, according to estimates. Exxon declined comment. Israel’s energy ministry declined comment. In February, Exxon announced a major gas discovery in Cyprus together with its partner Qatar Petroleum. That field is near two other huge gas finds in the region: Leviathan off Israel and Zohr off Egypt. The U.S. major and competitors such as Royal Dutch Shell and France’s Total have avoided investing in Israel, for fear of souring relationships with the governments of giant regional oil and gas producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. Those countries do not recognize Israel. Exxon is one of the biggest foreign investors in Qatar. It also has refining and petrochemical operations in Saudi Arabia, and produces oil and gas in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. President Donald Trump has angered the Arab world and stoked international concern with changes to U.S. policy in the region, including moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged oil and gas companies to use their clout in world markets to advance the Trump administration’s foreign policy agenda. That included helping the administration’s efforts to isolate Israel’s arch-enemy Iran, and Venezuela. (GRAPHIC: East Mediterranean gas - tmsnrt.rs/2O5muhW) The discovery and development of major fields off the coasts of Egypt, Israel and Cyprus have led to the development of the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum, a partnership created in January between seven countries, including those three, to create a regional gas market. Steinitz met with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Monday on the sidelines of an energy conference in Houston to discuss this partnership. He also held talks with his regional counterparts. “We are just at the tip of the iceberg... Israel and Cyprus are little countries, but they have a good chance to become exporters in the future,” Steinitz said during a panel discussion at CERAWeek. “It’s also important that we have the strong backing from the United States of America.” Israel gas production is dominated today by a handful of local, Greek and U.S. companies. The country became a producer in 2013 with the launch of the Tamar field, operated by U.S. explorer Noble Energy Inc. Noble is developing the Leviathan and is scheduled to begin production later this year. Israel hopes that the coming licensing round will draw significantly larger interest than a previous round when only two companies bid amid skepticism about its ability to sell and export the fuel. Israel has signed major export deals with Jordan and Egypt over the past two years, opening new markets to companies looking to sell Israeli gas. Egypt also saw rapid growth in natural gas production following the discovery of giant fields in the Mediterranean. Several other major oil and gas companies are considering bidding in the licensing round, which closes June 17, according to the source."

-5.19453251933968," Exxon Mobil CEO sets plan to boost spending; shares dip NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to boost capital spending for several years, CEO Darren Woods said on Wednesday, and the largest U.S. oil company’s shares fell after he laid out a strategy to “lean in” while the rest of the industry cuts back. Exxon shares fell more than 1 percent after the company told analysts attending its annual investor meeting that it plans to lift spending by 10 percent or more for the next several years as rivals are sidelining equipment and capping spending to boost shareholder returns. Woods defended the strategy of “leaning in as our competitors are leaning back,” saying the best time to buy into projects is not when everyone else is active. “You do it when everybody else is at home,” Woods said. Exxon’s plans include a big bet on U.S. shale, where output has surged in recent years, making the United States the world’s largest oil producer. Exxon shares finished down 91 cents at $79.28 on Wednesday. The stock has underperformed rivals for years and Woods faces challenges to boost investor confidence. He took over as chief executive in 2017, with a mission to boost sagging production and repair missteps made under former CEO Rex Tillerson, including expensive bets on natural gas and Russia. Capital spending will rise to $33 billion to $35 billion next year from $30 billion this year and from $23.1 billion in Woods’ first year as CEO. “With investors increasingly pressuring energy companies to return cash to shareholders, it is no surprise that the higher capital budget was not positively received by the market,” said Muhammed Ghulam, energy analyst with Raymond James. Over the last five years, Exxon shares have posted a total return of negative 0.16 percent, lagging total returns of 32 percent at Chevron Corp and 54 percent at BP PLC over the same period, while the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 48 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Exxon’s output has declined in nine of the last 10 quarters, but the company now forecasts continued production gains. It has placed one of its biggest bets on drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. shale field. The independent oil companies that launched the Permian boom are reducing drilling rigs and cutting spending in response to investor demands to rein in expenses while Exxon and other majors are cranking up investments in the oilfield. Woods argued that more investment was justified because global demand is rising for oil and gas, and that the declining output of existing wells must be replaced. “This is a compelling case for industry as a whole,” Woods said. This week, Exxon and rival Chevron released dueling Permian output projections. Exxon said its Permian production could hit 1 million barrels of oil and gas per day as early as 2024, up from its previous estimate of 600,000 by 2025. Both companies have boasted of superior technology to overcome one of shale’s biggest hurdles: rapid declines in production rates. New well production in the Permian was about 600 bpd per rig as of February, down from nearly 760 bpd in mid-2016, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Woods said Exxon can earn a double-digit return in the Permian even at $35-per-barrel oil. It expects annual cash flow from overall operations to reach $60 billion in 2025, on assumption of $60 per barrel international oil prices. GRAPHIC - Exxon returns lag Big Oil peers: tmsnrt.rs/2C2CuvZ Other major investments for Exxon include offshore projects in Brazil and Guyana, and from global investments in liquefied natural gas. Exxon, which faces investor pressure to trim its assets, said it would divest $15 billion in holdings over the next three years. Exxon needs to “convince the market that higher spending today translates to higher returns to shareholders over time,” which could be helped by increased asset sales, said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Europe Limited, in a note to clients. Analysts and investors have pressured Exxon to be more open and transparent. Woods opened Wednesday’s analyst meeting by saying he had spent “quite a bit of time engaging with our shareholders,” in the last year. Last month, for the first time, he joined the quarterly earnings call to discuss results."

-5.19453251933968," Oil prices end mixed after U.S. crude stocks build sharply NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil futures were mixed on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed an unexpectedly sharp build in crude inventories, though a third straight drop in gasoline stocks supported prices. Brent crude futures settled at $65.99 a barrel, up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent. U.S. crude oil futures ended down 34 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $56.22 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories rose 7.1 million barrels last week, far exceeding analysts’ expectations for a build of 1.2 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Gasoline stocks, however, fell 4.2 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 2.1 million-barrel drop. U.S. gasoline futures gained about 1 percent. “A solid bearish build to crude inventories has been offset by some chunky draws to the products,” said Matthew Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Crude futures also tracked a slump in U.S. equities, which sputtered without positive developments in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade talks were moving along well, but offered few details. “Selling in equities played a significant part in today’s oil price weakness,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “Further reduction in risk appetite and any additional downgrades in the global economic growth path could eventually weigh across the energy spectrum.” The markets have been hit by surging U.S. crude production, which, according to the EIA, held at an all-time high of 12.1 million barrels per day last week. The rise in North American production undermines supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its non-member allies, including Russia, that has helped crude prices rise about 20 percent this year. OPEC and its partners have pledged to curb output by 1.2 million bpd, and they are likely to push back their decision whether to extend the production agreement to June from April, sources said. Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp released rival Permian Basin projections on Tuesday pointing to increased shale oil production in the largest U.S. oil patch.

-7.947971056144517," Chevron, Exxon take turns wooing investors with shale boasts NEW YORK (Reuters) - The two biggest U.S. oil companies tried to outdo each other on Tuesday, boasting about their prowess in shale to lure investors to their side. Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp released dueling Permian Basin projections that, if realized, would cement the rivals as the dominant players in the West Texas and New Mexico field, with one-third of Permian production potentially under their control within five years. Chevron expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of next year, 59 percent above current production, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023, it said at its annual meeting with equity analysts in New York. The stakes are such that Exxon on Tuesday forecast shale production of 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024, grabbing the spotlight on the day Chevron was making a case in its oil growth. “Our investors don’t need to wait several years for the story to come together,” Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an apparent dig at Exxon, which has been investing heavily in the Permian to reverse production declines. “We’re delivering now.” The Permian Basin pumps around 4 million barrels per day now and IHS Markit expects it to hit 5.4 mbd in 2023, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia. Wirth said at a press conference that he had been “busy” and had not seen Exxon’s Permian goal, which was released while he was speaking to analysts. He said, however, that Chevron’s production could exceed 900,000 barrels daily if the company decided to increase drilling rigs from the 20 currently in operation. “It’s a decision we haven’t taken yet but we certainly have it under active consideration,” Wirth said. “It’s a good story that could get even better.” Oil companies are trying to win back investors after years of underperforming other industrial sectors and the S&P 500. The weighting of energy shares in the S&P 500 index fell to 6 percent in 2018, from 8.4 percent four years earlier. Like Exxon, Chevron has begun to emphasize achieving faster payoffs from investments in shale rather than the megaprojects of the past. “The key driver of cash flow growth over the medium term remains the Permian, which continues to perform ahead of expectations,” said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited. Chevron said it expects global production to rise 3 percent to 4 percent annually through 2023. Executives said the company would return more cash to investors this year through dividends and $4 billion in share buybacks aiming to achieve a 6 percent shareholder return. The company also raised its estimate of its reserves in the Permian, in Texas and New Mexico, to 16.2 billion barrels of recoverable resources from 9 billion. The San Ramon, California-based company expects to sell assets worth $5 billion to $10 billion bit.ly/2tOctMy between 2018 and 2020, including production assets in Denmark, Azerbaijan and Britain's North Sea. The company’s annual capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of $19 billion to $22 billion between 2021 and 2023. Chevron expects to spend $3.6 billion in the Permian Basin and another $1.6 billion in other shale fields. Chevron’s other shale holdings include the Marcellus in the Northeastern U.S., the Duvernay in Alberta, Canada and the Vaca Muerta in Argentina. Wirth also touched on Venezuela, where Chevron, the largest U.S. oil company still in operation there, is under pressure from U.S. sanctions. He said Chevron’s employees are safe and its operations are “in good shape,” and that it has taken “the long view” on the country. Wirth said he continues to talk with U.S. government officials. “We’re trying to be sure that we understand the policy objectives of the government and the government understands the ramifications of policy actions they might take,” Wirth said."

The target is five times as much as the company now produces in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico where the world’s largest publicly traded oil company has 1.6 million acres. Exxon said in a statement that its production would be profitable in the Permian even if oil prices fell to $35 per barrel. U.S. oil futures settled at $56.59 a barrel on Monday. Exxon has 48 rigs working in the Permian - about 10 percent of the region’s total, according to General Electric’s Baker Hughes - and expects to increase the number of drilling rigs to 55 by year-end. It also has 30 sites under construction to handle oil and gas processing and water handling, and between 4,000 and 5,000 workers on its acreage on any given day, Staale Gjervik, the newly named president of Exxon’s shale arm XTO Energy, said in an interview on Monday. Gjervik replaced Sara Ortwein, who retired March 1, an Exxon spokeswoman said. Exxon bought out shale producer XTO in 2009 and in 2017 purchased the Permian holdings of the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Now the company is approaching the acreage with a manufacturing mindset, Gjervik said. “With the size of this acreage we can apply some of the more traditional mega-project type tools we have within Exxon Mobil,” he said. The Permian, which will produce about 4 million bpd this month, is expected to generate 5.4 million bpd by 2023, greater than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit. Exxon said last week that its oil and gas reserves globally rose nearly 23 percent last year, driven mainly by holdings in U.S. shale, offshore Guyana and Brazil. The reserve update, which is required annually by U.S. regulators, comes as Exxon has been spending heavily under Chief Executive Darren Woods on fields and projects to reverse weak oil and gas production. Exxon holds its annual meeting with analysts on Wednesday in New York."
-7.070371021771129," Exxon's Cyprus gas discovery adds another giant to East Med collection ATHENS/LONDON (Reuters) - ExxonMobil added another giant gas discovery to the east Mediterranean region after finding a gas-bearing reservoir offshore Cyprus but infrastructure bottlenecks and geopolitical disputes mean output from the field could be far off. Exxon, together with partner Qatar Petroleum (QP), estimated in-place gas resources in the reservoir at 5 to 8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, similar order of magnitude to the Aphrodite and Calypso gas finds nearby, also in Cypriot waters. The region’s gas output has begun to soar thanks to older discoveries finally bearing fruit. Israel’s Leviathan field, found in 2010 with around 22 tcf, will fully come online in November, though the 2015 Zohr discovery offshore Egypt with up to 30 tcf is already producing. “This is the biggest find so far in Cyprus and based on some official data it is one of the biggest finds worldwide in the past two years,” Cypriot Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis said. Exxon’s Vice-President of Exploration for Europe, Russia and the Caspian, Tristan Aspray, said the company will now analyze data from drilling the reservoir, known as Glaucus-1. Exxon owns a 60 percent of the block, Block 10, with QP holding the rest. Industry consultants Wood Mackenzie said they estimated recoverable resources of Exxon’s field to be 4.55 trillion cubic feet. That compares to its 6.4 tcf estimate for Calypso, found by Italy’s ENI and France’s Total last year. “Glaucus is a giant. It will be one of the biggest discoveries of the year,” Senior Research Analyst for Europe, Robert Morris, said. “(It) maintains the East Mediterranean’s position as one of the world’s premier exploration hotspots.” The new discoveries have prompted Egypt, which has the ability to liquefy and regasify gas for LNG trade, to try to establish itself as a regional hub. It also provided a degree of energy security to Israel. In Cyprus, development could be complicated by the internationally-recognized government’s dispute with Turkey, which does not recognize its right to develop the resources. Meanwhile, Cyprus’ Aphrodite, which was first discovered in 2011, has been delayed as block stakeholders Noble Energy, Delek and Royal Dutch Shell renegotiate their production sharing agreement with the government. A development concept for Aphrodite is also still being debated, with some now advocating that the gas be sent to Egypt to be liquefied and exported onwards on LNG tankers. Morris said commercialization of the Exxon field was also “not straight forward”. “There is limited space in local markets and existing export infrastructure. And the volume is insufficient for ExxonMobil and its partner Qatar Petroleum to feed a two-train LNG plant – which had been the partnership’s goal,” he said. He said Exxon may instead look to cooperate with Calypso finders Eni and Total. “A joint development would potentially serve up enough gas to support a greenfield LNG development.”"

-7.584900999630187," Exclusive: Exxon adds veteran traders to bulk up oil trading - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has hired veteran crude traders Mitch Rubinstein and Michael Paradise in Houston, to further boost its trading capabilities, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. In a break from its past, Exxon has been building a global cadre of experienced traders and beefing up risk management systems to lift profit. Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company by market capitalization, has historically stood apart from rivals by limiting trading activity out of concerns it would be accused of market manipulation. The oil major has lagged behind rivals BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses. Both Rubinstein and Paradise, both of whom will be based in Houston, left commodity trader Noble Group Ltd in 2017. Rubinstein was managing director and global head of crude oil at Noble until 2017, when rival Vitol SA agreed to buy Noble Americas Corp. Noble was once Asia’s biggest commodity trader, and has restructured after facing insolvency last year. Before Noble, Paradise was Citigroup Inc’s director of oil trading in Houston. Exxon also recently hired Gary Pace, a senior gasoline trader, sources familiar with his move said. Pace was most recently at investment bank Macquarie in Houston and previously worked for Shell’s U.S. trading arm, according to his LinkedIn profile. Last year, Exxon hired at least four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66. In 2018, it also hired former BHP Billiton Plc trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader. A spokeswoman for Exxon declined to comment. Pace and Rubinstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rubinstein updated his LinkedIn profile to reflect his move to Exxon, but his exact title is not clear. A source familiar with the matter said he has already started at the company. Exxon has been aiming to expand trading and marketing around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings. “That is the style of the guys they are hiring,” one industry source said. This week, Exxon said its oil and gas reserves rose nearly 23 percent last year, driven mainly by increases from holdings in U.S. shale, offshore Guyana and Brazil."
-6.633258364524332," Exxon's reserves up 23 percent on gains in U.S. shale, offshore (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday its oil and gas reserves rose nearly 23 percent last year, driven mainly by increases from holdings in U.S. shale, offshore Guyana and Brazil. The reserve update, which is required annually by U.S. regulators, comes as the largest publicly traded U.S. oil producer has been spending heavily under Chief Executive Darren Woods on new fields and projects to reverse weak oil and gas production. Exxon said it added 4.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves in 2018, bringing its total to 24.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels at the end of 2018. Proved reserves are those considered economically and geologically feasible to produce in the near future. The 2018 additions put the company’s reserves life at 17 years based on current production rates. “Multiple new discoveries offshore Guyana, continued growth in the Permian Basin and a strategic acquisition in Brazil greatly enhanced our already strong portfolio of high-quality, low-cost-of-supply opportunities,” Woods said in a statement. Exxon plans to increase capital spending to $30 billion this year from $26 billion in 2018 as it expands operations in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and develops large- scale projects in Guyana and Mozambique. The U.S. oil major cited significant additions from shale and other unconventional sources, which added 1.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Higher oil prices last year contributed to proved reserves additions of about 3.6 billion boe. Overall reserves were reduced by 800 million boe because of future production reductions at a Netherlands gas field, the company said. Exxon’s stock gained 14 cents on Tuesday to $78.64 as oil futures inched higher and the overall stock market dipped. The company’s shares are up about 1 percent in the past 52 weeks."

-4.523087477699283," Exxon asks U.S. regulator to block climate-change resolution: investors (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is trying to block an investor proposal that calls on the world’s largest publicly traded oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions, two of the investor groups involved said on Sunday. Exxon in late January wrote to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the proposal, which is set for a vote at its May annual meeting, is misleading and an attempt to “micro-manage the company,” spokespeople for investors supporting the proposal said. The Financial Times reported on the letter earlier on Sunday. The Church Commissioners for England (CCE), the endowment fund of the Church of England, an institutional investor that supports the proposal, as well as New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who manages the state’s pension fund that is pushing the proposal, both saw the Exxon letter, officials for both groups told Reuters. “Trying to strike out a shareholder proposal from institutional investors with a fiduciary responsibility to manage climate risk is an outdated reflex,” CCE head of responsible investment Edward Mason said in a statement. “Our proposal deserves more serious consideration.” Exxon rivals Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP Plc have taken steps to broaden disclosure on greenhouse gas emissions or tied executive pay to reducing emissions. Investors supporting the Exxon proposal manage a total of $1.9 trillion and are led by DiNapoli. “Exxon is trying to deny shareholders’ right to vote on a significant climate risk concern,” DiNapoli said in a statement on Sunday. Exxon’s position is “shortsighted and disappointing.” Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email on Sunday that the company did not have anything to share ahead of the company proxy being filed. The proposal, led by New York state’s pension fund, calls on Exxon to start setting targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that are “aligned with the greenhouse gas reductions goals established by the Paris climate agreement,” including for use of its own products. But those short, medium and long-term targets would allow shareholders to supervise its “day-to-day” considerations, Exxon wrote to the SEC. CCE spokesman Mark Arena said that Exxon told the SEC that it has already put many of the measures the proposal requires in place. The 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit a rise in average world temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. In 2017, DiNapoli spearheaded a campaign that convinced a majority of shareholders to call on Exxon to detail risks it could face from rising global temperatures. Exxon produced a report last year outlining how global oil demand could drop sharply by 2040, but critics said the report fell short on areas like how climate policies could affect company finances."

The companies will collect data from Exxon’s wells and other production assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company holds 1.6 million acres, and make it immediately accessible to Exxon workers. The value of the agreement was not disclosed. But the partnership is the industry’s largest in cloud computing, Exxon said in a statement. The technology would allow equipment leaks to be immediately detected to reduce repair times in remote locations, and apply artificial intelligence to analyze drilling and completions data, Exxon said. Exxon has pledged to increase its Permian Basin production to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2025. The company’s fourth-quarter Permian production was 190,000 barrels of oil and gas per day. The Permian, which produces about 3.85 million bpd, is forecast to generate 5.4 million bpd by 2023, greater than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit.

-1.8662837063160547," Australia's Oil Search banks on 2020 sign-off for major expansion MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search is confident its partners ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA will be ready to sign off on two big projects in 2020 that together will double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea. Oil Search had first hoped the projects to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant would be approved in 2019, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country a year ago. “It was a very tough year in Papua New Guinea for a range of reasons and it started with the earthquake,” Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten said. The quake killed more than 100 people in the rugged highlands region of one of the world’s poorest countries, destroyed homes, roads and runways and knocked out gas and oil facilities. It also stoked long-running antagonism against the PNG LNG project, as the country’s take from the development has been much lower than anticipated and the government has been slow to pay out royalties to local communities. Some people even blamed oil and gas operations for triggering the quake. “In that context, we were doing a lot of negotiations on major projects and those sensitivities, I think, have been really well addressed,” Botten told Reuters after the company reported its annual results. Total is set to sign an agreement with the government by early April on its Papua LNG project, and Exxon Mobil is expected to follow soon after on terms for an expansion of its PNG LNG plant and development of a new gas field, P’nyang, Botten said. Total’s Elk and Antelope fields, new gas from PNG LNG fields and P’nyang are set to feed gas into three new processing units at PNG LNG, roughly doubling its output to 16 million tonnes a year, at a cost of around $13 billion, according to analysts. “I’m very confident that a 2020 final investment decision is very achievable,” Botten said. Oil Search, which has a 29 percent stake in the PNG LNG project, posted a 13 percent rise in annual profit, boosted by higher prices for its LNG and oil, which offset a loss of output after the earthquake. Net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to $341.2 million from $302.1 million a year earlier, but fell short of analysts’ forecasts around $360.83 million, according to Refinitiv data. Oil Search raised its full year dividend to 10.5 cents from 9.5 cents in 2017. Oil Search’s shares fell 1.5 percent in a slightly firmer broader market. Production is expected to return to pre-quake levels in 2019 and unit production costs are forecast to fall 15-20 percent on the back of higher production, it said."
3.865895041261032," Shell leads cash race but Exxon catching up LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell widened its lead over Exxon Mobil as king of cash among the world’s top oil and gas companies last year but its U.S. rival could catch up with its investment drive in new production. The five leading firms, known as oil majors, more than tripled profits and doubled cash generation since 2016 as deep cost cutting bore fruit after an industry slump. Unlike previous cycles, most executives have promised in the past week to stay thrifty, with memories of the 2016 oil price plunge below $30 a barrel still fresh and the outlook remaining foggy. (Graphic: Kings of cash - tmsnrt.rs/2TF9NMu) For investors, it’s been a bumpy ride. In the past five years, oil majors broadly underperformed global stock markets. A sharp drop in crude prices in the last quarter of 2018 to below $50 a barrel from a four-year high of $86 a barrel in October was a bleak reminder of the uncertainty. But stronger than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2018 reported over the past week gave the sector a boost as companies surprised investors with their resilience to generate profit, or breakeven, at oil prices around $50 a barrel. A barrel of benchmark Brent is now trading around $60. [O/R] “The cyclical driver is higher oil prices and strong refining margins but underlying this is a structural move to lower breakevens which is driving higher cash flows,” said Rohan Murphy, energy equity analyst at Allianz Global Investors. “I think the companies will remain disciplined,” he said. “When I meet the managements of these companies they are enthused about the future rather than feeling constrained.” After Exxon and Shell, the other three majors are U.S. firm Chevron, Britain’s BP and France’s Total. (Graphic: Oil profits - tmsnrt.rs/2UO61Rj) (Graphic: Flowing Cash - tmsnrt.rs/2UNIwYG) Exxon is the outlier of the group for now, as it boosts its spending to develop large-scale projects in Guyana and Mozambique and its sprawling U.S. onshore shale portfolio. The company, still the biggest energy firm in terms of production and market size, was slow to respond to the drop in crude prices, lagging rivals when they slashed costs, sacked employees and sold assets in the past three years. But under Chief Executive Darren Woods, who succeeded Rex Tillerson when he became U.S. secretary of state from 2017 until last year, Exxon is undergoing profound changes in its operations and structure in an effort to catch up. (Graphic: Exxon vs. Shell: A tight race for production - tmsnrt.rs/2UPYsJU) Exxon will increase capital spending to $30 billion this year from $26 billion in 2018. It is also trying to sell large assets in Azerbaijan and Tanzania. Woods told analysts in a fourth quarter earnings call that the Irving, Texas-based company would accelerate divestments. “Exxon Mobil has pulled the divestiture value creation lever much less than peers over five and 10 years,” said Doug Terreson, analyst at Evercore ISI. “It is timely for them to divest and use proceeds to reinvest in higher quality areas.” Exxon has pledged to double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025. Anglo-Dutch Shell is still set to retain the crown for cash generation until the end of the decade thanks to rising production and its dominance in liquefied natural gas (LNG). But Exxon’s new production should sharply narrow the gap, according to estimates by HSBC, which has a ‘hold’ rating on Shell and ‘buy’ on Exxon. While Exxon invests heavily into future production, Shell’s output growth is set to slow after years of gains following the acquisition of rival BG Group in 2016. For Shell and other rivals which have held back on new investments, the race to find new reserves to replace depleting fields will be a key challenge, said Darren Sissons, portfolio manager at Canadian investment management firm Campbell, Lee & Ross. “The trade off of balance sheet and reduced exploration and production (E&P) and capital expenditure has worked to strengthen balance sheets with the cost being reserve life deterioration,” Sissons said. “The next wave of E&P was largely started tepidly last year by Exxon and BP but all the others have now joined in.”"
3.872212862181807," Hungary calls on U.S. to spur Exxon gas project in Black Sea BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The United States could help Hungary diversify away from Russian energy by encouraging ExxonMobil to proceed with long-stalled plans to develop the Domino-1 gas field in the Black Sea, Hungary’s foreign minister said. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto discussed diversification of Hungary’s natural gas imports with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Wednesday, the ministry said on Thursday. He asked Perry to do what he could to facilitate the start of production from Domino-1 which is controlled by Exxon and Romania’s Petrom, a subsidiary of Austrian firm OMV. Discovered off Romania in 2012 with estimated gas reserves of 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet, the companies have since sought greater clarity from Romanian authorities before developing the field. Exxon said in January it was continuing to evaluate the project, pinning its final investment decision on factors including “competitive and stable fiscal terms for existing offshore concessions for the duration of the agreements.” OMV Chief Executive Rainer Seele said on Wednesday that the company was in dialogue with the Romanian government over the project, which is expected to cost a billion euros. Szijjarto said it was in Hungary’s strategic interest that the consortium make the investment required to produce the gas and that Hungary has access to this new source of energy. Hungary could import the gas via a pipeline Romania is building from the Black Sea through an interconnector between the two countries, which will be capable of handling reverse flows, Szijjarto was quoted by the ministry as saying. In November, Perry called on Hungary and its neighbors to reject Russian gas pipelines which Washington says are being used to cement Moscow’s grip on central and eastern Europe. Import-reliant Hungary gets most of its gas from Russia and Russian firm Rosatom is involved in a 12.5-billion-euro expansion of Hungary’s Paks nuclear power plant, the country’s main domestic source of electricity. Last year Hungary agreed to buy 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia in 2020."

3.170151068983995," Qatar Petroleum, Exxon invest in $10 billion Texas LNG project WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday they are investing in a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, as companies race to meet global demand for the fuel. Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin early this year. The project will add production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024. Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter. “Golden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said of the final investment decision. Woods and Qatar Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi signed the deal at the Four Seasons hotel in Washington in the presence of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The deal is proof that two of the world’s top energy producers can work together and “support rather than subvert an open energy marketplace,” Perry said. The Trump administration has promoted gas drilling and LNG exports in part to offer European customers alternatives to piped natural gas from Russia, while slashing Obama-era environmental regulations on energy operations. “To understand how critical this is, imagine how Europe feels when the winter winds begin to blow and Russia has its hand on the pipe valve,” Perry said. Russia has in recent years slashed gas shipments to Europe through Ukraine during pricing disputes. Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds 70 percent. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. Exxon has signed an agreement to buy a 12.4 percent interest in the existing terminal and a pipeline from ConocoPhillips, and the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals, both companies said. The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business. Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-24. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country. Energy industry construction firm McDermott International Inc and its partners, Chiyoda International Corp and Zachry Group, have won a contract worth more than $1 billion to build the export project, McDermott said separately on Tuesday. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year."

2.9347784513844895," Exxon Mobil profit tops estimates as production rebounds HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimates, pushing its shares up as oil and natural gas output rose slightly on a year-over-year basis. The company’s fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago. But earnings excluding the impacts of tax reform and impairments rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago. Analysts had forecast a $1.08 a share profit excluding one-time items, according to data from Refinitiv. Exxon’s oil equivalent production rose to just over 4 million barrels per day, up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. The company said its output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, rose 90 percent over a year ago. Results for oil and gas production were “especially strong,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. “It was a good quarter to end the year. I think the focus now will be on improving the cash flow,” he said. Exxon is not planning share buybacks this quarter, though, which makes it the only international oil company “not currently repurchasing shares,” analysts with Simmons Energy said in a client note. The company now expects to spend $30 billion this year, up from about $28 billion it had forecast previously, and analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a client note that the higher spending “takes away from the ‘sizzle’ of the quarter.” CEO Darren Woods said Exxon would sanction liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Mozambique this year. Qatar Petroleum and Exxon are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with the $10 billion Golden Pass LNG Terminal export project in Texas. Pretax earnings in its refining business were $2.7 billion, up $1.70 billion over the same period the year prior. Exxon earned $1.1 billion more pretax in its upstream business than it did in the fourth quarter of 2017, and said higher natural gas prices were partially offset by lower liquids pricing. Pretax profits in Exxon’s chemicals business were down $191 million on weaker margins, growth-related expenses and higher downtime and maintenance. Woods credited better-than-expected results to the company optimizing its operations across the board, and said it has an advantage because of its ability to tie decisions in the oil field to logistics and refining. “Irrespective of where we are in the cycle, we’re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,” he said. Woods joined a conference call with analysts this morning for the first time since becoming CEO two years ago. Production declines have been a significant issue in previous quarters for Exxon and it is a “positive sign” that production improved in the fourth quarter, said Muhammed Ghulam, analyst with Raymond James. But he noted the earnings beat was “partially driven by one-time asset sale gains of more than $800 million” from a refinery sale. Exxon shares closed up 3.6 percent at $75.92. They are down about 11 percent in the last year. Exxon is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average."
4.772670926625385," Imperial Oil hits brakes on rail shipments after government output cuts (Reuters) - Canada’s Imperial Oil Ltd is grinding its rail shipments to a near halt and reviewing a multi-billion-dollar oil sands project, due to uncertainty caused by government-ordered production cuts, its chief executive officer said on Friday. The Canadian province of Alberta ordered mandatory production cuts starting in January to ease an oil glut, lifting Canadian prices sharply. Alberta this week said it would now ease those curtailments slightly. Integrated producers like Imperial, majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp, were hurt by rebounding Canadian prices last month because they weaken their refining margins. CEO Rich Kruger said Imperial reduced rail shipments in January nearly in half, to 90,000 barrels per day, and plans volumes “near zero” in February due to the curtailments’ impact. “With the stroke of a pen, the government picked winners and losers,” he said on a quarterly conference call. “The incentive to move crude by rail has been erased. It’s negative, uneconomic.” A discount of at least $15 per barrel on Canadian heavy oil compared with U.S. prices is needed to make rail economical, but the discount shrank last month to less than half that, Kruger said. In December, Imperial dramatically increased rail shipments and intended to raise them further, he said. The cuts were necessary for protecting jobs, said Mike McKinnon, spokesman for Alberta’s energy minister. The government expects the differential between Canadian and U.S. prices to eventually settle into a more sustainable level, he said. Imperial is scaling back rail shipments as demand for heavy crude from U.S. Gulf Coast refiners climbs with U.S. sanctions against Venezuela taking hold. Imperial has pipeline contracts to ship crude there. “It reminds me of an old movie, Planes, Trains and Automobiles - any way we can get it there in the right market conditions makes sense,” Kruger said. Rail was an “insurance policy” against full pipelines for Imperial’s plans to build the 75,000 bpd Aspen oil sands project, but it is now re-evaluating its assumptions related to Aspen, Kruger said. “The curtailment order, it’s introduced new risk and new uncertainty,” he said. “Is it short-term? I don’t know. We think it’s prudent to re-evaluate and look at the assumptions.” Even so, Imperial’s 2019 capital budget released on Friday includes C$800 million associated with Aspen, which would cost C$2.6 billion. Earlier, Imperial posted a quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates, as cheap crude enhanced margins at its refining division. Imperial shares fell 4.4 percent in Toronto to C$35.65."
4.772670926625385," Exxon, Chevron fourth-quarter profits lifted by U.S. shale gains HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, two of the world’s largest oil producers, on Friday posted improved quarterly earnings that benefited from double-digit percentage increases in production from the top U.S. shale field. Shares of both companies rose about 3 percent. The two U.S. oil majors missed the first stage of the shale boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and have been investing billions of dollars to make up for lost time. They are betting their size and other businesses offer advantages smaller producers cannot duplicate. Combined, the two companies pumped 677,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in the shale field last quarter, close to a fifth of the region’s total oil production, according to figures released on Friday. Exxon said its fourth-quarter Permian production was 300,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 93 percent from a year ago and up 12 percent over the third quarter. Chevron’s output in the Permian jumped to 377,000 barrels per day, up 84 percent from the same period a year earlier. “In just two years we have doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs, and more than doubled our production,” Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said on an earnings call. Both companies are tying their shale operations to logistics and refining arms that independents do not have. “We’re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said on an earnings call, noting the company’s close coupling of pipeline, logistics and oil refining operations to shale. In nine of the previous 10 quarters Exxon’s overall oil and gas output dropped, but its fourth-quarter production edged up to just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 3.9 million in the year-ago period. Production at Exxon, the nation’s largest oil and gas producer, was “very strong,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. The Permian, now producing 3.85 million barrels per day, is forecast to generate 5.4 million barrels per day by 2023, greater than any single OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit. Shale fields’ fast payoff is lifting both companies’ earnings and cash flow. Chevron generated $9.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, up from $8.0 billion a year earlier. Its 2019 capital spending budget is going toward projects that can deliver cash within two years, Wirth said. Exxon, in addition to shale, continues to invest heavily in major refining, chemical and offshore projects. That has not sat well with some investors. Its stock is off 13 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. Exxon is the only international oil company “not currently repurchasing shares,” Simmons Energy said in a note. Exxon shares were up 3.03 percent at $75.50 in afternoon trading, and Chevron shares were up 3.04 percent at $118.13. Exxon’s fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago, when results benefited substantially from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impacts of tax reform and asset impairments, earnings rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago. Chevron reported a quarterly profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier."
4.772670926625385," Exclusive: Qatar, Exxon to proceed with $10 billion Texas LNG project - sources LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with a $10 billion project that will expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Texas, three people familiar with the transaction said. ConocoPhillips, the third partner in the existing import terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake and does not plan to participate in the expansion, the people said. LNG demand is soaring. Worldwide consumption of the fuel is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. Golden Pass LNG began as a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas able to handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day. However, as U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, the demand for export capacity has increased. The potential $10 billion expansion, first announced in 2014, would focus on this new market dynamic. It is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest some $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint. The most likely buyer for ConocoPhillips’ stake is Exxon Mobil, two of the people said, adding that the existing partners do not want to bring in another participant, as plans for the project are in advanced stages. Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in the LNG export project, and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. Exxon expects this year to “sanction” the Golden Pass export terminal and another LNG project in Mozambique, Chief Executive Darren Woods said Friday on a conference call with analysts. The company has been “working very closely with QP (Qatar Petroleum), our partner in Golden Pass, to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term,” Woods said. Qatar was the world’s largest LNG producer in 2017 and has annual output of 77 million tonnes. Exxon and ConocoPhillips declined to comment, while Qatar Petroleum could not immediately be reached for comment. ConocoPhillips’ stake sale led to delays in announcing the final decision to proceed with the project, one of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The move comes as ConocoPhillips hones its focus on international projects. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Firms are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. That’s well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year’s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie’s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said last month. More than 320 million tonnes of LNG was shipped globally in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country."

10.768674440720284," Exxon CEO combines exploration units to reverse output declines HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday outlined a major reorganization of its global exploration businesses aimed at reversing years of weak oil and gas output. Chief Executive Darren Woods, who took over the helm two years ago, has spent billions to buy production, build new pipelines and expand refineries after a series of costly misfires on deals under predecessor Rex Tillerson. Woods, who will address Wall Street analysts on an earnings call Friday for the first time as CEO, has been pleading with investors for patience as he restructures its sprawling businesses. The Exxon veteran replaced Tillerson, who became U.S. Secretary of State in February 2017, and reorganized Exxon’s refining operations that year. Exxon, which has spent heavily on U.S. shale and deep-water blocks in Brazil and Guyana, has posted lower output in nine of the last 10 quarters. “I am skeptical that this decision will make any real difference in practical terms,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. He cited hurdles and a sharp drop in output in a gas field in the Netherlands that accounts for 2.5 percent of Exxon’s total production. The reorganization will fold seven companies into three as of April 1, merging units for production, exploration, development, gas and power marketing, and others. The new companies - ExxonMobil Upstream Oil & Gas Co, ExxonMobil Upstream Business Development Co and ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solutions Co - are designed to help the company double profits by 2025 and better coordinate oil and gas production with logistics and refining operations. “Our focus is on increasing overall value by strengthening our upstream business and further integrating it with the downstream and chemical segments,” Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said in a statement. Liam Mallon was named president of ExxonMobil Upstream Oil & Gas, Steve Greenlee president of ExxonMobil Upstream Business Development, and Linda DuCharme president of ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solutions. XTO Energy, which Exxon acquired for $41 billion in 2009, will be part of Upstream Oil & Gas, a spokesman said. One of the new business units will oversee its existing portfolio of exploration projects, and handle future acquisitions. Analysts have been pushing Exxon to sell some assets to improve returns. Analysts expect Exxon to earn $1.08 per share for the fourth quarter, excluding one-time items, according to Refinitiv data. Exxon shares rose 0.6 percent to $72.71 shortly before the close. They fell to $65.51 in December, a level last reached in October 2010."

13.500622681762787," Exxon OK's project to nearly double size of Texas refinery: sources HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has given final approval to an expansion that would nearly double the size of its 365,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery, making it the largest in the United States, said two people familiar with the company’s plans. The largest U.S. oil producer, which has been considering a third processing unit at the plant since at least 2014, has authorized financing for equipment needed to convert shale crude from its West Texas oilfields into precursors for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products. The authorization is the final step to begin building a third crude distillation unit (CDU) that would process between 250,000 and 350,000 bpd of light crude at the refinery located 87 miles (140 km) east of Houston. With a 250,000 bpd CDU, the plant’s total capacity would reach 615,644 bpd, placing it ahead of the nation’s largest, Motiva Enterprises’ 603,000 bpd refinery, in nearby Port Arthur, Texas. “It has been approved,” said one of the people familiar with the refinery expansion. Employees have been asked to keep the approval confidential, said the person, who could not be identified because of the restrictions. The company has not publicly disclosed the cost of the expansion, which is part of a $20 billion investment program outlined in 2017 to increase its U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing over 10 years. Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said on Monday she had no updates on the status of the project. In October, she had confirmed that site preparation work had begun in advance of a final decision. Last October, Exxon has said construction on the project was expected to begin this year after a final investment decision, and estimated the work would be completed in 2022. Exxon aims to triple its daily crude production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) by 2025. Last year it agreed to form a joint venture with Plains All American Pipeline LP that would build a pipeline able to carry 1 million bpd of oil to its refineries in Baytown and Beaumont."

15.91300345906298," UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil signs preliminary Wilhelmshaven LNG deal -Uniper * Uniper, ExxonMobil to work out details in coming months * Wilhelmshaven FSRU expected to start operations in H2 2022 * Will take U.S. LNG from Freeport (Adds detail, background, context) FRANKFURT, Jan 25 (Reuters) - German utility Uniper on Friday said ExxonMobil had signed a preliminary deal to take a substantial share of the regasification capacity at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) floating terminal planned for Wilhelmshaven. “The heads of agreement (a non-binding draft) is an important step towards the realisation of the Wilhelmshaven floating storage and regasification (FSRU) project,” said Keith Martin, Uniper’s chief commercial officer. “The FSRU will provide LNG companies from the United States, but also other countries from around the world, with the opportunity to deliver LNG into the German and European markets,” he said. LNG is seen helping the German government diversify away from pipeline gas arriving from Russia, Norway and the Netherlands. Suppliers, most notably Qatar and the United States, have expressed interest. The Wilhelmshaven FSRU is expected to have a send-out capacity of 10 billion cubic metres per year and will be Germany’s first LNG terminal. It is expected to begin operating in the second half of 2022. Uniper and ExxonMobil will continue their discussions over the coming months to seek binding agreements, Uniper said. Wilhelmshaven is a deep-sea port close to storage facilities and pipelines. In December, Uniper said it had entered into agreements with Japanese shipping group Mitsui OSK Lines to own, operate and fund the FSRU. Uniper has always stressed its role will be a facilitator, handling the marketing of the volumes, developing the FSRU into a multi-user facility and finding more buyers keen on booking capacity. Longer term, it could use the capacity partly to optimise sales of LNG volumes it will be drawing from Freeport in the United States from second half of this year, where it has separately started global marketing efforts. Uniper said it will press on with receiving operations permits from the relevant authorities for Wilhelmshaven. In January, it struck a deal with Dutch firm Titan LNG to add logistics services at Wilhelmshaven. FSRUs are cheaper and quicker to build than on-shore terminals. Germany has three LNG terminal projects. Some observers are puzzled by the interest as many LNG terminals in the EU suffer from underutilisation, but concede new facilities will support further diversification as the market expands.

12.386238491400448," In Papua New Guinea, Exxon's giant LNG project fuels frustration PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - From her red-roofed home near Papua New Guinea’s capital of Port Moresby, Isabelle Dikana Iveiri overlooks a giant plant used by Exxon Mobil Corp to liquefy billions of dollars’ worth of natural gas before it is shipped to Asian buyers. Dikana Iveiri can also see swaths of muddy shoreline, where mangroves have been felled for firewood by locals who don’t have electricity, gas, or money to buy either. The $19 billion Exxon-led PNG LNG project was supposed to be a game-changer for PNG, a vast South Pacific archipelago beset by poverty despite its wealth of natural resources. But much of the promised riches, through taxes to the government, royalties to landowners and development levies to communities, have arrived well below Exxon’s own commissioned forecasts, if at all, according to landowners, the World Bank and the PNG government. “My family has been here a long time,” said Dikana Iveiri, one of several landowners interviewed by Reuters near the PNG LNG plant. “Our royalties are not going well; they are using our land but not paying us properly,” she said referring to both Exxon, which pays the royalties and the government, which distributes them. Since gas exports began more than four years ago, Dikana Iveiri said she had received just one royalty payment in 2017. She was expecting about 10,000 kina ($2,885) based on information given to her by the government and community leaders. She said she received 600 kina. Exxon, community leaders and the government did not comment on Dikana Iveiri’s specific situation but in a statement to Reuters, Exxon said distribution of royalties and benefits to the LNG plant site landowners started in 2017. Cash payments to individual landowners would depend on how many landowners were in a precinct and were just one of the benefits communities received, Exxon said. The project employs nearly 2,600 workers, 82 percent of whom are Papua New Guinean and Exxon said it has invested $360 million to build infrastructure and pay for training and social programs. “We could not be more pleased to see how the benefits are flowing to the communities at the LNG plant site, to see how investments are being made in important infrastructure such as schools and health that demonstrates the process is a good one and it works,” ExxonMobil PNG Managing Director Andrew Barry told a mining and energy conference in Sydney in December. Barry said Exxon was hoping royalties would begin flowing in the pipeline and upstream areas “in the not too distant future”. The government admits it has made mistakes. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill, who was part of the government but not the leader in 2009, said many of the disputes around PNG LNG stemmed from the way the government and Exxon proceeded with the project without first resolving landowner claims. “It should have been done before, it wasn’t only for Exxon and the partners but even the government at the time did not do the proper clan vetting, proper identification of the land owners - they allowed this project to go on without that,” O’Neill told Reuters. Treasury, the treasurer, and the Prime Minister’s spokesman declined to provide responses to Reuters’ questions about the project. (GRAPHIC: ExxonMobil's LNG facilities - tmsnrt.rs/2QhGSAz) GAS-POWERED MONEY SPINNER PNG LNG was completed ahead of schedule and exported 8.3 million metric tonnes in 2017, compared to its anticipated design capacity of 6.9 million tonnes, according to the project’s website. Exxon does not disclose the project’s revenue or profits but research house Morningstar estimates it has generated $18.8 billion in revenue for Exxon and its partners since production started in 2014. The project’s break-even price of around $7.40 per million British Thermal Units (mBTU) compares favorably to an average over $10/mBTU for eight recent gas projects in the region, according to analysis by consultancy Wood Mackenzie and Credit Suisse. “The plant capacity has performed phenomenally,” Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic told Reuters. “On cost, it’s much lower than peers ... it’s got an ample resource base and it’s got a well-disciplined operator in the form of Exxon.” The project’s contribution to Papua New Guinea’s economy and government finances is less clear. PNG’s Treasury does not report project income figures, but government budget papers show tax revenue flowing from PNG LNG has been well below expectations. In its 2012 budget, the PNG government estimated it would receive $22 billion in revenue over the project’s life to 2040. In November, the government slashed its revenue forecast in half to $11 billion over the life of the project. It identified 11 tax concessions, which along with a drop in gas prices, amounted to hundreds of millions in kina in annual revenue forgone. A 2017 World Bank analysis found the project partners had negotiated favorable methods of calculating royalties to the government that allowed them to take various deductions. Combined with tax concessions, the project created “a complex web of exemptions and allowances that effectively mean that little revenue is received by government and landowners,” the World Bank said. Exxon did not respond to questions regarding the World Bank findings and the World Bank declined to provide further comment. Exxon’s partners, which include Australian-listed Oil Search Ltd and Santos Ltd, and a subsidiary of Japan’s JXTG Holdings Inc, referred Reuters’ questions to Exxon. Exxon said in a statement to Reuters the project has generated 5 billion kina in revenue for the government and landowners via taxes, royalty and benefit payments. The figure includes revenue to the PNG state-owned stakeholders. “SOME MISTAKES” A second LNG project, Papua LNG, led by France’s Total with Exxon and Oil Search as minority partners, is scheduled to finalize an agreement with the PNG government in early 2019. Papua LNG, a new gasfield using the same but expanded processing plant, could commence production as soon as 2024, according to Total. Analysts estimate it will cost around $13 billion. “The experience of the first project developed by Exxon and Oil Search, there was some criticism, some mistakes,” Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters in an interview in Port Moresby, referring to relations with landowners. “Some lessons (are) being taken out … around the management of landowners and trying to engage at an early stage with them.” Total has agreed to an undisclosed annual minimum payment to the government and to reserve some gas for local industry, he said. Exxon did not respond to requests for comment on Pouyanne’s statements. In its statement, Exxon acknowledged that “distribution of royalties and benefits in some project areas were delayed since the start of production due to court action by a small number of landowners which prevented the relevant government departments from completing their administrative processes.” Exxon said it was committed to assisting the government ensure landowners receive royalty and equity dividends as soon as practicable. Disputes have broken out within communities near PNG LNG facilities as landowners fight to have their claims recognized. Some clashes have been fatal, said Highlands clan leader Johnson Tape, one of 16 clan leaders with a claim over the Komo Air Field, used by the Exxon project. “Our clans fought each other, but now there is peace; we are one team fighting Exxon,” said Tape. Christopher Havieta, the governor of Gulf Province, where gas fields for the new project are located, said locals wanted to avoid the experiences of Exxon’s PNG LNG. “It was a foundation project and so a lot of exemptions were made and the end result is we have a lot of social problems that have risen up.”"
14.146763697906989," Dutch citizens demand end to quake-hit Groningen gas production THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Angry Dutch citizens on Thursday asked their country’s highest court to put an immediate end to natural gas production in the Groningen region due to the risk of earthquakes. Once Europe’s largest gas field, decades of extraction have led to dozens of minor tremors every year, damaging thousands of homes and sparking unrest among locals and prompting authorities to impose caps on activity at Groningen. “Seismic risks are still increasing, all we hear are promises of future improvements, but nothing’s really happening”, resident and politician Nette Kruzenga said in court. An unusually severe magnitude 3.4 quake prompted the Dutch government last year to pledge to end production by 2030 and to lower it as quickly as possible in coming years. Groningen is run by NAM, a 50-50 joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil. Output is set to drop to 19.4 billion cubic meters (bcm) in the year that began in October, down from a 2013 peak of 54 bcm. It will be cut by another 75 percent in the next five years, the government has said. “Production has already been lowered to the lowest possible level”, state lawyer Hans Besselink said in court on Thursday. “Further reductions would lead to shortages at companies in the Netherlands and abroad.” But many in the region still feel their safety concerns are being ignored, as tremors are expected to continue, while numerous attempts to set up a compensation scheme for damage and repairs have failed. The petitioners demand drilling be stopped immediately, or at least capped at 12 bcm per year, a level the Dutch gas regulator last year said would limit risks. “We need two to three years to get at 12 bcm, it’s impossible to reach it straight away without disrupting consequences,” Besselink said . The government expects the 12 bcm level might be reached by the end of 2020, by switching large industrial users away from Groningen gas and by building extra capacity to convert high-caloric imported gas to the low-caloric gas needed for the Dutch network. The Netherlands still depends on Groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply and export obligations.

Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said the Baytown refinery was performing planned maintenance on several units. “This turnaround, the largest maintenance and improvement program in the site’s history, started January 2019 and is expected to last several weeks,” Nordin said. The 280,300-bpd Pipestill 8 CDU may be shut up to two months for the planned overhaul at the Baytown refinery, which is the nation’s third-largest by capacity, the sources said. Last week, a catalytic reformer was shut at the Baytown refinery. Along with Pipestill 8, Exxon plans to shut a sulfur plant and the 55,000 bpd Gofiner hydrotreater, the sources said. Pipestill 8 accounts for half of the refining capacity of the Baytown plant. It is the largest of three CDUs doing the primary refining of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks for all other units at the refinery. Reformers convert refining byproducts into octane-boosting components of gasoline. Sulfur plants extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide removed during the production of motor fuels. Hydrotreaters extract hydrogen sulfide during the production of motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules."

In addition to the 110,000 bpd Crude A CDU, Exxon was restarting the 16,000 bpd alkylation unit and the 45,000 bpd coker, the sources said. “Exxon Mobil continues to re-start units that were safely idled following an electrical fire that occurred,” said company spokeswoman Sarah Nordin. The fire in a transformer at the refinery’s co-generation plant on Saturday caused no injuries, the sources said. The refinery’s return to full production would probably stretch into next week, the sources said. Crude A is the smaller of two CDUs at the refinery doing the primary breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks for all other units. The coker converts residual crude oil from distillation units into hydrocarbon feedstock or petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

14.38772794284333," U.S. top court rejects Exxon in climate change document dispute (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the attorney general of Massachusetts to obtain records from Exxon Mobil CorpXOM.N to probe whether the oil company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change. The justices declined to hear Exxon’s appeal of a ruling by the top court in Massachusetts holding that state Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the company misled consumers and investors. The high court’s action marked the latest setback for Exxon in its efforts to halt the Massachusetts investigation and a similar one by New York’s attorney general, who in October filed a lawsuit against the company. “The law is clear. The Attorney General’s Office has the authority to investigate Exxon’s conduct toward consumers and investors, and we are proceeding. The public deserves answers from this company about what it knew about the impacts of burning fossil fuels, and when,” said Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for Healey. A spokesman for Exxon declined to comment. New York’s lawsuit accused Exxon of engaging in a systematic scheme to deceive investors about the impact that future climate change regulations could have on its business. Exxon has called the claims “meritless.” The Massachusetts and New York investigations were launched following 2015 news reports that Exxon’s own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those news reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. Healey in 2016 issued a civil investigative demand to Exxon seeking documents to investigate whether it had violated the state’s consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products. Exxon said that because it is incorporated in Texas and New Jersey, Healey had no basis to seek documents to conduct a Massachusetts-based investigation. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in April held that jurisdiction existed because of Exxon’s control over advertising conducted for about 300 franchise gas stations operating under the Exxon and Mobil brands in Massachusetts. Exxon has called the Massachusetts and New York investigations politically motivated."

19.25820925284753," Exxon continues drilling offshore Guyana as Venezuela lodges complaint CARACAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Wednesday its oil drilling and development activities offshore Guyana were unaffected by a weekend incident in which Venezuela's navy stopped two exploration vessels the company had hired. Venezuela’s navy halted seismic data collection by the boats on Saturday. The governments of each of the two South American neighboring countries said the exploration vessels were in their territorial waters. A century-long border dispute has heated up in recent years as Irving, Texas-based Exxon has discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana’s shores and said it could be producing 750,000 barrels of oil by 2025 from wells there. Its 10 oil finds are at least 110 km (68 miles) away from the northwest part of the Stabroek block where the incident took place, the company said. The company has a permit from Guyana to explore the Stabroek block. ""Exploration and development drilling is continuing in the southeast area of the Stabroek Block,"" the company said in a statement. An Exxon spokeswoman declined to say whether the two vessels, owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services PGS.OL, planned to continue their survey. Exxon shares rose about 4 percent on Wednesday as oil prices jumped, both recovering from sharp declines earlier in the week. Hess Corp HES.N, which owns 30 percent of the project, also surged 9.3 percent after plunging more than 12 percent on Monday. Markets were closed on Tuesday for the Christmas holiday. Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it had sent a formal protest to Guyana’s government over its decision to allow “unilateral and arbitrary” exploration and other activities in the area without consultation. The ministry said it had previously protested to Georgetown over a “notice to mariners” that it said was issued Dec. 6 and which it said detailed how Exxon’s Guyana subsidiary would start a seismic survey in the area lasting until Dec. 31. Guyana’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A notice of the survey published on Guyana’s Maritime Administration Department’s website was dated Dec. 7, and said the work was scheduled for a six-month period. Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the discrepancies over the dates. In OPEC-member Venezuela, crude output is near its lowest levels in 70 years amid an economic crisis and mismanagement under military rule.

17.72623201878431," Venezuela calls U.S. comments on Guyana dispute 'interventionist' CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's foreign ministry on Tuesday described as ""interventionist and disrespectful"" U.S. comments on a weekend incident in which the country's navy stopped two ships exploring for oil for Exxon Mobil XOM.N off Guyana's coast. Each of the neighboring South American countries says the incident on Saturday occurred within its territorial waters. In response to the event, the U.S. State Department said Venezuela had behaved “aggressively” and called on the country to “respect international law and the rights of its neighbors.” “It is evident that the U.S. government is interfering in a matter that is not at all incumbent upon it, with the goal of promoting corporate interests closely linked to the Washington ruling elite,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. Socialist President Nicolas Maduro has accused the United States of plotting to invade Venezuela and overthrow his government, while Washington has placed sanctions on Venezuela’s debt and members of Maduro’s government over accusations of corruption, human rights violations and election-rigging. A century-long territorial dispute between Venezuela and Guyana has flared up in recent years with Exxon’s discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana’s coast. In OPEC-member Venezuela, crude output is hovering near 70-year lows amid a severe economic crisis. Guyana says Caracas gave up its claim to the Essequibo, a sparsely populated jungle area making up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory, after an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal, but Venezuela later backtracked on that decision. The U.N. this year referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice. Two vessels owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services PGS.OL and under contract by Exxon Mobil were conducting seismic survey work in the area. The ships stopped their work and turned east after the Venezuelan navy told them Guyana did not have jurisdiction there. When asked on Monday if there were plans for the vessels to resume their activities, Guyana Foreign Affairs Minister Carl Greenidge said the government was “in discussion” with Exxon. Neither Exxon nor PGS immediately responded to requests for comment on Tuesday, and the U.S. State Department declined to comment. On Monday, the Caricom group of 15 Caribbean nations including Guyana - many of which have historically received subsidized oil from Venezuela under Caracas’ Petrocaribe program - said it viewed the “interception” by Venezuela’s navy “with grave concern.” “Such acts violate the sovereign rights of Guyana under international law,” the group said in a statement."

17.72623201878431," Guyana, Exxon in talks after Venezuela dispute halts marine survey CARACAS (Reuters) - Guyana’s government is “in discussion” with Exxon Mobil after two ships searching for oil off the South American country’s coast halted work following a weekend confrontation with Venezuela’s navy, Guyana’s foreign minister said on Monday. Both neighboring South American countries said the Saturday incident had occurred within their territorial waters. A century-long border dispute has heated up in recent years as Irving, Texas-based Exxon XOM.N has discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana's shores. Guyana Foreign Affairs Minister Carl Greenidge said he could not ""for the moment"" say whether the two ships owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services PGS.OL and hired by Exxon would resume their seismic survey, or if they would return to the area where the incident occurred, citing the ongoing talks with Exxon. When asked if Guyanese authorities would provide the vessels with protection if they continue exploration, he said Guyana is “committed to resolving territorial disputes by peaceful means.” “We will therefore first try to explore and exhaust Diplomatic channels,” Greenidge said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters. “Guyana is a small state of less than a million persons compared with Venezuela’s population of 30 million.” Earlier on Monday, Exxon declined to say when the survey would restart, referring questions to PGS. Bard Stenberg, a PGS senior vice president, declined to comment on any resumption of the work or if the company has sought to have Guyana provide protection for its vessels. There were two PGS ships involved in the confrontation, the Ramform Tethys and Delta Monarch, Stenberg said on Monday. “A couple hours later we learned that the Venezuelan navy had withdrawn from the area,” he added. Critics of Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro say he has rekindled tensions with its eastern neighbor over the Essequibo region, a sparsely populated area making up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory that is also claimed by Venezuela, to distract from a severe economic crisis in the OPEC-member nation. Venezuela is home to the world’s largest crude reserves, but production is hovering near its lowest levels in 70 years due to underinvestment, hyperinflation, and mismanagement under military control of the company. Saturday's confrontation recalled an October 2013 incident when Venezuela's navy seized a ship carrying out a seabed survey for Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N in Guyana, accusing it of violating its maritime territory. Venezuela freed the vessel a week later."

The latest incident in a century-old border dispute comes after a series of offshore oil discoveries have given Guyana the potential to become one of Latin America’s largest producers. In OPEC member Venezuela, by contrast, crude output has tumbled to the lowest levels in nearly 70 years amid an economic crisis. The Ramform Tethys vessel, which belongs to Norwegian company Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) and was conducting seismic survey work on behalf of Exxon, stopped exploration and turned east after being approached by the Venezuelan navy, PGS spokesman Bard Stenberg said in a statement. “Guyana rejects this illegal, aggressive and hostile act,” Guyana’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Saturday, adding that the move “demonstrates the real threat to Guyana’s economic development by its western neighbor” and “violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country.” The ministry added that it would report the incident to the United Nations and send formal communication to Venezuela’s government. It said it would inform the governments of the various homelands of the 70 crew members aboard the vessel, flagged by the Bahamas, of the “threat to their safety.” A spokeswoman for Exxon said the U.S. oil firm’s seismic explorations in the western portion of Guyana’s Stabroek Block “have been paused until they can be safely continued,” and that the vessel was operating in Guyana’s exclusive economic zone. In a statement on Sunday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said its navy, during a routine patrol, had encountered two boats hired by Exxon in an area under “undoubtedly Venezuelan sovereignty” and “proceeded to apply the appropriate international protocols.” The ministry said the boats’ captains told the navy they had permission from Guyana’s government to explore in the area, and that the boats turned around after being told Guyana did not have jurisdiction in that area. It also said it informed the UN and sent a protest note to Guyana’s government. Neither PGS nor Guyana’s foreign ministry immediately responded to requests to clarify whether one or two research ships were involved in the incident. Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro has previously criticized Guyana’s decision to allow oil exploration in the waters off the shore of the Essequibo region, a sparsely populated and dense jungle area equivalent to around two-thirds of Guyanese territory that Venezuela also claims. Guyana says Caracas agreed to relinquish the area after a ruling by an international tribunal in 1899, but Venezuela later backtracked on that decision. The U.N. earlier this year referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice, a move welcomed by Georgetown but criticized by Caracas. The dispute has heated up in recent years as Exxon has announced the discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of oil off the shore of Guyana, an English-speaking nation of 750,000 with no history of oil production. In a statement, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino faulted Venezuela for the latest incident. “The Venezuelan Navy aggressively stopped ExxonMobil contracted vessels operating under an oil exploration agreement with the Cooperative Republic of Guyana in its Exclusive Economic Zone,” he said, saying Guyana had the right to explore there and urging Venezuela to respect international law and its neighbors’ rights. Washington is a critic of Maduro’s government, which it accuses of corruption and human rights violations. On Friday, Guyana’s parliament toppled the government in a no-confidence vote, paving the way for elections in three months."
19.805942783847424," ExxonMobil shelves Canada LNG export project LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp has withdrawn its WCC liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Canada from the environmental assessment process, it said on Thursday, signaling that the project has been shelved. The decision to pare its LNG project portfolio follows the go-ahead of a giant Royal Dutch Shell-led project in British Columbia, and Exxon’s focus on LNG projects in Asia, the Middle East and the United States. Global LNG demand is expected to double to 550 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2030, as countries like China move away from coal to cleaner fuels. The top import market for LNG is northeast Asia. Exxon’s West Coast Canada (WCC) LNG export project, located in northern British Columbia, was expected to produce around 15 million tonnes per year of LNG to serve Asian buyers, with plans for further expansion up to 30 million tonnes per year. The project was being jointly reviewed by the province and Canadian environmental regulators, an assessment that had been underway since 2015, though no major documents have been filed since 2016. Exxon formally withdrew from the process in a Dec. 5 letter to the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office, posted on the regulator’s website. “After careful review, ExxonMobil and Imperial (Oil Resources Ltd) have withdrawn the WCC LNG project from the environmental assessment process,” a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil confirmed in an email. Exxon’s decision signaled it is concentrating on LNG projects with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] and a proposed expansion of its chilled-gas operation in Papua New Guinea, said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners, LNG tanker brokers and consultants. “They have got a pretty robust pipeline of liquefaction projects globally. It would be natural to review that and see which would be competitive,” he said. Exxon has been “taking advantage of opportunities as they become available to invest, restructure or divest assets to strengthen our long-term competitive position and provide the highest return to shareholders,” said spokeswoman Julie King. LNG demand is growing but environmental groups say exports will boost carbon emissions in Canada, both through gas extraction and the liquefaction process. The WCC LNG export project planned to have liquefaction and storage facilities for natural gas, loading facilities and a third-party pipeline. Exxon’s shares were off 3.12 percent at $68.57 apiece, the lowest since August 2015."

15.52389752746453," Exclusive: Exxon Mobil secured U.S. hardship waiver from biofuels laws - sources WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N a financial hardship waiver this year temporarily freeing its Montana refinery from U.S. biofuel laws, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Exxon, which reported earnings of almost $20 billion in 2017, became the largest known company to be awarded a such a waiver by the Trump administration’s EPA under a program meant to protect the smallest fuel facilities from going bust. Farm state lawmakers have complained that the hardship waivers are being overused in a way that is killing demand for corn-based ethanol, and they were likely to criticize the waiver awarded to one of the world’s biggest and most profitable companies. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year or buy compliance credits from competitors that do. But it allows the EPA to exempt plants of less than 75,000 barrels per day if they show complying would cause financial hardship. The EPA has vastly expanded the program under President Donald Trump, but is reviewing how it handles further requests as it seeks to balance the competing interests of refiners and ethanol producers. Exxon’s waiver was granted before the review began, and covers its 60,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Billings, Montana, for the 2017 compliance period, said the sources, who asked not to be named. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud declined to comment on whether the refinery received a waiver, but pointed out that the waiver program requires the agency only to consider the financial situation of the refinery and not its owner. “This was a decision Congress made when drafting the Renewable Fuel Standard and EPA implements the small refinery exemption program consistent with that explicit direction,” he told Reuters in an emailed statement. ExxonMobil declined to comment. Reuters reported earlier this year that Andeavor MRO.N and Chevron CVX.N, both large and highly profitable refiners, were also granted recent EPA exemptions for their small facilities. The EPA keeps the identities of companies receiving waivers secret, arguing the information is business sensitive. But the agency recently began publishing the numbers of exemptions granted. It said it awarded 29 exemptions to small refineries in 2018 for the 2017 compliance year so far, up from 19 for 2016 and just seven for 2015. The EPA has attributed the program’s expansion mainly to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners that challenged its denial of their waiver requests under President Barack Obama’s administration. A federal judge ruled last year the EPA was using too narrow a test to evaluate applications. The EPA, which relies partly on advice from the Department of Energy, has asked DOE to review its scoring system for applications before considering additional waiver requests. Biofuel backers have argued that the waiver program’s expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, a supporter of the fossil fuels industry who sought ways to lower compliance costs for energy companies. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa responded to the news with a call for an overhaul of the waiver process. “That Exxon was reportedly granted a ‘small refiner’ waiver for ‘hardship’ just goes to show how abused the process has been,” he said in an emailed statement. “There’s no good reason multibillion dollar oil refining giants should be able to skirt the law.” Pruitt resigned amid a slew of ethics scandals last July and has been replaced in the interim by his deputy Andrew Wheeler. Trump has said he was likely to nominate Wheeler to serve as the permanent EPA chief. That would require U.S. Senate confirmation, and several powerful pro-corn Senators such as Grassley are agitating for measures to protect ethanol demand. “I suspect Wheeler would be more invested in maintaining the reputation of the agency,” a biofuels industry participant said, asking not to be named. “He also would not want to upset people who will have a say in his confirmation.”"

The administration of President Donald Trump in September proposed weakening requirements for repairing leaks of the greenhouse gas in drilling operations in a step toward rolling back an Obama-era policy that was intended to combat climate change. “We support maintaining the key elements of the underlying regulation, such as leak detection and repair programs,” Exxon Vice President Gantt Walton said in the letter dated on Monday. The company believes “reasonable regulations help reduce emissions” and support the use of cleaner-burning natural gas, the letter said. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, leaks from oil and gas wells during drilling. It accounts for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions but has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere. The oil and gas industry is the largest single source of U.S. methane emissions, according to EPA data."

9.454120547435577," Shareholders call on ExxonMobil to set greenhouse gas reduction targets NEW YORK (Reuters) - A number of institutional investors in ExxonMobil Corp XOM.N have said they will file a shareholder resolution which calls on the world's largest oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. The call, led by the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF) and the Church Commissioners of England (CCE), comes in the wake of shareholder moves at other major energy firms seeking to make them more responsive to climate change and its impact on the business. The statement released on Sunday by the CCE asked Exxon to disclose, for the first time, short, medium and long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from both its operations and the use of its products. “We want to see ExxonMobil develop a clear strategy for long-term sustainability, in line with international commitments for a safer climate,” Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the CCE, said in the statement. Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, added: “The world is transitioning to a lower carbon future and Exxon needs to demonstrate its ability to adapt or risk its bottom line along with investors’ confidence.” Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pair have previously teamed up to pressure Exxon on environmental issues, including on a shareholder resolution in 2017 which asked the company to disclose the impact of measures to combat climate change on its business. The NYSCRF and CCE are joined in the latest initiative, which will be filed for a potential vote at Exxon’s shareholder meeting in the spring of 2019, by other funds including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), and HSBC Global Asset Management, the statement added. Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS set out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets that were linked to executive pay in 2020, following pressure from its investors. BP BP.L and Total TOTF.PA have also set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but these are limited to their own operations."
7.611897816347481," Angola's Sonangol, Exxon Mobil sign oil exploration agreement LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola’s state oil company Sonangol and Exxon Mobil on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding for oil exploration in the country’s Namibe basin, the two firms said. Angola, Africa’s second-largest crude producer, is facing a steep output decline unless it can revive exploration in what was once one of the world’s most exciting offshore prospects. Sonangol is negotiating contracts for new blocks with oil majors and Angola plans to hold an auction next year, the first tender for exploration rights since 2011. Sonangol’s chairman Carlos Saturnino said the memorandum paves the way for the parties to start contract negotiations for new oil concessions, part of the state firm’s strategy to strengthen the search for new oil activities and discovery of new reserves. Exxon Mobil’s director general in Angola Andre Kostelnik, said the new field of exploration can be viewed as the resurgence of oil activity in the country. The signs of fresh exploration in Angola comes after a period of near-paralysis due to a lack of drilling success, a slump in oil prices and a deteriorating relationship between Sonangol and the oil majors.

Exxon said the project, located off the shore of the state of Victoria, is part of its continuing investment in the Gippsland Basin, an area rich in oil and gas. BHP will invest about A$200 million ($144.36 million) in the gas field, the miner said in a separate statement. Rising natural gas prices has become a political issue in Australia as households and manufacturers complain of higher costs, especially in the country’s more populous east coast. The Gippsland Basin joint venture continues to supply about 40 percent of east coast Australian domestic gas demand, Exxon said, adding that front-end engineering design work for the project was completed and key contracts awarded. “The West Barracouta project is an important investment, underpinned by strong economics and rates of return, that will unlock a high quality, new gas resource and will help offset Bass Strait production decline at a vital time for the east coast market,” said Graham Salmond, General Manager of BHP Petroleum Australia. “BHP is actively engaging with a diverse range of customers for future Bass Strait gas supply,” he said. The West Barracouta development is expected to achieve first gas from 2021.

5.390295441518636," BP targeted with first shareholder resolution on climate goals * Follow This tables resolution with BP and Shell * Organisation says might also target Exxon, Chevron * Resolution calls for reduction targets for all emissions LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Pressure on oil companies to tackle climate change is growing after an activist group for the first time filed a shareholder resolution urging BP to set hard targets for reducing overall carbon emissions. Follow This, a Dutch organisation that spearheaded a number of climate shareholder resolutions at Royal Dutch Shell’s AGMs over the past three years said it also filed one with the Anglo-Dutch company for 2019. It also plans to file a resolution with U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron “unless other parties file a similar resolution,” it said in a statement. The 2019 resolution calls on the companies to set and publish targets for the reduction of carbon emissions in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Accords to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The targets should include emissions from the drilling and refining operations as well as for the burning of fuels and products such as plastics which are sold to millions of customers around the world, known as Scope 3 emissions. BP CEO Bob Dudley has repeatedly opposed setting targets for Scope 3 emission reduction. It calls on the companies to set clear metrics to measure greenhouse gas emissions and disclose information on progress. “Targets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Follow This founder Mark van Baal. BP and Shell confirmed the resolutions had been filed. BP “will consider the resolution carefully and make a response and recommendation to our shareholders as part of our Notice of Meeting prior to the AGM,” a spokesman said. A Shell spokeswoman said the Follow This resolution was “unnecessary” after the company last week announced plans to set sector-leading emission targets that will be linked to executive pay and include Scope 3 emissions. The announcement, which followed extensive discussions with investors, marked a reversal for Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden who had previously opposed setting targets. “We are planning short-term targets for the net carbon footprint of our energy products. This will allow us to demonstrate clear progress towards our long-term ambition in this area,” Shell said. Shell’s board has consistently opposed the Follow This resolutions which were voted down with less than 6.34 percent of the vote since 2015. In the 2018 AGM, the discussion around the resolution however led to a heated debate between van Beurden and van Baal. BP earlier this year announced plans to keep emissions flat over the decade to 2025, which are nevertheless limited to its own operations. BP has faced several shareholder resolutions in the past focused mostly on emissions disclosure. (Reporting by Ron Bousso; editing by David Evans)"
2.8943606739353704," Qatar Petroleum to buy stake in ExxonMobil Mozambique blocks CAIRO (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum said on Saturday it had agreed to buy a 10 percent participating interest in three of ExxonMobil’s offshore exploration blocks in Mozambique’s Angoche and Zambezi basins. It will be part of a consortium made up of affiliates of ExxonMobil with a 50 percent stake, Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos with 20 percent, Rosneft with 20 percent interest, and Qatar Petroleum with 10 percent. Qatar and the United States plan to strengthen “energy partnerships,” the emirate’s minister of state for energy affairs, Saad Al-Kaabi, said in a statement after a meeting in Doha with his U.S. counterpart Rick Perry. “This is a milestone for Qatar Petroleum as it marks its first foray into Mozambique’s promising offshore basins,” Qatar Petroleum said in a statement on its website.

2.2303718300633673," Exclusive: Exxon, Chevron seek to exit Azerbaijan's oil after 25 years LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N and Chevron CVX.N are seeking to sell their stakes in Azerbaijan's largest oilfield, marking the retreat of the U.S. majors from the former Soviet state after 25 years as they re-focus on domestic production. Exxon is hoping to raise up to $2 billion from the sale of its 6.8 percent in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea, according to industry sources. Rival Chevron said in a statement to Reuters it had also decided to launch the sale of its 9.57 percent stake in ACG as well as its 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. Exxon spokeswoman Julie King declined to comment, saying “we don’t comment on market rumors or speculation”. A spokesman for Azerbaijan’s state energy company Socar said: “The report is about Exxon and there is no need for Socar to get involved.” For both companies, the sale would mark the end of a 25-year involvement. Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan’s current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994. The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the “the contract of the century” thanks to the field’s large reserves and hopes of future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas. Even though the project is operated by British oil major BP BP.L, it had received substantial U.S. government support and a total of five American companies initially participated in the deal, including Exxon, Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil and McDermott. BP said it had no information about Exxon’s or Chevron’s plans. The ACG project received particular Western support due to hopes it would help cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy, but those hopes faded as new large discoveries failed to materialize. Most U.S. companies sold out of the project or were acquired by rivals, while U.S. support to the Azeri administration also shrank. Azerbaijan also became more assertive in controlling its energy wealth by building up large stakes in its energy projects via state company Socar. Other than Exxon and Chevron, BP holds a 30.4 percent stake in ACG and Socar a 25 percent stake. The ACG fields still account for the lion’s share of Azeri oil output. They produced around three quarters of overall Azeri crude output, or nearly 600,000 barrels per day, in the first half of 2018. Other ACG consortium members include Japan’s Inpex with 9.3 percent and Norway’s Equinor with 7.3 percent. Turkey’s TPAO, Japan’s Itochu, and India’s ONGC Videsh have smaller stakes. Exxon and Chevron have in recent years increasingly focused on developing shale fields in the United States. Exxon is also set to invest billions in developing a string of large oil discoveries in Guyana, while Chevron is developing the extension of the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, estimated to cost $37 billion. The BTC pipeline transports the majority of ACG production from Baku through Georgia to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey."
2.2303718300633673," Norway's Equinor to start talks with Tanzania over LNG project OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor is ready to start talks with Tanzania on developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project based on a deepwater offshore discovery, the company said on Tuesday. Tanzanian President John Magufuli has asked his government to proceed with negotiations to set out the commercial and fiscal framework for the LNG project, Equinor, a majority state-owned energy company formerly known as Statoil, said. “Equinor will now proceed with our partner ExxonMobil with negotiations for a host government agreement,” an Equinor spokesman said in an email to Reuters. He said it was too early to say how long talks with the government could take and how much the project would cost. Tanzania said in 2014 that a planned LNG export plant could cost up to $30 billion. Royal Dutch Shell, which operates deepwater Blocks 1 and 4, adjacent to Equinor’s Block 2, previously sought to develop the LNG project in partnership with Equinor and Exxon Mobil. “Shell continues to work with the government of Tanzania to establish the most cost effective and competitive solution for the LNG project in Tanzania,” a company spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. “We believe the government is best placed to lead the right way forward to deliver the project,” she added. Shell declined to say whether it would join Equinor and Exxon Mobil or would pursue separate talks with the government. Shell said on its website the three blocks had sufficient gas reserves to build an onshore LNG plant, but the company was not immediately available to comment on whether it would join the other two in starting talks. Shell estimates its two blocks hold about 16 trillion cubic feet (453 billion cubic meters) of recoverable gas, similar to the volumes in Equinor’s Block 2. Reuters reported in June that Exxon Mobil was seeking to sell its 25 percent stake in Block 2 as it was focusing on an even bigger project in neighboring Mozambique."

5.0346050771023085," Strikes hit six oil refineries, two depots in France, CGT union says PARIS (Reuters) - French trade union CGT said on Thursday that a strike over wages and bonuses had hit output and deliveries at six out of France’s seven oil refineries, as well as at two major depots. CGT spokesman Thierry Defresne told Reuters that the two-day strike that started on Wednesday could be extended at some of the refineries on Thursday evening. The unions are holding talks with the French oil sector employers federation UFIP over wages on Thursday. Defresne said refineries affected by the strike included all four of Total’s refineries in France. The 253,000 barrel-per-day Gonfreville in Normandy, the 102,000 bpd Grandpuits site, the 220,000 bpd Donges refinery and the 109,000 bpd Feyzin refinery. He said that strikes had also been declared at the Ineos refinery in Lavera and Exxon Mobil’s Fos-sur-Mer plant, which are both in the south of France. As of now, only one refinery in France, Exxon Mobil’s 240,000 bpd Port-Jerome-Gravenchon refinery, was not affected by the strike, Defresne said. A spokeswoman for Total said output and products deliveries at three of its four refineries and a depot were slightly impacted by the strike. Exxon Mobil Corp said there was no production or delivery impact from the strike at its two refineries even though CGT had called for a strike. Ineos could not immediately be reached for comment. Workers at France’s CIM oil storage and dispatch services company, which handles supplies of crude to Total and Exxon’s refineries in the north of France, walked out in solidarity with the striking workers earlier on Thursday, CIM’s head Olivier Peyrin said. He said work was expected to resume at the terminal around 1800 GMT."
-0.4904360954176311," Papua New Guinea paves way for long-awaited Exxon, Total LNG expansion PORT MORESBY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A long-awaited project led by France’s Total SA that will help double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea has come another step closer, with the government agreeing to set financial terms early next year. The LNG expansion, which analysts estimate will cost $13 billion, is crucial to the Pacific island nation’s economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging in international energy markets. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said in the country’s capital of Port Moresby on Friday that “physical terms” had been agreed. He said negotiations over how revenue would be shared in the community and provincial governments required more work. “I’d say we are almost 50 to 60 percent through already about our understanding of revenue sharing,” O’Neill said, in response to questions from Reuters. Disagreements over land-owner rights and revenue-sharing agreements have been an almost constant feature of resource development in PNG. A non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on Friday is basically a commitment by the government to finalise a gas agreement in early 2019, which would lead to the development of Papua LNG, run by Total. The signing was held on the sidelines of the PNG-hosted Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said he hoped to make progress on the agreement quickly. “There is still some work to be done, but we are ambitious and I’d love to come back not in two years but in 10 months or before,” Pouyanne said. Papua LNG will supply gas from the Elk-Antelope fields for two new processing units, called trains, at Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant. At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to develop gas at the P’nyang field to help fill a third new train at the plant. All together the projects will double the plant’s output to around 16 million tonnes a year. Exxon said in an emailed comment that it was pleased to see progress on the Papua LNG talks. Oil Search, a partner in both Papua LNG and PNG LNG, said all parties were “aligned on the need to ensure that new LNG developments in PNG remain competitive with other new LNG projects worldwide”. The companies are racing to start exporting from the new trains by 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. But analysts say that timeline might be hard to meet as a final investment decision may not come until 2020 or 2021. “Ultimately the timeline for Papua will be dictated by Exxon’s patient and disciplined centralised decision making process, and all other parties will just need to fall in line with that,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic. Analysts estimate the expansion will cost around $13 billion, well below the $19.5 billion cost of the original project, which involved building a wide range of infrastructure from scratch, including a 700-km (435-mile) pipeline through the nation’s rugged highlands down to the coast. The government is aiming to strike better fiscal terms for the country than it did with Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG project in 2009, when it was looking secure the biggest foreign investment in the country amid the global financial crisis."

EXTAP will be able to participate in the Asia fuel oil paper and physical cargo processes as well as in the sour crude physical cargo process, including Dubai partials, Platts said. In June, Reuters reported Exxon was pushing deeper into energy trading, a shift for a company that has limited its past activity out of concern it would be accused of market manipulation. An Exxon Mobil spokesman in Singapore declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Singapore is the world’s largest marine fuels market and serves as Asia’s pricing hub for fuel oil as well as other petroleum products including gasoline and diesel. The Platts Dubai assessment is the price benchmark for millions of barrels of high-sulfur crude oil produced daily in the Middle East. The MOC is used by Platts to assess the value of crude oil, petroleum products, including fuel oil, and related derivatives."

The West African nation is receiving “huge interest” from international and local oil companies after the government launched its first bidding rounds for offshore blocks last month, Amewu told reporters. Exxon Mobil signed a deal with Ghana in January for exploration at the oilfield after direct negotiations without an open tender because of the nature of the field, where the depth ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 meters, the government said. The U.S. oil major is lead operator with 80 percent interest in the field, while state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corporation holds 15 percent. The deal required a local partner to own the remaining 5 percent. Exxon named GOIL as the partner about two weeks ago and the government has given the consent it needed at the ministerial level, Amewu said. The deal still requires parliamentary approval. Last month the government launched its first bidding rounds to award six blocks this year and another three in 2019 through a mix of open tenders and direct negotiations. “The interest that has been shown so far is huge and it is interesting to know that a number of international oil companies and national oil companies have all shown interest in our licensing round,” Amewu said. Ghana, which also exports cocoa and gold, produces around 200,000 barrels of oil per day from three fields."

Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N posted a 57-percent increase on prices there were up 44 percent over a year ago helped by a lower tax rate while Chevron Corp's CVX.N earnings doubled on surging output from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. While Exxon’s results topped Wall Street forecasts, but shares were up fractionally as its oil and gas production declined for the ninth of the last 10 quarters. Chevron’s shares rose 2.7 percent as it forecast continued strong oil production this quarter. Results for most of the world's top oil companies are returning to levels not seen in four years, driven by strong demand for oil and years of cost-cutting. Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and BP Plc BP.L this week reported profit of $3.8 billion. Irving, Texas-based Exxon is investing heavily to reverse its production declines. It spent $6.59 billion on capital projects during the quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year. Executives on Friday said the company plans to continue to prioritize spending on new projects and shareholder dividends over stock repurchases, something that investors have been calling for it to restart. Exxon halted buybacks except to offset dilution in 2016. “The company that a decade ago had the largest buyback program in the S&P 500 is now altogether absent from the buyback table,” said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov in a note on Friday. Chevron said it benefited from running 20 drilling rigs in the Permian basin during the quarter and new well designs that have boosted output. It produced 338,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter from the field and forecast sustained Permian growth this quarter. “The economic outcomes are really outstanding,” Pat Yarrington, Chevron finance chief, told analysts on Friday. She said that the San Ramon California-based company plans to hold to its full-year capital spending budget of between $18 billion and $20 billion, despite spending about $450 million more than it anticipated year-to-date. Exxon reported earnings of $6.24 billion, or $1.46 per share, while analysts had forecast a per share profit of $1.23.

The company’s third-quarter net income rose 57 percent to $6.24 billion, or $1.46 a share, compared with $3.97 billion, or 93 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had forecast a $1.23 a share profit, according to data from I/B/E/S on Refinitiv. With crude up 44 percent in the quarter over a year-earlier, results at Exxon and other major oil companies are returning to levels not seen in four years. Royal Dutch Shell posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and BP Plc this week reported profit of $3.8 billion. Exxon’s shares rose more than 1 percent to $81.61 in morning trading but are down more than 4 percent year-to-date on lower oil and gas production. Including the latest period, its oil and gas output has dropped in nine of the last 10 quarters. “It’s a modestly positive report,” said Brian Youngberg, an equity analyst at Edward Jones. “They had such a weak first half of the year, the bar was lower and they jumped over it.” Results benefited in part from a $360-million tax benefit that added about 7 cents a share to earnings, said Youngberg. Oil production fell 3 percent to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent and natural gas output dropped 4 percent, the company said. Its liquids output in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico rose 57 percent over a year ago as the company brought on 66 wells in the nation’s largest oilfield, Senior Vice President Jack Williams said during a conference call. Earnings from the company’s downstream unit, which refines crude oil into gasoline and other products, rose 72 percent to $1.64 billion, benefiting from fewer maintenance disruptions during the quarter and from growing supplies of discounted shale oil from West Texas and crude from Western Canada. Exxon officials said the company continues to prioritize investing cash into new production projects and to shareholder dividends rather than share buybacks. Investors have been pushing the company to resume repurchases which were halted in 2016 except to offset the dilution the stock issues to employees."

-7.080925626196816," New York sues Exxon for misleading investors on climate change risk HOUSTON (Reuters) - New York's attorney general sued Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Wednesday, alleging that the world's largest oil company for years misled investors about the risks of climate change regulations on its business. The suit, filed in New York Supreme Court, New York County, seeks undisclosed damages, a court order for a review of the company’s representations, and that the company corrects “numerous misrepresentations” to investors. It alleges Exxon assured investors it had properly evaluated the impact of climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” for the likely effects of future events on its business. However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, the suit claims. The company also failed to properly account for such costs in determining its volume of oil and gas reserves, or whether to write down the value of its assets, a metric important to investors, the suit claims. “The company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions,” Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.” Exxon “looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed,” said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement. He further described the suit as the “product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general’s inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing.” The suit was brought under the Martin Act, a civil statute that has been used by New York prosecutors to pursue fraud claims against investment and other financial companies. “In bringing this case, the state is yet again using the Martin Act as a political weapon,” said Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, calling the case “nothing more than a contortion of the securities litigation system.” Exxon unsuccessfully fought to halt the New York investigation and a similar probe by the state of Massachusetts that claims Exxon misled consumers with its statements on climate change. “This is a very significant lawsuit,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “The New York state attorney general has gotten a lot of documents and we should assume they filed the suit based on the information received during that process.” Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change."
-7.080925626196816," Breakingviews - Climate suit should light fire under Exxon owners NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The New York attorney general wants Exxon Mobil to pay. After several years investigating the company’s communications with shareholders, Barbara Underwood unveiled a suit that claims the $340 billion oil giant has misled investors about how climate change regulation would affect its business. Shareholders weren’t dupes, though. Their revolt last year forced the company to start addressing the issue. Legal heat should prod Exxon’s owners to demand more than baby steps. The world’s largest independent, publicly-traded oil company was already on the defensive with climate change. Last year shareholders voted to demand that the company disclose more about how carbon-related environmental risks would affect its business. Then there are the rolling lawsuits, including one earlier this year when two California cities sought to make Exxon pay for coastal flooding. The New York state AG’s lawsuit claims that Exxon didn’t properly account for future regulatory changes when it was valuing its businesses. Exxon called the claims “baseless” and said it is looking forward to refuting them. The company has some tricks up its sleeve. With California, for example, it used some of the government’s disclosures in bond documents to show that the municipalities had hedged their assumptions about climate change when it was trying to raise debt. Exxon, under pressure from shareholders, has made some changes since Chief Executive Darren Woods took over from Rex Tillerson at the beginning of last year. In March the company attempted to address shareholder concerns about the effect of climate during its investor day. This summer it ended its association with a conservative political lobby group. Then earlier this month it said it made a donation to a campaign that is working to promote a U.S. tax on carbon-gas emissions. None of that yet amounts to a thorough investigation of the climate risks in Exxon’s businesses. Nor has it mattered much to what shareholders care about the most: Exxon’s stock price. The shares are down almost 8 percent since Woods took over, after accounting for dividends, worse than the energy sector overall. Shareholders have mostly gone quiet, however, and they didn’t urge further action at this year’s annual meeting in May. New York’s lawsuit may just jolt some of them back into action."

The company also has begun hiring and training staff to operate what would be a third crude distillation unit at the site. The expansion would increase crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery by at least 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the current 365,644 bpd, the sources said. The proposed unit would convert crude oil from Texas shale fields into refined products, including diesel and gasoline. Exxon wants to triple daily crude production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent by 2025. Initial work has begun and construction of the crude unit is scheduled to start next year after a final investment decision, with processing beginning by 2022, spokeswoman Sarah Nordin confirmed in an email this week. “The company is proceeding with front-end engineering, design and other preparatory work to further increase the refinery’s crude refining capacity,” Nordin said. Nordin did not describe specific steps being taken at the refinery to prepare for the new crude unit, which is part of a $20 billion program to expand its U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing over 10 years. The refinery added an initial eight operators, who are gaining experience working on the two existing crude units. They will move over to the new processing unit after it is built, the sources said. Another element of the company’s preparations involves raising the site to resist flooding. The plant was swamped and shut by torrential rains from Hurricane Harvey last year and was not able to be fully returned to service for 36 days. “They’re building up the soil 10 to 14 feet (3 to 4.3 meters),” one of the sources said. The ground-level increase would place the base of the new crude unit above the level of Harvey’s flood waters. Exxon also is taking steps to increase crude delivery. It has agreed to join with Plains All American Pipeline LP on a pipeline to carry 1 million barrels per day of crude oil from the Permian Basin to Exxon refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Exxon is not the only refiner looking to expand along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Saudi Arabia’s Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] is seeking to buy or build another U.S. refinery and Chevron Corp recently said it is considering adding a refinery on the western U.S. Gulf Coast. Motiva’s 603,000 bpd plant in Port Arthur, Texas, currently is the largest in the United States. With the Exxon expansion, the Beaumont refinery would surpass Motiva’s capacity."
-7.080925626196816," Romanian parliament clears legal framework for Black Sea offshore gas BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania’s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved on Wednesday a much-awaited offshore hydrocarbons legal framework, needed before energy groups OMV Petrom and Exxon decide whether to pursue further investment in the Black Sea. Austria’s OMV has said it was confident Bucharest would establish an acceptable framework for its Black Sea exploration project, regarding taxes and royalties, before it can give a final nod to “a billion euro investment”. Under the bill, which must be signed into law by President Klaus Iohannis, holders of current offshore petroleum agreements with Romania, will be levied the current level of royalties, taxes and gross production thresholds. It also stipulates that companies involved in production operations in Romania’s offshore perimeters, would need to sell at least 50 percent of yearly gas output in a “transparent, public and non-discriminatory way on the centralized market.” The exploration of the Black Sea Neptun block is a joint venture between OMV’s Romanian subsidiary Petrom and U.S. major ExxonMobil and includes the first deep-water exploration well in Romanian waters. In 2012, the firms said they had discovered 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet (42-84 billion cubic meters) (bcm) of gas reserves at the ExxonMobil operated Domino-1 well, around 170 km offshore. Unlike other countries in the region, European Union member Romania is almost entirely energy independent, importing less than 10 percent of its gas needs from Russia, with the rest produced locally, largely by state producer Romgaz and Petrom."
-9.791121535184011," Exclusive: Exxon, Rosneft to build LNG plant with Japanese, Indian partners - sources MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Rosneft ROSN.MM and U.S. ExxonMobil XOM.N plan to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in a consortium with Indian and Japanese partners, spreading the estimated $15 billion cost, two sources familiar with the talks said. The four companies - Rosneft, Exxon, Japan's SODECO and India's ONGC Videsh ONGC.NSONVI.NS - are partners in the Sakhalin-1 group of fields that will supply the gas, but Exxon and Rosneft had initially planned to build the LNG plant without the other consortium members. As well as spreading the costs among more stakeholders, the broader involvement of the participants may mitigate sanctions risk. Initially, Rosneft and Exxon unveiled their joint plans to build an LNG production site in Russia’s Far East to President Vladimir Putin in 2013. But production of the super-cooled, seaborne gas has so far failed to materialize for many reasons, including international sanctions against Moscow for its role in the Ukraine conflict. LNG production itself is not subject to sanctions, but Russian companies have limited access to financial markets due to the restrictions. Exxon had to leave most of its other new joint projects with Rosneft due to the West’s punitive measures against Moscow. Two sources - one person close to Exxon, and a high-ranking Rosneft executive not authorized to speak publicly - said both firms are committed to carrying out the LNG plant project within the framework of the Sakhalin-1 agreement. Sakhalin-1, a hydrocarbon project, is led by Exxon with a 30 percent stake. Twenty percent belongs to Rosneft, with the rest split between SODECO (30 percent) and ONGC Videsh (20 percent). “No one is interested in financing such a project alone,” the source close to Exxon said. Asked how the LNG plant deal would be structured, the senior Rosneft executive said: “It will be Sakhalin-1.” The sources did not say how the financing of the LNG plant would be shared between the participants. The source close to Exxon said a decision whether to go ahead with the LNG project was expected in 2019, otherwise the project risked losing its market amid growing competition. Currently, two LNG plants, Novatek's NVTK.MM Yamal LNG and Gazprom's GAZP.MM Sakhalin-2, are producing the frozen gas in Russia, which has set an ambitious target of more than doubling its global LNG market share to 20 percent in the next decade. Sakhalin-1 is pumping close to 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, a record high, as well as natural gas that it has been unable to sell abroad. Gazprom has the exclusive rights to export pipeline gas from Russia. Sakhalin-1 has to pump most of the gas back into the ground, while a small amount goes to local customers in the sparsely populated region. Decade-long talks with Gazprom and the consortium over gas sales have not yet yielded any results. Rosneft, ONGC and SODECO declined to comment. The Russian Energy Ministry and the government also declined to make any immediate comment. “The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,” an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in Moscow said in emailed comments sent in response to Reuters questions. Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive, said in June that the LNG plant would be built just across the Tatarsky strait in the port of De Kastri in Russia’s Khabarovsk region, where Rosneft already has an export terminal for Sakhalin-1 oil. Sechin said then that the plant’s annual capacity was seen at 6 million tonnes of LNG, with supplies aimed at starting in 2025. Gazprom’s Sakhalin-2 has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes. The source close to Exxon confirmed the technical plans for the plant and said the project partners are considering the option of laying a gas pipe along the existing oil pipeline from Sakhalin-1 to the LNG plant in De Kastri."

Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China’s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet. Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon’s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company’s plans. That combination “will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,” said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company’s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster. “China’s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,” the Exxon manager said. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company’s LNG investments in China. Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon’s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing. Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides “a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.” Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex. Exxon’s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals’ exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China’s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country’s closed markets. The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world’s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years. Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations. His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal. Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment. The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon’s in China in jeopardy. In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany’s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor. The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2wDdglt China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities. That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects. But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China. “Major Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,” said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia. Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil. That is changing, in part because China’s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it. The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases. “LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,” said Credit Suisse’s Kavonic."

The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases. “LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,” said Credit Suisse’s Kavonic."

The contribution, made to the Americans for Carbon Dividends political action committee of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), was disclosed by the group on Tuesday, less than a month after Exxon agreed to contribute $100 million to oil companies’ efforts to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “Applying a uniform cost across the economy is consistent with our principles on how to manage the risk of climate change,” Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email. “We’ve been supportive of a revenue-neutral price on carbon for a decade.” The $1 million contribution will be spread over two years. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, has supported a carbon tax in the past and has stepped up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations. Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming. The Climate Leadership Council’s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group. “We’re in the very early days of this organization,” said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money raised to be returned to consumers. The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said. The council’s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz.

-19.540772987662937," Exxon Mobil eyes multi-billion dollar investment at Singapore refinery: executive SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N is considering a multi-billion dollar investment at its Singapore refinery, the company's largest, ahead of new global shipping fuel regulations starting in 2020, a senior executive said on Wednesday. “We are currently assessing a multi-billion project in our integrated manufacturing facility here in Singapore,” Matt Bergeron, vice president of Asia Pacific Fuels Business at Exxon, said at a bunkering conference. “Should the project proceed, we plan to implement proprietary technologies that will convert lower value by-products into cleaner higher value products including 0.5 percent sulphur fuels that we believe will be the compliant option for the vast majority of the marine sector,” Bergeron said. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is introducing new rules on marine fuels from 2020, limiting the sulphur content to 0.5 percent, from 3.5 percent currently, to curb pollution produced by the world’s ships. The shipping and oil refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were announced in 2016. Exxon’s Singapore refinery is the company’s largest, with a capacity of about 592,000 barrels a day. Singapore is also home to the oil giant’s biggest integrated petrochemical complex. “We have already made significant investments at a number of other refineries around the world in order to increase our production capacity of cleaner fuels with lower sulphur content,” Bergeron said. Exxon in September announced it was planning to spend more than $650 million to upgrade the UK’s largest oil refinery, Fawley, on England’s south coast."
-18.579141811416683," Exclusive: Exxon explores sale of U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets - sources (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N is exploring the sale of many of its U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, as higher prices prompt the world's largest publicly traded oil company to review its portfolio, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Major oil companies have been looking to concentrate development operations in a few key areas. Irving, Texas-based Exxon is focusing on promising acreage in offshore areas such as Guyana and Brazil and onshore in the Permian basin of Texas. Exxon has asked a small number of parties to gauge their potential interest in the company’s Gulf assets, ahead of deciding how to proceed, according to two of the sources, adding that any sale would likely happen next year. The company is considering selling deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico that currently produce about 50,000 barrels per day of oil, one of the sources added. The company has stakes in Gulf assets that produce the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day and 730 million cubic feet of gas daily, according to company data. Exxon produces the equivalent of about 2.2 million barrels of oil daily. While Exxon is the most valuable publicly traded oil company, it is only the ninth-largest operator in the Gulf, trailing heavyweights like Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS and BP Plc BP.L, along with smaller Gulf-focused independent oil companies like Fieldwood and Talos. The Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production, has become overshadowed by shale formations onshore and by new offshore plays like Guyana, where Exxon’s giant Liza field is expected to produce 120,000 barrels per day of crude in its first phase. “Exxon Mobil continually reviews its assets for their contribution toward meeting the company’s operating needs, financial objectives and their potential value to others,” a spokeswoman for Exxon said in a statement. “We remain committed to conducting business in the U.S. Gulf region, as we have for more than 100 years.” The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Exxon's positions in the Gulf of Mexico include a 50 percent stake in development of the large Julia oil field, and a 47 percent stake in the Hadrian South natural gas field, which it operates. The company also has a 9 percent piece of Heidelberg field and 23 percent of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N, according to Exxon's latest annual report. Exxon’s partners in developing many of these sites could have a contractual right of first refusal on any opportunity to acquire Exxon’s interest, one of the sources said. Exxon has sold 29 leases or stakes in leases to other companies since 2014, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The company has not acquired any leases from other companies in that period. In the last 10 federal lease sales of oil acreage, Exxon has bid on 28 leases, compared with rivals like BP, which has bid on 52 leases. Exxon shares were up 0.7 percent to $86.42 each on Tuesday. Shares have risen 6.5 percent this year, trailing broader equity averages. Qatar, which has a number of partnerships with Exxon, including in Brazil, would be well positioned to make an offer for the Gulf of Mexico assets, the sources said. Exxon has an extensive partnership with Qatar, including partnering with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] to develop the world’s largest non-associated natural gas field off that country’s coast. Qatar Petroleum also bought a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon’s affiliates in Argentina in June, giving Qatar access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country. Qatar Petroleum’s chief executive told Reuters in May that the company was expanding its upstream business and assets abroad, particularly in the United States. Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips holding smaller stakes. It could not be established whether Qatar will indeed make an offer. Qatar government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This week, Chevron Corp agreed to sell its North Sea holdings off the shore of Britain."
-19.006077738100224," Exxon-led Russian consortium to pay Rosneft $230 million to settle production dispute NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Russia’s Sakhalin-1 consortium, led by ExxonMobil, has agreed to pay Russian energy giant Rosneft $230 million in an out-of-court settlement of an oil production dispute, an executive of an Indian consortium partner said on Friday. Rosneft had filed a $1.4 billion lawsuit in the Sakhalin district arbitration court in Russia’s far east, accusing the consortium of unjust enrichment, an allegation the consortium denied. The dispute centered around how oil should be shared between the Sakhalin-1 concession and an adjacent Rosneft field. “Rosneft was demanding that it should be paid $1.4 billion ... We have agreed for an out-of-court settlement and will be paying $230 million as Rosneft entered the other area in 2011,” N.K. Verma, managing director of India’s ONGC Videsh, a partner in the Sakhalin-1 consortium, told Reuters. Rosneft, which also has a stake in the Sakhalin-1 consortium, declined to comment. ExxonMobil in Moscow declined immediate comment. “We don’t have anything we can share,” said Suann Guthrie, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in the United States. P.K. Rao, director for operations at ONGC Videsh, said the out-of-court settlement was reached about 10 days ago. The row was over oil “cross-flows” from Northern Chayvo oilfield, controlled by Rosneft. Sakhalin-1, off Russia’s Pacific Ocean coast, is operated by Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, through which ExxonMobil owns 30 percent in the project. Rosneft and ONGC control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium Sodeco owns 30 percent. ONGC’s Verma said production at Sakhalin-1 reached 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from some 200,000 bpd, as Russia had lifted output restrictions as part of a global deal with OPEC. Russia’s total oil production hit a post-Soviet high of 11.347 million barrels per day this month. The dispute between Rosneft and the Sakhalin-1 consortium unfolded against the background of a wider rift between Russia and the United States over what Washington called Moscow’s meddling in a 2016 presidential election. Exxon had to quit some joint projects with Rosneft, including developing Arctic oil and gas, over sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States. Participation in Sakhalin-1 is not punishable by sanctions."

Exxon has plowed big money into Brazil to replenish its dwindling reserves, starting with an oil auction in September of last year. Before that, it was among the few oil majors without an exploration presence in Brazil’s pre-salt, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. The American oil major is expected to bet big on Friday in an oil auction that could be its last crack at Brazil’s coveted offshore oil for another four years, as a wide-open election spurs fears about barriers to foreign investment."

-18.26724612166567," In U-turn, Exxon, Chevron to join industry climate initiative LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum are joining a group of major international oil and gas companies in an initiative aimed at curbing carbon emissions in the sector, they said in a statement on Thursday. The move marks a U-turn for Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The top two U.S. oil and gas producers had resisted joining the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) after its launch in 2014. Exxon and Chevron differ from their rivals on several topics around climate, and in the past have refused to join a call by the European firms for a global price on carbon. Together with its three newest members, the group will account for around 30 percent of global oil and gas production and 20 percent of primary energy consumption, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a tweet. “The addition of 3 U.S. companies gives us more impact to lead the industry’s response to climate change,” he wrote. The OGCI currently comprises 10 firms including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Total as well as national oil companies of China, Mexico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. The announcement comes ahead of Climate Week in New York next week, a global gathering of world and company leaders around climate change. “We are pleased to be joining OGCI to work constructively on addressing the risks of climate change,” Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in the statement. The OGCI created a $1 billion fund to develop technologies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the sector as the world aims to shift toward a low-carbon economy. Exxon and Chevron will each contribute $100 million to the fund, the statement said. Exxon in recent years came under fire from investors and faced lawsuits over its climate policies and disclosures. It will expand its investment in greenhouse gas emission-reduction research as part of the initiative, the company said in a statement. Earlier this year, Exxon pledged to reduce its methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020 and last year began an equipment upgrade at its XTO Energy shale business unit to cut emissions during production. “It will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in the statement. “Our mission is to supply energy for modern life and improve living standards around the world while minimizing impacts on the environment. This dual challenge is one of the most important issues facing society and our company.” The news of the U.S. firms’ joining was first reported by Axios."

Inpex sold 350,000 barrels of Ichthys condensate to load over Sept. 28 to Oct. 8 in a tender to Exxon Mobil Corp, the traders said. The cargo is likely for delivery into Singapore, they added. Exxon owns and operates Jurong Aromatics Corp’s condensate splitter. The quality of the condensate could not immediately be confirmed, but a trader said the API is likely around 50 and it has 50 percent to 60 percent yield of naphtha and 35 percent of middle distillates which comprise mainly diesel and jet fuel. Inpex and Exxon declined to comment. An Exxon spokesman said the company typically does not discuss details of its commercial transactions. Inpex said in August that it expected the $40 billion Ichthys project to start shipping condensate, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in that order from around end-September to end-December.

-10.333806738344213," Shell targets lower methane emissions from oil and gas operations LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell announced on Monday plans to limit leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, across its oil and gas operations as it tries to sharply curb carbon emissions. Shell aims to maintain methane emissions below 0.2 percent of its total oil and gas production by 2025, it said in a statement, joining British rival BP, which last year set a similar goal. Larger rival Exxon Mobil announced in May plans to reduce methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020. Methane is released into the atmosphere mostly from the burning of excess gas, known as flaring, as well as through leaks in gas infrastructure such as wells, pumps and pipelines. The gas has a bigger greenhouse impact than carbon dioxide, even though the oil and gas industry produces less methane and the gas also has a shorter lifetime. The methane target will be measured against a baseline leak rate, which is currently estimated at range from 0.01 percent to 0.8 percent across the company’s oil and gas assets, it said. The Anglo-Dutch company set out last year an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by 2050, far exceeding rivals. Investors have called on the company to set binding targets to reach those goals. Climate change and emissions, caused by burning fossil fuels, have moved to the forefront of discussions between energy companies and investors since the signing of the 2015 U.N.-backed Paris climate agreement that seeks to curb emissions to zero by the end of the century in order to limit global warming. “The race to near-zero methane emissions is on,” said Ben Ratner, director at Environmental Defense Fund, U.S-based non-profit climate advocacy. “Company leadership on methane does not stop with setting targets. Follow through with good data and transparency are vital.” Shell’s methane emissions reached 123,000 tonnes last year, accounting for around 5 percent of its total greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website."

The project at the 270,000 barrel per day refinery - representing a fifth of British refining capacity - still needs a final investment decision which is not expected before the second quarter of next year, Exxon said. The planned upgrade, which would include building a new hydrotreater and a new hydrogen plant, would reduce Britain’s reliance on diesel imports. “ExxonMobil is considering significant upgrades at its Fawley site to help meet demand in the UK market for high quality fuels,” Exxon said in a statement. “If approved, the project, which is expected to involve an investment of hundreds of millions of pounds, will ... allow the site to process a wider selection of crude oils, and will help secure future employment for 1,000 employees at the site.” A spokesman confirmed a report in the Financial Times that the investment, if finalised, would amount to more than 500 million pounds.

-1.585069024802133," ExxonMobil latest foreign major to invest in petchem plant, LNG terminal in China BEIJING (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday it has signed a preliminary deal to build a petrochemical complex and invest in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in China, the latest major foreign investment in the world’s top chemicals market. The agreement worth billions of dollars with the southern Guangdong provincial government includes a 1.2 million-tonne-per-year (tpy) ethylene plant, two polyethylene production lines and two polypropylene lines in the coastal city of Huizhou, it said. Exxon also agreed to participate in a provincial project to build an LNG terminal in Huizhou and to supply LNG for it, it said. No details about the capacity of the project or timeline were given. China is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors. Exxon would be one of only a few international oil majors to invest in LNG infrastructure in China as the country tries to shore up supplies amid a switch to gas-fired boilers by factories and households as part of the government’s battle against smog. The news comes after German chemical giant BASF announced plans in July to invest $10 billion to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, also in Guangdong. The project includes a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes a year of ethylene. Details of the ownership structure of Exxon’s chemical plant and LNG investment were not released on Thursday. Still, the deal could be seen as a goodwill gesture by China amid a deepening trade war between the United States and China as the world’s top two economies have traded tit-for-tat punitive tariffs that target $50 billion of each other’s goods. Washington was holding hearings this week on another round of proposed duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that appear likely to take effect in late September or early October. The agreement comes a day before a planned meeting in Beijing between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Exxon chairman and chief executive Darren Woods. The preliminary deal was signed with the local governments of Guangdong province and Huizhou as well as state power company, Guangdong Yuedian Group, according to the Guangzhou Daily. While the petrochemical deal was largely expected following a joint study signed late last year, the push on LNG was a surprise and would mark a second investment in China’s gas infrastructure by an international oil company. “It marks a salient step for Exxon in their pursuit of becoming an LNG portfolio player,” said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia. An investment in the import facility and downstream gas marketing will help it boost sales and margins compared with just selling the fuel at the import terminal gate, Kavonic added. BP is so far the only global major with a stake in a gas receiving terminal in China, a joint venture with state-owned CNOOC which began operations 12 years ago. Exxon said it is also looking at other chemicals manufacturing projects in Asia to help meet expected demand growth in the region. A decision to proceed with the petchem project will be based on a number of factors, including the receipt of permits and project competitiveness, it said. Startup is planned for 2023. Exxon already owns a 25-percent stake in a refinery and petrochemical plant in Fujian in partnership with China’s top state refiner Sinopec."

0.16951316839585645," U.S. sells 11 million barrels of oil from reserve to Exxon, five other firms WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six companies, including ExxonMobil Corp, bought a total of 11 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a Department of Energy document showed on Friday, in a sale timed to take place ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran that are expected to remove oil from the global market. Sale of the oil from the reserve was mandated by previous laws to fund the federal government and to fund a drug program, but the Trump administration took the earliest available time to sell the crude under the law. The sale’s timing “would appear to reflect President Donald Trump’s concern regarding oil market tightness associated with the reinstatement of Iran oil sanctions,” analysts at ClearView Energy Partners said after the sale was announced on August 20. In May, Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement between five other world powers and Tehran. The administration is urging countries to cut purchases of Iranian oil from the Islamic Republic to zero or face possible sanctions after November. The United States in certain cases will consider waivers for countries that need more time to wind down imports of oil from Iran while reimposing sanctions against Tehran, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said. Exxon bought about 3.3 million barrels of oil from the reserve, held in a series of underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. The other companies purchasing the oil were Marathon Petroleum Corp, which bought nearly 1.4 million barrels, Motiva Enterprises LLC, with 2.4 million barrels, Phillips 66, with more than 2 million barrels, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, with nearly 1.6 million barrels, and Valero Energy Corp bought 330,000 barrels. The oil, for shipping by both pipeline and vessels, sold in a range of $67.66 a barrel to $69.05 a barrel."

2.6548522669401318," U.S. judge rules securities suit against Exxon, executives can proceed HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Exxon Mobil Corp’s motion to dismiss a securities suit alleging the company and top executives misled investors about the impact of climate change on its business. U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas ruled on Tuesday the plaintiffs could go ahead with their suit against Exxon, former Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and several financial executives. The civil suit alleges Exxon and the executives failed to properly account for climate impact to its business and made public statements and financial disclosures that caused its share price to fall. The decision to proceed “is an important first step in holding one of the world’s most powerful corporations accountable,” said Darren Robbins, an attorney for the plaintiffs, which include the Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters Pension Fund. Exxon had sought to dismiss the suit, arguing plaintiffs failed to state a claim for the civil action. “We continue to believe the complaint is meritless and will vigorously defend ourselves from these baseless claims,” said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. The case is one of several, including shareholder and employee lawsuits, centered on whether Exxon has for decades lied about climate change, including its impact on energy prices and the environment and its ability to develop reserves, and taken public positions inconsistent with what it knew. New York and Massachusetts attorneys general are investigating whether the company misled the public and investors on its statements on climate change, releasing documents showing that Tillerson while at the company had used an email account under a different name to discuss climate-related issues. Exxon has called those investigations politically motivated. The case is Pedro Ramirez Jr v. Exxon Mobil et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 16-03111."

-2.6271465056199137," Exxon Mobil, Chevron earnings miss Wall Street expectations HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.N, two of the world's largest oil producers, reported quarterly profit on Friday that fell far short of Wall Street's expectations. The disappointing results come as much of the U.S. oil industry has been recovering from a three-year downturn in the energy sector, bolstered by higher production and crude prices. Exxon’s troubles highlight ongoing issues the company has been having to boost operations, whereas Chevron’s miss was fueled by a slight rise in expenses that likely will not be repeated, analysts said. Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $82.09 shortly after midday, while Chevron's recovered from an early drop and were up about 2 percent at $126.34. Both stocks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. The results were particularly weak at Exxon, which has been trying to boost operations in a bid to revive a stock price trading at about the same level it was a decade ago. “Exxon’s definitely sticking out like a sore thumb right now,” said Edward Jones energy analyst Brian Youngberg. “It’s just hard to find anything good in the quarter.” Despite rising oil prices CLc1LCOc1, Exxon's production dropped 7 percent and it spent more than $600 million to upgrade refineries in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia. Exxon called the quarter a “challenging” one for its operations and “well below market expectations.” Neil Chapman, an Exxon executive and member of the company’s management committee, said he is “not happy” about the ongoing refinery maintenance, adding there is “nothing systemic” about the repairs that would reveal weakness in the refining division. “We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents,” Chapman said on a conference call with investors. Exxon earned 92 cents per share, while analysts expected earnings of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At Chevron, oil production rose 2 percent and profit spiked, but higher corporate expenses surprised Wall Street. Still, the company announced a $3 billion stock buyback program, long awaited by Wall Street. “We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios,” Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a conference call. Chevron earned $1.78 per share, while analysts expected $2.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS, a key rival, posted second-quarter profit on Thursday far below forecasts due in part to weakness in refining. British oil major BP Plc BP.L is set to report quarterly results next week. On Thursday it agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton BLT.LBHP.AX for $10.5 billion."

Analysts expected earnings of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production fell 7 percent to 3.6 million barrels per day of oil equivalent. Earnings from the company’s downstream unit, which refines crude oil into gasoline and other products, fell 47 percent, which Chief Executive Darren Woods said was the primary drag on earnings in the quarter. Exxon said the second quarter featured multiple refinery renovation projects, known as turnarounds, in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia.

-0.5691239308680335," Exxon beefs up Mozambique LNG project to cut costs ahead of bank talks LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil will expand its Rovuma liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique by half to cut production costs as the partners prepare to book the plant’s supply and formally tap lenders in September, the company told Reuters. The U.S. oil giant took charge of the East African LNG project’s onshore operations following a $2.8 billion deal with Italy’s Eni last year, adding to its slate of planned gas projects in Qatar, Papua New Guinea, Russia and the United States. It now aims to build the world’s biggest liquefaction units, or trains, outside Qatar, in Mozambique’s remote north, shelving former operator Eni’s more modest blueprint in pursuit of cost savings to boost returns on investment. “The larger train design will lower the unit cost of the Rovuma LNG project and ensure a competitive new supply for the global LNG market,” Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said in response to emailed questions. Under new development plans submitted to the government this week, Exxon’s first two liquefaction trains should each produce 7.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), with a start date in 2024. Eni initially planned 5 mtpa trains. The Italian oil major holds the offshore resource license to Area 4, which contains some 85 trillion cubic feet of gas in place to be supercooled into a liquid and exported on ships to world markets. Super-sizing the first two trains means having to renegotiate a resource-sharing deal Eni struck in 2015 with rival LNG project developer Anadarko Petroleum, which owns the neighboring Area 1 license, industry sources said. A geologically porous section of Area 4 covering the Mamba and Prosperidade fields straddles Area 1. This effectively means Exxon-Eni would pump gas away from Anadarko’s adjoining reservoir to feed its LNG plant. “Area 4 and Area 1 stakeholders have agreed on the Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement (UUOA) which has been presented to the Mozambican government for approval,” Exxon’s King said. Anadarko spokeswoman Helen Wells said the company was engaging with the government and Area 4 to address any concerns and ensure the UUOA benefits all involved. Mozambique’s two rival LNG projects are ramping up to take final investment decisions (FID) in 2019 and both are teeing up buyers and loans to underpin hefty construction costs. But there the similarities end. Anadarko Petroleum’s approach involves raising a record $14-$15 billion from banks and export credit agencies (ECAs) to fund the build. At the same time, it is lining up long-term LNG sales deals with external companies in China, Asia and Europe to guarantee the loans. Exxon in contrast will finance a larger share of costs from its own pockets as well as drawing on project partners, including Eni, Korea Gas Corp and China National Petroleum Corporation [CNPET.UL], bank and industry sources say. Exxon said it expects Rovuma LNG financing to originate from a mix of “external lenders and joint-venture party funding.” “We have begun initial engagement with lenders and are planning a formal kick-off event in September 2018,” King said. Exxon already approached those ECAs that backed Eni’s Coral South Floating LNG project in Area 4 last year, sources said. For its part, Anadarko engaged commercial banks on May 21 after having first secured interest for about $12 billion from ECAs. Production from Rovuma LNG will also be treated differently. While Anadarko sought out buyers from France’s EDF to Britain’s Centrica and Japan’s Tokyo Gas, Exxon is holding talks for binding sales and purchase agreements for Rovuma output with subsidiaries of its Area 4 project partners. “We expect sufficient interest from the affiliate buyers to launch the project and support the financing,” King said."

Exxon declined to comment. Algeria sees last week’s agreement from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost output as a “good deal” and the country has increased output by 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day, Kaddour said. “If this (OPEC) agreement falls apart, there’s no control on the price” of oil, he said. “You have Saudi (Arabia) and Russia that want to increase as much as they can produce, and then you have the other side, like Iran and other countries, that do not want that increase. “We need to stay together as a group. Keeping that equilibrium alive is the most important thing.” Kaddour, who took the top spot at Sonatrach last year, has launched a long-term strategy “SH 2030.” It targets $67 billion of additional revenues by 2030, of which 50 percent will be reinvested. As part of that, Sonatrach is working to boost natural gas exports to Europe and other markets. Exports are the largest sources of hard currency for Algeria, and the company has space available on export pipe to Europe, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has in recent months imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports, steps that have resulted in retaliatory measures against U.S. crops, motorcycles and other products, including petroleum. That has sparked concern amongst Chevron Corp CVX.N, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and other major oil and natural gas producers that Trump's actions could imperil relations with some of their largest customers, including China and the European Union. The United States, the world’s largest natural gas producer, has begun exporting more of the fuel, part of Trump’s approach to energy diplomacy. But the tariffs could undermine that plan. “The risk of trade wars starts to weigh on people’s perception of economic growth in the future,” Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said at the World Gas Conference in Washington. “These things run the risk of becoming a bit of drag on growth.” Chevron tries to buy steel for its pipelines and other equipment from U.S. manufactures but cannot always do so, Wirth said. Darren Woods, Exxon’s CEO, said his company is trying to keep a “level headed voice” around the tariffs. “The world has been very well served with low tariffs and free trade,” Woods said. “With tariffs, you run the risk of making some projects less attractive.” Both companies are major natural gas producers in the United States, with Chevron focused especially on the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and Exxon on the Eagle Ford shale in Texas. The two executives, who appeared jointly on a conference panel, argued that natural gas is the best way to help cut global greenhouse gas emissions and also increase the availability of power across the developing world. Natural gas had for several years enjoyed a designation as a “bridge fuel” away from hydrocarbons toward renewable energies. This view has come under assault recently by environmentalists, something both CEOs pushed back on. “Renewables are terrific, but you need the lights and the power and the air conditioning all the time,” said Wirth, who became Chevron’s CEO earlier this year. “You’ve got to have a mix.” Natural gas, Woods said, “as the fuel of the future is a part of the solution to climate change.”"

The two executives, who appeared jointly on a conference panel, argued that natural gas is the best way to help cut global greenhouse gas emissions and also increase the availability of power across the developing world. Natural gas had for several years enjoyed a designation as a “bridge fuel” away from hydrocarbons toward renewable energies. This view has come under assault recently by environmentalists , something both CEOs pushed back on. “Renewables are terrific, but you need the lights and the power and the air conditioning all the time,” said Wirth, who became Chevron’s CEO earlier this year. “You’ve got to have a mix.” Natural gas, Woods said, “as the fuel of the future is a part of the solution to climate change.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)"

9.596449632432684," Shell, Exxon not to seek compensation for end of Groningen gas production: government AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Energy companies Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil will not submit a claim for missed revenue due to the Dutch government’s decision to halt gas production at the Groningen field by 2030, the Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs said on Monday. “A lot of gas will be left in the ground,” Economy minister Eric Wiebes said at the presentation of his deal with the oil majors responsible for extracting Groningen gas. “That gas is the property of the oil companies, but they will not submit a claim and the government is not required to compensate them.” The Dutch government in March said it would end gas production at the Groningen field by the end of the next decade, in an effort to stop a string of relatively small, but damaging earthquakes caused by gas extraction. This will leave around 450 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in the ground, Wiebes said, with an estimated value of approximately 70 billion euros ($81.5 billion). The decision to halt Groningen production forced the government to broker a new deal with Shell and Exxon Mobil, whose 50-50 joint venture NAM is responsible for the field. NAM will be required to pump as much gas as the government says is needed in the coming years. In return, it will see its share of the revenue from Groningen rise from 10 to 27 percent, Wiebes said, starting this year. As part of the deal, NAM will also contribute a total of 500 million euros to strengthen the economy in the Groningen region. ($1 = 0.8587 euros)"

4.544177964431053," ExxonMobil considers importing LNG to Australia MELBOURNE (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp, southeastern Australia’s biggest gas supplier, is considering importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help plug a looming gas shortage from 2021 and protect its market share. The move would compete with plans by both Australia’s no.2 energy retailer AGL Energy to start importing LNG by 2021 and a consortium involving Japan’s JERA to start imports from 2020. ExxonMobil is also stepping up exploration off the coast of Victoria and considering developing a gas field called West Barracouta close to an existing field, it said in an emailed statement on Monday. “Combined with the existing Gippsland resource and infrastructure, an LNG import facility could ensure ExxonMobil can continue to meet our customers’ needs,” the company said. The facility could open by 2022, it said. Australia’s energy market operator warned in March that Victoria, the country’s biggest gas consuming state, could face shortages from mid-2021 due to a rapid drop in supply from the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, owned by ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton. Output from the Gippsland Basin, the state’s mainstay supplier over the past 50 years, is expected to fall to just half of 2018 levels by 2022, it said. Even though Australia is set to challenge Qatar as the world’s top LNG exporter, local gas supplies are under threat due to field declines and long-term export contracts. ExxonMobil could use a lot of its existing infrastructure at Longford in Victoria for an LNG import facility. The company declined to comment on an estimate by Macquarie analysts cited in The Australian newspaper that it could build import facilities for around A$100 million ($74 million), less than half the estimated cost of the two rival LNG import plans. AGL is working toward a final investment decision for its import plans by June 2019. “If we saw some new supply come to market that fundamentally changed that market dynamic, we would revisit the business case, but we haven’t seen that to date,” AGL General Manager Phaedra Deckart told Reuters in an interview last week. She said rising LNG prices would not deter the company from going ahead with the plan. “It’s not about what price can we bring LNG into the market. It’s about meeting the needs of our 1.4 million gas customers and the 10 large industrial customers that have executed (tentative agreements) with us and are looking for a new source of supply to meet that shortfall beyond 2020.”"

1.901768969200141," Exclusive: Exxon Mobil breaks with past, bulks up energy trading to boost profit HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N is pushing deeper into energy trading, building a global cadre of experienced traders and beefing up risk-management systems to lift profit, according to executive recruiters and people familiar with the business. The development is a sea change for a company that has stood out from rivals by limiting its past activity out of concern it would be accused of market manipulation. Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter. Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon XOM.N expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade. Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore GLEN.L, the world's second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66 PSX.N. This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc BLT.L trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP's first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later. The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc BP.L, Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions. “Paul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,” said a trading house executive who knows Butcher. Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks. Chief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon’s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. “Trading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,” said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. “A change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.” Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses. During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell RDSa.L often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division. Shell for example trades more than 8 million barrels per day or 8 percent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxon’s output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale. Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms. “Exxon still doesn’t plan to begin speculative paper trading,” said one source familiar with Exxon’s thinking. Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025. The company’s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business. Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople. Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading. “We’ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it’s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,” said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved."

The company said it expects to start producing oil from these developments in 2020. The projects include the conversion of an oil tanker into a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, which would have a production capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. A second FPSO with a capacity of 220,000 barrels per day is being planned and a third is under consideration, the company said. Exxon said in March that projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico, as well as refining and chemical plant expansions, should drive earnings gains."

All three were initially treated at the chemical plant by Exxon emergency personnel, Nordin said. “Two were transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” she said. “One received first-aid treatment at a local clinic.” The Department of Environmental Quality and Exxon are investigating the release, details of which were not immediately available."
-0.24851918814008067," Exclusive: Exxon seeks to sell out of Tanzanian gas field - sources LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N is seeking buyers for its stake in a large undeveloped gas field off Tanzania, according to three banking and industry sources, as the company focuses on the development of an even bigger project in neighboring Mozambique. The planned sale is an example of Chief Executive Darren Woods’ strategy of freeing up cash and narrowing the American firm’s focus on a number of giant projects around the world deemed to have the best prospects, including in Mozambique, Guyana and U.S. shale. Woods, who became CEO in January 2017 after predecessor Rex Tillerson retired and became U.S. secretary of state, has come under heavy pressure from investors over the past year to turn around the world’s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company as its output and earnings sagged. Exxon holds a 35 percent stake in Tanzania's deepwater Block 2 field that was discovered earlier this decade. It holds an estimated 23 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to the website of Norway's Equinor EQNR.OL, which operates the block and holds a 65 percent stake. The prospect has faced repeated delays in recent years due mainly to a lack of infrastructure and regulation for the country’s nascent oil and gas sector, complicating any sale. The sources said the value of the asset was unclear due to early stage of development and uncertain future. Exxon declined to comment. A spokesman for Equinor declined to comment on the sale process. He said the company had not changed its plans in Tanzania. Tanzania has moved down the priority list for Exxon after it acquired a 25 percent stake in the gas-rich Area 4 development offshore Mozambique $2.8 billion from Eni ENI.MI last year. Area 4, holding an estimated 85 trillion cubic feet of gas, is one of the world’s largest gas discoveries in recent years, and far bigger than the Tanzanian field. The project is also far more advanced - it is already under development and expected to start production in 2022. Houston-based Exxon has also taken charge of the development of the liquefied natural gas plant at the site."

0.18296266842240697," Qatar Petroleum buys stake in Exxon's Argentina shale assets DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement on Sunday with Exxon Mobil to acquire a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon’s affiliates in Argentina, giving QP access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country. The deal would give QP, the world’s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a 30 percent share in two of Exxon’s local affiliates in Argentina - ExxonMobil Exploration Argentina S.R.L. and Mobil Argentina S.A., which holds rights with other partners for seven blocks, QP said in a statement. “This is an important milestone, as it marks Qatar Petroleum’s first investment in Argentina as well as its first significant international investment in unconventional oil and gas resources,” QP’s Chief Executive Saad Al-Kaabi said in the statement. The agreements were signed by Al-Kaabi, and Andrew Swiger, senior vice president at Exxon Mobil Corp., in Doha. The announcement did not disclose the value of the investment. The blocks, in Vaca Muerta in the onshore Neuquén basin in Argentina, are under “unconventional exploration licenses with active drilling plans as well as exploitation licenses with pilot drilling and production,” QP said. The deal between QP and Exxon comes as the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer looks to rapidly expand its upstream operations under Chief Executive Darren Woods, who inherited a portfolio with relatively few international growth operations compared to peers. Exxon has been investing heavily in its U.S. shale operations and in Guyana, though its development in Argentina has been slow due to a host of factors, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government price controls for natural gas. By bringing in QP as a partner, Exxon cuts its financial risk and also pushes the project forward. For QP, the deal offers a chance to invest for the first time in a sizeable shale operation while avoiding the public relations difficulties that would have likely arisen had it invested in shale operations in the United States, where public sentiment still sees Qatar and other OPEC members as economic competitors. It would also help Qatar guarantee long-term access to gas assets abroad, when decades from now its own gas reserves could start depleting. For Qatar it also signals its ability to sign big multi-billion-dollar deals with oil majors despite a prolonged regional political crisis and pressure on governments and companies by other Gulf neighbors to reduce ties with Doha. Last year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, along with Egypt imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies. In May, the International Petroleum Technology Conference decided to move its 2020 IPTC event which was due to be held in Doha, to Dhahran in Saudi Arabia, prompting Al-Kaabi to instruct heads of QP’s subsidiaries and joint ventures to cut all ties with the organization, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The deal with Exxon appears as a show of strength by QP as the boycott continues. “This agreement... goes hand in hand with the planned expansion of our local production from the North Field, which will further boost Qatar’s leading global position by raising its LNG production from 77 million to 100 million tons per year,” Al-Kaabi said. “Our oil and gas sector has not been impacted by the blockade, nor has our previously planned expansion.”"

-0.1958055367938956," Exxon shareholders reject proposal to split CEO, chair roles DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp shareholders rejected a proposal on Wednesday that would have split the roles of chairman and chief executive, securing CEO Darren Woods’s role as he looks to improve results at the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer. Woods, who became chairman and CEO in January 2017, has struggled to recover from failed bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, the former U.S. secretary of state, that resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs and a stock price that has lagged peers. Exxon under Woods has moved aggressively to launch major expansion programs to find and produce new reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as expand the company’s refining and chemical footprint. Woods in March told Wall Street investors that the expansions should help double Exxon’s earnings by 2025 to about $31 billion. Still, Exxon’s first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices. By voting to keep the roles combined, shareholders effectively gave support to Woods to lead the board and employees as they jointly try to meet those goals. “No one in our industry can match our opportunity set today,” Woods told fellow shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in Dallas. Shares of Exxon rose 3.4 percent to $81.13 on Wednesday after an analyst upgraded the company’s stock, saying its low valuation relative to peers presented a buying opportunity. “CLIMATE CRIMINAL” Woods vowed that he would continue to work to address climate change, especially through biofuels research. But outside the Dallas meeting, about 30 people gathered to protest what they said was Exxon’s lack of accountability for its impact on global climate change. There were no climate-related proposals for Exxon’s shareholders to consider at this year’s meeting after one was approved last year requiring an annual carbon report. Protesters on Wednesday said they were biding their time this year. “There’s not a lot of optimism they’ll (Exxon executives) will make good on it, but if they don’t, we’ll be back next year with an even stronger shareholder proposal,” said Molly Rooke, a former Exxon employee who now volunteers with the environmental group 350.org. Rooke’s fellow protesters held a bevy of signs outside the meeting emblazoned with such slogans as “Exxon Mobil, Climate Criminal” and “Arrest Exxon.” Shareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced Exxon to provide greater disclosure on its lobbying expenditures and change its bylaws to how special meetings are called. Shareholders approved a full slate of 10 nominees to the company’s board of directors."

Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp shut production on platforms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico due to Alberto and evacuated workers from those sites, the companies said. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Alberto was transitioning to a tropical cyclone as its circulation became more focused around a central core located 135 miles (220 km) west of Tampa, Florida, with 50 mile per hour winds (85 kph). The storm was expected to make landfall on Monday morning in the Florida panhandle. Chevron shut production at its Blind Faith and Petronius platforms in the eastern Gulf. The Blind Faith platform is located in the Mississippi Canyon region of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The Petronius platform is in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf. Shell shut its Ram Powell Hub, which is also in the Viosca Knoll area, on Friday. Shell has shut the production platform at the Appomattox Hub it is developing in Norphlet in the eastern Gulf. Appomattox has not yet begun production, but the platform recently arrived on the site. Exxon said production in the Gulf was unaffected by the evacuations and the company transferred control of its offhsore operations in Mobile Bay, Alabama, to an onshore control room. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude output and five percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the U.S. refining capacity and 51 percent of natural gas processing capacity is located along the Gulf."

Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour, who was visiting the southern In Salah gas field, did not elaborate. Exxon was not immediately available for comment. The OPEC oil producer plans to explore shale gas reservoirs deep in the south but needs foreign expertise and the support of the local population, whose protests in 2015 stopped earlier productions attempts. To win over locals, Kaddour visited three Sufi Muslim institutions, or Zaouia, in the gas region of In Salah to discuss with their leaders ways to convince people to endorse shale exploration. Sufism is mainstream in Algeria’s south. Residents have protested against Sonatrach’s plans, saying they are too risky and damaging to the environment. Kaddour gave details of his long term strategy named “SH 2030” targeting $67 billion of additional revenues by 2030 of which 50 percent will be reinvested.

-2.744173381506305," Exxon to cut methane emissions in bid to tackle climate change (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday it was targeting a 15 percent cut in methane emissions by 2020, the latest effort by an oil major to reduce its carbon footprint and address climate change concerns. Exxon, like oil and gas majors across the world, is working to placate environmentalists and governments who are concerned about pollution from fossil fuels. BP said last month it would keep carbon emissions flat over the decade to 2025 to help tackle climate change. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, had said in September it would replace oil equipment and update technology to curb methane emissions from its U.S. shale facilities. Exxon said leak-detection-and-repair efforts at XTO Energy, its shale-focused subsidiary, had reduced emissions of the gas by 2 percent in the past year. The company also expects these efforts to cut natural gas flaring by about 25 percent by 2020, with most reductions expected in West Africa. Flaring, used to eliminate gas at mineral exploration sites, is released via pressure relief valves to ease the strain on equipment. (This story corrects paragraph 4 to say Exxon is world’s largest publicly traded ‘oil’ producer.)"

Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin confirmed that the Beaumont refinery was overhauling some units. “The Beaumont plant has shut down some of its units and associated operations for planned maintenance beginning May 13,2018,” Nordin said. “We have communicated this turnaround to our customers and expect to meet all contractual commitments.” Exxon is overhauling the 40,000 bpd CHD-2 diesel hydrotreater through the last week of June, the sources said. Maintenance work is also being done on a sulfur recovery unit. Work will be performed on two of the furnaces on the 40,000 bpd coker. One furnace will remain in operation while the other is shut, the sources said. The Beaumont refinery coker converts residual crude oil from distillation units into motor fuel feedstocks and petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute. Hydrotreaters remove hydrogen sulfide from motor fuels and their feedstocks in compliance with U.S. environmental rules. Sulfur recovery units extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide removed by hydrotreaters."

Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin declined to discuss the status of specific units, but said the company continued to meet its contractual commitments. The sources said the larger of two FCCUs was shut within the past 24 hours and may be shut for up to three weeks. Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 3 has a capacity of 125,000 bpd. One of the sources said FCCU 3 was shut in part because of an overhaul under way on the 42,000 bpd Flexicoker, which began on April 2. The Flexicoker overhaul began on April 2 and was planned to last six weeks, but sources have told Reuters the work may continue until early June. Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said that Pipestill 7, the second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) at the Baytown refinery, showed signs increased activity on Friday. The 135,000 bpd CDU was shut as part of the work on the Flexicoker. CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock for all other units in the refinery. There are three CDUs at the Baytown refinery. The other two crude units remain in production.

5.843866869714388," Exxon pushes ahead with Rosneft LNG project despite sanctions: sources BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N is pushing ahead with efforts to develop its $15 billion Far East Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project with Russia's Rosneft ROSN.MM despite being forced to exit some joint ventures due to Western sanctions. Two months ago Exxon invited companies including China National Petroleum Corporation’s [CNPET.UL] engineering arm to bid for construction contracts by October, sources with knowledge of the matter said. A final investment decision is due in 2019, they said. The project is being jointly developed with Rosneft using gas from the Sakhalin-1 venture which will be chilled into liquid to underpin the LNG plant’s initial annual output target of 6 million tonnes. Western sanctions forced Exxon to exit some joint ventures with Rosneft in late February, but LNG is not part of the sanctions. The Russian company said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production-sharing JV struck in the mid-1990s. “The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,” Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said. “A liquefied natural gas plant is an option to maximize benefits to the consortium and the Russian state and its citizens,” she added. Exxon-Rosneft have also held discussions about feeding gas from Sakhalin-1 fields into a planned third production unit at an existing LNG plant run by Gazprom GAZP.MM on Sakhalin Island, industry sources said. Rosneft was not available for immediate comment. Exxon’s LNG footprint is expanding rapidly with major new projects planned in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and the United States as demand in China and Southeast Asia booms. Gas accounted for 43 percent of Exxon output last year, according to BMO Capital Markets, a share set to rise as new LNG projects start up. CNPC’s Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp is preparing to bid for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for Far East LNG’s supporting facilities, such as storage tanks, pipelines and utilities, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Chinese engineering companies, banks and shipyards are all muscling into LNG, typically the preserve of Western, Japanese and South Korean players, as government coal-to-gas switching policies make LNG an increasingly strategic fuel. For example, Chinese investment is pouring into African floating LNG projects, import terminals, tankers and traditional land-based plants such as the $12 billion invested in Russia’s Yamal facility, used to skirt Western sanctions. Loans in turn drum up business for Chinese engineering firms and shipyards in LNG, and give state-backed companies the upper hand in supply negotiations. It is unclear if Chinese lenders will help finance Far East LNG. The bid deadline for EPC contractors is September 30, sources said. A consortium of Japan's JGC and Texas-headquartered Fluor Corp FLR.N will handle the core work of project managing and building the liquefaction trains and other key components, industry sources said. JGC was not available for immediate comment and Fluor declined to comment."

6.376569883944338," Exxon first quarter profit misses estimates on refining, chemical woes HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices CLc1LCOc1. It was the second consecutive quarter of weakness in Exxon units that make gasoline, plastics and related products. Exxon blamed weak margins for the income drop in those segments. Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell 2.5 percent to $78.86 in premarket trading. The company posted net income of $4.7 billion, or $1.09 per share, compared to $4.01 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit jumped more than 50 percent in the company’s upstream division, which pumps oil and natural gas, thanks largely to rising commodity prices. In the downstream refining unit, though, profit fell 12 percent, and in the chemical unit, profit dropped 14 percent. Production fell 6 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Exxon said earlier this month it resumed production at the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project a fortnight ahead of schedule after it was shut down in the wake of a deadly earthquake in February. The shutdown cut quarterly earnings by $80 million and production by about 25,000 boe/d, Exxon said. The company has struggled in the past 16 months to unwind some of the biggest bets taken by former Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who left to become U.S. secretary of state in early 2017 before being fired by President Donald Trump last month. Exxon has recorded billions of dollars in writedowns amid falling production since Tillerson left, and successor CEO Darren Woods has moved quickly to try to repair operations. Woods laid out a bold plan last month to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments in U.S. shale, Guyana and several LNG projects around the world. The company plans to hold a conference call with investors to discuss quarterly results on Friday morning. Exxon rival Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L on Thursday posted a 42 percent jump in first-quarter profit, its highest earnings in more than three years."

4.30779636706645," Exxon faces setback in Iraq as oil and water mix LONDON/BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Talks between Exxon Mobil XOM.N and Iraq on a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure contract have reached an impasse, Iraqi officials and two industry sources said, in a potential setback to the oil major's ambitions to expand in the country. More than two years of negotiations on awarding the U.S. firm a project to build a water treatment facility and related pipelines needed to boost Iraq’s oil production capacity have hit difficulties because the two sides differ on contract terms and costs, the officials and sources told Reuters. Unless the differences can be resolved, the project could be awarded to another company in a tender, the officials said, without elaborating on the points of dispute. Losing the contract could deal a blow to Exxon’s broader Iraqi plans, as it would be handed rights to develop at least two southern oilfields - Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi - as part of the deal. Exxon declined to comment. Further delays to the project could also hold back the oil industry in Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer; the country needs to inject water into its wells or risk losing pressure and face severe decline rates, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives. The Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), which would supply water to more than six southern oilfields, including Exxon's existing West Qurna 1 field and BP's BP.L Rumaila, was initially planned to be completed in 2013 but has now been delayed until 2022. “The CSSP would be expensive and challenging but there’s opportunity here (for Exxon) ... to get access to resources on a very large scale and to achieve something and really make a difference to its own business,” said Ian Thom, principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Many of the world's biggest oil companies, like BP, Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Eni ENI.MI, have operations in Iraq, where a low-return environment and strict contract terms have squeezed returns in recent years. With total oil production at West Qurna 1 at around 430,000 bpd, Exxon’s presence in Iraq is small compared with dominant player BP whose Rumaila oilfield accounts for around a third of the country’s total production of around 4.4 million bpd. While the Texas-based firm is looking to grow in Iraq, its geographical focus remains on the Americas, including U.S. shale fields and Brazil, in contrast to rivals like France’s Total and Italy’s Eni who have been significantly expanding their activities in the Middle East in recent years. ‘ANOTHER APPROACH’ The talks between Iraqi authorities and Exxon are still ongoing, according to the industry sources and officials from the Iraqi oil ministry. However the state-run Basra Oil Company (BOC), which is overseeing the project, said it could now tender the project this month in a parallel process with the aim of completing a first phase by 2022. “We have this one approach but we can have another approach as well,” Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the Iraqi oil ministry’s licensing and contracts office, told Reuters. Iraq chose Exxon to coordinate the initial studies of the CSSP in 2010 [story here here]. At the time, Baghdad aimed to raise its oil production capacity to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2018, rivaling Saudi Arabia. That target has been missed and now been cut to 6.5 million bpd by 2022 from around 5 million bpd now. “Iraq can probably get to 5.5 million bpd production without a major seawater supply project, but I think they will struggle to get to 7 million bpd,” said Thom. Negotiations with Exxon fell through in 2012 due to red tape and cost disputes. In 2015, the company reentered talks with the oil ministry, this time in partnership with China's CNPC and with the CSSP folded into a much bigger development project known as the Integrated South Project. [story here here] CNPC did not reply to a request for comment. For Iraq, going down the non-Exxon route raises two major concerns: how to integrate the project between the water treatment facility and the oilfields and how to finance the project, Thom said. Two Iraqi oil sources told Reuters that taking the non-Exxon path would raise financing concerns for Iraq. “If you decouple it, it’s not the same project,” one of the industry sources said of a non-integrated project. Projected costs of the scheme have not been disclosed. ILF Consulting Engineers, which did the front end engineering and design (FEED) for the project in 2014 based on treating 12.5 million bpd of seawater transported to six oilfields, put the cost at $12 billion. The capacity has been revised downwards, with the first phase set to have a 5 million bpd of water, and in the second phase an additional 2.5 million bpd of water will be added for additional fields."

He said an improved security environment had contributed to growing interest from foreign firms. Algeria has struggled to attract foreign investment in recent years and has seen its oil and gas production stagnate. A sharp fall in oil prices from 2014 hit state finances, which are heavily dependent on hydrocarbons exports.

The tanker’s destination wasn’t immediately clear, but the resumption of shipments could put pressure on spot LNG prices, traders said. ExxonMobil Corp restarted output at the project near the capital Port Moresby a fortnight ahead of schedule, its Australian partners said late last week. “We confirm an LNG cargo has been loaded onto the Kumul tanker,” a spokeswoman from ExxonMobil told Reuters in an email reply. The 172,000-cubic metre capacity LNG tanker Kumul, custom-built for the PNG LNG project, left the project terminal with a draft of 91 percent, suggesting it is nearly full, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon shiptracking data. The Kumul unloaded an LNG cargo at the PNG terminal on April 4. It was anchored nearby until April 14, before loading the cargo from the terminal on April 15, the data showed. ExxonMobil had said in early April that it had imported an LNG cargo to the project’s terminal in order ensure tanks at the PNG facilities remained cold. The 170,000-cubic metre capacity LNG tanker Papua is currently anchored near the Kumul Marine Terminal, while the 165,000-cubic metre capacity LNG tanker Bishu Maru is headed to Port Moresby, the Eikon data showed."
