7.307796997782097," MOVES-FTI Consulting hires ISS executive for governance and activism team BOSTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - FTI Consulting Inc hired a corporate governance analyst from proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) for its unit that advises clients on hot button issues from climate change to executive pay, the company said on Wednesday. Kosmas Papadopoulos joined FTI’s Corporate Governance & Activism team as a senior director and is working for Rodolfo Araujo, who had also worked at ISS and joined FTI earlier this year. Araujo worked for ISS’ special situations research group where he weighed in on how shareholders should vote in prominent proxy battles. At ISS, Papadopoulos most recently oversaw the publication of Governance Insights, the firm’s weekly newsletter, which writes about shareholder engagement and environmental, social and governance issues. A spokesman for ISS declined to comment. FTI, like other companies, has been expanding in this area as more corporations and their boards face demands from activist investors, often for dramatic changes ranging from splitting off businesses to overhauling management teams. Most recently Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T Inc, urging the company to end its acquisition spree, divest some units and cut costs."
19.106851065172215," UPDATE 1-Thai domestic car sales suffer first fall in 2-1/2 years in June * June sales fall 2.1% y/y, vs +3.7% in May * FTI keeps sales growth target of +2.4% this year * Central bank worries about car loans BANGKOK, July 18 (Reuters) - Thailand’s domestic car sales declined for the first time in 30 months in June, as finance firms used stricter lending criteria after the central bank moved to talk down a surge in auto loans amid concern about high household debt. Sales dropped 2.1% in June from a year earlier after rising 3.7% in May, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). Thailand is a regional vehicle production and export base for the world’s top car manufacturers. The industry accounts for one-tenth of the Thai economy, and has been one of a few growth drivers at a time of falling exports. The FTI attributed the sales contraction to tighter car loan approvals and a high comparative figure last year. “Finance for car purchases is tougher, with very high rejection rates, particularly for smaller cars,” said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesman of the FTI’s automotive industry division. “The central bank has talked too often about car loans”. Car dealers will have to work harder to help clients get loans, or to shift to the high-end market, Surapong said. Although the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has not taken any policy action, the mere prospect of car loan curbs has been enough to tighten the finance spigot to domestic buyers. On Wednesday, BOT Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said the central bank is discussing with banks and non-bank lenders adjusting their lending process to focus on borrowers’ debt-service ratios. Surapong said the FTI’s 2019 car sales growth target of 2.4% should still be achieved, as it is conservative. In January-June, sales rose 7.1% from a year earlier, after a 19.5% jump in the whole of 2018, helped by easy auto loans."
26.772755988447887," FTI Consulting hires Colleen Hsia to advise clients on public affairs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global consulting company FTI Consulting Inc has hired financial services executive Colleen Hsia to advise clients on corporate reputation and public affairs among other matters, the company said on Tuesday. Hsia joined FTI as a senior managing director and Americas head of financial services in the strategic communications division on Monday. She reports to Brian Kennedy, a senior managing director who serves as head of the Americas for the strategic communications division. Advising companies on how to protect reputations has become big business at a time when ever more corporations are facing crises ranging from product recalls to cyber hacks that often prompt chief executives to rank reputation risk among their biggest priorities, analysts have said. Hsia previously worked at Jane Street, a trading firm founded in 2000, where she was global head of marketing. Before that she worked at asset management firm BlackRock where she was head of investment content and before that she was head of business development at hedge fund of funds firm Magnitude Capital."
10.409914487059632," MOVES-FTI Consulting hires former ISS executive NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Rodolfo Araujo, who helped determine the outcome of contested mergers and proxy contests as a vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, is joining FTI Consulting, FTI said on Thursday. Araujo will be joining the global consulting firm as a senior managing director and head of activism and corporate governance. He is expected to take up his new role in March in the Washington office and will later move to New York. He spent three years at ISS working in the special situations research group where analysts weigh in on how shareholders should vote in prominent proxy contests, including battles at Procter & Gamble and Campbell Soup, for example. FTI works with clients around the world and counseled health insurer Cigna in its bid to buy pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts. “Rodolfo brings a wealth of highly relevant and invaluable experience to our clients as they navigate board elections, reputation and brand risk, M&A transactions and challenges to their governance practices,” Mark McCall, global segment leader of FTI Strategic Communications, said. Araujo’s decision to leave comes as activist investors, with their requests for companies to return capital to shareholders and split their businesses, are helping drive the pace of mergers and acquisitions around the world. His move comes just a few weeks after ISS deputy head of research Jim Miller left the firm to join proxy solicitor and governance advisory firm Alliance Advisors. ISS has roughly 1,400 clients, including some of the world’s biggest mutual and pension funds."
