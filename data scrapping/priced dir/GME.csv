315.93989159891595," Citadel's Griffin says firm does not use personal information of retail investors: CNBC (Reuters) - Market maker Citadel Securities does not use the personal information of retail investors, its billionaire co-founder Ken Griffin told CNBC on Friday, a day after the U.S. congressional hearing on GameStop. During Thursday’s hearing, several lawmakers had raised concerns on whether large market makers had taken advantage of retail investors and if they could pose a threat to the financial system. Griffin had pushed back against those questions, saying that Citadel Securities, which executes roughly 47% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, had worked for years to help give consumers “a better price.” A market maker is a broker or dealer who holds a certain amount of securities at hand to facilitate trading, competing for orders by giving buy and sell price quotations, then filling orders rapidly either from its own inventory or an offsetting order. The retail investor-led rally in heavily shorted stocks earlier this year has raised scrutiny on the information market makers can collect from the order flow. “There’s been a number of misperceptions about the data that we receive from the retail brokerage community. In fact, a prominent U.S. Senator asked us specifically about what personal identifying information do we receive from retail investors. The answer is none,” Griffin told CNBC. Friday’s interview allowed Griffin to clear the air after he got cut off repeatedly on Thursday by lawmakers who demanded quick, clear responses. “This conspiracy theory that we somehow or another are like some of the big tech giants that have access to personal identifying information is just flat out false,” he said on Friday."
315.93989159891595," Long, tense with cat photo for relief; how the GameStop hearing unfolded WASHINGTON/BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tension, irate questions, people talking over one another, and a cat photo. Thursday’s five-plus hour U.S. congressional hearing on GameStop had all of that, as top hedge fund managers, the head of Robinhood, and Roaring Kitty himself answered a barrage of questions over who was at fault in January’s trading frenzy. GameStop rose more than 1,000% during two weeks as retail traders using the Reddit platform encouraged each other to pile in, socking it to hedge fund managers who were short the stock - a bet GameStop would fall. The trade deflated, however, after online brokerage Robinhood and several other brokers controversially restricted buying GameStop’s shares - leaving retail investors frustrated but capping the losses for the hedge funds. “Robinhood owns what happened and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad  Tenev, who appeared to field the most questions at the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services hearing. Keith Gill, a Reddit user and YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty who had boosted the stock with his videos about how undervalued the company was, provided a more lighthearted exterior. Gill sat in a red videogaming chair from which he recorded many videos promoting his investment in GameStop. Displayed behind him was a poster of a kitten with the caption “Hang in there!” Many investors who bought GameStop as the price skyrocketed now face deep losses. Speaking as much to his social media followers as to the lawmakers, Gill said, “I like the stock”, a phrase that has become a rallying call on Reddit, where commenters watching the hearing cheered him on, some calling him their “savior” and a “hero.” Hedge fund managers Gabe Plotkin, whose Melvin Capital lost 53% in January in the GameStop frenzy and Ken Griffin, who built both Citadel LLC and market making business Citadel Securities, also spoke. The hearing was led by Representative Maxine Waters, chair of the Democratic-led panel, who is a critic of Wall Street and in January called hedge funds “unethical.” Some lawmakers questioning the witnesses at times cut them off in frustration at not getting quick, clear answers. At the end, Waters promised to hold more hearings, with testimony from regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. She said she was “more concerned than ever” that retail investors were being taken advantage of, and that large market makers such as Citadel Securities could pose a threat to the financial system. Republicans on the panel also sought to burnish their consumer-protection credentials, making for a fiery virtual hearing featuring echoes, feedback and background noise. One main question was whether Robinhood had been pressured by hedge funds holding losing positions - they had an interest in making the short squeeze of GameStop end. But Tenev and Griffin denied that. “We don’t answer to hedge funds,” said Tenev. “We serve millions of small investors who use our platform.” Citadel CEO Griffin said the same. “Absolutely not,” he replied, when asked whether Citadel had contacted Robinhood about restricting trading. Tenev found himself repeatedly in the hotseat, explaining how Robinhood makes money and how its clients fare while trading on its platform. Representative Sean Casten, a Democrat, played an automated message on the Robinhood customer service phone line while questioning Tenev about how customers are treated. Griffin, a Republican donor, was meanwhile castigated by another Democrat, Representative Brad Sherman, for evading his question about whether market-makers provide the same prices to all brokers. Griffin maintained that Citadel Securities, which executes roughly 47% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, had worked for years to help give consumers “a better price.” Some of the repercussions of the GameStop saga could be in the business of short selling itself. Melvin Capital’s Plotkin, who first bet against the future of GameStop in 2014 when it traded around $40, is wary about holding big short positions again. Melvin suffered massive losses as the stock soared leading up to Jan. 28. Citadel made a $2 billion investment in Melvin on Jan. 25. “I don’t think investors like ourselves want to be susceptible to these types of dynamics,” Plotkin said. “Whatever regulation you guys come up with we’ll abide by.” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman also appeared, but was grilled less than the Wall Street players. Huffman and Reddit user Gill were asked about the role of social media platforms in potential market manipulation. “We spend a lot of time at Reddit ensuring the authenticity of our platform ... And in this specific case, we did not see any signs of manipulation,” Huffman told lawmakers. (GRAPHIC: GameStop's rise and fall - ) (GRAPHIC: GameStop comments soared on Reddit's Wallstreetbets - )"
315.93989159891595," Short-selling under spotlight in GameStop hearing NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short selling was under the microscope on Thursday as a U.S. House committee grilled executives from trading app Robinhood and hedge funds Melvin Capital and Citadel over the GameStop Corp trading frenzy, with some calling for change. Shorting a stock is a bet that the share price will fall. GameStop had around 140% short interest at its peak in January, meaning more shares were shorted than the company had outstanding. “The ability for the same share to be shorted an indefinite number of times is somewhat of a pathology and that should be fixed,” said Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev. He called for a modernization of the market’s infrastructure so shares can properly be tracked once they’ve been loaned out to be shorted, which does not currently happen. The GameStop saga could also dampen industry demand for shorting stocks going forward, said Melvin’s CEO Gabe Plotkin. Melvin had been short GameStop since 2014. It suffered massive losses as retail investors piled into GameStop in January, driving its price up 1,400% and creating a “short-squeeze,” where short sellers were forced to buy the shares back at a higher prices to close their positions, adding to the upward pressure on the stock price. Citadel made a $2 billion investment in Melvin on Jan. 25, which closed its GameStop position on Jan. 27. People familiar with the fund said it lost almost 30% in the first three weeks of January. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said of short-selling reforms that as far as legislative priorities that could improve the markets go, “this doesn’t make the top 100 list.” “The short interest in GameStop was exceptional and I’m not sure it’s worth us delving into legislative corrections for a very unique situation in terms of the extreme sides of the short interest,” he said."

315.93989159891595," Hedge fund manager Plotkin's GameStop short, dissected BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Gabriel Plotkin first bet against the future of GameStop Corp in 2014 when it traded around $40. But after a harrowing experience with short sellers in recent weeks, he’s wary about holding big short positions again. Plotkin, long one of the hedge fund industry’s most admired traders, became one of the financial industry’s most vilified players last month when an army of retail investors pushed the video game retailer’s stock much higher after his hedge fund shorted the stock, betting its price would fall. On Thursday, he spent more than five hours answering U.S. lawmakers’ questions about how his firm Melvin Capital Management, which shed 53% of its value in January, lost so much money and whether it wasn’t playing by the rules. But the fund manager, trying to strike a contrite note by saying he has to earn the cash back for his investors, turned the lens around and cast himself as having been hurt by Main Street investors who ganged up on the professionals. “They exploited an opportunity around short selling and we will have to adapt and the whole industry will have to adapt,” Plotkin said. “I don’t think investors like ourselves want to be susceptible to these types of dynamics. Whatever regulation you guys come up with we’ll abide by.” Plotkin said Melvin is paid to take a view on companies and always follows financial industry rules. “If those are the rules then I will certainly abide by them.” To him, GameStop was an ailing video retailer with structural problems and declining revenues. “Anytime we short a stock, we locate a borrower, our systems actually force us to find a borrower,” he said, explaining that Melvin does not engage in so-called naked shorting which is prohibited. He was not drawn into a debate about the merits of short selling. And he sidestepped picking a fight with Elon Musk when a lawmaker asked him whether Musk’s tweet “Gamestonk!!”, seen as an endorsement of the stock, might have targeted him for having at one point bet against Musk’s electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. “I don’t want to speculate on what the motives of his tweet were. The stock did rise,” Plotkin said diplomatically. GameStop’s gains deeply wounded Melvin as its assets shriveled to $8 billion from $12.5 billion at the start of the year. Billionaires Steven A. Cohen - Plotkin’s mentor - and Kenneth Griffin, who runs hedge fund Citadel LLC, gave Melvin Capital a $2.75 billion dollar lifeline. Due to the pandemic, lawmakers and Plotkin used video to communicate and the fund manager sat in a drab room whose biggest feature was a large printer. He said he comes from a middle-class family in Maine, and did not have a job when he graduated college. He left out that he worked for one year at Griffin’s Citadel and soon joined Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors. He has earned enough money during his career to buy a stake in the Charlotte Hornets professional basketball team and pay around $44 million for two side-by-side properties overlooking Miami’s Biscayne Bay last year."

344.0157346772114," Yellen says SEC will prepare report on retail trading volatility WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that an increased prevalence of zero-commission trading has spurred retail investors to get more involved in stocks, and the Securities and Exchange Commission will prepare a report on trading practices amid recent volatility. “Our broad conclusion was that markets worked reasonably well,” with core infrastructure resilient despite heavy trading and high volatility, Yellen told CNBC in an interview, referring to a recent meeting of regulators on retail trading that led to heightened trading in GameStop and other stocks favored on social media. “We really need to look at whether the trading practices are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,” she added. Regarding high stock valuations amid high unemployment, Yellen said this was partly due to a very low interest rate environment that has chased money into stocks. “In a world of very low interest rates, price-earnings type multiples tend to be high,” she said, adding: “there are maybe sectors where we should be very careful.” Yellen also said the market for U.S. Treasury debt remains “robust” and that she sees no issues with the Treasury’s ability to finance the U.S. budget deficit. The Federal Reserve will buy whatever Treasury debt is appropriate for the central bank’s monetary policy goals, she added. Asked if she wanted to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Yellen called it “a high-risk, speculative investment” that has seen a recent surge in value. The top priority was to ensure that bitcoin is not used as a vehicle for illicit transactions and that investor protections are maintained, she said. Ensuring that firms dealing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “adhere to their regulatory responsibilities I think is certainly important,” Yellen added."
344.0157346772114," GameStop frenzy sparks fresh investment in stock-trading apps OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The recent trading frenzy centered on GameStop Corp and other “meme” stocks is sparking a wave of investor interest in start-ups aiming to mimic the success of Robinhood Markets Inc, whose no-fee brokerage app has helped drive a trading boom. Public.com, a direct competitor to Robinhood that boasts a host of blue-chip backers, said on Wednesday it had raised $220 million, valuing it at $1.2 billion on the private market. Another well-heeled rival, Stash, said earlier this month it had raised $125 million, while Webull Financial LLC, backed by Chinese investors, is also raising fresh funds after enjoying an influx of new users. Robinhood, meanwhile, raised some $3.4 billion in the midst of the GameStop furor to assure its stability amid rapid growth and demands by its trading partners that it post more collateral. The fresh investments are coming even as government regulators ramp up scrutiny of Robinhood and others involved in the GameStop trading. A U.S. congressional committee on Thursday grilled the chief executive of Robinhood and a YouTube streamer known as “Roaring Kitty,” among others, as it probes possible improprieties, including market manipulation. Robinhood came under stiff criticism from some quarters for restricting trading in GameStop and other shares at the height of the frenzy, a move the company says it was forced to make due to requirements of partners that settle trades. It has also drawn scrutiny for a business model that relies on payments for sending trading business to partner brokerages, a practice Public.com and some other rivals are pledging to avoid. Investors see rich opportunity in bringing easy stock trading to smartphone users globally, though the companies say they are also cognizant of the risks. Stash, which doubled its active accounts to over 5 million by the end of last year, operates with only four trading windows a day to discourage rapid speculative trading, it said. U.K.-based Freetrade.io told Reuters by email that its user numbers last year grew six-fold to 300,000 and by mid-February had reached 560,000. It said it had raised a total $35 million, including from crowd-funding rounds from over 10,000 customers. But it does not offer margin trading or riskier offerings. “These products encourage investors to behave as if they are gambling or speculating rather than investing,” a Freetrade.io spokesman said. Interest in trading apps is soaring globally. In Mexico, trading app Flink launched seven months ago and already has a million users, according to co-founder and chief executive Sergio Jimenez. He said Mexicans can buy fractions of U.S. stock through the platform, but not Mexican stocks - yet. “Ninety percent of them are investing for the first time,” said Jimenez. Flink raised $12 million in a funding round in February led by Accel, an early investor in Facebook. Accel is also an investor in Public.com and Berlin-based Trade Republic Bank Gmbh, which allows European retail investors to buy fractions of U.S. stocks, according to Accel partner Andrew Braccia. “The bigger story here is there’s just this global trend of… accessibility,” he said. Start-up investors also see opportunity in the infrastructure behind the trading apps. DriveWealth, which serves Mexico’s Flink and 70-plus other online trading apps around the world, has hundreds more partnerships in the pipeline, according to founder and chief executive Bob Cortright. DriveWealth provides the technology to power digital wallets and trading apps, and also provides clearing and brokerage service to its business partners. “This is this is only beginning,” said Cortright. “The fact that you could have a smartphone in your hand in India, for instance, and buy $10 worth of Coca-Cola stock at an instant, that’s pretty game-changing.” Venture capital investments in U.S. fintech companies hit a record last year with $20.6 billion invested, according to data firm PitchBook. Globally, around $41.4 billion was invested in fintech companies in 2020."
344.0157346772114," GameStop briefly rallies after 'Roaring Kitty' testifies to Congress (Reuters) - Shares of GameStop briefly reversed losses on Thursday after the trader known as Roaring Kitty told a congressional hearing he remained optimistic about the stock following its recent rally and selloff. Shares rose as much as 4% before falling again to a loss of about 4%. Keith Gill, 34, known on YouTube as Roaring Kitty and widely followed on Reddit’s popular Wallstreetbets trading forum, addressed the hearing over video from a red videogaming chair. In the background was a poster of a kitten dangling by a paw with the caption “Hang in there!,” an apparent message to fellow GameStop investors, many of whom now face deep losses after buying at the height of the stock’s rally. “As for me, I like the stock. I’m as bullish as I’ve ever been on a potential turnaround for GameStop and I remain invested in the company,” Gill, who said he played video games and shopped at GameStop in his youth, told the hearing. Fueled by snowballing enthusiasm on Reddit, GameStop stock surged over 1,000% during two weeks in late January. The stock has since tumbled, but it remains up over 100% year to date. Many Reddit users are still bullish and urge others in the discussion group sitting on painful losses not to sell. Gill began sharing his positions on Wallstreetbets in September 2019, posting a portfolio screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop. By late January, he was up over 4,000% on stock and options investments in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his Reddit posts. Gill has not recently posted his position in GameStop on Reddit. Reacting to Gill’s testimony, users on Reddit described Gill as a “legend” and “our saviour!,” with one user commenting, “Godspeed my friend.” Gill appeared before the House finance panel along with senior executives from Robinhood, Melvin Capital, Reddit and Citadel."
344.0157346772114," REFILE-GameStop frenzy sparks fresh investment in stock-trading apps The recent trading frenzy centered on GameStop Corp (GME.N) and other “meme” stocks is sparking a wave of investor interest in start-ups aiming to mimic the success of Robinhood Markets Inc, whose no-fee brokerage app has helped drive a trading boom. Public.com, a direct competitor to Robinhood that boasts a host of blue-chip backers, said on Wednesday it had raised $220 million, valuing it at $1.2 billion on the private market. Another well-heeled rival, Stash, said earlier this month it had raised $125 million, while Webull Financial LLC, backed by Chinese investors, is also raising fresh funds after enjoying an influx of new users. Robinhood, meanwhile, raised some $3.4 billion in the midst of the GameStop furor to assure its stability amid rapid growth and demands by its trading partners that it post more collateral. The fresh investments are coming even as government regulators ramp up scrutiny of Robinhood and others involved in the GameStop trading. A U.S. congressional committee on Thursday grilled the chief executive of Robinhood and a YouTube streamer known as ""Roaring Kitty,"" among others, as it probes possible improprieties, including market manipulation. read more Robinhood came under stiff criticism from some quarters for restricting trading in GameStop and other shares at the height of the frenzy, a move the company says it was forced to make due to requirements of partners that settle trades. It has also drawn scrutiny for a business model that relies on payments for sending trading business to partner brokerages, a practice Public.com and some other rivals are pledging to avoid. Investors see rich opportunity in bringing easy stock trading to smartphone users globally, though the companies say they are also cognizant of the risks. Stash, which doubled its active accounts to over 5 million by the end of last year, operates with only four trading windows a day to discourage rapid speculative trading, it said. U.K.-based Freetrade.io told Reuters by email that its user numbers last year grew six-fold to 300,000 and by mid-February had reached 560,000. It said it had raised a total $35 million, including from crowd-funding rounds from over 10,000 customers. But it does not offer margin trading or riskier offerings. “These products encourage investors to behave as if they are gambling or speculating rather than investing,” a Freetrade.io spokesman said. Interest in trading apps is soaring globally. In Mexico, trading app Flink launched seven months ago and already has a million users, according to co-founder and chief executive Sergio Jimenez. He said Mexicans can buy fractions of U.S. stock through the platform, but not Mexican stocks - yet. “Ninety percent of them are investing for the first time,” said Jimenez. Flink raised $12 million in a funding round in February led by Accel, an early investor in Facebook. Accel is also an investor in Public.com and Berlin-based Trade Republic Bank Gmbh, which allows European retail investors to buy fractions of U.S. stocks, according to Accel partner Andrew Braccia. “The bigger story here is there's just this global trend of… accessibility,” he said. Start-up investors also see opportunity in the infrastructure behind the trading apps. DriveWealth, which serves Mexico’s Flink and 70-plus other online trading apps around the world, has hundreds more partnerships in the pipeline, according to founder and chief executive Bob Cortright. DriveWealth provides the technology to power digital wallets and trading apps, and also provides clearing and brokerage service to its business partners. “This is this is only beginning,” said Cortright. “The fact that you could have a smartphone in your hand in India, for instance, and buy $10 worth of Coca-Cola stock at an instant, that's pretty game-changing.” Venture capital investments in U.S. fintech companies hit a record last year with $20.6 billion invested, according to data firm PitchBook. Globally, around $41.4 billion was invested in fintech companies in 2020.   "
344.0157346772114," Factbox: The U.S. agencies probing the GameStop 'Reddit rally' saga WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A raft of federal agencies are probing last month’s “Reddit rally” in which Reddit users trading on low cost retail platforms banded together to push up GameStop Corp and other stocks, burning hedge funds that had bet against the companies. The resulting volatility triggered massive margin calls from post-trade clearing houses that guarantee stock trades, prompting several retail brokers to suspend buying in the affected securities. Here is who is probing the saga: The House Financial Services Committee on Thursday will grill executives involved in the saga. Lawmakers have questioned whether the retail trading platforms, by curbing buying in the affected securities, sided with powerful hedge funds over Mom and Pop investors. On Thursday, they will likely focus on commercial arrangements between trading platforms and market makers they route orders to and whether that “payment for order flow” model may disadvantage retail investors. There are also questions about whether hedge funds that bet against the shares pressured trading platforms to suspend buying and whether Reddit or its users breached the letter or spirit of the law by hyping shares. Market makers and retail brokers say “payment for order flow” often results in better prices for retail investors than if their orders were sent to the stock exchange. Lawyers say retail trading platforms’ user agreements typically allow them to curb buying, while social media platforms like Reddit are shielded from liability for users’ activity under a 1996 law. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee chair, has power to subpoena the companies if she is not satisfied on Thursday. The SEC is looking at every aspect of and parties involved in the episode, suggesting a swath of industry players may be swept up in its review of the trading frenzy. The potential misconduct the SEC is probing, according to its acting chair Allison Lee, includes: market manipulation; whether retail brokers breached fair access rules by restricting buying; the role of hedge funds with short positions in the companies, including whether there was enough data and transparency around their bets; and whether the companies took advantage of the rally to raise funds. The agency may also examine whether hedge funds broke risk management rules that aim to ensure investors can make good on their short bets, said lawyers. Consumer advocates expect the SEC will also examine “payment for order flow” arrangements. The Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin has expressed concern about market integrity and systemic risks. This month, he subpoenaed Keith Gill, a YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty who helped drive the surge of GameStop shares. Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton began probing retail trading firms, alleging “apparent coordination between hedge funds, trading platforms, and [social media platforms] to shut down threats to their market dominance.” New York Attorney General Letitia James is also reviewing the episode. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Justice Department and the San Francisco U.S. attorney’s office have sought information from brokers and social-media companies. Prosecutors are probing whether market manipulation or other types of criminal misconduct fueled the rally, the WSJ said. It also reported that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was probing an apparent Reddit rally in silver futures and an exchange-traded fund tied to the metal. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and CFTC declined to comment on the WSJ report. The CFTC has said it is monitoring the recent silver market activity."
344.0157346772114," Explainer: How were more than 100% of GameStop's shares shorted? NEW YORK (Reuters) - One area of focus from a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Thursday will likely be on the role short selling played in the GameStop market mayhem. Executives from trading platform Robinhood and hedge funds Melvin Capital and Citadel will be grilled following the retail-driven trading frenzy that sparked wild gyrations in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. Short selling, details of which are included in the memorandum here about the hearing, can be a positive move, as it can be used in hedging positions, more accurately valuing prices of stocks and exposing frauds, like Enron and Theranos. But Vlad Tenev, broker Robinhood’s chief executive officer, recently pointed out that some of the stocks involved in the “meme stock” rally were more than 100% shorted, implying that more shares were shorted than were available to trade. ""I just think that's pathological,"" he said on the All-In Podcast here late last Friday. ""You end up with this situation that could destabilize the financial markets."" Typically, shorting a stock is a bet that the share price is going to fall. Short sellers borrow shares from brokers and then sell them into the market, with the agreement that they will buy the shares back and return them to the lender at an agreed upon time. The shares can come from the brokers’ own inventories, or from customers that have allowed the brokers to lend out their shares. When it’s time to return the shares, if the stock price has fallen, the short seller can buy the shares back at a lower price than they originally paid for them, locking in a profit. If the price has risen, the short seller must buy back the shares at the higher price, incurring a loss. In the meantime, the short seller pays the lender interest on the value of the stock, giving the lender extra income. Not really. The borrower posts collateral, typically here 102% of the prior day's settlement price. The borrower can also request the shares back at any time. Once the short seller borrows the shares from the lender and then sells them back into the market, the new owner of the shares is free to lend them out, just as the previous owner did, and have no idea they are on the other side of a short sale. Settlement time is two days after the transaction. In that time, the same shares can be lent out again, and again. This makes it possible, on paper, for more than 100% of the float of a stock to be shorted. According to financial analytics firm S3, GameStop’s peak short interest was 141.8% of its float on Jan. 4. S3 argued in a recent research note that the traditional method of calculating the percentage of float is flawed because it uses stale data. U.S. investors are required to mark their shares shorted and regulators report these figures twice a month, with a 10-day delay, S3 said. There have been calls since the GameStop saga to improve transparency around short selling through more frequent reporting. When the price of a heavily shorted stock soars, short-sellers are forced to buy the shares back at a higher prices to close out their positions, pushing the stock price even higher. Shorting shares in GameStop cost hedge funds a total $12.5 billion over January, according to financial analytics firm Ortex. Yes. In 2004, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prohibited naked short selling, which is the practice of shorting shares before having borrowed them, except in some cases, such as when a market maker is providing liquidity.

344.0157346772114," The Wall Street players at the GameStop hearing BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The public will get the rare opportunity on Thursday to hear from big hedge fund managers who generally operate out of the spotlight, along with other players in the GameStop trading frenzy who are scheduled to testify in the U.S. Congress. Founders of hedge funds Citadel and Melvin Capital Management and trading app Robinhood are due to speak at the hearing which will be livestreamed here. So are Keith Gill, who helped fuel the surge in GameStop with Reddit posts using the tag Roaring Kitty, and Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman. The issues to be discussed are detailed in a memo here. Founder and CEO Ken Griffin here, 52, built both the Citadel LLC hedge fund and market making business Citadel Securities by investing in technology, data and traders. The businesses operate separately from each other. During the financial crisis Citadel’s hedge fund stumbled badly to end 2008 with a 55% loss. The hypercompetitive Griffin rebounded, and in 2009 the flagship hedge fund gained 62%. Over its three decades the hedge fund has returned an average 19% a year. In January, Citadel’s hedge fund and securities trading businesses became central figures in the GameStop story for two reasons: Its order flow from Robinhood, the app many retail traders used to buy GameStop, and its role bailing out Melvin Capital after Melvin’s short position on GameStop soured. Citadel Securities, led by Peng Zhao, competes with other market makers for Robinhood’s order flow and receives a large percentage of orders based on execution quality. It also pays Robinhood to process orders it receives. Griffin threw Melvin a $2 billion financial lifeline when it stumbled, saying he has “great confidence” in the team. In return he will get exposure to the fund’s future returns in addition to a share of the revenue for years. The move was reminiscent of other times Griffin took advantage of trouble. In 2006, he bought an ailing energy portfolio from Amaranth Advisors and in 2007 he snapped up Sowood Capital’s credit portfolio. Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev, 34, co-founded online broker Robinhood Markets Inc in 2013 with the goal of “democratizing finance for all,” by offering commission-free trading. Tenev was born in Bulgaria, grew up in the Washington, D.C. area, and earned a math degree at Stanford University in California. He dropped out of a PhD program at UCLA to join his Stanford roommate Baiju Bhatt in business ventures. The pair started two New York-based trading software companies before founding Robinhood back in California. Lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic turbo-charged Robinhood’s growth, especially among younger investors. The company boasts more than 13 million users and is valued at more than $20 billion, Reuters reported in December, with an IPO expected this year. Lawmakers are likely to question Tenev about the trading app’s decision to restrict trading during the GameStop frenzy, and Robinhood’s role in the “gamification” of stock trading, which may promote risky trading among retail investors and has attracted scrutiny in Washington. Tenev has faced heavy criticism from some Robinhood customers and has even been the target of death threats, according to Bloomberg. Robinhood declined to comment. Gabriel Plotkin, one of the world’s most successful hedge fund investors, stated his aim succinctly in August on a YouTube video: “Just get better every day.” He stuck to that motto for years, with 30% average annual returns from 2014 to 2020 at Melvin Capital, the fund named after his grandfather, a small businessman. Plotkin honed his craft at SAC Capital Advisors. He left when SAC pleaded guilty to insider trading charges but did not cut ties with founder Steven A. Cohen who was among his first investors and had $1 billion invested in Melvin last year. Over time, Plotkin developed expensive tastes, say people who know him. Last year he paid $44 million for side-by-side properties overlooking Miami’s Biscayne Bay and in 2019 he bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Hornets basketball team. In January, the hedge fund lost 53% and its size shriveled from $12.5 billion to $8 billion largely because of a bet that GameStop’s stock would fall. GameStop rose instead thanks to the Reddit rally. Plotkin’s short position in GameStop enraged some people so much that he received death threats. After GameStop’s Reddit rally swamped Melvin with red ink, stunned investors, regulators and lawmakers want answers to Plotkin’s risk management and how he had left his fund so vulnerable."
344.0157346772114," 'Roaring Kitty,' MassMutual hit with lawsuit ahead of GameStop hearing (Reuters) - The social media persona “Roaring Kitty”, who became a key player in last month’s frenzied rally in shares of GameStop Corp, is facing a lawsuit alleging he violated securities laws and caused “huge losses” for investors, just a day before he is set to testify before U.S. lawmakers. Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepF***ingValue on Reddit forums, allegedly hid his sophisticated financial training and duped retail traders into buying inflated stocks, according to a class action lawsuit filed in federal court in Massachusetts on Tuesday. Gill is scheduled to testify on Thursday in Congress about the so-called “Reddit rally,” which was hailed as a victory of the little guys against Wall Street hedge funds betting against GameStop and other struggling businesses. The lawsuit holds that Gill “incited” the rally. Gill downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws, noting in prepared congressional testimony published on Wednesday that he used publicly available information to determine GameStop was undervalued. It was a view he shared with a “tiny” following on social media ahead of January’s events, he said. “The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,” Gill said in the testimony. “I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel.” The lawsuit by Christian Iovin, a Washington state resident who purchased GameStop stock options, also names as defendants Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co and its subsidiary MML Investors Services LLC, which employed Gill until Jan. 28. MassMutual was obligated to supervise his activities as a registered broker, according to the lawsuit. The firm declined to comment. MassMutual told Massachusetts regulators it was unaware of Gill’s outside activities. Gill allegedly purchased GameStop stock for $5 and then used social media to drive shares from around $20 in early January to more than $400 in just two weeks, violating securities laws against manipulating the market, according to the lawsuit. The stock closed down 7.2% at $45.94 on Wednesday. Gill remains bullish on GameStop’s turnaround, describing it as “stunning” that the market continues to undervalue the firm, according to his prepared remarks. “In short, I like the stock,” he said."
344.0157346772114," Factbox: Stonks in Washington - Deciphering Reddit's WallStreetBets lingo (Reuters) - Reddit trading lingo may filter in to Washington on Thursday when top hedge fund managers, the head of Robinhood and Roaring Kitty himself are set to give testimony before U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers. The lingo of the online traders of Reddit's WallStreetBets group, or WSB, which fueled a surge in GameStop Corp's stock, prompted even singer Dionne Warwick to ask on Twitter here, ""What are stonks and why is it a trending subject?"" For the uninitiated, here is a guide to understanding some common WSB words. An intentional misspelling of “stocks” that originated with an internet meme. The social media pseudonym of Keith Gill, a financial adviser in Massachusetts whose Reddit posts and YouTube video streams helped drive interest in GameStop’s stock. An acronym for “you only live once.” If someone on WSB has “yoloed” a stock, that person has poured a significant portion of their investments into it. Someone who has taken heavy losses on a stock, in WSB parlance: While others may have profited from a similar position in the past, that person has been left holding the bag. Shorthand for chicken tenders, which WSB uses as slang for profits on a trade. Often referenced using emoji, “diamond hands” are how members express their belief that their position is valuable and worth holding on to for maximum profit. Conversely, a trader with “paper hands” sells out early. A rallying cry on WSB, which members use to express their belief that a stock will rise significantly. The phrase is often accompanied by a rocket emoji."

344.0157346772114," Ahead of GameStop hearing, Robinhood, Melvin Capital, Roaring Kitty publish testimonies Wall Street hedge fund managers, the chief executives of Robinhood and Reddit and a YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty on Wednesday defended their roles in GameStop's (GME.N) Reddit-fueled stock rally before they face a grilling by lawmakers. They insisted that while the market turmoil around the stock was unprecedented, there was no foul play, according to official testimony published by the House Financial Services Committee a day before a scheduled hearing. (https://bit.ly/3pucdNd) Last month's Reddit rally drove massive volatility in GameStop and other shares, prompting the post-trade clearing houses that guarantee trades to call for billions of dollars in collateral from Robinhood and other retail trading platforms. In response, many suspended buying in the affected stocks on Jan. 28. This outraged lawmakers, who questioned if the trading platforms were siding with hedge funds that had bet against the shares over Mom and Pop investors. Vladimir Tenev, CEO of online brokerage Robinhood, wrote in his testimony that the decision to halt buying was solely due to the need to meet regulatory capital requirements. Gabriel Plotkin said he was ""humbled"" when his hedge fund Melvin Capital Management suffered significant losses on the short end of the trade, but insisted his firm did not push Robinhood to suspend trading. Likewise, Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel LLC and majority owner of Citadel Securities, a market maker that handles most of Robinhood's customer orders, disputed speculation that his firm tried to influence Robinhood's decision. ""I want to be perfectly clear: We had no role in Robinhood’s decision to limit trading in GameStop or any other of the 'meme' stocks. I first learned of Robinhood’s trading restrictions only after they were publicly announced,"" he wrote. Keith Gill, who touted his GameStop investment for months on his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel and Reddit, insisted his position was solely based on publicly known fundamentals of the business and it was ""preposterous"" to suggest he sought to entice unwitting investors to buy shares. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company had analyzed traffic on the Reddit sub-feed WallStreetBets where users congregate to discuss stocks. The company found no bots, foreign agents or bad actors played a significant role in a traffic that helped drive interest in GameStop. ""WallStreetBets is first and foremost a real community,"" he said. On Thursday, the House committee will hear from the five men, as well as from Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute. Lawmakers have directed most of their ire at Robinhood, but Tenev insisted his company had little choice but to suspend buying. He provided extensive detail on demands from clearing houses for the firm to put up billions of dollars in additional collateral to meet regulatory requirements. He also dismissed the idea that Robinhood acted at behest of any hedge funds, calling such speculation ""absolutely false and market-distorting rhetoric,"" while noting its customer agreement and securities rules give it discretion to freeze trading. Griffin used the opportunity to point to flaws in the post-trade infrastructure, noting that faster settlement times and ""transparent clearing house capital requirements,"" could help reduce risks to brokers like Robinhood and its customers.

344.0157346772114," GameStop bull 'Roaring Kitty,' MassMutual hit with securities lawsuit The social media persona ""Roaring Kitty"", who became a key player in last month's frenzied rally in shares of GameStop Corp (GME.N), is facing a lawsuit alleging he violated securities laws and caused ""huge losses"" for investors, just a day before he is set to testify before U.S. lawmakers. Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepF***ingValue on Reddit forums, allegedly hid his sophisticated financial training and duped retail traders into buying inflated stocks, according to a class action lawsuit filed in federal court in Massachusetts on Tuesday. Gill is scheduled to testify on Thursday in Congress about the so-called ""Reddit rally,"" which was hailed as a victory of the little guys against Wall Street hedge funds betting against GameStop and other struggling businesses. The lawsuit holds that Gill ""incited"" the rally. Gill downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws, noting in prepared congressional testimony published on Wednesday that he used publicly available information to determine GameStop was undervalued. It was a view he shared with a ""tiny"" following on social media ahead of January's events, he said. ""The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,"" Gill said in the testimony. ""I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel."" The lawsuit by Christian Iovin, a Washington state resident who purchased GameStop stock options, also names as defendants Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co and its subsidiary MML Investors Services LLC, which employed Gill until Jan. 28. MassMutual was obligated to supervise his activities as a registered broker, according to the lawsuit. The firm declined to comment. MassMutual told Massachusetts regulators it was unaware of Gill's outside activities. read more Gill allegedly purchased GameStop stock for $5 and then used social media to drive shares from around $20 in early January to more than $400 in just two weeks, violating securities laws against manipulating the market, according to the lawsuit. The stock closed down 7.2% at $45.94 on Wednesday. Gill remains bullish on GameStop's turnaround, describing it as ""stunning"" that the market continues to undervalue the firm, according to his prepared remarks. ""In short, I like the stock,"" he said. "
293.1214843953305," GameStop fan 'Roaring Kitty' to tell Congress: 'I like the stock' (Reuters) - “In short, I like the stock.” That is the key takeaway for Reddit’s Wallstreetbets army of retail traders to upcoming testimony to Congress from Gamestop super-bull Keith Patrick Gill. The 34-year-old from Massachusetts who became the Pied Piper in a massive GameStop rally fueled by a Reddit discussion group will tell a Congressional hearing on Thursday that his enthusiasm for the struggling videogame retailer is backed up by his own research. Social media platforms including Youtube, where Gill is known as ""Roaring Kitty"", and Reddit's Wallstreetbets discussion group level the playing field for small investors competing against hedge funds and other institutional investors, Gill said in a copy of his remarks here published by the House Financial Services Committee a day before the scheduled hearing. The hearing on how Reddit users banded together to squeeze hedge funds betting against GameStop and other companies will feature rare opportunities for U.S. lawmakers to question powerful Wall Street players including top executives from Citadel LLC, Robinhood and Melvin Capital. Fueled by snowballing enthusiasm on Wallstreetbets, shares of GameStop surged over 1,000% as of their intra-day high during two weeks in late January. The stock has since tumbled, but it remains up over 100% year to date, with many Reddit users still bullish and urging others in the discussion group sitting on painful losses to hold on and not sell. “If he’s holding I’m holding,” was one of the top comments to a Reddit post linking to Gill’s testimony. “I’m glad to be bag holding right now with this legendary dude,” commented another user. Gill began sharing his bets with the group in September 2019, posting a portfolio screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop. By late January, he was up over 4,000% on stock and options investments in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his Reddit posts. In his testimony, Gill, says he never attempted to get people to buy GameStop shares for his own profit. He describes himself as the first in his family to earn a four-year college degree, and said he struggled to find work before landing a job in 2019 at an insurance company, where he worked while researching stocks and investing his own money in his free time. “I’ve been asked why I decided to share my investment ideas on social media. My investment skills had reached a level where I felt sharing them publicly could help others,” he said."

293.1214843953305," Don't rely on social media stock tips, EU watchdog warns retail investors LONDON (Reuters) - Retail investors should avoid using unverified information from social media to buy and sell stocks, the European Union’s markets watchdog said on Wednesday. Retail investors following the Reddit forum WallStreetBets in the United States piled into GameStop Corp last month, sending shares in the retailer rocketing at the expense of prominent investors who had bet against the stock, ringing alarm bells in Europe. Although market rules and structures are different in the EU, it cannot be ruled out that similar circumstances may occur in the bloc as well, the European Securities and Markets Authority said in a statement. There are already signs that more retail investors are piling into European stock markets. ESMA said increased participation of retail investors in Europe is helping to deepen the EU’s capital market, but they face significant risks when buying shares that are very volatile, the watchdog said. Investors should first gather information from reliable sources and know how much losses they can bear, ESMA said. Organising or executing coordinated strategies to trade or place orders at certain conditions and times to move a share’s price could constitute market manipulation, ESMA said. “Similarly, special care should be taken when posting information on social media about an issuer or a financial instrument, as disseminating false or misleading information may also be market manipulation,” it said. Care should be taken when disseminating investment recommendations, including via social media and online platforms, as they are subject to regulatory requirements, ESMA added."
293.1214843953305," Traders chase sky-high returns in leveraged exchange traded products NEW YORK (Reuters) - Frenzied speculation in the shares of GameStop may have subsided, but it is business as usual in a small corner of the market where traders looking to turbocharge their gains dabble in what may be some of the market’s most volatile funds. Leveraged and inverse exchange traded products (ETPs) - which aim to magnify the moves of an underlying index or stock several times over - account for only around 1% of the $5.9 trillion universe of U.S.-listed exchange traded products, according to CFRA. Yet some of these ETPs are drawing heavy interest from both professional traders and retail investors, though no definite numbers are available on their participation rates. But it is another sign of the voracious appetite for risk that has gripped markets in the wake of unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve, expectations of another fiscal package from lawmakers and a rally that has boosted the S&P 500 Index about 80% from its March lows. In recent weeks, investors looking to capitalize on the sharp rise in the PHLX Semiconductor index have poured money into the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares, which seeks to amplify daily moves in the chip index threefold. The fund is up about 1,000% over the last 11 months compared with a rally of about 150% in the chip index. It has logged inflows for five straight weeks, the longest such stretch since April, helping boost its assets to a record $3.27 billion. Meanwhile, assets in the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF, which provides leveraged exposure to short-term volatility futures, hit a record $2.5 billion on Friday, up about 50% since Feb. 3. Another leveraged ETF, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ which targets 3X the one-day return on the Nasdaq 100 Index, has nearly doubled its assets over the last 9 months to $11.13 billion, according to data from ProShares. The inflows to these funds come amid signs that investors are becoming increasingly willing to take risks, less than a year since a COVID-19 driven sell-off lopped about a third off the S&P 500 Index. Although these ETPs are leveraged, investors risk only the amount they invested, unless they bought on margin. Still, when the market moves against some of these trades, the losses can be quick and staggering.The latest fund manager survey by BofA Global Research showed cash allocations down to their lowest level since March 2013, allocations to stocks and commodities at their highest level in around a decade and a record in the net percentage of investors taking higher-than-normal risk. “Investors are seeing volatility and looking to participate from a short-term perspective,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, referring to flows into leveraged and inverse ETPs. ETPs track an underlying security, index, or financial instrument and trade on exchanges like stocks. Exchange traded funds, which contain investments that can include stocks and bonds, are the most popular type of ETPs. Analysts caution that leveraged and inverse ETPs, many of which are extremely volatile, are designed to be used as quick in-and-out trading vehicles, not as buy-and-hold securities. Long-term holding of some of these ETPs can rack up significant losses. For instance, UVXY, which appreciates sharply when stocks turn volatile, tends to fall steadily in value when markets remain calm. Leveraged and inverse ETFs accounted for more than 20% of the ETF closures in 2020, FactSet data showed, when many struggled to deal with intensely volatile markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission in October put off proposals for controls on the sale of leveraged exchange traded funds to retail investors, saying it would study the issue later. “I thought maybe, when I saw some of these close at the end of last year, the industry might be taking a different look toward these products,” said Lois Gregson, senior ETF Analyst at FactSet. “But we have seen different ones open up.”"
293.1214843953305," Melvin Capital raised put option on GameStop Class A shares to 6 million in fourth quarter 2020 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Melvin Capital Management on Tuesday disclosed it had raised the put option on Class A shares of U.S. video game chain GameStop Corp to 6 million shares for the quarter ended Dec. 31, from 5.4 million shares in the past quarter. The disclosure - which comes after a flood of retail trading drove GameStop and other shares to extreme highs in late January and squeezed hedge funds like Melvin Capital that had bet against it - does not reflect January’s moves when Melvin said it liquidated its GameStop position. Separately, the hedge fund reported a stake of 300,000 Class A shares in Airbnb as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing. While investors may be especially interested in Melvin’s position in GameStop, the firm also adds and sheds many other stock names every quarter, making the so-called 13F filings that detail quarterly holdings closely watched. In the fourth quarter Melvin added a new position in Facebook by buying 4.6 million shares. The fund, founded by Gabriel Plotkin, also increased its investment in financial company Mastercard Inc by 168% during the quarter. It raised its stake in Visa by 59%. The hedge fund also put on a new call option on Mastercard and increased the call option on Visa by 110%. Stocks that may get a boost once life returns to some semblance of normal as a COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out also got a boost in the portfolio. For example, the fund’s stake in hotelier Hilton Worldwide Holdings was raised by 125% during the quarter. Similarly the firm bought more shares in Nike, raising its holdings by 21%."

264.77481982528053," Handful of hedge funds bet big on GameStop before its wild ride NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of small hedge funds were in a position to profit from the Reddit rally that sent shares of GameStop Corp and other out-of-favor stocks rocketing higher last month at the expense of prominent investors who had bet against the stocks, according to securities filings released Tuesday. Hedge funds including Maverick Capital, Shellback Capital, Landscape Capital Management, and Engineers Gate Manager LP were among those that added a new position or increased their stakes in GameStop during the quarter that ended Dec. 30, according to a regulatory filings known as 13-Fs. Had each fund sold its shares of GameStop near the record closing price of $347.15, they would have banked gains of 1,600% or more. Shellback, for instance, could have seen its 200,000 shares reach a value as high as $69.5 million had it held through Jan. 27, a gain of nearly 1,750% from its market value of $3,768,000 at the end of December. Hedge fund Senvest, which told the Wall Street Journal that it scored a $700 million profit on the GameStop position, increased its position in the company by 56% when it bought 1.8 mln shares. Maverick, increased its stake by 164%, or 2.9 million shares, leaving it with 4.7 million shares, regulatory filings show. The filings do not include short positions and funds may also have been short, which would have diminished profits from long positions. GameStop shares surged as investors following the Reddit forum WallStreetBets bought the stock hoping to punish hedge funds such as Melvin Capital Management that had taken short positions in the stock. Melvin lost more than 50% in January, requiring a $2.75 billion capital infusions from hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel. Other hedge funds that entered January with bearish bets against GameStop included Maplelane Capital and Sculptor Capital, according to securities filings. Maverick, Shellback Capital, Landscape Capital Management, and Engineers Gate Manager LP and Senvest did not respond for requests to comment for this story. Along with positions in GameStop, hedge fund managers navigated a quarter that included the addition of electric car maker Tesla Inc to the benchmark S&P 500 and President Donald Trump’s unsuccessful attempts to overturn the result of the Nov. 3 presidential election. Tesla’s inclusion in the S&P 500 forced index-tracking funds to buy shares, boosting its shares during the fourth quarter. Some hedge fund such as Coatue Management significantly cut back their stakes during the same time period, leaving them less likely to gain from the company’s 13.4% gain for the year to date. George Soros’ Soros Fund Management exited its position in Twitter Inc while Kerrisdale Capital, whose founder told Reuters this year the company is enjoying a turnaround, cut its stake by 29%. Shares of the company are up nearly 37% for the year to date. Tiger Global, meanwhile, appeared to be betting big on several newly-public companies, raising its stakes in GoodRx Holdings Inc, DoorDash, Snowflake Inc, Airbnb, and Tencent Music Entertainment Group."

187.51468444284478," Exclusive: How GameStop missed out on capitalizing on the Reddit rally (Reuters) - U.S. video game retailer GameStop Corp decided it could not seize on the Reddit-fueled rally in its shares to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock because of regulatory restrictions, according to three people familiar with the matter. The Grapevine, Texas-based company found itself at the epicenter of an unprecedented trading frenzy last month, as amateur investors organized on social media sites such as Reddit to bet against Wall Street hedge funds that had shorted its shares. While many heavily shorted stocks, from movie theater operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc to headphone maker Koss Corp, also scored big rallies, “Gamestonk,” as it was nicknamed by many online, including Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, became synonymous with the wave of trading speculation. GameStop’s market value soared from $1.4 billion on Jan. 11 to a peak of $33.7 billion on Jan. 28. At that point, GameStop could have raised hundreds of millions of dollars through a stock sale to pay down its debt pile, which totaled $216 million net of cash as of the end of October, and fund its transformation into a digital gaming service, as sales at its mall-based stores dwindle. Yet GameStop never sold shares, the sources said, despite being egged on by many Wall Street pundits to do so. While it could still sell shares in the coming weeks, the opportunity to raise hundreds of millions of dollars has now slipped as the rally in its shares reversed. It now has a market value of $3.6 billion. GameStop examined the possibility of selling stock during the rally, the sources said. The company had already registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell $100 million worth of stock in December, an option it did not exercise, the sources added. GameStop decided it was restricted under U.S. financial regulations from selling shares because it had not yet updated investors on its earnings, the sources said. The SEC requires companies to have released such information when conducting stock sales. While GameStop had started preparing results for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in January, it was not due to report them for several more weeks, the sources said. By the time its shares took off in the second half of January, executives had already compiled data and had a clear picture of what the quarter would look like, the sources said. GameStop could have gone ahead with a stock sale by releasing preliminary earnings. But such a move, carried out for the purposes of a stock sale, came with significant logistical hurdles and regulatory risk that the company was not willing to accept, one of the sources said. The SEC had said it would scrutinize how companies took advantage of the trading volatility to sell stock and had asked that they provide more information to investors about the potential risks. Representatives of GameStop and the SEC declined to comment. “They were 2-1/2 months into their quarter when all this stuff took place,” said David Erickson, a finance lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School who was previously co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays Plc “It’s so deep in the quarter that from a legal and corporate governance perspective they would likely be obligated to pre-announce some high-level financial information for the quarter. And that can’t be prepared in just a week.” Other companies in the middle of the Reddit frenzy, whose financial quarters finished at the end of December and had already updated investors on their latest financial performance, were able to sell stock when their shares rallied at the end of January. AMC, whose movie theater business has been hurt by the pandemic, raised roughly $1.2 billion through debt and equity deals after its shares rallied more than 700%. American Airlines Group Inc, which has also suffered as demand for flights plummeted, pulled the trigger on a plan to sell more than $1 billion of stock last month after its shares rallied as much as 48%. GameStop has lost market share to larger competitors, including Best Buy Co Inc and Amazon.com Inc, as consumers buy video games online or through big-box retailers. Robert W. Baird & Co analysts wrote last month that the best outcome for GameStop shareholders would be for the company to close the majority of its physical stores and diversify into online businesses, including hosting tournaments and events. One of GameStop’s largest shareholders, online pet store Chewy Inc co-founder Ryan Cohen, and two of his partners joined the company’s board in January. Last year, hedge funds Hestia Capital Partners and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund also won seats on the board."

The SEC had said it would scrutinize how companies took advantage of the trading volatility to sell stock and had asked that they provide more information to investors about the potential risks. Representatives of GameStop and the SEC declined to comment. ""They were 2-1/2 months into their quarter when all this stuff took place,"" said David Erickson, a finance lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who was previously co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays Plc (BARC.L) ""It's so deep in the quarter that from a legal and corporate governance perspective they would likely be obligated to pre-announce some high-level financial information for the quarter. And that can't be prepared in just a week.""  AMC, AMERICAN AIRLINES Other companies in the middle of the Reddit frenzy, whose financial quarters finished at the end of December and had already updated investors on their latest financial performance, were able to sell stock when their shares rallied at the end of January. AMC, whose movie theater business has been hurt by the pandemic, raised roughly $1.2 billion through debt and equity deals after its shares rallied more than 700%. read more American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), which has also suffered as demand for flights plummeted, pulled the trigger on a plan to sell more than $1 billion of stock last month after its shares rallied as much as 48%. GameStop has lost market share to larger competitors, including Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), as consumers buy video games online or through big-box retailers. Robert W. Baird & Co analysts wrote last month that the best outcome for GameStop shareholders would be for the company to close the majority of its physical stores and diversify into online businesses, including hosting tournaments and events. One of GameStop’s largest shareholders, online pet store Chewy Inc (CHWY.N) co-founder Ryan Cohen, and two of his partners joined the company’s board in January. Last year, hedge funds Hestia Capital Partners and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund also won seats on the board. "

Tilray shares surged 51% on Wednesday amid signs the Reddit community behind the recent retail trading frenzy and the GameStop GME.N short squeeze is now talking up the cannabis sector. Shares in other cannabis companies also surged. The Tilray shares out on loan amounted to 41 million shares, Ortex said, comparing this to stock exchange data for Jan. 29 which showed 30.8 million shares or 27% of the freefloat on loan. S3 Partners, another financial analytics firm, put Tilray’s short interest at 31 million shares as of Tuesday. Estimated short interest in video game retailer GameStop, meanwhile, declined to 39% of freefloat versus exchange estimates of 46% at the end of January, according to Ortex. S3 Partners’ data indicated short selling in GameStop on Tuesday was at 26 million shares, equivalent to $1.3 billion. GameStop’s stock on Wednesday closed 1.8% higher at $51.20 after dropping in recent sessions from an intraday high of almost $500 during the January short squeeze."
179.72655898971564," Massachusetts regulator subpoenas GameStop bull 'Roaring Kitty' BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts securities regulators have issued a subpoena seeking the testimony of a YouTube streamer who helped drive a surge of interest in GameStop Corp as part of a review of his registration, including his “outside business activities,” an official said on Wednesday. The office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin issued the subpoena on Monday, looking to hear later this month from Massachusetts financial advisor Keith Gill. Gill gained notoriety as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube, making the case for buying shares of the video retailer with colorful language. Gill until recently worked for insurance giant MassMutual and is a registered broker. Gill became a key figure in the so-called “Reddit rally,” which saw shares of GameStop surge 400% in a week before crashing back to pre-surge levels. The volatility has also drawn scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers, the White House, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Attorney General. MassMutual has informed regulators they were “unaware of Gill’s outside activities and they had previously denied a request made by Gill to manage the portfolio of a family friend” in response to an inquiry from Galvin’s office, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State said in an email. The firm told the regulators Gill gave his notice on Jan. 21 and his last day was Jan. 28, she said. MassMutual and Gill did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Gill is due to testify before the Massachusetts Securities Division on Feb. 26, according to the subpoena."
179.72655898971564," Robinhood, Melvin Capital, Citadel executives expected to testify in Congress on GameStop turmoil: sources (Reuters) - Executives from Robinhood, Melvin Capital and Citadel Securities are expected to testify before a House panel at a Feb. 18 hearing exploring trading turmoil in GameStop Corp and related stocks, said two sources familiar with the matter. The House Financial Services Committee is examining how an apparent flood of retail trading drove certain stocks to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds like Melvin that had bet against those shares. A committee spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, and a full witness list for the hearing has yet to be made public. Spokespeople for the companies declined to comment. The hearing is the first of what could be several Washington-driven probes into what happened in the stock market to kick off 2021. The three companies have been at the center of the GameStop saga. Robinhood emerged as both a popular and accessible retail trading platform, but drew criticism during the frenzy after it temporarily handcuffed trading in GameStop and other viral stocks as the firm tapped credit lines. Robinhood’s commission-free trading model also put a spotlight on Citadel Securities, which accounts for over 20% of all U.S. equities volume and roughly 39% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, according to its website. Citadel Securities’ heft has raised questions over the company’s market power, including business arrangements where the company and competitors pay brokers like Robinhood for order flow. The GameStop surge resulted in massive losses for Melvin Capital, after the hedge fund bet the retailer’s stock price would tumble. The fund, founded by Gabe Plotkin in 2014, began the year with $12.5 billion in assets but lost 53% in January as retail traders ganged up on hedge funds."

Investors who followed the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets helped push shares of GameStop to a closing high of $347.51 on Jan. 27 as part of a strategy to squeeze hedge funds that had taken a short bet on the retailer. Since then, GameStop has tumbled about 85% to near $40 a share. The discussion of the stock was notably muted on Reddit as shares fell Tuesday.

Other Reddit favorites tumbled alongside GameStop, with AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc shedding nearly 12% and BlackBerry Ltd dropping nearly 4%. The benchmark S&P 500 was flat in afternoon trading. The average price target of analysts tracked by Refinitiv on the company is $13.44."
184.6750112368314," Canada stock market rules curb platforms linked to churning U.S. stocks TORONTO (Reuters) - Stock brokers in Canada cannot use marketmakers to execute trades for a fee, under a government rule that has restricted the growth of zero-commission trading platforms like Robinhood, whose booming business in United States was linked to wild swings in GameStop Corp and other “Reddit rally” stocks. U.S. zero-commission platforms sell orders to wholesale marketmakers and generate revenue. Canadian brokers are required to fulfill trades on exchanges because it makes the stock market more transparent than splitting trades among market makers. “Canadian regulators require brokers to go with best execution... for all orders to meet at the market,” rather than through a wholesale marketmaker, said Marius Zoican, assistant professor of finance at the University of Toronto. “As long as payment for order flow is not allowed in Canada, it would be difficult to have full-fledged zero-commission trading,” he added. In the United States, 10 million new retail brokerage accounts opened in 2020, according to JMP Securities, driven by the growth of zero-commission trading, versus 2.4 million in Canada, based on Investor Economics’ retail brokerage research. In Canada, most online trading platforms still charge commissions, even as they add new revenue sources to overcome pressure from declining trading fees. That has left Canadian retail investors with limited choices for commission-free trading. “They’re like gyms that rely on only 5% of members showing up; when 40% show up on the same day, they’ve got problems,” said Glenn LaCoste, chief executive at Surviscor, which analyses online services including Canadian discount brokerages. “Everybody wants to talk zero commission, but there’s no free lunch.” Questrade, one of Canada’s biggest non-bank online brokerages with C$20 billion ($15.7 billion) of client assets, has had about 200,000 account openings annually in its 21 years of operation. Robinhood has amassed over 13 million accounts in seven years. While Robinhood’s zero-commission trades have pushed bigger rivals including Charles Schwab and Fidelity to follow suit, most major Canadian trading platforms, including the biggest banks, Questrade and Aviso Wealth’s Qtrade, still charge for trades, and show no inclination to change. Regulators Canadian Securities Administrators and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada have not announced any changes to regulations, and did not respond to requests for comment about plans for payments for order flows. “We have a very strong regulatory system in Canada... and we’re not even close to the model of the firms” that experienced capital shortfalls in the U.S., said Stephen Graham, chief operating officer at Questrade. “Where does your pricing strategy go after free?” Qtrade’s new account openings spiked 60% in the last week of January from previous weeks, and trade volumes doubled in the month from a year earlier, more than half of these coming from Blackberry, AMC Entertainment Holdings and GameStop, according to Aviso data. “Charging for the trades helps to cover our costs,” said Christine Zalzal, head of online brokerage and digital wealth at Aviso. “Others who have zero commission may not have the robust information, education and support that we provide.” The only major zero-commission trading platform in Canada is Wealthsimple, owned by Power Corp of Canada,. It charges 1.5% in exchange fees on U.S. trades and funds Canadian trades with local deposits, Chief Executive Michael Katchen told Reuters. About 20% of its trades are in U.S. dollars. Wealthsimple, which has about 700,000 trading clients and C$3 billion of assets, plans to grow revenues by adding premium features for more sophisticated clients, he added. The firm, which has seen 70% growth in new clients since the beginning of 2021, is more open than some rivals to introducing payment for order flows. “There are great ways to introduce payment for order flows, in particular if the broker decides to share revenue with clients, enabling better price execution,” Katchen said. “In the U.S., because of a lack of transparency, and a misunderstanding of the business model, there was a huge backlash against this.”"
184.6750112368314," Analysis: Lost in the 'Gamestonks' mania - What is GameStop actually worth? NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of video game retailer GameStop Corp have been on a wild ride. Analysts who cover the company, however, remain unmoved from their conviction that the stock still has much further to fall before it meets reality. The company’s shares soared more than 1,600% in January as retail investors, urged on by popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, bought the stock as a way to punish hedge funds that had taken an outsized short bet against it. While few on the forums have posted their breakdown of what they think is the fair value of a share of GameStock, a popular YouTube streamer named Keith Patrick Gill, who posted under the name the Roaring Kitty, suggested in videos prior to the short squeeze that it was worth at least $50 per share. The company’s stock fell 5.9% to $60 in Monday trading. Analysts who cover GameStock see it worth on average $13.44 per share, a 78% drop from its current trading price, highlighting the wide gulf between how Wall Street and amateur investors view a stock that has become a symbol of the growing power of retail investors. “I’ve worked on Wall Street for over 20 years and what is happening with GameStop is the most nonsensical, insane thing I’ve ever seen in my entire career,” said Anthony Chukumba, a managing director at Loop Capital who covered the company for more than 10 years but recently dropped his coverage due to a lack of interest by institutional investors. “GameStop at most is worth $10 a share,” Chukumba said, given its declining market share. “We’ve seen short squeezes happen all the time but we’ve never seen a stock become so disconnected from the fundamentals.” At heart is whether the company will be able to transition to a focus on digital sales without losing its profitable used games business, which at gross margins of approxamitely 50% is by far its most lucrative business segment. GameStop did not respond to a request for comment. In an unlikely “bright blue sky” scenario, GameStop shares would be worth $125 each, assuming a 20 times multiple of earnings per share of $6.29 in 2024, said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. That would only be possible if GameStop boosts margins by saving $500 million annually by closing its 2,500 physical locations while retaining its market share against competitors such as Best Buy Co Inc and Target Corp, he said. That scenario has at most a 5% probability of happening, Sebastian noted. Far more likely is that GameStop will benefit from faster e-commerce growth while closing stores at a delayed pace with a slower rollout of new services, leaving its shares worth $13 each, he said. A “storm cloud” scenario, meanwhile, in which customers abandon the store and push the company’s share price to zero, is three times more likely to happen than a successful transition to a digital marketplace, Sebastian said. The company's current average target price among analysts is nearly double that of November, shortly before Ryan Cohen, one of the company's largest shareholders, urged it in a Nov. 16 letter here to focus on digital sales. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, currently has a $16 per share price target for the company but said that “you could convince me that it’s worth $24” per share depending on its ability to transition to a digital-first business. Yet the stock’s price has become disconnected from its intrinsic value, leaving it inevitable that it will collapse, he said. “They are a real company with real profits and the management team is good,” Pachter said. “I was telling the shorts when it was at $8 that it’s not going to zero.”"

168.51666833333334," Once a 'stonk,' Hertz reveals dilemma companies face in Reddit frenzy NEW YORK (Reuters) - Months before the irrational trading in GameStop Corp, there was Hertz Global Holdings Inc. Operating under bankruptcy protection last spring once the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out its business, the car-rental giant confronted an extraordinary situation: Its stock price was skyrocketing for no apparent reason. Conversations at the time among Hertz management and directors on its board, reported here for the first time, turned from shock to a vigorous debate about whether the company should capitalize on its unexpected good fortune and sell shares to fund itself during bankruptcy proceedings, according to three people familiar with the deliberations. Raising money through a share sale would be less expensive for Hertz, which was bleeding cash as travel and car rentals plunged, than tapping a costly bankruptcy loan that most companies in its situation use to navigate court restructurings. Directors keen on selling shares fended off concerns from some in Hertz’s C-suite and boardroom that such a move risked misleading investors who failed to appreciate that creditors are always paid first in bankruptcy, two of the sources said. Shareholders, on the other hand, usually lose their shirts. But Hertz abandoned its plan to sell up to $500 million in new shares after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started scrutinizing it. Hertz declined to comment. Over the past few weeks, soaring stock prices of GameStop - along with movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, home goods retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc and other companies - on the back of Reddit memes and YouTube videos have put company leaders in a similar situation. The internal Hertz deliberations offer a window into the contours of the ethical and regulatory dilemmas they face. Namely, can they sell stock to raise capital in such a volatile market? Regulators are watching. The acting head of the SEC has said in recent days that the agency is looking closely at how companies are behaving, including whether they are trying to raise money and adequately disclosing risks associated with it to investors. “Taking advantage of what could potentially be a manipulated market would trigger both reputational and legal concerns,” said Donald Langevoort, a Georgetown University Law Center professor and former SEC attorney. The SEC declined to comment. As a social-media-fueled retail trading frenzy has whipsawed a series of “stonks” - a Reddit meme for stocks - over the past few weeks, the companies in the eye of the storm have largely kept quiet. But three sources familiar with some of these companies said discussions about surging shares are taking place in their C-suites and boardrooms as well. Unlike Hertz, these companies are not under bankruptcy protection. So far, they are taking different approaches. GameStop, whose shares slumped as much as 84% in the first week of February after surging more than 25-fold the previous month, has paperwork lined up to sell $100 million worth of new equity but has not yet disclosed whether it has done so. American Airlines Group Inc pulled the trigger on a plan to sell more than $1 billion of stock after its shares recently rallied as much as 48%. GameStop and American declined to comment. AMC, which previously warned it could file for bankruptcy after the pandemic temporarily closed its cinemas, has raised roughly $1.2 billion through debt and equity deals. It is now racing to file papers with regulators to sell shares possibly worth hundreds of millions of dollars more, two people familiar with the matter said. “A company would be silly not to” consider selling additional shares, one source close to AMC said. “Any company that is thinking seriously would want to talk it through and decide what strategies are available.” AMC did not respond to a request for comment. In late January, Chief Executive Adam Aron said recent fundraising meant “any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table.” That was the dilemma Hertz faced last spring. The company filed for bankruptcy last May, crumbling under roughly $19 billion of debt as the pandemic decimated its business. Roughly two weeks later, Hertz shares vaulted nearly 16 times to a high of $6.25, almost unheard of at the time for any company, let alone one under bankruptcy protection. Directors, executives and company advisers were befuddled, three sources familiar with the matter said. Calling around, there were no signs that a hedge fund or other large institutional investor was buying shares, one of the sources said. An adviser talked with an investor who suggested the trading app Robinhood was behind the unexpected rise, the source said. Indeed, Hertz was among the platform’s most popular stocks. “Hertz bankruptcy is CANCELLED by Robinhood ‘investors,’” a Reddit commenter called “itsnotshade” wrote at the time. “Good job guys.” Some Hertz directors saw an opportunity to bolster its cash coffers with a stock sale. But some in the management, along with other directors, pushed back over concerns the shares were virtually worthless and any offering would take advantage of small-time investors unfamiliar with bankruptcy law, the sources familiar with the discussions at the time said. Directors favoring a share sale countered that, while rare, shareholders sometimes receive payouts in bankruptcy cases, one of the sources said. Shares of other companies under bankruptcy protection, such as J.C. Penney Co Inc and Whiting Petroleum Corp, were also spiking at the time. Eventually, the board decided to proceed with selling shares. On June 12, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath approved Hertz’s plan to sell new shares. In court filings, Hertz touted that it would not have to repay the money and that the move was better for its creditors. Hertz alerted the SEC and warned prospective buyers they would likely lose all their money. But the deal was done before it started. In a television interview, then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the agency had informed Hertz it had “comments” on the stock offering, and that most companies do not go forward after hearing from the regulator until the issues are resolved. Reuters could not determine the content of the SEC’s feedback on the offering. The next day, Hertz, not wanting to antagonize regulators, pulled the offering, two of the sources said."

Longer-term, several market analysts say the GameStop effect may be no more than a blip on the radar screen for markets as a whole.

150.08624117923785," GameStop shares halt slide after Robinhood lifts trading curbs (Reuters) - Shares of GameStop and other companies caught in the recent social media-fueled trading frenzy bounced on Friday, after online broker Robinhood lifted all the buying curbs imposed at the apex of the battle between amateur investors and Wall Street hedge funds. The videogame retailer, the initial trigger for the market slugfest after gaining popularity on social media platform Reddit’s WallStreetBets, closed up 19.20% at $63.77 after hitting a session high of $95, although the wild gyrations seen in the past two weeks appeared to be easing. “The WallStreetBets influence is diminishing to a certain extent because there are a lot of people that got burned,” said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure and a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “From a short seller’s perspective, I was spooked a week-and-a-half ago to short any small caps because I was worried WallStreetBets could squeeze me on it,” Dick said. “I’m not spooked anymore; I kind of went back to normal trading, so I can say I think the WallStreetBets influence is not as strong as it was last week.” Robinhood, among the fee-free online brokers credited with fueling the trades, said late on Thursday it had removed all buying restrictions imposed due to a surge in clearinghouse deposit requirements last week. With many of the stocks involved in the so-called “Reddit rally” slumping this week, hedge funds with bearish positions on GameStop made $3.6 billion in profits compared with losses of $12.5 billion in January, financial analytics firm Ortex said on Friday. The slump cut declines so far this year for GameStop shorts to $8.73 billion realized and unrealized losses through Friday morning, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. Analysts pointed to a stunning Hong Kong debut for Tencent-backed Kuaishou Technology as more evidence of the growing power of small investors, but on the WallStreetBets forum at the center of the last week’s action there were few signs of consensus around new stock market favorites. “The speculation is now fading, but that doesn’t mean it can’t come back a month or two months from now,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “A lot of the small investors may have gotten burnt, so it’s going to take time to heal that wound,” Cardillo said. “It may not pop up in those stocks that were already attacked, but it could happen in other companies and maybe on a broader scale.” Other stocks that have seen sharp declines as their fortunes reversed in the social media phenomenon, such as Koss Corp and the U.S.-listed shares of Blackberry closed higher on Friday, while others such as Bed, Bath & Beyond, saw their price fall slow. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with top officials on Thursday to discuss the volatility, and sources told Reuters securities regulators were looking at all aspects of the rally and all parties involved. GameStop’s stock has crashed to as low as $51.09 after scaling as high as $483 last week, but is still up about 220% from levels at the start of the rally in mid-January. Shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment have more than halved from a closing peak of $19.90 and closed down 3.67% on Friday. (Graphic: Wild ride for Gamestop and AMC: ) Shares of insurer Clover Health, which on Thursday became the first company to be targeted by a short-selling report in weeks, rose 5.7% due to a late rally sparked by comments from venture capitalist backer Chamath Palihapitiya in response. The company earlier said on Friday it had received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission following the report published by Hindenburg Research. Meanwhile, on WallStreetBets, participants were still urging investors to stick with GameStop. “GME YOLO/FOMO my second mortgage. 35k to 5mil to 300k. I WILL NOT SELL!,” read one post by a participant with the handle u/Rhollow1."

As of Thursday’s close, 25.4 million shares were shorted versus 25.86 million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $1.36 billion. As of Friday morning, GameStop shorts were down $8.73 billion in realized and unrealized losses so far in 2021, according to S3.

150.08624117923785," 'The police will visit you': why GameStonk won't come to China (Reuters) - In his Hangzhou apartment in eastern China, Wen Hao had just finished his daily stockpicking video when he discovered he’d been barred from social media platform Toutiao, a day after inviting netizens to join his stock-recommending community. In a country where trading activities are closely monitored and the internet censored, Wen, 35, reckoned his own blocking showed why the mass buying that sent shares in U.S. videogame retailer GameStop more than 2,000% higher over two weeks could never happen in China. “It’s OK if you have one hundred followers,” said Wen, a self-styled investment adviser who livestreams his stock recommendations everyday via Wechat. “But if you ask thousands of followers to buy a stock at the same time via social media in China, the police will visit you.” GameStop’s rally grabbed world market headlines for the manner in which swarms of Reddit users took on big short-sellers and hedge funds. Efforts to emulate that sort of drama in Asia’s idiosyncratic markets have been isolated so far. There was a small-scale online crusade to support Malaysia’s heavily shorted glove makers, and calls in South Korea to retain a ban on short-selling. But such retail cheerleaders have struggled to attract much of a following. China’s stock market once had the reputation of being a casino, yet the country’s stringent censorship, absence of famous short-sellers and a general tendency to not cross state directives stymie their efforts. Dean Li, a blogger on Xueqiu.com, a Reddit-like investor community, said the GameStop saga had demonstrated that “if a short-seller dares to rashly announce bearish bets against a listed company, it will be in trouble.” But both short-selling and option trading, the key drivers of GameStop’s stratospheric rise, are restricted in China, making such a duel impossible, he said. Huang Wei, founder of an online investment community that comprises what he calls “grassroots investors”, said he emphasizes with U.S. retail investors in their “riot” against Wall Street short-sellers, but in China, there’s no grounds for a retail investor uprising. “It’s a clash of people’s value outlook. It’s like farmers uprising against tyranny,” Huang said. “There isn’t widespread public discontent at the moment.... so you don’t see Che Guevara or Mao Zedong in the market,” Huang said, referring to the charismatic leaders in Cuban and Chinese revolutions. The chance of a Chinese equivalent to GameStop emerging has been dimmed further by recent capital market reforms aimed at weeding out weak companies and encouraging long-term investment. Chinese regulators are also cracking down on price manipulation and Internet stock recommendations. The China Securities Regulatory Commission campaign last September scrutinized illegitimate stock recommendations, also taking aim at “market black mouths” who spread misleading information to influence stock prices, as well as “black apps”, which attract investor clients using chat groups on social media. Chinese hedge fund manager Yuan Yuwei said the trading patterns seen in GameStop are not new in China, or Hong Kong, where speculators have talked up stocks in pump-and-dump schemes. “The pattern is identical. You drive up share prices and attract followers. And then, you dump your holdings to late comers. The only difference is that you have no or little short positions (in China),” he said, adding such practices have become much less common in China in recent years. Still, Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer, said he expected the retail frenzy to flare up soon in Asia, including China. “That could be a perfect storm where you have the use of these Robinhood-type platforms, plus, the spread of internet chat groups, plus, the highly shorted names. That would create a potent cocktail,” said Tiruchelvam, who identified stocks including China Literature and MTR Corp as potential targets. “This is actually the beginning of a massive wave of investing behavior along these lines.”"
150.08624117923785," 'To the moon' or to a lawyer, GameStop investors cope with stock's rollercoaster NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eric Diaz, an operations manager in Tampa, Florida, remains committed to his GameStop shares even after their steep retreat from highs they hit last week. “It got personal,” he said. Like many other people, Diaz first invested $3,000 after reading about the video game retailer’s stock on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets. The so-called “Reddit rally” to squeeze shortsellers rocketed GameStop Corp shares from below $18 a share in early January to as high as $483 last week. Diaz sold some to take profits of $1,500 and hold on to the rest, 10 shares. After watching the shares plunge on Thursday to close at $53.5, Diaz said he plans to buy more if the price keeps dropping. “At first it was investing in an idea,” said Diaz. “But then after all the shenanigans when retail investors who wanted to purchase were prevented from doing it, it got personal. So I’m just going to hold until it plays out.” The wild swings of GameStop and other Reddit rally favorites were cast as a David versus Goliath tale of individuals taking on Wall Street hedge funds. With trading volume swelling last week, online broker Robinhood and other investing apps placed restrictions on GameStop and other shares. The fierce rally damaged some hedge funds when they could not cover short positions. Still, many people on Wall Street have also made money off GameStop, while some small investors were hurt by its rapid decline. Many financial professionals had warned the rally could not last forever. Still, lawyers said their phones have been ringing with GameStop shareholders hoping to recoup losses. Even during this week’s swoon, many recent Reddit posts pledged to hold GameStop until the stock goes “to the moon.” “IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN” Those who were late to the party are likely looking at losses, if they did not hedge their long positions somehow. John Gjolaj, a restaurant manager in New York and longtime user of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, invested in over 300 shares of GameStop last week at $269 a share. He plans to hold on. Gjolaj said he believed GameStop’s team can turn around the company. “I’m hoping I can sell it at $500 or so. But if it takes years, I’ll be holding,” Gjolaj said. “I invested in bitcoin at its height in 2017. I can stomach all this volatility.” Jerry Corley, a gardener in Arkansas, joined WallStreetBets’ thread on Reddit last week and bought three shares of GameStop on Monday. Looking at a loss, he has drawn encouragement from Roaring Kitty, the online handle of an investor who championed GameStop and whose posts claimed he turned an investment of a few thousand dollars into millions. “He has got his money where his mouth is. This guy’s no dummy. That’s a great sign right there,” said Corley. On Wednesday, Roaring Kitty, also known as DeepF***ingValue on WallStreetBets, posted a screenshot on Twitter of the GameStop stock, which was traded at around $4 in July, adding “I like the stock.” Keith Patrick Gill, a trained financial advisor who is behind the Roaring Kitty streams, did not respond to a request for comment. His recent posts show he still holds a position worth over $8 million in the stock. Some followers on Reddit posted after his Wednesday tweet: “If he’s still in, I’m still in.” Diaz tried to get around Robinhood’s trading restrictions by using several trading platforms. But the trading limits quickly drew a backlash from investors and U.S. lawmakers from both parties, and have also sparked lawsuits. Levin Papantonio Rafferty attorney Michael Bixby said his firm has gotten dozens of calls with “every sort of complaint you could imagine” related to Robinhood’s handling of GameStop trading. “If you lost $10,000, that might be a heck of a lot of money to the individual but it would be difficult to justify the cost of litigation,” Bixby said. A representative for Robinhood declined comment on the lawsuits. Previously, the online broker said the trading restrictions were put in place to because of the collateral it needs to post required by clearinghouses to backstop many of the trades. Matthew Schwartz, attorney at Kass Shuler in Florida, said most of the calls he received were from individuals trading options that could not buy, or who had traditional equities that were restricted. The Reddit rally also had winners that remain in play. Bryan Towey, a 20-year-old entrepreneur in New York, said he made over 890% returns on GameStop since he invested in 10,000 shares at an average cost of $22.10 per share in early January after reading about the company’s e-commerce sales growth. Towey has gradually sold his holdings since it hit $165, but still owns 2,200 shares, in the hope for another breakout. “I’m like a gut investor type of person,” Towey said. “I have a good feeling about the business. If there is another bubble, I’ll probably get rid of it.”"

150.08624117923785," Yellen seeks to 'understand deeply' GameStop frenzy as market regulators meet WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday vowed to protect investors, but said financial market regulators needed to fully understand the recent trading frenzy involving GameStop Corp and other retail stocks before taking any action. The core infrastructure of financial markets had proven resilient during the high volatility and heavy trading volume around GameStop and other stocks, Yellen said after a high-level meeting with other top regulators to discuss recent market volatility. But a timely study of the events by the Securities and Exchange Commission was important, Treasury said, adding the SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission were reviewing whether the trading practices were consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets. Yellen told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday it was critical to ensure “that our financial markets are functioning properly, efficiently and that investors are protected.” In her first media interview, Yellen said President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal stimulus plan was needed to alleviate the economic pain caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has left millions of Americans jobless. “We never had anything so large even during the Great Recession. We need to make sure people have jobs, if they don’t have jobs, that they’re supported,” Yellen said, referring to the 2007-2009 economic contraction in the United States. She said Biden still wanted Congress to pass the plan on a bipartisan basis and “is looking to cooperate” with Republicans. Yellen convened the heads of the SEC, CFTC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to discuss retail trading and “whether or not the recent events warrant further action,” she told ABC. “We need to understand deeply what happened before we go to action, but certainly we’re looking carefully at these events.” She did not specify what potential actions could be taken by regulators to respond to the situation. Many on Wall Street have been stunned this past week by the sharp gyrations in shares of video-game retailer GameStop, headphone maker Koss Corp, cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other stocks and commodities favored on the Reddit social media site’s Wall Street Bets forum. Traders had bid the shares to dizzying heights in an effort to punish shortsellers - who profit when shares fall - forcing some hedge funds to close their positions at heavy losses. But the so-called “Reddit Rally” later collapsed, exposing many individual traders to huge losses themselves. GameStop shares closed Thursday down 42% at $53.50, far from their peak of $483 a week ago. AMC Entertainment has lost about two-thirds of its value after two weeks of wild swings. Regulators likely discussed the online forums where mass buying of the stocks of those two companies was discussed last week, and the ever-larger role played by hedge funds in financial markets. “Any kind of market distortion by investors agreeing to cause the distortion goes against the smooth and transparent functioning of markets,” said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard, adding that such activity has not been previously scrutinized by regulators. The SEC is reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud, Bloomberg News reported. Before calling the meeting, Yellen sought and received permission from Treasury ethics lawyers to do so and ensure that she was in compliance with her ethics agreement. Reuters reported here on Monday that such an ethics waiver might be necessary because of the over $700,000 in speaking fees Yellen was paid by Citadel LLC, a hedge fund that has been at the center of the GameStop trading saga. Citadel, whose trading arm profits from processing trades on the Robinhood commission-free trading app favored by many retail investors, had provided a $2.75 billion lifeline to Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that had suffered major losses in the GameStop short-squeeze."
150.08624117923785," In GameStop saga, U.S. regulator examining all aspects and parties: sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking at every aspect of and parties involved in the “Reddit rally” of GameStop Corp and other stocks, said two people familiar with the matter, suggesting a swath of industry participants may be swept up in the regulator’s review of the trading frenzy. The people added that the furious surge in shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings and other stocks contained familiar patterns, in that it involves users of online platforms hyping up stocks – something seen in the past on bulletin boards and social media platforms. However, manipulation cases can be complex and may rely on more than simply language posted on a message board, they said. Thousands of Reddit users trading on low-cost retail platforms including Robinhood banded together to drive up the prices of GameStop and other “meme” stocks, squeezing hedge funds that had taken short positions, or bets against those shares. The resulting volatility triggered massive margin calls from post-trade “clearing” houses that guarantee stock trades, prompting several retail brokers to suspend buying in the affected securities. The Reddit effect then appeared to spread into the silver market last week. Several U.S. lawmakers expressed outrage at trading limits on individual investors, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a meeting of market regulators. On Monday, acting SEC chair Allison Herren Lee told National Public Radio the agency was examining the conduct of retail brokers, potential market manipulation, the role of hedge funds that bet against the companies, and whether the companies tried to exploit the rally by raising money. In recent days, questions have grown around the arrangements retail brokers have with market making firms to which they route orders; the role of the clearing houses; and whether some hedge funds jumped on the Reddit bandwagon and bought up GameStop to amplify their rivals’ pain. GameStop and other Reddit rally stocks have since dropped sharply, with GameStop down 38% on Thursday. Proving manipulation may be tough due to ambiguous U.S. securities laws, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law and a former SEC commissioner. “The law governing market manipulation is almost as chaotic as the trading in GameStop shares,” he said. Still, the episode is not entirely novel territory. In 2000, the SEC charged individuals in two separate “pump-and-dump” schemes that used internet message boards to drive up stocks. In December, it sued a former day trader who profited from spreading false rumors about public companies in online forums. The SEC would look beyond generalized hype for users who disseminated false or misleading information about material company issues, such as revenues and products, or coordinated efforts to force buying or selling, said lawyers. “I think the existing SEC playbook still functions fairly well,” said Philip Moustakis, counsel at Seward & Kissel and a former SEC senior enforcement counsel. If the trading was driven by a decentralized crowd with no organizers, that could pose challenges, he continued. “They might have to rely on a more novel theory of market manipulation.” The SEC will likely also probe whether hedge funds properly disclosed risky bets to clients and allowed some clients to cash out before others, said Ken C. Joseph, a managing director at Duff & Phelps LLC and former SEC official. Broker trading restrictions will also raise questions over fair access to markets, said Robert Frenchman, an attorney with Mukasey Frenchman & Sklaroff. “Fair access to markets has long been a regulatory priority,” he added. Robinhood has said its decision to suspend trading in some shares was purely a risk management decision and that it is committed to its customers."

Many of the so-called “Reddit rally” stocks fell sharply this week. GameStop shares closed Thursday down 42% at $53.50, far from their peak of $483 a week ago. AMC Entertainment has lost about two-thirds of its value after two weeks of wild swings. The family behind Koss Corp and some of the headphone maker’s top executives raked in about $45 million from a surging stock price during the rally. Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said retail investors who got burned buying at the highs were likely to be more cautious bidding up shares of companies with a high short interest. Retail investors “can see that this is a roller-coaster ride and not a one-way trip up, and that’s probably given them a little more pause before pushing the buy button.” Some investors may once again be setting their sights on stocks they believe are overvalued. Health insurance startup Clover Health, which is backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, ended down 12% after it was criticized in a report by Hindenburg Research. On WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum at the center of the squeeze that has hurt hedge funds and other “short” sellers, some denizens urged each other to hold the line and not sell GameStop. Others expressed frustration at the stock’s big drop. “It’s funny how everyone on here is telling others to hold but stock keeps falling meaning y’all are actually selling,” said a user with the handle the_undergroundman. “You’re getting played by your own brethren.” Despite this week’s declines, GameStop shares remain up 184% so far in 2021, AMC up over 200% and Koss over 400% year to date. Ahead of the Thursday meeting, Yellen said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that she and other regulators were seeking to “understand deeply” what had happened before considering action. Yellen was to meet with heads of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Analysts said they would likely look at online forums where mass buying of GameStop and AMC was discussed last week, and on the ever-larger role of hedge funds in financial markets. “Any kind of market distortion by investors agreeing to cause the distortion goes against the smooth and transparent functioning of markets,” said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard. “The reason this might not be covered by regulation yet is simply because it has never happened before. But now it might find its way into regulation in a more explicit way.” Credit rating agency Fitch said late Thursday that U.S. financial institutions face second order effects from GameStop volatility and that social media raises retail investors’ impact, which may have long-term implications for financial firms. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester told CNBC she does not see the Fed making any adjustments in reaction to the GameStop frenzy. The SEC is reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud, Bloomberg News reported. At least a dozen proposed class-action lawsuits accuse brokerage app Robinhood of breaching its contract with customers when it restricted trading last week. Hindenburg, which called Clover a “broken business” in the title of its report, said it had taken no short or long investment position - market code for a bet on the company’s shares. The group added it was important investors understood the role of short-sellers and their research. Famous as an early Facebook executive and minority owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, Palihapitiya was among the tech sector billionaires who encouraged the GameStop trade last month by saying he had bought into the shares. Meanwhile, Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted his support for cryptocurrency Dogecoin, sending its value surging more than 50%. Musk’s tweets about certain companies, including GameStop, and cryptocurrencies have contributed to the recent rally. Many analysts think the “short squeeze” is over and market attention has begun to turn to possible fallout. The number of GameStop shares shorted edged lower, according to the latest data from analytics firm S3 Partners. “The retail frenzy that provided an unusual distraction over the last couple of weeks appears to have lost momentum,” said Craig Erlam, market analyst at OANDA Europe. “A comeback tour may be planned at some point in the not-too-distant future but whether it will be as effective, we’ll have to wait and see.”"

150.08624117923785," Yellen says wants to ""understand deeply"" GameStop frenzy before taking action U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday vowed to protect investors, but said financial market regulators needed to fully understand the recent trading frenzy involving GameStop Corp (GME.N) and other retail stocks before taking any action. The core infrastructure of financial markets had proven resilient during the high volatility and heavy trading volume around GameStop and other stocks, Yellen said after a high-level meeting with other top regulators to discuss recent market volatility. But a timely study of the events by the Securities and Exchange Commission was important, Treasury said, adding the SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission were reviewing whether the trading practices were consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets. Yellen told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" earlier Thursday it was critical to ensure ""that our financial markets are functioning properly, efficiently and that investors are protected."" In her first media interview, Yellen said President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion federal stimulus plan was needed to alleviate the economic pain caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has left millions of Americans jobless. ""We never had anything so large even during the Great Recession. We need to make sure people have jobs, if they don't have jobs, that they're supported,"" Yellen said, referring to the 2007-2009 economic contraction in the United States. She said Biden still wanted Congress to pass the plan on a bipartisan basis and ""is looking to cooperate"" with Republicans.  UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED Yellen convened the heads of the SEC, CFTC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to discuss retail trading and ""whether or not the recent events warrant further action,"" she told ABC. ""We need to understand deeply what happened before we go to action, but certainly we're looking carefully at these events."" She did not specify what potential actions could be taken by regulators to respond to the situation. Many on Wall Street have been stunned this past week by the sharp gyrations in shares of video-game retailer GameStop, headphone maker Koss Corp (KOSS.O), cinema chain AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) and other stocks and commodities favored on the Reddit social media site's Wall Street Bets forum. Traders had bid the shares to dizzying heights in an effort to punish shortsellers - who profit when shares fall - forcing some hedge funds to close their positions at heavy losses. But the so-called ""Reddit Rally"" later collapsed, exposing many individual traders to huge losses themselves. GameStop shares closed Thursday down 42% at $53.50, far from their peak of $483 a week ago. AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) has lost about two-thirds of its value after two weeks of wild swings. Regulators likely discussed the online forums where mass buying of the stocks of those two companies was discussed last week, and the ever-larger role played by hedge funds in financial markets. ""Any kind of market distortion by investors agreeing to cause the distortion goes against the smooth and transparent functioning of markets,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard, adding that such activity has not been previously scrutinized by regulators. The SEC is reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud, Bloomberg News reported. read more Before calling the meeting, Yellen sought and received permission from Treasury ethics lawyers to do so and ensure that she was in compliance with her ethics agreement. Reuters reported on Monday that such an ethics waiver might be necessary because of the over $700,000 in speaking fees Yellen was paid by Citadel LLC, a hedge fund that has been at the center of the GameStop trading saga. read more Citadel, whose trading arm profits from processing trades on the Robinhood commission-free trading app favored by many retail investors, had provided a $2.75 billion lifeline to Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that had suffered major losses in the GameStop short-squeeze.

200.42989906542056," Short-seller Hindenburg takes aim at Palihapitiya-backed Clover Health Noted short-selling specialist Hindenburg Research published a critical report of Chamath Palihapitiya-backed Clover Health Investments Corp (CLOV.O)on Thursday, sending the insurance firm's down more than 10%, its biggest daily percentage drop in four months. Venture capital investor Palihapitiya, who held a 27% stake in Clover Health as of Jan. 7, was among the big financial names to support last week's GameStop (GME.N) buying frenzy against institutional short-sellers, saying early in the slugfest that he had bought in to the video game retailer. The Hindenburgreport, the title of which called Clover Health a ""broken business,"" risks reheating the battle between hedge fund short-sellers and investors. Clover Health said it would be issuing a statement in the next few hours to address the claims made by Hindenburg. Neither Palihapitiya nor his representative immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment. Hindenburg said in the report that it had no investment position in Clover Health. Citron, another of the financial world's famous short-selling research houses, said last week it would no longer publish reports recommending shorts. Clover, which sells Medicare-backed insurance plans, went public through a $3.7 billion deal with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Palihapitiya. Its other investors had included Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Sequoia Capital. Palihapitiya's SPAC raised $720 million in April 2020 and six months later announced the tie-up with Clover. In recent months, the popularity of using SPAC's has exploded among startup companies who want to avoid the more traditional route of using an initial public offering to enter the market. Clover shares closed down 12.33% at $12.23, the biggest daily percentage drop since Oct. 6. Volume in the session topped 68 million units, by far the most active trading day in the stock's history and well above its 10-day average of about 14.4 million. Shares of Clover had fallen 16.8% so far this year before Thursday's tumble. In September, Hindenburg issued a report on Nikola Corp (NKLA.O) calling it an ""intricate fraud built on dozens of lies."" Shares of the electric truck maker have fallen about 35% since the report. In a Dec. 15 report, Hindenburg said it remained short on Loop Industries (LOOP.O) with a $0 price target. Shares of Loop have climbed nearly 50% since. "

75.5221187957096," Fed's Bullard says not seeing broader risks from Gamestop trading frenzy WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The frenzied trading in Gamestop and other stocks driven by new retail trading platforms is not the result of the Fed’s loose monetary policy, and is not an issue for the central bank, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said Wednesday. “Fed policy has been appropriate given the crisis that we are in,” Bullard said. “As far as the trading itself, that would be an issue for the (Securities and Exchange Commission) not for us. You always have speculative activity going on in the financial markets. This was a spectacular case of that. But I don’t see it having consequences for the stance of monetary policy.”"

75.5221187957096," Game on after GameStop: Stocks soar again despite amber warnings LONDON (Reuters) - When the man in the street starts dispensing stock market tips, it’s time for the professionals to exit, goes the saying. Yet the torrent of cash sloshing around world markets means any warnings arising from last week’s frenzied face-off between retail traders and Wall Street hedge funds over U.S. videogame chain GameStop seem likely to go unheeded. Most traditional market-top signals, as outlined below, are flashing amber - just as they did before the bursting of the dotcom bubble two decades ago. What is different this time around is the sheer amount of money central banks and governments are pumping in, allied to interest rates that look firmly stapled to the floor for years to come. With the GameStop effect seemingly already fading as stocks get back on course for new highs, below are five signals typically seen as warnings of market exuberance: GameStop’s double blow: retail traders first managed to force hedge funds to sell positions to cover their bearish bets, and then, with the rally fizzling out this week, retail traders coming late to the party got burnt. (Graphic: GameStop effect shakes up hedge fund performance ) The GameStop drama has done little to no damage to technology stocks’ dominance, with a concentration risk rising in markets as the sector expands to make up a fifth of all global stocks - the highest since the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. (Graphic: Concentration risk in global stock markets ) Given record demand for equities, initial public offerings have done extremely well, much like the response to IPOs during the dotcom bubble, with prices hitting eye-watering valuations. Meanwhile, bonds have also drawn in a great deal of interest. (Graphic: Give me more ) The frenzy is also visible in options markets. The CBOE put-to-call ratio is firmly sitting at levels last seen just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy. (Graphic: CBOE put-to-call ratio pinned at 20-year lows ) Another indicator is the extent of central bank liquidity support in the system. M2, a measure of money supply that takes into account cash and deposits, jumped sharply last year spawning bubbles in many corners of the markets from bitcoin to high-flying tech stocks.

Yellen will convene the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Treasury said on Tuesday. Yellen sought and received permission from ethics lawyers before calling the meeting, according to a document seen by Reuters, along with clearance to engage on wide-ranging issues in the financial services industry. Yellen's decision to seek the waiver followed a report here by Reuters that because of speaking fees she was paid by a key player in the GameStop saga, hedge fund Citadel LLC, she may need permission to deal with matters involving the firm. A Treasury official, who declined to be identified by name, said the meeting would be held this week, possibly as early as Thursday. “Secretary Yellen believes the integrity of markets is important and has asked for a discussion of recent volatility in financial markets and whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,” Treasury spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said in a statement to Reuters. Yellen’s action comes after days of gyrations in the shares of video-game retailer GameStop, headphone maker Koss Corp, cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other stocks and commodities favored on the Reddit social media site’s Wall Street Bets forum. Retail traders last week bid up the shares to force short-sellers, who profit if a stock falls, to close their positions at massive losses, sending GameStop to a dizzying high of $483. But GameStop crashed back to earth, closing down 60% at $90 on Tuesday, leaving many traders with huge losses. Silver prices also fell. The SEC last week warned here that ""extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence."" The Federal Reserve Board declined to comment and the SEC, New York Fed and CFTC did not respond to queries about the meeting late on Tuesday. The Treasury official said Yellen was looking for an update from the top U.S. financial regulators. The meeting signals heightened concern about the volatility just a week after Yellen was sworn in as the first female U.S. Treasury secretary. The saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role played by non-bank firms in the financial markets, regulatory experts say. One of these is Citadel, which extended hedge fund Melvin Capital a $2.75 billion lifeline last week after the latter firm suffered massive losses in short positions. Yellen earned more than $700,000 in speaking fees from Citadel, as recently as last fall. In an ethics agreement here, she pledged not to involve herself in specific matters involving the firm - as well as major banks including Citigroup, Barclays and Goldman Sachs - without first seeking authorization. Treasury ethics attorneys have given Yellen flexibility to work on any related markets or broad financial services sector issues, with no limits on current or future matters, the Treasury official said. She may need to seek further authorization to deal with specific firms she listed. In the memo granting Yellen permission to call the meeting of regulators, a Treasury ethics official, Brian Sonfield, said it would be “difficult, if not impossible” for Yellen to recuse herself from matters involving market volatility. “You are the Secretary of the Treasury, the duties of which require you to be involved in a broad array of matters focused on these sectors,” Sonfield wrote. “Issues relating to these sectors could arise at any time without the opportunity for consultation with the ethics office,” and “argue in favor of prior authorization.”"

75.5221187957096," Explainer: How a GameStop share pullback could hurt some investors (Reuters) - Any pullback in GameStop Corp’s shares potentially exposes some investors to losses. Those at risk could include people who bought the stock at recent highs, or on margin, and those using options trading strategies. Shares of GameStop, which had seen a spectacular rally, fell 31% on Monday to close at $225, 53% lower than their Jan 28 peak of $483. Analysts worry some new or inexperienced investors could face losses if they bought in as the stock was peaking. Particularly vulnerable would be those who bought “on margin,” using money borrowed from brokers to buy extra shares. The strategy can boost gains when share prices are on the way up, but magnify losses on the way down especially if brokers issue “margin calls” requiring clients to add money or face forced sales to bring an account’s equity back to required levels. Brokers are not required to notify clients when they sell shares in a margin call, ""although most do so as a courtesy,"" according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority here, the industry's self-policing body. Riley Adams, a 31-year-old financial analyst who runs youngandtheinvested.com, a financial blog aimed at millennials, said if investors bought on margin late to the party “you’re definitely exposed right now.” Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, estimated about half the platform’s 1.2 million accounts are margin accounts. Thousands of margin calls occur on a typical day and the rate increased last week, he said. Peterffy said about 27,000 accounts had some sort of position in GameStock, and many positions liquidated were owned by traders who had shorted GameStock. Representatives for brokerages TD Ameritrade and Robinhood declined to share details about how many clients may have traded GameStop shares on margin. A Schwab representative did not respond to questions. However, Robinhood has restricted here buying shares, which limits investor exposure on its platform. Options bets on GameStop shares helped fuel the stock’s breathtaking rally. Investors are gauging to what extent they could exacerbate a decline. Some market watchers say a “gamma squeeze” - where market makers who have sold large numbers of calls to investors balance out their positions by buying the underlying stock - was a key driver of GameStop’s sharp rally. In theory, a sharp drop in the stock could prompt those same market makers to unload their shares, potentially speeding up a plunge. That’s what happened last September, after investors piled into call options on tech-related companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc. The unwind of those positions helped fuel a sharp decline in the Nasdaq. For now, however, it appears that open interest in GameStop calls has not accumulated significantly, as many buyers of those contracts have traded them the same day, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. More contracts have remained open among GameStop puts, according to data from Trade Alert. Another key risk would be to market participants who sold those puts, wagering that GameStop shares would not fall below a certain level, if the stock were to tumble significantly below their targets. But because options prices already account for gigantic swings in the stock, “people who are short options might not lose as much as you think,” Murphy said. Overall, GameStop options are now pricing in daily moves of about 27% over the next month, versus around 8.5% at the start of January, according to Trade Alert. On the other hand, investors who have held onto calls to position for further gains in GameStop shares could lose their entire investment should the stock not hit their targeted price before the options expire. A slide in GameStop shares would see short sellers looking to capitalize by finding “attractive exit points,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. Short sellers sell borrowed shares in a bet that prices will fall and the shares can be bought back at a lower level. At the same time, a slide could draw new shorts looking to jump on any downward price momentum, Dusaniwsky said. The number of GameStop shares shorted has fallen by more than half in the past week, as shorts have covered their bets, Dusaniwsky said. If new shorts join in as the stock slides, it would exacerbate the selling, as long holders try to exit their positions to realize profits, Dusaniwsky said."

75.5221187957096," In stock-trading frenzy, no systemic risk, Kaplan says (Reuters) -Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said Tuesday that while the Fed’s massive bond-buying program is creating plenty of liquidity in financial markets, there are no signs of broad market instability at present. “I don’t see anything right now systemic,” Kaplan said in a CNBC interview, responding to a question about a possible link between the Reddit-fueled frenzy in GameStop Corp shares and monetary policy. Kaplan did not comment on GameStop directly, and instead addressed the broader question of how Fed policy affects financial markets. “Some of the current situation you are seeing - one of the factors - is there is a lot of liquidity, and some of that relates to Fed purchases of $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month: I think it’s wise for us to acknowledge that.” The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since last March and has pledged to keep them there until the economy has returned to full employment and inflation has reached, and is on track to overshoot, the Fed’s 2% goal. It has also said it will keep buying at least $120 billion of bonds each month until there is “substantial further progress” toward the Fed’s full employment and 2% inflation goals, a benchmark that Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida has said may not be reached until next year. The bond-buying and low interest rates are aimed at making borrowing cheap and boosting investment and hiring to blunt the economic fallout of the pandemic. Critics say it can distort markets and create dangerous asset bubbles. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said it is “premature” to consider reducing the Fed’s bond-buying program, given the millions of Americans still out of work. Kaplan said Tuesday he supports the Fed’s current “aggressive” policy. “I still think we need to be doing what we are doing right now, in the teeth of the pandemic, but again, I think if we go beyond it, it will be healthier to start limiting this liquidity and normalizing policy down the road,” Kaplan said."
80.22221888888889," GameStop bears use options to profit from stock's plunge NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bearish investors are using options to capitalize on a slump in shares of GameStop Corp by more than half their value on Tuesday. Put options, often used to protect against losses or position for declines in a stock’s price, outstripped bullish calls in volume by a ratio of more than two to one on Tuesday, continuing a trend that has seen bearish derivatives bets on GameStop grow over the last week-and-a-half. The videogame retailer’s shares, which have seesawed wildly with hedge funds and other investors making or losing billions of dollars, were last down 56.3% at $98.33. They are now worth less than a quarter of their high of $483 last week. The positioning marks a reversal from six straight weeks of GameStop calls dominating daily volume, as options bets helped fuel a 1,625% rally in the video game retailer’s shares in January that triggered heavy losses among some investors who had shorted the stock, betting on its price to fall. “People are putting on puts in order to profit from the eventual GameStop short squeeze to be over,” said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS. Some investors may be turning to puts as an alternative to shorting the stock, analysts say. Demand to borrow GameStop shares has subsided significantly in recent weeks but remains high overall, making it relatively expensive to short the stock. That has made put options more appealing in comparison, said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. The stock’s sharp decline and the flight to put options are an inevitable consequence of the stock’s dizzying ascent, analysts said. Last week, implied volatility in GameStop - an options-based measure of how much traders expect the shares to gyrate in coming days - suggested daily moves of as much as 69% in either direction, according to Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The simultaneous rallies in volatility and the share price served as a “harbinger of downside to come,” she said. The run-up in volatility helped make GameStop options expensive, potentially putting them out of reach for some investors, said Steven Place, founder of InvestingWithOptions. As a result, call buying subsided, eliminating a source of fuel for the rally in GameStop shares. Implied volatility on GameStop calls has since fallen significantly, another signal of a shift in trading. “Once it starts to drop, that’s a warning sign that the squeeze is out of steam,” Place said."
80.22221888888889," Robinhood raises trading limit on five companies (Reuters) -Online trading platform Robinhood said on Tuesday it had raised trading limits on stocks of five companies, including GameStop Corp and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. The trading limit on GameStop shares was increased to 100 from 20, while restrictions on Express Inc, Naked Brand Group Ltd and Nokia were also eased, according to an update on Robinhood’s website. The online broker, one of the hottest venues in last week’s retail-trading frenzy, had put temporary buying restrictions on a small number of securities as clearing house-mandated deposit requirements for equities increased ten-fold. The move had drawn the ire of retail investors who were pouring money into certain stocks that were being heavily shorted by hedge funds following calls by Reddit thread WallStreetBets. However, Robinhood still recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week, according to market research data providers."
80.22221888888889," GameStop stock slide gives remaining short sellers some relief NEW YORK (Reuters) -The sharp slide in GameStop Corp shares is stemming the bleeding for short sellers, even though some who bet against the high-flying stock have already exited the trade to cut their losses. Short sellers saw paper gains of $3.57 billion during Tuesday’s session, as GameStop’s shares dropped 60% to $90, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. Overall, the last two days have been a relief for remaining bearish GameStop investors, after retail traders pushed the heavily-shorted stock well over $400 a share last week. Silver, another asset involved in the retail-trading frenzy, has been more immune to short squeezes due to a lack of a big position. Year-to-date realized and unrealized losses for GameStop shorts stood at $9.08 billion, according to S3, less than half of where the combined year-to-date losses stood on Friday morning. “Are the remaining shorts now making back some of their losses? Absolutely,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. But a number of short investors have already covered their bets. The number of GameStop shares shorted fell to 26.09 million, about 1 million less than a day earlier and down more than half in about a week, according to S3. “It’s kind of hard to win when you’ve already lost half your troops,” Dusaniwsky said. “We have had a lot of shorts take their losses and walk away from the trade.” Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop drama, lost 53% in January, while Maplelane Capital, another fund that bet against GameStop, had lost roughly 45% in January. The remaining shorts likely include those who have been betting against the stock for a while and have had an “iron stomach” as the stock soared and “momentum shorts” who have jumped into the trade more recently as the stock price showed weakness, Dusaniwsky said. Short interest in GameStop, a measure of the stock’s price and number of shares shorted, stood at $5.81 billion as of Monday’s close, down about 34% from Friday, according to S3. Along with the decline in GameStop shares, silver prices also retreated on Tuesday as the Reddit-driven trading frenzy that has shocked global financial markets appeared to fizzle. Silver prices in recent days have become an alternate focus in the battle between retail traders and big institutions. But unlike stocks such as GameStop, analysts said there was no big short position in silver to squeeze. Banks and silver producers do hold large short positions in U.S. futures markets, but these tend to be balanced against silver holdings elsewhere or future production, meaning they are not exposed to price moves. Most money managers and speculative investors on the Comex exchange in New York were already long silver before prices began to rise, and so have benefited from rising prices. What some of the Reddit crowd set out to do was to create a supply squeeze by buying more silver than the market could provide. But most traders say the market remained liquid and there is plenty of silver around. Silver slid more than 7% on Tuesday after surging on Monday to its highest level since February 2013."
80.22221888888889," Global equities rally as more U.S. stimulus looms, silver slides NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets surged for a second day on Tuesday, spurred by increased optimism about more U.S. stimulus and the economic recovery, while retail investors retreated from GameStop and fleeting interest in silver, causing their prices to tumble. The party for the Reddit-inspired trading frenzy that pushed GameStop’s stock up five-fold in five days last week appeared over as its shares plunged 60% in heavy trade to close at $90.00, less than one-fifth of an all-time peak on Friday. Silver prices also fell on Tuesday, sliding 8.5% to $26.54, after exchange operator CME Group Inc raised maintenance margins on its COMEX 5000 Silver Futures contract by 17.9% to their highest since October 2020. CME’s move on silver took the air out of GameStop too, with short interest declining to 53% of the stock’s available shares to trade, from 140%, said Tom Hayes, founder and chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. “Everyone’s rushing for the same narrow exit and trying to get off margin, and you have a lot of weak sisters that are coming out of the stock,” Hayes said. “The squeeze is over.” Equities rallied as investors saw improved prospects for President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid bill. The U.S. Senate voted to open debate on a budget resolution, starting a process that would allow Democrats to pass Biden’s package without Republican support. Expectations for Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com earnings after the bell were high and lifting investor sentiment, Hayes said. “Very few people want to be short going into that type of earnings report,” he said. Google closed up 1.38% and Amazon added 1.11%. The two stocks were among the top boosts to the S&P 500; 97% of technology companies have beaten analysts’ earnings estimates, IBES data from Refinitiv shows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.57%, the S&P 500 gained 1.39% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.56%. Advancing shares outnumbered declining ones by almost 3:1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Positive momentum overnight in Asia carried through to Europe, with the pan-European STOXX 600 closing up 1.29%. Medical device maker Coloplast and Sweden’s Indutrade were the top gainers on STOXX 600 on beating quarterly earnings. Initial European Union estimates showed the euro zone economy contracted less than expected in the fourth quarter but was headed for another, probably steeper decline, in the first quarter of 2021. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 1.34% after posting its strongest day in three months on Monday. Its emerging markets index rose 1.52%. MSCI’s gauge of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 1.4%. China’s benchmark CSI300 Index gained 1.5%, helped by easing concerns about tight liquidity and declining cases of new coronavirus infections. Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 1%. The dollar rose to two-month highs against the euro on a perceived widening disparity between the strength of U.S. and European economic recoveries from the coronavirus pandemic. A sell-off in the euro after coronavirus lockdowns choked consumer spending in Germany and short-covering in over-crowded dollar-selling positions also strengthened the greenback. The euro was last down 0.17% at $1.2038. The Japanese yen weakened 0.08% at 105.02 per dollar.

80.22221888888889," Canadian dollar beats G10 rivals on rising U.S. stimulus hopes TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart and the other G10 currencies on Tuesday, as oil prices climbed to a one-year high and the prospect of more U.S. economic stimulus bolstered risk appetite. Major U.S. stock indexes climbed as Democrats in Congress prepared to take the first steps toward fast-track passage of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package and new cases of COVID-19 in the United States fell for a third week in a row. New cases in Canada have also declined in recent weeks. Canada has signed its first deal to allow a foreign coronavirus vaccine to be manufactured domestically, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. “We’re seeing a broad-based rally in risk appetite today ... which is boosting the value of the loonie,” said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners. Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the global flow of trade and capital. U.S. crude oil futures settled 2.3% higher at $54.76 a barrel after major crude producers showed they were reining in output roughly in line with their commitments. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.3% to 1.2807 per greenback, or 78.08 U.S. cents, having traded in a range of 1.2781 to 1.2869. The only other G10 currency to gain ground against the U.S. dollar was the Swedish crown. It was up 0.1%. “The USD is broadly stronger against the majors illustrating today’s move is more about the loonie,” Smith said. Canada’s employment report for January is due on Friday, which could help guide Bank of Canada interest rate expectations. Canada’s 10-year yield rose 2.7 basis points to 0.910%, approaching the 10-month high it touched on Friday at 0.922%."
80.22221888888889," ""Buy the dip"": Retail traders urge others to keep the faith as GameStop tumbles LONDON (Reuters) - The Reddit online forum that fired up a global trading frenzy was in a more sober mood on Tuesday, with many retail investors begging others to “buy the dip” as their favourite stocks plunged. An army of retail punters had sent shares in U.S. videogame chain GameStop and cinema operator AMC soaring in the past two weeks, causing billions of dollars of losses for Wall Street hedge funds which had made costly “short” bets that the share prices would fall. But with GameStop halving in value on Tuesday, bringing its loss since Thursday’s peak to 75%, and AMC losing another 40%, the earlier euphoria was fizzling out, judging by posts on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets. “Guys. This only works (if) we work together. Buy the dip and hold. For all of us. The movement isn’t over. Balls of steel ... We can do this,” said one post from “mwybert” that had garnered more than 8,000 comments, most of them supportive. Another wrote: “This is looking ROUGH. To be honest I already made my money last week but I am holding the few I have left. But without people out buying the hedgies ... this is as good as done.” The squeeze on short-sellers in Reddit-favoured “stonks” - an intentional misspelling of “stocks” - upended Wall Street, forcing hedge funds such as Melvin Capital to post declines of more than 50%. Short-sellers such as Andrew Left’s Citron Research have shifted their approach to focus only on long positions. More retail traders joined the Reddit crowd as their focus widened to take on short-sellers in other asset classes, but they have struggled to make the same explosive impact. Silver was a new battleground. But spot prices slid nearly 9% on Tuesday, reversing most of the gains notched up in the previous two sessions and showing how much tougher it is for small investors to shift a global commodity than to move individual stocks. “With volumes in all the hot stocks collapsing, silver attack met by margin, Robinhood having to seek fresh collateral at a rampant speed, the signals that the retail mania could unravel rapidly are aligning,” said Mark Taylor, a London-based equity sales trader with financial group Mirabaud. GameStop and AMC shares, which small investors traded on Robinhood and other online platforms, are still more than double their Jan. 22 levels when the buying mania erupted. But many small investors that piled in late last week said on Reddit they were sitting on paper loses of more than 50%. Some wrote on the forum on Tuesday that they would capitalise on the drop in GameStop and AMC to load up on more shares. A few said the “vibe” on the forum had changed, making unfounded claims that internet bots had infiltrated the group to dampen the mood. Yet others pledged to hold, no matter what. “It”s not a loss until you sell,” wrote one post, while another declared: “Down 50% on gme. Zero or hero.”"

80.22221888888889," Analysis: GameStop saga expected to revive scrutiny of hedge fund industry WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With hedge funds at the center of market drama for the second time in less than 12 months, the GameStop saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role non-bank firms play in the financial markets, regulatory experts said. Scrutiny of the non-bank financial sector was already expected to be high on newly appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s agenda after hedge fund de-leveraging contributed toward turmoil in the U.S. Treasuries market in March 2020. But the sector is likely to garner much closer attention after a retail buying frenzy in GameStop and other stocks burned several hedge funds that had bet against the companies and led retail brokerages to restrict trading in the affected stocks. The incident appeared to spark market-wide volatility as hedge funds scrambled to meet their obligations and close out bad bets, trading the highest volume of shares since 2009, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. It has shone a spotlight on the huge footprint of non-bank equity trading firms, particularly that of Citadel Securities, which accounts for over 20% of all U.S. equities volume and roughly 39% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, according to its website. Its heft has raised questions over the company’s market power. “Washington was already expected to scrutinize various non-bank financial markets, but this episode increases the urgency,” Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note. “Citadel Securities will certainly be part of the conversation.” A spokeswoman for Citadel Securities declined to comment. After the 2009 financial crisis, Congress imposed tough rules on banks, pushing riskier activities into more lightly regulated sectors, such as asset managers and private funds. In response, the Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) began a review of the asset management sector. In 2016 it warned that leveraged hedge funds could cause instability during market stress if they became forced sellers. The FSOC said it would continue monitoring hedge fund risks, including leverage, and address data blindspots. But months later, former President Donald Trump’s administration shut down that project, according to Yellen and public records. With a Democratic administration in power and a new crop of regulators due to take over, regulatory advocates expect the Treasury to revive the project. “This is a decent moment to step back and think about what trading activities in the financial system regulators should really be concerned about from a broader systemic perspective,” said Gregg Gelzinis of Washington think tank Center for American Progress, who has advocated for FSOC to take on hedge funds. The Managed Funds Association, which represents the sector, did not provide comment on recent developments, but has said that hedge fund investments help pension funds and other institutional investors manage risk and deliver returns. Hedge funds will not be the only ones in the spotlight. Open-ended funds and money market funds, which have also grown in systemic importance, are already under review internationally by the Financial Stability Board. “We need better oversight of the non-bank financial sector, to make sure we have rules and safeguards in place that create a financial system that serves the economy,” said Gelzinis. The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment, but Yellen has been a strong advocate of FSOC’s work and has previously said March’s Treasury market turmoil showed that the risks FSOC had identified were “real and serious.” During that episode, highly leveraged hedge funds dumped treasuries to meet margin calls, prompting the Federal Reserve to prop up the market, according to the Bank for International Settlements. It added that September 2019 dislocations in the repurchase agreement market were a “precursor” to the March turmoil and involved similar players. As of 2020, aggregate net U.S. hedge fund assets were $2.9 trillion. But taking leverage into account, gross assets were $6.3 trillion, said FSOC. While aggregate leverage was relatively small, much of it was concentrated among a small number of players, FSOC found in 2016. “There’s no public policy reason why you should let people take on infinite leverage for what is essentially short-term speculation,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director at the progressive think tank Americans for Financial Reform. “We’re going to see a big push on this.”"
80.22221888888889," GameStop bears use options to profit from stock's plunge Bearish investors are using options to capitalize on a slump in shares of GameStop Corp (GME.N) by more than half their value on Tuesday. Put options, often used to protect against losses or position for declines in a stock's price, outstripped bullish calls in volume by a ratio of more than two to one on Tuesday, continuing a trend that has seen bearish derivatives bets on GameStop grow over the last week-and-a-half. The videogame retailer's shares, which have seesawed wildly with hedge funds and other investors making or losing billions of dollars, were last down 56.3% at $98.33. They are now worth less than a quarter of their high of $483 last week. The positioning marks a reversal from six straight weeks of GameStop calls dominating daily volume, as options bets helped fuel a 1,625% rally in the video game retailer's shares in January that triggered heavy losses among some investors who had shorted the stock, betting on its price to fall. ""People are putting on puts in order to profit from the eventual GameStop short squeeze to be over,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS. Some investors may be turning to puts as an alternative to shorting the stock, analysts say. Demand to borrow GameStop shares has subsided significantly in recent weeks but remains high overall, making it relatively expensive to short the stock. That has made put options more appealing in comparison, said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. The stock's sharp decline and the flight to put options are an inevitable consequence of the stock's dizzying ascent, analysts said. Last week, implied volatility in GameStop - an options-based measure of how much traders expect the shares to gyrate in coming days - suggested daily moves of as much as 69% in either direction, according to Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The simultaneous rallies in volatility and the share price served as a ""harbinger of downside to come,"" she said. The run-up in volatility helped make GameStop options expensive, potentially putting them out of reach for some investors, said Steven Place, founder of InvestingWithOptions. As a result, call buying subsided, eliminating a source of fuel for the rally in GameStop shares. Implied volatility on GameStop calls has since fallen significantly, another signal of a shift in trading. ""Once it starts to drop, that's a warning sign that the squeeze is out of steam,"" Place said. "

80.22221888888889," Buying into 'poor man's gold', Chinese investors jump on silver SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese investors rushed into silver investments on Monday, pushing up Shanghai silver prices while boosting performances of related stocks and funds, matching calls by global retail investors to boost prices of the precious metal. Retail traders on Reddit and other social media who caused a rally in share prices of U.S. video game retailer GameStop Corp have now turned their attention to silver, leading Chinese investors to also jump on the bandwagon. China’s domestic silver prices rose to their highest since September. Prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed up 9.27% at 5,939 yuan per kilogram. Spot prices on the Shanghai Gold Exchange surged to an over four-month high on Monday before ending afternoon trade up 9.4% at 5,890 yuan per kilogram. Open interest on the Shanghai futures contract also jumped on Monday to 516,568 lots, its highest since the start of the year. Trading volumes reached 2.28 million lots. “Since last week’s Reddit discussions to buy long, funds have flowed into the silver market,” said Xu Ying, precious metals senior analyst at Orient Securities Research. “In the short term, silver’s rise has little to do with fundamentals. Sentiment to go long is high, the market rally is not over yet.” Silver is dubbed the “poor man’s gold”, as it is cheaper to buy and invest in while impacted by the same factors as gold. Shares of Chinese listed silver mining companies like Shengda Resources Co Ltd and Inner Mongolia Xingye Mining Co Ltd, rallied on Monday, while listed open fund UBS SDIC silver futures fund closed 8.7% up. Chinese social media was abuzz with silver’s rally, but warned of a possible bubble. “I thought it will be the victory of retail investors, but if this continues, the market will definitely fall and retail investors will only harm one another,” said a comment on Weibo."
80.22221888888889," Analysis: GameStop saga may provide early test of Biden administration ethics pledges WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Arguably the last thing new U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to take up during her first days in office is a financial market imbroglio involving one of her last private sector business relationships. But as hedge fund Citadel LLC emerges as one of the key actors in the trading frenzy last week involving GameStop Corp - and questions arise over whether the activity exposes deeper risks for the financial system - Yellen could find herself pulled into the fray. Citadel, together with another fund, extended a $2.75 billion financial lifeline to hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which had suffered heavy losses by betting against GameStop. Citadel Securities, a separate trading arm, pays Robinhood to execute its users’ trades, a practice that has drawn some concern from investor advocates. The White House has said Yellen is among a handful of officials monitoring the fracas. As head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), Yellen is broadly responsible for the health of the entire trading and investing system. A sticking point for her to clear, though, may be $700,000 in speaking fees she accepted from Citadel, as recently as last fall. Yellen has pledged not to involve herself in an official capacity in matters involving the firm without first seeking a written waiver from Treasury ethics officials. Ethics experts say that pledge is not a hard wall for her to scale should the need arise. After ethics violations dogged the Trump administration, some groups are urging Yellen to pre-emptively seek a waiver, and set a precedent. “This example is a good test of Biden’s ethics executive order and the transparency that follows, but it also highlights the revolving door and why restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of government missions, policies, and programs,” said Scott Amey, general counsel at Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog group. The Treasury secretary normally does not get involved in matters involving individual stocks and concentrates instead on broad systemic risks to the financial system, which the department monitors through daily market surveillance. “Secretary Yellen of course will abide by her ethics agreement and ethics pledge in all instances,” Treasury spokesman Calvin Mitchell said. He did not indicate how she would approach the specific Citadel issue. Like many former government officials, including here her Federal Reserve chair predecessor Ben Bernanke, Yellen took speaking fees from private companies after she left government. Yellen filed an ethics agreement here with the Office of Government Ethics in December saying she would ""seek written authorization to participate personally and substantially in any particular matter"" related to any companies that paid her speaking fees prior to joining President Joe Biden's administration - for a year after her last speech to each firm. Yellen spoke several times at Citadel, most recently on an Oct. 27 webinar, according to the filing. She was paid at least $700,000 in speaking fees by the Citadel while she was in private practice at the Brookings Institution think tank, another disclosure here shows. These speaking engagements, which also include financial heavyweights such as Barclays, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, are not likely to impact her ability to give Biden broad advice on the stock trading matter, government ethics experts say. “If this becomes a situation where regulators are considering new rulemaking with Citadel as the poster-child, that’s different,” said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a group pushing for stronger financial regulation. A major question is whether volatility from Gamestop and similar retail investor revolts against short-squeezes boil over into a systemic event that sends markets crashing broadly. Typically a matter involving an individual stock or equity market trading and brokerages would fall to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said it is examining the matter. On Friday, SEC commissioners including acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement here they were closely monitoring the extreme volatility in certain stocks and warned market participants to ""uphold their obligations to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing."" Extreme stock price volatility “has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,” they added. Biden’s choice to run the SEC, Gary Gensler, awaits Senate hearings. The FSOC that Yellen chairs is charged with identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. It includes the heads of the Federal Reserve and other major U.S. financial regulatory agencies. It has the authority to designate non-bank financial institutions for consolidated supervision to minimize risk to the financial system or to break up firms that pose a “grave threat.” Distress in individual companies rarely rises to such a level. Treasury maintains daily market surveillance, but it is looking for orderly market functioning and broad systemic threats. Thus far, the situation looks contained, Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. Short positions in stocks favored on the Reddit social media site total about $40 billion, which would limit the pain to a handful of hedge funds. “The ongoing short squeeze in a few stocks by retail investors has raised concerns of a broader contagion. While we believe there is more pain to come, we remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Barclays said. Unlike many previous Treasury secretaries, Yellen has only worked as an academic and for the government, not at a bank or trading firm. Richard Painter, a former top ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, said many Treasury secretaries had a great deal more entanglements that would raise conflict of interest concerns than Yellen. Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, sold half a billion dollars in stock from his former employer Goldman Sachs Group Inc to satisfy ethics concerns. Paulson later forced Goldman and other major banks to take billions of dollars in taxpayer capital at the depth of the financial crisis. Steven Mnuchin, Yellen's immediate predecessor, pledged here after he was nominated to divest $94 million in investments, and refrain from any decisions involving CIT Group until August 2018, when he was due a payment of $5 million from the company. “Yellen is going to be about as clean as you can get on this stuff,” Painter said.

80.22221888888889," Silver prices, miners surge as retail buyers pile in A social media-driven buying spree lifted silver to an eight-year high on Monday, though prices later pared gains on doubts about the ability of retail traders that have been focused on stocks to sway prices in the bigger, more liquid commodity. Silver prices climbed to an eight-year peak of just over $30 an ounce before cooling off a little to trade up 6.3% at $28.70. At the same time, video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N), at the center of last week's ""Reddit rally,"" slid 30.8% to $225, but other shares caught up in the frenzy that has battered short-sellers extended their advance, including BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO), . A lot of people who were anticipating a GameStop-like rally in silver ""now realize there is not as much buying pressure pushing it up like some had thought,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors. It was not clear how long the Reddit-fueled rally in stocks shorted by hedge funds would last. It could mean more losses in the wider market this week if funds have to keep selling to meet redemptions or right their portfolios. Longer-term, they may have to shift strategies. read more Share prices swung wildly last week when small-time traders, who organised in online forums and traded with fee-free brokers such as the Robinhood online brokerage, saddled several powerful hedge funds with losses on their short positions. On Monday, however, the effect of the struggle on the wider U.S. market abated, with stocks ending sharply higher. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) was flat, having risen more than 500% this year. BlackBerry shares were higher in New York and Toronto trading. Robinhood continued to roll back trading restrictions on some retail-driven stocks on Monday, raising its trading limit on GameStop to 20 shares from four. It also raised trading limits on AMC and Koss Corp (KOSS.O). Investors who have been short shares of GameStop cut their year-to-date losses on Monday with a mark-to-market gain of $2.71 billion after the stock tumbled, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. Mark-to-market losses for short-sellers year-to-date stand at $12.6 billion, the firm said. The showdown has drawn scrutiny from financial regulators, lawmakers and the White House, concerned about possible market manipulation. The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said on Monday it will hold a hearing on recent market volatility on Feb. 18. Politico, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev was expected to testify on Capitol Hill on that day. Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders just days after existing investors pumped in $1 billion, it said in a blog post. The company, which faced anger last week for curbing the purchase of some stocks, raised trading limits on GameStop, AMC, Koss Corp and Express Inc (EXPR.N).

Miner Fresnillo (FRES.L) rose 8.95%, and U.S. small-cap miners Hecla Mining Co (HL.N) and Coeur Mining Inc (CDE.N) surged 28.3% and 23.1%, respectively. Small silver miners in Australia, which had leapt on Monday, retraced some of their gains on Tuesday. Natural gas rose about 10% on Monday, in part due to expectations for colder weather, though such moves are not out of the norm for that market. Late on Monday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange increased margins for several commodities contracts, including silver futures which was hiked by nearly 18%, as part of “normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage.” The CME typically raises margins when there are big price moves to account for the increased risk.

GameStop had 27.13 million shares shorted, down 35 million over the prior week, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. Still, GameStop short interest stood at $8.82 billion as of Friday, making it the sixth-biggest short by value, according to S3. GameStop shares soared 400% last week alone as the stock became a prime focus of a battle between small traders and big institutions betting against the stock. As of early Monday trading, short sellers had mark-to-market losses of $13.38 billion in GameStop so far this year, according to S3 Partners, although those losses were mitigated somewhat as the stock was down early in the session. “Fundamental and momentum shorts have incurred very large mark-to-market losses and they have been squeezed out of their positions,” Dusaniwsky said. “We saw over the last couple of days some serious short covering in the name.”"

-22.84889066666666," 'Gamestonks' or silver? Reddit investors worry about losing GameStop focus NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail investors on the popular online forum WallStreetBets expressed concerns on Monday that bets on silver were undercutting their focus on GameStop Corp and other popular stocks. Posts that argued against buying silver at the expense of GameStop swarmed across the 7.9 million-member discussion board as shares of GameStop fell 30.8% to close at $225.00 on Monday. Spot silver, meanwhile, jumped more than 11% before paring some gains, its largest one-day rise since 2008. “By buying silver ... you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME,” wrote a user with the handle RizzutosNOTAWORD who urged investors to continue to buy GameStop. “It will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in.” The posts discouraging investors from buying silver came after a number of posts over the weekend that touted buying the metal because it was undervalued and shorted by large institutions. ""Its value is seriously being artificially depressed by the big banks,"" a user with the handle here mrbulldops17 wrote late last week. Retail investors had pushed GameStop up more than 1,650% during the month of January as a form of protest against a handful of hedge funds which were betting that shares of the video game retailer would fall. The short squeeze in Reddit-favorite “stonks” - an intentional misspelling of “stocks” - has upended Wall Street over the last month, forcing hedge funds such as Melvin Capital to post declines of more than 50% while short-sellers such as Andrew Left’s Citron Research have shifted their approaches to focusing only on long positions. The last two weeks have been “a wakeup call and retail traders are likely to continue to be a force to be reckoned with, which will likely permanently affect the business models of institutional investors,” according to a note from Barclays. Yet the muted trading in silver is one sign that individual investor buying may not sway global assets as they have small-cap stocks with low trading volumes, said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for the Multi-Asset Solutions team at Wells Fargo Asset Management. “There is a big difference between some of the names in the Russell 2000 and the global silver market or gold market,” he said. GameStop, for instance, began the year with a market cap just north of $1 billion, compared with the roughly $1.4 trillion market value of silver traded worldwide. GameStop’s market cap stood at roughly $22 billion on Monday. “Guys got way over their skis in terms of how many similar hedge funds have huge short positions in this stock,” said Andrew Beer of Dynamic Beta Investments. “I’d be shocked if there are a lot of people who are vulnerably short silver so that if it goes up 5% they have to start buying and suddenly it goes up to 50%.”"

-22.84889066666666," Analysis: To the brink and back on GameStop - Wall Street vs Reddit NEW YORK (Reuters) - On three hours of sleep a night and with no time to eat, one New York-based hedge fund manager overseeing billions in assets called last week the most stressful of his life. “Nothing was making sense anymore,” he said, as he watched the stock of GameStop Corp soar, while he bet it would fall. Wednesday was the worst. Fueled by chatter on Reddit and other social media to take on Wall Street, investors used venues like online trading app Robinhood to bid up the brick-and-mortar retailer. GameStop surged 135%, on its way to gaining more than 1,500% in January without any change in its business outlook. Hedge funds scrambled. By this point trading had become so unpredictable across all sectors that funds were forced to dump their winning stocks to balance out their portfolios. “It’s time to cut out,” the manager said he told his team. “Let’s live for another day.” The experience of this manager and a handful of others interviewed by Reuters over the last days, who all requested anonymity for fear of personal threats from retail investors, is a keyhole into a week of losses on Wall Street they say was far worse for them than last year’s historic pandemic sparked sell-off. As a new week of trading begins, it remains to be seen how long the Reddit-fueled rally in traditionally unloved stocks will last. More immediately, it could mean more market losses if hedge funds have to keep selling to meet redemptions or right their portfolios. Longer term, they may have to shift strategies to find their footing and turn the tide to their advantage. “What is not clear as yet is whether this disruption will evolve into a market accident,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor of Allianz. The extent of losses has exposed a big weakness on Wall Street. Analytics firm S3 said GameStop short sellers had mark-to-market losses of nearly $20 billion so far this year. Several hedge fund managers said the idea to short GameStop had long been a favorite at exclusive “idea dinners”, where fund managers swap their best trades. Managers also noted traders, many of whom who work at multi-strategy funds that employ pods of portfolio managers, traders and analysts, often know each other well and may compare notes.Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital, one of the funds gored most by GameStop’s gains, took a $2.75 billion bailout from his one-time mentor Steve Cohen and Citadel’s Ken Griffin. The funds involved have taken a dent: Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management lost roughly 15% in January partly because of its investment in Melvin. Melvin’s assets slid during the month from around $12.5 billion to $8 billion, a source familiar with the situation said. Maplelane Capital, another fund that bet against GameStop, had lost roughly 45% in January, a person familiar with the fund’s returns said. Even Viking Global Investors, one of the world’s best-performing hedge funds, was off some 7%, people familiar with the returns said. Representatives for Plotkin, Cohen and Griffin declined to comment. “Being short consensus stocks is just bad business,” said Dinakar Singh, a former Goldman Sachs trader who now runs hedge fund Axon Capital and was not short the stock. “It is great while it is working but when it isn’t anymore one guy’s problem triggers everyone’s headache. It becomes a circular disaster.” INVESTING ‘INSANITY’ Fund managers said the week’s experience is changing the way they do business. Citron’s Andrew Left, who ignited the retail trading frenzy by publicly detailing GameStop’s issues, acknowledged defeat by Friday. He had covered his positions, taken a loss, and said he will stop publishing short-seller reports, a strategy that earned him millions and made him a prominent name in the industry. Hedge funds will also be much more cautious about having short positions going forward for fear of becoming a “mindless target”, said one former hedge fund manager, adding that “kind of defeats the purpose of hedge funds.” Traditionally hedge funds promised investors a cushion against market declines by being able to sell short and make money when stocks drop. Funds are also less likely to use trading strategies such as put options, a kind of derivative that has to be disclosed and that Melvin and Maplelane used, the managers said. At the same time, though, one thing will not change: Wall Street thinking of new ways to make money again. Already the tide started to turn somewhat late in the week for hedge funds as Robinhood and other some online brokerages used by millions of retail investors restricted trading in the stock. Many hedge funds still remain on the other side of the GameStop trade, with the number of shares shorted having dropped only 8% during the week as firms like Melvin covered positions. One New York-based banker said his clients were looking for other possible targets of retail trading frenzy and positioning themselves ahead of it to make money if the eye of Reddit turned that way. “People have spent all week running their screens on other situations that might fit this criteria,” the banker said. “You’re going to see more of it.” “This isn’t investing, this is insanity,” said Kyle Bass, founder, Hayman Capital Management LP. “A month, two months from now, I will be flabbergasted if GameStop isn’t below $100.”"

Funds in their coverage sold long positions and covered shorts in every sector,” the investment bank wrote in a note late Friday. “Despite this active deleveraging, hedge fund net and gross exposures on a mark-to-market basis both remain close to the highest levels on record, indicating ongoing risk of positioning-driven sell-offs.”"
-22.84889066666666," RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-Sideshow or main event? GameStop stock ride weighed as bubble warning (Repeating item sent previously with no changes to text) NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Some investors are growing concerned that wild swings in GameStop and other stocks driven by small-time traders could be fresh signs of overexuberance that foreshadow volatility for the broader stock market. GameStop shares closed up 400% for the week after the video game chain’s stock became a battleground between retail traders and Wall Street professionals, a tussle that captivated investors the world over. Some market-watchers see those massive gains, as well as the moves in American Airlines and other heavily shorted stocks, as a sideshow in a rally underpinned by Federal Reserve support, anticipated coronavirus relief spending and expectations that vaccines against COVID-19 will help the U.S. economy rebound later this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week pushed back on suggestions that the central bank’s super-low interest rates and massive bond purchases were creating asset bubbles. But those comments failed to quell some investors’ worries that the Fed’s monetary policy has encouraged excessive risk-taking across broader markets: The S&P 500 is up 66% since March and stocks stand near their highest valuations in two decades. The action in GameStop and other stocks “definitely gives us some cause for concern,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. “At the very least, you have to consider that there’s a chance of a market correction.” The moves also drew some comparisons to the internet stock mania two decades earlier. “Just the fact that you have a group of investors that are really chasing abnormal gains, that’s what is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble,” Ragan said. Some barometers of general over-exuberance are already flashing: Citi said its “Panic/Euphoria” model is in “elevated euphoric territory.” And the latest fund manager survey from BofA Global Research noted that allocations to cash had dropped rapidly, indicating that investors are putting more funds into riskier assets. The frenzied trading dominated the news on Wall Street this week, even as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other corporate heavyweights reported quarterly results. The S&P 500 fell 3.3% for the week, with trading volume surging above 24 billion shares on Wednesday, well above the 14.4 billion-share average of the past 20 sessions. The CBOE volatility index closed above 30 points this week for the first time since early November. One potential catalyst for further volatility could come if hedge funds are forced to sell out of positions in order to cover failed short selling bets, although it was unclear whether there would be enough of such selling to create a broad risk to equities. Already, some short-selling hedge funds appeared to be changing their approach. Short seller Andrew Left, whose company Citron Research was one of the hedge funds to spark this week’s battle with small-time traders over GameStop Corp, said in a YouTube video on Friday that his company would no longer publish short selling research. Others said the ramped-up activity of retail investors - who last year helped drive rallies in shares of Tesla Inc and other names - could in itself be the latest sign of market frothiness. “When you think about market bubbles, the last players that jump on board are retail, and that is generally what is happening right now,” said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. Analysts at LPL Financial doubt the recent ructions in GameStop and other names indicate a broader market bubble, noting that market breadth - which measures how many stocks are participating in a rally - remains healthy and credit markets are functioning “just fine.” “Maybe it is simply time for a break” in the S&P 500’s rally, the firm said in a report Friday. Others, though, pointed to potential market turbulence ahead. Stephen Suttmeier, technical research strategist at BofA Global Research, earlier this week urged clients to “take some profits” ahead of February, a comparatively weak month for stocks. Other worrisome signs are the explosion of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, and the surge in shares of electric vehicle companies on the heels of Tesla’s gains, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors. Still, he believes the frenzy over GameStop and other stocks is more of a “sideshow.” Even after their rallies, the market capitalization of GameStop and other companies that have recently seen their stocks soar are “like a rounding error” compared with the broader market, he said.

-46.58769353846154," Billionaire Steve Cohen quits Twitter, citing threats in GameStop uproar BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Steve Cohen, seen by small investors as an enemy in the GameStop stock drama this week, deleted his Twitter account because of what he said were threats against him and his family, a spokeswoman said on Saturday. “I’m going to take a break for now,” Cohen said on Twitter late on Friday, citing “personal threats.” His account no longer appeared on Saturday, and a spokeswoman for Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management confirmed it was closed. The small investors, connected on social media, mobilized to take on institutional short sellers of GameStop and other shares, sparking a short squeeze that sent those stock prices surging. The details of Cohen’s holdings were not disclosed, so it was unclear if he was a short seller. However, Cohen’s Point72 and Citadel LLC gave a capital infusion to Melvin Capital, a fund that held a large short position in GameStop, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss and survive. Cohen, who previously used Twitter largely to engage with fans of the New York Mets baseball team after he bought a majority stake last year, was among fund managers who received threats as the GameStop saga unfolded. On Thursday, Cohen got into a heated debate with blogger Dave Portnoy, who founded the sports and pop culture blog Barstool Sports. Cohen, worth roughly $14 billion, tweeted, “Hey Dave, What’s your beef with me. I’m just trying to make a living just like you.” Point72 lost between 10% and 15% in value since the start of the year to the middle of the week, people familiar with the numbers said."

CNN reported no such thing. Examples of posts sharing this purported screenshot can be found here , here and here . As explained here by Reuters, a surge of retail stock trading over the last year lit the fuse that recently sent shares of GameStop Corp rocketing higher without a clear business reason, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against the video game retailer and other companies that were out of favor on Wall Street. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online discussions about stocks on social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook appear to be gaining more influence. Investors pointed to discussion threads such as “WallStreetBets” on Reddit (here) for driving the surge in GameStop. Holocaust Remembrance Day, which marked the 76th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops in 1945, took place on Jan. 27 (here). The anniversary is in no way related to the GameStop short squeeze.

-46.58769353846154," GameStop rallies back as U.S. regulators eye wild trading (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission waded into the battle between small investors and Wall Street hedge funds on Friday, warning brokerages and social-media traders it was on alert for any wrongdoing in this week’s roller-coaster trade. GameStop shares rallied again, awarding retail investors the advantage in the latest round of their week-long slugfest against major financial institutions that had shorted the video game retailer. The so-called “Reddit rally” has inflated stock prices for GameStop and other previously downtrodden companies that individual investors championed on social media forums such as Reddit’s Wallstreetbets, which has almost 6 million members. GameStop surged 68% on Friday after brokerage apps including Robinhood eased some restrictions on trading. GameStop shares fell on Thursday following the curbs, which drew calls for scrutiny from regulators and outrage from celebrities and politicians on both sides of the political aisle. Robinhood said late on Friday opening new positions in 50 securities including GameStop is currently allowed, but limited. Koss Corp was up 53%, but both the headphone maker and GameStop remained below peaks reached earlier this week. Hedge funds and other short sellers had a bruising week. GameStop short sellers have endured mark-to-market losses of $19.75 billion so far this year, according to S3 Partners. Even so, the stock remained highly shorted, with $11.2 billion short interest. The SEC issued a rare joint statement from its acting chair and commissioners that said it was working closely with other regulators and stock exchanges “to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing” and would “closely review actions ... that may disadvantage investors” or hinder their ability to trade stocks. The showdown between small traders and professional short-sellers also drew scrutiny from lawmakers, the White House and the attorneys general of New York and Texas. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued 13 civil investigative demands, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, on Friday to Robinhood and others that put curbs on stock trading, calling it “shockingly unprecedented and wrong.” The battle added to uncertainty in equity markets that had looked ripe for a pullback. Some funds were forced to sell some of their best-performing stocks, including Apple Inc, to cover billions of dollars in losses on short positions. All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October on Friday, closing down around 2%.[.N] The surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across U.S. exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data. The “Reddit stocks” have accounted for as much as 7.6% of that volume, according to Piper Sandler analyst Rich Repetto. “The markets were vulnerable to a decline ... and this Reddit activity was the catalyst that sort of triggered the sell-off,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. GameStop marked a near 400% weekly gain, eclipsed by Koss’s 1,800% week. AMC Entertainment rose 54% on Friday, and was up 278% for the week, while Express added almost 28%. Virgin Galactic closed up 2.7%, Bed Bath & Beyond was up 5%, and American Airlines fell 5% after a rally the prior session. Since the start of the week, BlackBerry Ltd more than doubled to touch $36 on Wednesday before easing back to $19.96 on Friday. [.TO] Silver continued a blistering rally. While some companies swept up in the so-called “Reddit rebellion” have used the opportunity to raise capital, most have said little about the volatility in their shares. GameStop did not reply to multiple requests for comment. AMC, BlackBerry and Koss did not immediately respond to requests for comment. For a full list of Reuters stories about the GameStop phenomenon, please see: Restrictions imposed on Thursday were driven by the high concentration of risk in hot stocks and by increased clearinghouse capital and deposit requirements, Piper Jaffrey said. While Robinhood eased the curbs on Friday, it was still not allowing purchases of fractional shares in GameStop and some other companies, meaning smaller investors must bet more to buy-in. The brokerage was also limiting the number of shares any one account could hold. London-based trading platform Freetrade disabled buy orders for U.S. stocks but will allow users to exit positions. While the battle could limit short-sellers’ influence on the market, analysts said, the fact remained that the prices of stocks will eventually fall if they are overvalued. “These moves ... can go a lot further than people can expect, but they end with a quick move back down,” said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading. “People race for the exits very, very quickly.” Citron Research’s Andrew Left, who sparked the conflict with a call against GameStop, said Citron would no longer publish short-selling research and would shift to writing on companies that he thinks hold value. “When we started Citron, it was to be against the establishment, but now we’ve actually become the establishment,” Left said in a video on Friday. “The Citron narrative is going to change and have a pivot.”"

The CIDs were sent to Discord, Robinhood Financial, Robinhood Markets, Robinhood Securities, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, TD Bank, E-Trade, WeBull Financial, Public Holdings, M1 Holdings, Citadel Financial, and Apex Clearing Corporation, Paxton’s office said in a statement.

-45.787691692307696," Analysis: GameStop's 'Reddit rally' puts scrutiny on social media forums OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Social media services including Facebook Inc and Reddit restrict discussions about weapons, drugs and other illegal activity, but their rules do not specifically mention another lucrative regulated good: stocks. Some people think they should. Users of a Reddit group, in which 5 million members exchange investment ideas, generated significant profits by gorging on shares of GameStop Corp and other out-of-favor companies that had been shorted by big hedge funds. Investors have used social media for years. Anonymous posts have fueled cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes, according to studies, but that obscure market generated less scrutiny. The “Reddit rally” however, has roiled global stock markets and drawn scrutiny of posts in which thousands of smaller investors trade tips on platforms from Facebook to Instagram to Telegram and Clubhouse. Individual investors won praise from elected officials and the general public for jabbing powerful hedge funds with a “short squeeze.” Yet critics have emerged, accusing social media users of manipulating markets unlawfully by pumping shares of weak companies. The manager of one Facebook trading community said she has turned down requests to tout individual stocks. Social media companies are generally not liable for user activity under a statute commonly known as Section 230. Still, their rules bar illegal behavior like facilitating gun and drug transactions or distributing offensive content that could rile advertisers or generate calls for tighter regulation. Section 230 also has some carve-outs that in theory could lead to a tech company being penalized for user-generated content, including violations of federal criminal law, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law scholar who wrote a book on the law. He noted that the bar is high. The speech itself would need to be a criminal violation of a law that explicitly specified distribution of that speech as illegal. In addition, First Amendment precedents typically hold that the companies must have knowledge of criminal speech posted on their platforms in order to be held responsible for it, said Kosseff. Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried said the stock trading forums appear to be “purely legal behavior: irrationally exuberant buying by amateur investors.” Prosecuting users for deceiving investors is tough but possible, said University of California, Berkeley law professor Stavros Gadinis, adding that social media companies should have the same ability stock market operators do to intervene to stop alleged manipulation. Identifying bad actors among the frenzy is a challenge. “There’s all of these feedback loops and incentives behind the scenes,” said Sinan Aral, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “We don’t know exactly who was in the crowd.” The vast majority of traffic on Stocktwits, a social media platform for investors, appears to be people talking about stocks without evidence of manipulation, said Rishi Khanna, its CEO. He said the platform was not taking any extra moderation actions on this activity. Although Reddit has stated platform-wide rules - including no illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions - the service relies heavily on community-based moderation. Users who act as moderators make and enforce guidelines about what is permissible. The founder of the WallStreetBets Reddit community Jaime Rogozinski, who was a moderator of the group until April 2020, said he tried to draw lines on what to allow. He said he and other moderators removed illegal attempts to game the market, such as claiming to have insider information. When there were gray areas, he said they played it safe. “You’d have attempts for pumping up stock and I still to this day am not sure what the regulation was, but I never wanted to find out,” said Rogozinski. Archived copies of the forum showed a ban on “market manipulation” topped its list of rules by April last year. The current moderators said they struggled to moderate the WallStreetBets group as traffic surged, briefly causing technical errors at Reddit this week. A spokeswoman said earlier this week that Reddit would “review and cooperate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed.” Discord, which hosts many trading discussions, said its rules bar users from engaging in “any illegal behavior.” Discord on Thursday said it was working with the “Wallstreetbets” room team to moderate its new server, after removing the previous server over hate speech and misinformation. It did not address stock market influence. A lack of closer scrutiny on the matter has left open the opportunity for potential manipulation. Former Merrill Lynch financial adviser Cassandra Cummings, 47, who now manages 80,000-member Facebook trading group The Stocks and Stilettos Society, said she declined multiple requests in the last year to rally her group around a specific stock. “They know that I have the power through my group to move that company stock price,” she said."

GameStop stock ride weighed as bubble warning NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are growing concerned that wild swings in GameStop and other stocks driven by small-time traders could be fresh signs of overexuberance that foreshadow volatility for the broader stock market. GameStop shares closed up 400% for the week after the video game chain’s stock became a battleground between retail traders and Wall Street professionals, a tussle that captivated investors the world over. Some market-watchers see those massive gains, as well as the moves in American Airlines and other heavily shorted stocks, as a sideshow in a rally underpinned by Federal Reserve support, anticipated coronavirus relief spending and expectations that vaccines against COVID-19 will help the U.S. economy rebound later this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week pushed back on suggestions that the central bank’s super-low interest rates and massive bond purchases were creating asset bubbles. But those comments failed to quell some investors’ worries that the Fed’s monetary policy has encouraged excessive risk-taking across broader markets: The S&P 500 is up 66% since March and stocks stand near their highest valuations in two decades. The action in GameStop and other stocks “definitely gives us some cause for concern,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. “At the very least, you have to consider that there’s a chance of a market correction.” The moves also drew some comparisons to the internet stock mania two decades earlier. “Just the fact that you have a group of investors that are really chasing abnormal gains, that’s what is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble,” Ragan said. Some barometers of general over-exuberance are already flashing: Citi said its “Panic/Euphoria” model is in “elevated euphoric territory.” And the latest fund manager survey from BofA Global Research noted that allocations to cash had dropped rapidly, indicating that investors are putting more funds into riskier assets. The frenzied trading dominated the news on Wall Street this week, even as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other corporate heavyweights reported quarterly results. The S&P 500 fell 3.3% for the week, with trading volume surging above 24 billion shares on Wednesday, well above the 14.4 billion-share average of the past 20 sessions. The CBOE volatility index closed above 30 points this week for the first time since early November. One potential catalyst for further volatility could come if hedge funds are forced to sell out of positions in order to cover failed short selling bets, although it was unclear whether there would be enough of such selling to create a broad risk to equities. Already, some short-selling hedge funds appeared to be changing their approach. Short seller Andrew Left, whose company Citron Research was one of the hedge funds to spark this week’s battle with small-time traders over GameStop Corp, said in a YouTube video on Friday that his company would no longer publish short selling research. Others said the ramped-up activity of retail investors - who last year helped drive rallies in shares of Tesla Inc and other names - could in itself be the latest sign of market frothiness. “When you think about market bubbles, the last players that jump on board are retail, and that is generally what is happening right now,” said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. Analysts at LPL Financial doubt the recent ructions in GameStop and other names indicate a broader market bubble, noting that market breadth - which measures how many stocks are participating in a rally - remains healthy and credit markets are functioning “just fine.” “Maybe it is simply time for a break” in the S&P 500’s rally, the firm said in a report Friday. Others, though, pointed to potential market turbulence ahead. Stephen Suttmeier, technical research strategist at BofA Global Research, earlier this week urged clients to “take some profits” ahead of February, a comparatively weak month for stocks. Other worrisome signs are the explosion of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, and the surge in shares of electric vehicle companies on the heels of Tesla’s gains, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors. Still, he believes the frenzy over GameStop and other stocks is more of a “sideshow.” Even after their rallies, the market capitalization of GameStop and other companies that have recently seen their stocks soar are “like a rounding error” compared with the broader market, he said."

The SEC is a regulatory agency that oversees and monitors developments along these lines. It is currently in their purview. They’ve put out several statements this week. We will certainly defer to them on that,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a press conference."
-45.787691692307696," GameStop shares may be up 350%, but investors love the 50-cent options NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild gyrations in GameStop Corp shares have roiled Wall Street all week with plenty of chatter about every conceivable angle, but some traders have honed in on one question: For a stock that has rocketed about 350% in five sessions, why is the most hotly traded options contract at the 50-cent level? Put options that pay out if GameStop’s shares fall below 50 cents within a year were the most popular options tied to the stock on Thursday, with nearly 33,000 contracts changing hands. The video game retailer’s stock closed down 44% at $193.60. Some analysts said traders may be buying these puts in conjunction with other options contracts to take advantage of the rise in the stock’s implied volatility - an options-based measure of how much traders expect the shares to gyrate in coming days. GameStop shares have bounced between $42 and $483 over several days. The sharp moves have boosted the stock’s implied volatility and inflated the price of options contracts. For example, 30-day implied volatility for GameStop shares is at about 540%, up from 170% a week ago, according to Trade Alert data. Some traders may now be selling puts at these high prices, hoping to buy them back at a lower price if volatility falls, pocketing the difference, said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe. Still, traders who sell a put without owning the underlying stock risk heavy losses if the shares move below the contract’s strike price. Some brokerages do not allow customers to sell puts “naked,” or without an offsetting position. As a result, some traders may be buying the 50-cent puts, which are among the cheapest GameStop options, in order to sell puts at higher strike prices, a trade known as a spread. They could close the trade at a profit as long as volatility drops in coming days and weeks. “I am almost certain that it’s people buying so that they can sell some of the crazy volatility in the other puts,” Schwartz said. Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories had a slightly different theory. Some traders who are able to sell options “naked” may simply be selling the 50-cent strike puts on a wager that even if GameStop shares retreat from their recent highs, they are unlikely to go to zero, he said. GameStop’s shares traded in a range of $2.60 to $22 months ago, before their huge run-up began. A put seller would get to pocket the premium as long as the stock stays above the selected strike price - 50 cents in this case. “That might be one of the safest trades in the market today,” Gottlieb said."
-45.787691692307696," After plunge, GameStop and AMC remain Reddit darlings (Reuters) - GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings remained overwhelmingly favored stocks on Reddit’s top trading forum on Thursday, even as they and other companies at the core of a retail trader frenzy plummeted after online brokerages imposed trading restrictions. Data about posts and comments on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets, aggregated on swaggystocks.com, showed GameStop and AMC were by far the most discussed stocks on the discussion group that has fueled their recent surge, with both continuing to enjoy overwhelming positive sentiment. Swaggystocks.com was created by Reddit member swaggymedia, whose posts sharing data about Wallstreetbets sentiment have won thousands of “upvotes” from readers. Swaggystocks did not immediately respond to an email asking for his identity but gave permission for his content to be reproduced. For a graphic on Wallstreetbets ticker sentiment:  GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings slumped on Thursday after Robinhood Markets Inc and Interactive Brokers restricted trading in several social-media darling stocks that had soared this week, with trading platform Robinhood later saying it would remove some restrictions on Friday. GameStop dropped 44%, but the stock remains up almost 900% since Jan. 12. AMC’s 57% drop reduced its gain since Jan. 21 to around 190%. Also falling heavily were Blackberry, Koss and Express, which Robinhood also restricted trading in. Wallstreetbets has ballooned in recent days to 4.8 million members. Many of those people have piled into stock heavily bet against by professional short sellers, overwhelming the professionals and forcing them over the past week to abandon their positions with heavy losses. AMC, GameStop, Nokia and Blackberry are currently the most discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets, eclipsing Tesla, which has long dominated chatter amongst its members. AMC and GameStop account for over 25% of recent comments on Wallstreetbets, with Nokia accounting for over 20%. Discussion of GameStop has receded over the past week as a proportion of overall comments, although the sentiment of comments about the company remains overwhelmingly positive. Swaggystocks calculates sentiment by analyzing individual words used in posts and comments. For a graphic on Gamestop ticker sentiment:  Along with its stock price, AMC’s prominence on Wallstreetbets has skyrocketed this week to match GameStop’s, after accounting for less than 1% of all comments on Monday. Sentiment in AMC is close to entirely positive on Wallstreetbets, according to Swaggystocks.com. For a graphic on AMC ticker sentiment:  Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies, which in early January accounted for as much as 16% of comments on Wallstreetbets, has seen its prominence in the group fall to under 1%, even as its stock this week hit a record high. Tesla, which has long been a popular stock on Wallstreetbets and a major target of short sellers, currently accounts for less than 1% of comments in the discussion group, down from over 30% in the first week of January. Tesla’s stock is roughly unchanged over that time period after reporting disappointing quarterly results on Wednesday."
-45.787691692307696," GameStop third biggest short, even as shares shorted falls - S3 Partners NEW YORK (Reuters) -Short interest in GameStop Corp, whose shares have skyrocketed this week, is at $11.2 billion, making it the third most shorted stock by value, although the number of shares shorted has declined, analytics firm S3 Partners said. Video game store chain GameStop is the third-largest short by value behind Tesla and Apple, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said. The number of GameStop shares shorted has declined by 8% in the last 7 days to 57.83 million, as some short sellers have covered their bets that the stock would fall, Dusaniwsky said. GameStop shares soared over 400% this week as of early on Friday, taking its market value to over $23 billion. It has been one of the prime stocks caught in a battle between small traders and major financial institutions. While some short sellers covered their positions to stop any losses, other “momentum shorts” have taken positions, betting that “nothing goes to the moon forever,” Dusaniwsky said. “This has not been a short-squeeze rally. This has been a long-buying event,” Dusaniwsky said. As of early on Friday, GameStop short sellers had mark-to-market losses of $19.75 billion so far this year, S3 said."
-45.787691692307696," GameStop, other retail darlings dented after Reddit group briefly shuts doors (Reuters) - A slugfest between Wall Street and Main Street took an unexpected turn late on Wednesday after moderators of a stock trading forum that has helped fuel massive rallies in the shares of GameStop temporarily closed its doors. Shares of GameStop and other companies tumbled in extended trading after Wallstreetbets, a discussion forum popular with retail traders on the Reddit website, briefly turned invitation-only. They pared those losses around an hour later, when the forum opened back up. “We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad night’s sleep. We’ve got so many comments and submissions that we can’t possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators,” read a message from the group’s moderators after Wallstreetbets reopened. Shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry all dropped at least 20% moments after the shuttering of the forum, highlighting the role it has played in fueling stock rallies that many say have been driven primarily by retail investors. Earlier in the day, amateur traders chalked one up versus Wall Street as hedge funds suffered heavy losses on short positions in GameStop, and regulators and financial professionals called for more scrutiny of trading fueled by anonymous social media posts. In the latest skirmish in a week-long battle between Wall Street and Main Street, funds sold long positions in stocks to pay for losses shorting GameStop, contributing to a slide of more than 2% in Wall Street’s main indexes.[.N] “We are moving to a world where ordinary folk have the same access as professionals and can come to the same conclusion or maybe the opposite,” technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC. “The solution is more transparency on the institutional side, not less access for retail.” The market turmoil caught the attention of the White House, with press secretary Jen Psaki saying President Joe Biden’s economic team - including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her first full day on the job - was “monitoring the situation.” Massachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on NYSE to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. “This isn’t investing, this is gambling,” he said in an interview. “This is obviously contrived.” Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman said exchanges and regulators should watch whether anonymous social media posts could be driving “pump and dump” schemes. “If we see a significant rise in the chatter on social media ... and we also match that up against unusual trading activity, we will potentially halt that stock to allow ourselves to investigate the situation,” Friedman said on CNBC. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was aware of the market volatility and working with fellow regulators to “assess the situation and review the activities of regulated entities, financial intermediaries, and other market participants.” U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, long critical of Wall Street, called on regulators to take action. “For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price,” Warren said on Twitter. “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs.” Reddit has not been contacted by authorities over stock surges driven by a message board on the platform, a spokeswoman said. The war began when famed short seller Andrew Left of Citron Capital bet against GameStop and was met with a barrage of retail traders betting the other way. Citron has been a target on Wallstreetbets. Left said in a video post that Citron abandoned its bet against GameStop after the video game retailer’s value soared almost tenfold in a fortnight. “I have respect for the market,” Left said in the post. Melvin Capital Management closed out its short position in GameStop on Tuesday after taking a huge loss. Shares of GameStop surged 135% during Wednesday’s trading session, bringing their gain since Jan. 12 to about 1,700% and ballooning its market capitalization to $24 billion. U.S. shares of BlackBerry jumped 33%, bringing their gain in 2021 to 279%, while movie theater operator AMC surged 300% and is now up over 800% year to date. Along with Finnish technology firm Nokia Oyj, those companies were among the most heavily traded, with Reddit threads humming with chatter about the stocks. Nokia said it was not aware of any reason for the continuing surge in its share price. Such inflated stocks will eventually fall back to their fair value, predicted Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It does have a David and Goliath feel, where the Reddit crowd is taking on the most shorted stocks by the largest hedge funds in the world and winning.” BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, could have made gains of about $2.4 billion on its investment in GameStop. Its share holdings amounted to roughly a 13% stake as of Dec. 31, 2020, a regulatory filing showed. According to research firm S3 Partners, total short interest in GameStop was $10.6 billion as of Wednesday. In the last seven days the short has increased by $117 million, or 1.1%, as the stock price surged. Year-to-date, GameStop shorts have lost $19.15 billion, including $9.85 billion on Wednesday at a $285 share price, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics. “These large mark-to-market losses will be squeezing many existing shorts out of their positions, but we are still seeing new short sellers taking their place as they look to short at the top and ride a windfall of profits,” he said. Long dismissed as “dumb money,” retail traders have made stocks move in ways that defy fundamental analysis. Global bets worth billions of dollars could be at risk as amateurs challenge bearish positions of influential funds. Experts are debating whether these massive share moves should be considered ominous signs for the market. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian said the rise of retail investors is healthy, however. “That’s the sentiment, the public doing what they feel has been done to them by institutions,” Ohanian said in a tweet on Wednesday."
-45.787691692307696," U.S. SEC will review actions inhibiting trading of some securities WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Friday said it would review actions that may “unduly inhibit” trading of certain securities and said it was closely monitoring potential wrongdoing amid recent price volatility in the U.S. stock market. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials warned against illegal “manipulative trading activity” and said they were working closely with other regulators to monitor the situation after a wild week of trading during which an army of small investors have driven a dramatic squeeze of Wall Street hedge funds in shares of GameStop Corp and other hot companies. “The Commission will closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities,” the SEC said on Friday, following a statement earlier in the week it was monitoring market volatility. Online broker Robinhood earlier in the week placed disputed trading restrictions on certain shares, drawing ire from lawmakers and scrutiny from regulators. The firm had eased restrictions on Friday. “Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week’s extraordinary trading volumes. Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,” the SEC said on Friday."

-45.787691692307696," Rush to stocks continues amid retail frenzy, BofA data show LONDON (Reuters) - Investor cash continued to pour into stocks last week amid a retail trading frenzy that saw shares in GameStop soar over 2,500% year-to-date at one point, BofA’s weekly flow data showed on Friday. Inflows in the last three months soared to a record $272 billion. U.S. small cap firms, at the centre of amateur trading, saw their second-largest inflow ever, of $29 billion. Crowds of solo traders herd buying, pumping up and squeezing out hedge funds from their bets against ailing companies, have shaken financial markets in the past week, with analysts worrying about the systemic implications of a retail speculative bubble bursting. BofA analysts compared this new trend, often described as a populist market revolt, to the 2011 “Occupy Wall Street” movement against financial inequality. “Our secular view is inequality can only end via higher wage inflation for poor and wealth taxation for rich”, they commented in their weekly note. BofA analysts added they expected to see a 10% correction in equity markets in the coming months as the COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out."

-45.787691692307696," Analysis: How Wall Street gains from 'populist' trading movement (Reuters) - Steep gains in shares of GameStop Corp and other stocks this week have been described as populist market revolts. But among those out ahead are some of Wall Street’s largest asset managers, which can realize gains both from their share stakes and from lending out stocks to short sellers. Other beneficiaries include market-makers and trading systems that profit from huge volumes. Many investors have not yet realized their profits by selling shares, and some platforms could later face disillusioned retail customers who bought into the rally too late, said Larry Harris, a former chief economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and now a finance professor at the USC Marshall School of Business. But for now, big, traditional investors that already held GameStop shares have the advantage, Harris said. “Long institutions are the big winners,” he said. That contrasts with the short sellers who have bet against GameStop in expectations that the share price will fall, borrowing shares in hopes they can later buy shares at a lower price to repay their loans and pocket the difference. Shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry shot up this week as they were pushed by traders on Reddit and other social media platforms, although they fell back on Thursday. Hedge funds betting against the stocks were forced to cover their positions, costing them billions of dollars and adding fuel to the rally. That was good for funds like the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund. It held 2 million shares of GameStop, according to a recent disclosure, worth close to $1 billion at GameStop’s peak price of $482.95 on Thursday, before closing at $193.60. The stake would have been worth around $33 million at the start of January. Asked if the fund might sell the shares now, a Fidelity spokesman said via e-mail that to protect fund shareholders, “We do not disclose intent for any potential buy or sell decisions.” Big asset managers would also have benefited from lending securities to short-sellers and others. Such activity generated $7.66 billion in revenue globally in 2020 according to DataLend. Top asset manager BlackRock Inc has said its securities-lending revenue hit a record in 2020. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment. As the price of GameStop rose so has the cost of borrowing its shares, partly as higher trading volumes made the shares harder to locate, said Sam Pierson, securities lending analyst for IHS Markit. Borrowers of GameStop now pay around 30% on an annualized basis, less than earlier this week but up from around 7% in early December. Other beneficiaries of this week’s rally was private equity firm Silver Lake, which took advantage of a 301% surge in struggling movie theater chain AMC’s shares on Wednesday to convert $600 million in convertible notes into AMC shares. Brokerages and market makers such as Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities LLC also stood to gain from higher-than-average volume. Volume on U.S. exchanges on Thursday was 19.58 billion shares, compared with the 14.86 billion average over the last 20 trading days. A Citadel spokesman did not comment when asked about the trading’s business impact on the firm. Citadel “remains focused on continuously providing liquidity to our clients across all market conditions,” he said. A representative for Schwab did not comment on questions about the business impact of the trading. “The higher the volume of trading the easier it is for them to make money,” said Georgetown University professor James Angel, who studies market structure and regulation."

Ocasio-Cortez said the move was “unacceptable,” adding Congress needs to know more about Robinhood’s decision “to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.” She said the House Financial Services Committee investigation should not be limited to Robingood but “should examine any retail services freezing stock purchases in the course of potential investigations - especially those allowing sales, but freezing purchases.”"
-45.787691692307696," Robinhood is new eye of GameStop storm as outrage grows LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Online broker Robinhood has been one of the hottest venues in this week’s retail-trading frenzy but its sudden curbs on buying of some hot stocks have raised the ire of customers, celebrities and politicians who argue it unfairly benefits bigger investors. The firm has also tapped a credit line so that it has funds to ensure trading continuity when it lifts the rules. Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said on Thursday trade was restricted in “about 13” viral stocks, which include GameStop, AMC Entertainment and American Airlines, to protect the company and its customers from volatility. Those stocks slid on Thursday, paring losses only after Robinhood said it hoped to lift the curbs on Friday. Tenev said on CNBC the brokerage had tapped credit lines “so that we could maximise, within reason, the funds we have to deposit at the clearing houses,” to facilitate more trade. “We understand our customers are upset, we’re doing what we can to re-enable buying in these names,” he said. “We want to be clear in the communications, and I own that we should have been out there a little bit sooner.” While other firms such as Interactive Brokers also restricted trading, Robinhood’s fee-free and simple-to-use app has made it popular with a new generation of small-time traders and its restrictions drew the heaviest backlash. “Robinhood? Nah y’all ROBBING the HOOD,” tweeted one user. “Crazy how you guys would rather watch your company burn to the ground than live up to your promise to provide users with free trade,” commented another. Twitter users also complained that Robinhood appeared to be selling their shares without authorization. Robinhood did not immediately comment on whether it had restricted sales, however Tenev said customers were allowed to sell, but not buy. Two customers sued Robinhood Financial, seeking damages trading halts in a series of stocks. Bloomberg reported the broker has tapped at least several hundred million dollars from its lenders, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, though Tenev did not discuss the size of Robinhood’s borrowing on CNBC. Meanwhile, anger has spread beyond the investment community with rappers and U.S. politicians on both sides of the aisle joining the backlash. “This is unacceptable,” tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. “We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.” Her tweet was shared by Republican Senator Ted Cruz who commented “fully agree.” Tesla founder Elon Musk, whose shares have also been a retail favorite, also commented on Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet saying “Absolutely”.

Founded in 2013 with the mission of “democratizing finance for all” by offering commission-free trading, Thursday’s move was seen by many as hypocritical. Many users shared a tweet from 2016 in which the company said “Let the people trade.” “This was always a potential issue with Robinhood,” said Ian Kar, co-founder and chief executive of research provider Fintech Today. “When are you responsible for helping your users make good financial decisions, versus allowing them to trade freely?” Robinhood has seen business boom during the coronavirus pandemic as more homebound consumers took to buying and selling stocks online.

-45.787691692307696," S.Korea shares fall for fourth day, Wall Street volatility weighs"
-45.787691692307696," ""GameStop effect"" could ripple further as Wall Street eyes short squeeze candidates NEW YORK (Reuters) - The clash between retail traders and Wall Street professionals that sparked roller coaster rides in the shares of GameStop Corp may pose a risk to dozens of other stocks and potentially create a headache for the broader market, analysts said. Market watchers identified dozens of stocks potentially vulnerable to extreme volatility after a buying spree from an army of retail traders in recent days prompted hedge funds to unwind their bets against GameStop and other companies, fueling surges in their share prices in a phenomenon known as a “short squeeze.” “Unfortunately, it’s definitely not a one-off thing,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “The type of activity that drove that higher, I believe, has caused people to try to duplicate that in other names.” J.P. Morgan earlier this week named 45 stocks that may be susceptible to short squeezes and similar “fragility events,” including real estate company Macerich Co, restaurant chain Cheesecake Factory Inc and clothing subscription service Stitch Fix Inc. Like GameStop, American Airlines Group Inc, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and others that have recently become targets of retail traders in recent days, all the stocks have high short interest ratios. That means a large percentage of investors have borrowed the stock to sell it in anticipation that they will be able to buy it back at a lower price and profit on the trade. But if the stock rises sharply, those investors may be forced to buy back the stock at a loss. “The unfortunate events in GameStop this week may be building a dangerous precedent for markets whereby retail investors act en masse to leverage their buying powers to spark fragility events,” analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a note. Using derivatives and coordinating buying on websites such as the Reddit forum wallstreetbets, retail investors have had an outsize impact on markets in recent months. Hedge funds Melvin Capital Management and Citron Capital closed out short positions in GameStop earlier this week after buying pressure pushed up the company’s shares. GameStop shares were recently down 25% on Thursday as retail brokerages Robinhood Markets Inc and Interactive Brokers Inc, restricted purchases of the stock, along with several others that have catapulted in recent days, including AMC Entertainment Group Inc and BlackBerry Ltd.. Even so, the video game retailer’s shares have gained more than 500% since last Thursday. Barring wider trading restrictions, similar patterns could play out over several weeks as short sellers unwind their bets, said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. Some firms run strategies that involve holding both long and short positions on a stock, he said, and as a result, certain stocks could see a surge and then a sharp drop as those firms adjust their positions. That process could put pressure on stocks more broadly and contribute to market volatility. “I do think the contagion risk is real,” Purves said. “Any stock that is heavily shorted is exposed to getting GameStopped.”"
-45.787691692307696," Asia's 'ant' and 'moth' investors test broker nerves SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia’s retail investors, emboldened by the meteoric rise of U.S. videogame retailer GameStop, are taking on short sellers and making their brokers nervous enough to cut off margin lending. In South Korea, small investors known as “ants” have borrowed so much money to dabble in stocks that at least half a dozen brokerages have stopped offering them leverage. GameStop’s global impact is the latest manifestation of a day-trading mania driven by amateur investors that is boosting the price of assets ranging from cryptocurrencies to new stock market listings. “Not afraid, not flinching,” said Ji-Han Kim, who works at a food delivery chain in Seoul and whose stock portfolio includes Chinese drone-maker Ehang, which he says has made him a 412% return, and chip giant Samsung Electronics. “I see it as a bubble that doesn’t burst for a while.” However, this euphoria is not universal and Korea Financial Investment Association data shows six South Korean brokerages stopped margin lending this month, after loan values hit a record 21.6 trillion won ($19.3 billion) this week. “Any more lending to ants would go against the capital requirement ratio for brokerages,” said Kwak Sang-jun, a stockbroker at Shinhan Investment Corp in Seoul. “No-one expected the rally would be this explosive, and trading demand from retail investors would grow this explosive.” The retail phenomenon is widespread across Asia, where small-time traders have long played an outsized role, especially in markets such as South Korea and China. But investors are becoming younger, much more leveraged and influential. In Thailand, where they are known as “moths”, such investors piled into local cannabis-related stocks on Thursday in anticipation of regulatory changes by the government there. In Hong Kong, retail investors borrowed more than $50 billion to buy shares in Chinese video sharing app Kuaishou Technology’s float. And in Australia and Japan, heavily shorted stocks are surging as small investors try and emulate the squeeze that has driven GameStop shares up 17-fold in little more than two weeks. GameStop has become the poster-stock for apparently coordinated small-investor buying, marshalled over online forums such as Reddit, and aimed at inflicting pain on big hedge funds who had bet it would struggle and its stock would fall. It was the most-traded stock at brokers Stockal and Vested Finance in India and a tiny Australian nickel explorer with a similar ticker, GME Resources, rose as much as 50% on Thursday in Sydney. Such trades lit up market forums such as chat app Telegram, Kakao Talk in South Korea and 2 channel in Japan, as prices reacted to the retail army, though with much less of the fury of Reddit forums and much more enthusiasm for locking in gains. “People are calling me and saying: I’m FOMO, I think I’m missing something,” said Chris Brankin, CEO at TD Ameritrade in Singapore, a platform for local investors to buy U.S. stocks. Along with fellow retail darling AMC Entertainment, GameStop has topped volumes over last few days for Saxo Capital Markets, said its Asia-Pacific CEO Adam Reynolds, adding new account volumes are “insane”, with 80% of new clients under 40. “Because they’re getting better and because they’re getting more confidence, it’s sometimes the institutional (investors) who are getting a bit overrun,” Reynolds said. Retail investors made up 67% of average daily trading volume on South Korea’s main KOSPI market last year and a “buy everything” market has lifted it 113% since March. Asian markets were jittery on Thursday and painful for short sellers, as some heavily shorted companies jumped. In Australia, funeral operator InvoCare, salmon farmer Tassal and poultry producer Inghams, all of which have short interest levels higher than 8% according to regulatory data, leapt to multi month highs. Japan’s most shorted stock, telecom equipment maker Anritsu Corp, touched a two-decade high. In China, where investors are more familiar with the swings and roundabouts of a market in which fickle retail buyers command price moves, traders were admiring of the role adopted by U.S. retail investors but said that such stock volatility would trigger action by Chinese regulators. “Retail investors in the U.S. are marvellous,” read one well-liked post on a chat app run by Hithink RoyalFlush. For Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun, who bid$4.6 million for a charity lunch with Warren Buffet in 2019, the GameStop party is not over. “I’ll be buying $1 mil of $GME tonight,” he said on Twitter. “Watch out, Asians are coming!”"

-45.787691692307696," GameStop up another 60%, amateur interest shows no sign of abating A slugfest between Wall Street and Main Street took an unexpected turn late on Wednesday after moderators of a stock trading forum that has helped fuel massive rallies in the shares of GameStop (GME.N) temporarily closed its doors. Shares of GameStop and other companies tumbled in extended trading after Wallstreetbets, a discussion forum popular with retail traders on the Reddit website, briefly turned invitation-only. They pared those losses around an hour later, when the forum opened back up. ""We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad night's sleep. We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators,"" read a message from the group's moderators after Wallstreetbets reopened. Shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment (AMC.N), Koss Corp (KOSS.O) and BlackBerry (BB.TO) all dropped at least 20% moments after the shuttering of the forum, highlighting the role it has played in fueling stock rallies that many say have been driven primarily by retail investors. Earlier in the day, amateur traders chalked one up versus Wall Street as hedge funds suffered heavy losses on short positions in GameStop, and regulators and financial professionals called for more scrutiny of trading fueled by anonymous social media posts. In the latest skirmish in a week-long battle between Wall Street and Main Street, funds sold long positions in stocks to pay for losses shorting GameStop, contributing to a slide of more than 2% in Wall Street's main indexes. ""We are moving to a world where ordinary folk have the same access as professionals and can come to the same conclusion or maybe the opposite,"" technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC. ""The solution is more transparency on the institutional side, not less access for retail."" The market turmoil caught the attention of the White House, with press secretary Jen Psaki saying President Joe Biden's economic team - including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her first full day on the job - was ""monitoring the situation.""

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, long critical of Wall Street, called on regulators to take action. “For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price,” Warren said on Twitter. “It's long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs.” Reddit has not been contacted by authorities over stock surges driven by a message board on the platform, a spokeswoman said.  GAME ON The war began when famed short seller Andrew Left of Citron Capital bet against GameStop and was met with a barrage of retail traders betting the other way. Citron has been a target on Wallstreetbets. Left said in a video post that Citron abandoned its bet against GameStop after the video game retailer's value soared almost tenfold in a fortnight. ""I have respect for the market,"" Left said in the post.

-7.758266288483482," Canadian investment firm Senvest lands $650 mln payday from GameStop surge TORONTO/MONTREAL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Little-known Canadian investment firm Senvest Management LLC landed a multimillion-dollar payday from betting on video game retailer GameStop Corp, which has been at the centre of a frenzy driven by retail investors this week. The investment manager, owned by Canadian holding company Senvest Capital, has seen its 3.6 million shares in GameStop rise 1,205.4% from last week, after they hit $483 a share briefly on Thursday. The stock ended Thursday at $193, taking Senvest Management’s paper profit to about $650 million, which for a firm that manages just $1 billion would land stellar returns when it cashes out of the position. Senvest first disclosed a position in filings with the U.S. regulator on Oct. 13. While the investment manager did not reveal the acquisition price, GameStop stock traded in the range of $9.10 and $15.87 in October. Reuters’ estimate of Senvest’s gains is based on the Oct. 13 opening price of $11.73. An army of retail investors in recent days has powered a massive rally in stocks, including GameStop and BlackBerry . The stocks gave up some of their gains on Thursday after online brokerages Robinhood Markets Inc and Interactive Brokers restricted trading in the red-hot stocks. Other investors like BlackRock have also benefited from the GameStop stock rally. A spokesperson for Senvest Management, which is based in New York and founded by Richard Marshal in 1997, declined to comment. Senvest is GameStop’s seventh biggest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data. The firm has more than $1 billion in assets under management and runs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy, according to its website. Montreal-headquartered Senvest Capital operates as a holding company with interests in investment management and direct investing in public securities and private investments, according to its website. Shares of publicly traded Senvest Capital ended down 0.6% at C$280 on Thursday."

COMMENTS ELLEN HAZEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS “As I think back to different bubbles that I have watched over my investing career, whether it is the tech bubble in 1999 and 2000 or the mortgage bubble a decade-plus ago, there are always speculative excesses that turns into frenzies. There are often short squeezes that happen with companies that are not fundamentally sound and there is often a lot of so-called retail day trading. The move to zero commissions a couple of years ago probably did not help matters because with zero friction people are more likely to trade. There does seem to be an echo with what we saw in Washington a few weeks ago where there is a thread of populism that is visible in some of these chatrooms, so if that is the case it may continue to bubble up. ""From a pure investing standpoint, it doesn’t change what I am doing, it doesn’t change what my team is doing. We are fundamental investors, we are looking at cash flows, return on capital, traditional fundamental metrics so we are not investing in these types of names that have been impacted. I do think that whenever there is a pump-and-dump scheme, which this may be, we don’t know for sure, it ends badly for many people and there are prosecutions. It is too soon to tell without an investigation whether or not that is the case here, but I do worry that what seems like a lot of fun for a few days can end badly.”  ERIC SCHIFFER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM THE PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION, BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA ""Trading platforms are not going to want to stick their necks out and be on the frontline of what they may see as a reckless war, in part, against the elite and the system of Wall Street that's being democratized by information and the social media. They also don't want to get involved in a system that has served them for a long time. You are going to see many take conservation positions until the SEC or the Biden Administration clarifies how they are looking."" ""What's sad in all of this, what's concerning to me is, why are they not picking companies that have intrinsic fundamental benefits to investors in all this? There are many undervalued solid companies that would benefit investors versus an AMC, despite having an injection of more than $900 million dollars, which still has a very questionable future with COVID and these further variants that may keep people away from theaters for years.""  JOHN MCCLAIN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DIAMOND HILL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, COLUMBUS, OHIO “GameStop is a side effect of the vaccinations given to the market from policymakers. The headache is GameStop, the chills are some of these things that are happening in the debt markets.” “This does have implications for the fixed income market, in a variety of forms and fashions. One is that clearly if the equity price goes parabolic - like we’ve seen from some of these names - there’s a bigger market capitalization and the bonds are in theory more covered, particularly with some of these companies - like you saw AMC issue equity. If you can actually issue equity, get cash, you are issuing equity at a ridiculous valuation. This is like Tesla 3.0.” “The asset management industry is experiencing something of a crisis right now, where you are going to have to start thinking about non-traditional metrics for evaluating a business. Typically, I don’t think most bond managers are interested in the short interest of an equity outside of a handful of names. But now that’s something you might want to pay attention to. Understanding that in our market if you’re short a name through the cash or the CDS, you’re going to have to pay attention to certain things in the equity market that we used to pay less attention to.”  DAN PIPITONE, CO-FOUNDER, TRADEZERO AMERICA, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK ""This is history in the making. When I have uncles and relatives calling me about trading, it's gone beyond the realms of normal investing. ""A lot of the big houses have all kinds of issues especially since they have restricted trading on some of these short squeeze stocks.

ANDREW SLIMMON, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO On how it's affecting the broader market: “Not at all, it’s a sideshow.

The hefty losses come as shares of highly-shorted GameStop jumped more than 1,000% in the past week without a clear business reason, forcing short-sellers to buy back into the stock to cover potential losses -- defined as a short-squeeze -- while retail investors then piled in to benefit from the surge. Chasing shorted companies became a trend among retail traders, rippling across U.S. markets and Europe. Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms. Its data also showed that estimated losses from shorting GameStop at $1.03 billion year-to-date, while those shorting Bed, Bath & Beyond were looking at a $600 million loss. Ortex said the figures are based on the change in trading prices between the start of January to Wednesday’s close, and the number of short positions. The company sources short interest data from submissions by agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers."
-7.758266288483482," Inspired by GameStop, Malaysian retail investors look to prop up medical glove shares (Advisory: Readers may find language reference offensive in paragraph six) KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Malaysian retail investors are looking to buy stocks of medical glove makers to drive up their share prices and squeeze out short sellers, drawing inspiration from the recent rally at U.S. firm GameStop Corp . Shares of GameStop have surged 1,700% in just two weeks as amateur U.S. investors piled in and forced hedge funds to lose billions on their short positions. The WallStreetBets forum on Reddit, where small investors discuss stocks anonymously, is seen as having fuelled the GameStop rally. In a new forum on Reddit called BursaBets, created on Thursday, Malaysian retail investors discussed buying up stocks of glove makers, and complained about share prices having dropped in recent months even as the firms’ profits grew. Malaysia is the world’s largest producer of medical gloves, demand for which has soared due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Whoever is still holding gloves (has) already been through hell, join me by saying ‘eff you’ to investment banks, fund managers, market manipulators, and everyone else,” said an user called ‘_Revenant_’ who started the BursaBets forum. The national stock exchange is called Bursa Malaysia. “We’re gonna be fighting in our markets tomorrow,” the user said, adding that WallStreetsBets has inspired “us to bring our market back into our control”. Discussions in the forum centered around Top Glove - the biggest glove making company - and short positions in the sector. Investors short stocks they see as vulnerable to weakness by borrowing them for a fee and selling them with the aim of buying them back at a lower price. If the stock continues to rise, they may have to buy back at a higher price. Those betting on a rise also risk losing their investment if the price increase proves unsustainable. Institutional investors typically drive share moves. Analysts have noted an increase in retail interest in Malaysian glove makers in the past year, though it is unclear how much of an impact any retail buying may have. Top Glove gained 290% last year, hitting an all-time high of 9.76 ringgit ($2.41) per share in August, but it has since fallen nearly 40% as COVID-19 vaccines became available. It reported a record profit in December. Investors have also raised questions about the company’s treatment of staff after over 5,000 factory workers became infected with the coronavirus. Shares of other glove makers - Supermax Corp, Hartalega Holdings and Kossan Rubber Industries - have also seen similar rallies and declines. Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega were the three most shorted stocks as of Jan. 27, according to data from the stock exchange. Supermax was in the top ten. Malaysian markets were closed on Thursday for a public holiday, and are set to reopen on Friday."
-7.758266288483482," GameStop surge leaves U.S.-based mutual funds and ETFs behind NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of exchange-traded funds appear to be among the largest institutional winners from the more than 360% rally in shares of GameStop Corp so far this week as the video game retailer remains at the center of a showdown between retail investors and short-selling hedge funds. The $189 million Wedbush ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF jumped more than 16.1% Wednesday, pushing it up approximately 25% since the start of the week. The $758 million SPDR S&P Retail ETF soared 12%, powering it to a 21.9% gain for the week-to-date. The relatively small number of winners among funds from the outsized rally in GameStop reflects the company’s relatively small ownership base among mutual funds, leaving the prime vehicle for Americans’ retirement savings mostly unaffected by GameStop’s rally. Overall, just 367 mutual funds had a long position in GameStop as of their most recent reporting period, according to Lipper data, while 2,151 funds reported a long position in competitor Best Buy Co Inc. Apple Inc, one of the most widely held stocks on Wall Street, is owned by 5,641 mutual funds. The small mutual fund ownership base is one reason why GameStop shares notched one of the most high-profile surges in Wall Street memory, analysts said. [L1N2K221Y] “If there’s a large institutional investor base held within mutual funds the stock is likely to be less volatile as these are often core long-term positions. Stocks that are held more by retail investors could see hot money move in or out relatively quickly,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. Few large funds that own shares in GameStop have a big enough position in the company to sway their overall performance. The Fidelity Intrinsic Opportunities fund, for instance, owns 9.75% of GameStop’s outstanding shares, according to Lipper data. Yet that position accounts for just 0.64% of the fund’s assets. The fund is up 5.6% for the year-to-date, approximately 1.5 percentage points less than the benchmark Russell 2000 index. The BlackRock Advantage Small Cap Core fund holds 0.03% of its assets in GameStop, according to Lipper. Overall, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, owned about 9.2 million shares in GameStop as of Dec. 31, 2020, spread over several funds. If BlackRock has not since sold any of those shares, its stake’s value is up $2.4 billion since the start of the year."

Shares of GameStop have surged 1,700% since Jan. 12 as amateur U.S. investors, monitoring social media comments, have piled in and forced professional short-sellers to abandon their positions with heavy losses. This week, GameStop accounted for 19% of the trades on Vested Finance, an Indian investment firm that helps Indians buy or sell U.S. stocks, and 15% of the trades on its rival Stockal, making it the most traded stock on both platforms. “It’s quite surprising to see Indian investors jumping on the GameStop bandwagon,” Stockal co-founder Sitashwa Srivastava told Reuters. “This shows a marked shift in investor behaviour from just using U.S. stocks to diversify their portfolios to rushing after a rally based on social media discussions. It could be reckless but it works for some.” Despite India’s highly restrictive cross-border investment rules, Indians have been placing big bets on U.S. equities this year as American stocks recovered quicker than markets in India from a crash sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. Indian investors venturing into U.S. stocks usually prefer top global companies such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Tesla as they look to diversify their holdings in India."

GME Resources stock closed up 13% at 8.5 Australian cents, or a gain of one cent on the day, giving up most of its gains of four cents in early trade, when it reached A$0.115 ($0.0878). It rose 14% on Wednesday. “There are people buying the stock for shits and giggles, just because of the ticker symbol,” said market analyst Kyle Rodda of brokerage IG Markets in Melbourne. “It’s all caught up in this GameStop dynamic,” he said. “It’s got nothing to do with the company and entirely to do with this mad phenomenon that we’re seeing at the moment where these Redditers looking to swarm into these stocks and play around with the market a little bit for their own amusement.” Shares of U.S. videogame retailer GameStop have soared about 17-fold since Jan. 12 as small investors, organising on social media, have piled in and forced professional short-sellers to abandon their positions with heavy losses. A spokesman for GME Resources was not available for comment. However, Managing Director Peter Sullivan told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper the surge caught him by surprise. “When I opened my share tracking app and saw it was at 9.4 cents, I was stunned,” he told the paper. “It just went bang, and I thought: ‘Well, what’s going on here?

One of the rescuers was Cohen’s hedge fund, which has roughly $1 billion under management with Melvin, NYT said.

""GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL,"" wrote one user on Wednesday, urging others to keep pushing the stock higher. ""WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON...ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY."" Jacob Frenkel, Securities Enforcement Practice chair for law firm Dickinson Wright, said the SEC would likely look at whether the messaging by investors holding the stock long-term and activists betting against it was manipulative.

-7.758266288483482," EXPLAINER-How retail traders squeezed Wall Street for bets against GameStop A surge of retail stock trading over the last year lit the fuse that sent shares of GameStop Corp (GME.N) rocketing higher without a clear business reason, market watchers say, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against the video game retailer and other companies that were out of favor on Wall Street. What is going on? Here are some answers: BEHIND THE SURGE IN INTEREST OF RETAIL INVESTORS: More individuals have invested in stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and experts cite a number of reasons. Lockdowns boosted savings, policy stimulus put cash into people's pockets, and extremely low interest rates drove investors to the stock market. Also, a proliferation of trading apps allowed anyone with a smartphone to buy or sell stocks for free. Retail investors' participation in U.S. equity order flows increased to nearly 20% in 2020 from 15% in 2019, while orders from long-only funds fell to 6.4% last year from 9.7% in 2019, data from Swiss bank UBS showed. Data this year suggests further growth. Online broker eToro said it registered more than 380,000 new users in the first 11 days of 2021, adding to the 5 million who used it last year, for example. Retail investors are also buying stock options, the right to buy or sell shares at set prices without putting cash upfront. That takes their dollars much farther and can turbocharge share price movements.  WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF THIS SURGE IN RETAIL TRADING? Big U.S. technology companies were among the beneficiaries last year. Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) saw record inflows as their businesses benefited from lockdowns and their stocks soared. With unprecedented stimulus and easy money policies from central banks, investors then shifted to smaller stocks, especially ones that got beaten down during the pandemic. Market capitalization of world stocks surged to a record $88 trillion, a whopping $33 trillion jump from the March bottom. In the last few days, GameStop’s shares have jumped 1600%, with big gains also for shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), Blackberry Ltd , Nokia Oyj and others. WHAT’S HAPPENING ON REDDIT AND SOCIAL MEDIA? Online discussions about stocks on social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook are seen by many traders and analysts as fueling massive share price moves that cannot be explained by fundamental news or traditional valuation metrics. Retail investors have long discussed stocks on social media, but during the pandemic these forums appear to be gaining more influence. Investors pointed to discussion threads such as “WallStreetBets” on Reddit for driving the surge in GameStop. Professional investors are paying attention. Dennis Dick, a stock trader in Las Vegas said he reads the site Seeking Alpha before work and keeps up to the minute by watching Twitter, but last weekend he also joined a group on Reddit ""because I need to know what's going on."" read more  HOW HAS THIS AFFECTED HEDGE FUNDS AND PROFESSIONAL TRADERS? Massive share price swings for no apparent reason have caught Wall Street off guard. Short sellers, or investors who bet the price of a stock would fall, are getting crushed. Melvin Capital, a well-established hedge fund, took massive losses on its bets that GameStop share would fall. Traders scrambling to cover these short positions and prevent further losses had to pay inflated prices, which added more fuel to the rally. Several traders told Reuters that this phenomenon -- the classic short-squeeze -- drew in still more retail investors hoping to ride the wave. WHAT ARE THE RISKS? With global stock markets surging since March despite the pandemic’s devastation of the real economy, investors and analysts are warning about asset bubbles. If markets turn, overvalued stocks will fall with them. Many trading platforms also offer loans to investors to buy shares and magnify their returns. In a falling market, that could wipe out people caught on the wrong side of the trade. "

The combination of accessible retail trading and social media could upend the market if not adequately policed, Galvin warned. “It’s diminishing the integrity of the marketplace and it’s putting individual investors at risk.” he said."
-48.84463788539502," Fed's Powell: Don't blame us for GameStop frenzy NEW YORK (Reuters) - Those thinking the latest and most glaring evidence of stock market froth - the more than tenfold increase in GameStop Corp shares in two weeks - might draw Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into a “mea culpa” moment may be disappointed. Powell, a former private equity industry attorney who knows a thing or two about a stock price, on Wednesday declined outright to comment on the extraordinary rise in the shares of an unprofitable company that seemed proof positive the market had become detached from reality. In his press conference following the Fed’s latest two-day policy meeting, he pushed back on the suggestion that the Fed’s super-low interest rates and massive bond purchases were creating asset bubbles, such as the one apparently forming in GameStop that has transfixed market mavens and the general public alike. “I think the connection between low interest rates and asset values is probably something that’s not as tight as people think because a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time,” Powell said. It was a telling response from arguably the world’s single-most influential financial figure, who came to his central banking post through Wall Street and whose policies in response to the COVID-19 crisis have been praised for their speed and boldness but also criticized for helping fuel a “K-shaped” economic recovery that favors asset owners. Indeed, Powell said his motivation is fostering an economic environment that will help the millions still out of work in the pandemic to regain employment. “In a world where, almost a year later we’re still 9 million jobs at least ... short of maximum employment, it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative,” said Powell, whose remarks followed the Fed’s decision to leave its benchmark interest rate near zero and to keep buying $120 billion a month in bonds. That said, Powell said the Fed is cognizant that financial risks can emerge in periods of extensive accommodation, but it prefers to address those through so-called macroprudential tools largely focused on keeping the banking sector safe and sound. “We don’t really think we’d be successful in every case in picking the exact right time to intervene in markets,” Powell said. The Fed also coordinates with other regulators when it comes to monitoring financial stability risks in the nonbank sector, he said. “We monitor financial conditions very broadly, and while we don’t have jurisdiction over ... many areas in the nonbank sector, other agencies do,” he said. GameStop’s dizzying rise has been assigned by many market watchers to a battle between retail investors who have piled into the shares and hedge funds and others who have placed big bets against the struggling video game retailer. It has also become a rallying cry among some who favor more market regulatory oversight. On Wednesday, GameStop closed at $347.51 a share. Its price on Jan. 12? $19.95. The White House and Treasury Department are monitoring the situation with GameStop and other companies that have seen sharp gains in the last week or so, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday. Back at the Fed, though, Powell said changing monetary policy to ward off bubbles would not be his first choice. “If you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, will that even help? Will it actually cause more damage?” he said. “I think that’s unresolved ... We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues.”"

-48.84463788539502," Factbox: Stocks shunned by Wall Street surge as 'GameStop Effect' snowballs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amateur stock traders made a concerted effort to buy shares of companies shunned by Wall Street, challenging short positions by hedge funds, and costing some professionals billions of dollars on their bearish bets and inflating stock valuations. The GameStop effect has snowballed, with a number of downtrodden stocks surging thanks to the buying frenzy that started with GameStop. Heavy buying by retail investors sent shares of the video game retailer soaring, forcing big funds including Andrew Left’s Citron to cover short positions, incurring hefty losses. Below are some of the stocks involved: ** GameStop: Institutional investors bet against the video game retailer’s model, but the company’s announcement on Jan. 11 that it was changing its board and doubling down on digital sales, boosted the stock. Short sellers scrambled to cover their positions, which in turn attracted a spate of further retail buying. GameStop stock was last up 134.8% for the session, extending its year-to-date gain of 685.5% as of Tuesday’s close. ** Blackberry announced it was expanding its partnership with China-based search platform Baidu Inc, but the Canadian company said it was not aware of any reason behind its rally. The stock was last up 32.7%, extending its 185.4% year-to-date advance ** AMC Entertainment Holdings’ stock started its ascent after saying bankruptcy talks were “completely off the table.” So far this year, the movie theater operator’s stock was up 134% as of Tuesday’s close. On Wednesday, its price was last up 301.2% ** Bed Bath & Beyond continued to rise even after Wedbush downgraded the retailer to “neutral” after an “extraordinary two days of trading.” Its shares were last up 43.5%, building on its 107.6% jump since the last closing price of 2020. ** Pharmaceutical firm CEL-SCI Corp shares jumped 72.5% in a session fraught with multiple trading halts due to volatility. This added to its 24% gain so far this year. ** Finland-based Nokia announced on Wednesday it was unaware of any reason why its shares joined the short squeeze stampede. It was last up 38.5%, extending its 21% jump year to date. ** Consumer electronics company Koss Corp was caught in the mania.

The use of volatile call options, herd buying through social network Reddit, the involvement of Tesla’s Elon Musk and a burst of copycat trades in an apparent speculative retail bubble have contributed to put low profile GameStop on the front page of financial news. The following are significant moments in the GameStop share price: Dec. 8, 2020: GameStop shares tank after company misses Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue as pandemic-led store closures and intense competition from digital-game sellers hit sales. Jan 11: GameStop appoints Chewy.com founder and two other e-commerce veterans to its board in a deal with investor Ryan Cohen’s RC Ventures, as it doubles down on digital sales Jan 12: Short interest at 70.9 mln shares, down from 71.2 mln on Jan 8, per S3 Partners. Notional value of short bets rose to $1.4 bln from $1.3 bln, reflecting the rising stock price Jan 13: GameStops shares rise 57%, followed by another 27% jump the next day to $39.90. Its median target price among analysts is only $12.50. Jan 19: Short seller Citron Research takes aim.

-48.84463788539502," The big short: GameStop effect puts global bets worth billions at risk LONDON (Reuters) - Global bets worth billions of dollars could be at risk as amateur share traders challenge the bearish positions of influential funds, inflating stock valuations and leaving the professionals looking at potentially hefty losses. Gone are the days when bruised retail investors fled after prominent hedge funds bet against a stock -- the GameStop effect is rippling across U.S. markets and spreading to Europe. Shares of the 20 small-cap Russell 2000 index companies with the biggest bearish bets against them have risen 60% on average so far this year, easily outperforming the rest of the market, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data shows. Similarly, the best performers in Britain this week have been companies such as Pearson and Cineworld, in which investors also have sizeable short positions. But share price surges such as the 700% year-to-date jump in U.S. video game retailer GameStop could potentially wipe out billions of dollars of those short bets. Bets against GameStop alone amounted to more than $2.2 billion as of Monday, FIS’ Analytics data showed, equivalent to more than a fifth of the company’s market value. However, the company’s share price has quadrupled since the end of last week and added as much as 86% in early Wednesday trading to $276. “Most of the short positions are funded on margins. And so when markets run against you, you are stopped out if you are a short seller,” said Kaspar Hense, a fund manager at BlueBay Asset Management, which runs $60 billion in assets. “A short position can exaggerate your losses if you are not actively managing your position.” Several traders have told Reuters that one of the reasons for the jump in the price of some shares is short-sellers buying back into the stock to cover potential losses -- the classic short-squeeze -- drawing in more retail investors hoping to ride the wave. Retail investors account for an increasingly large share of market trading. Retail broker eToro told Reuters a third of its base joined in 2020 when trading on its platform surged five-fold from 2019 to $1.5 trillion. Retail investors’ participation in U.S. equity order flows increased to nearly 20% in 2020 from 15% in 2019, while orders from long-only funds fell to 6.4% last year from 9.7% in 2019, data from Swiss bank UBS showed. Short sellers typically borrow stocks to sell with a view to buying them back later when the price falls. The premium they pay to borrow the shares reflects the demand for them. All the GameStop shares that would be available to borrow are are already out on loan, with traders estimating annual borrowing costs at 25%-50% of the company’s share price. Short-seller Andrew Left, who runs Citron Research and is one of the big names behind the bets against GameStop, shorted the stock when it traded around $40, expecting it to halve in value. He still has a short bet although he has covered the majority of the position at a 100% loss. Melvin Capital Management also closed out a short position against GameStop at a 100% loss. GameStop is not the only short bet that has turned sour. BlackBerry, Bed Bath & Beyond, AMC, Macy’s and Cinemark Holdings, have all risen anywhere between 100% to 250% so far this year. In Europe, Evotec, Nokia and Varta have outperformed the wider market 2021. Matthew Leibowitz, CEO of digital brokerage Stake said GameStop’s performance is indicative of hedge funds being caught on the wrong side of a momentum rally. While they might have a valid theory in shorting the stock, the retail frenzy whipping it to record highs will hurt them. “You might have an amazing gun, but its no use if you’ve run out of bullets.” Refinitiv data on performance of some stocks with high short interest: Company RIC YTD rise Short interest GameStop 700% 100% AMC Entertainment 400% 100% Bed Bath 110% 62.8% BlackBerry 250% 35.8% Dillard’s 100% 82% Discovery 35% 34% Graphic: Smallcap index outperforms S&P 500 - Graphic: CBOE -"

-48.84463788539502," GameStop extends Reddit driven hyper-rally after Musk tweet (Reuters) - Amateur investors piled further into niche stocks on Tuesday, sending professional short sellers scrambling to cover losing bets, with GameStop skyrocketing for a fourth straight day, thanks in part to Elon Musk. GameStop surged 50% in extended trade after Musk tweeted “Gamestonk!!”, along with a link to Reddit’s Wallstreetbets stock trading discussion group, where supporters affectionately refer to the Tesla CEO as “Papa Musk.” “Stonks” is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks widely used on social media. (Graphic: GameStop dominates Wallstreetbets: ) GameStop’s after-hours surge added to a 93% jump during Tuesday’s roller coaster trading session, with the videogame retailer’s stock propelled by traders on Wallstreetbets, many of them buying volatile call options. The share spikes of the last few days are raising questions about potential regulatory clampdowns from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Such volatile trading fueled by opinions where there appears to be little corporate activity to justify the price movement is exactly what SEC investigations are made of,” said Jacob Frenkel, Securities Enforcement Practice Chair for law firm Dickinson Wright and former SEC enforcement attorney. The SEC declined comment. Herds of amateur investors on Reddit have long been supporters of Tesla and other hyper-volatile stocks, and their influence appears to be growing. “I don’t think this is a fad, it is a generational shift in how people think about investing their money,” said John Patrick Lee, ETF manager at VanEck. “A retail trader will not lean on Wall Street to manage their money and I definitely now see an antagonistic relationship between the old guard (Wall Street) and individual traders who are on the rise,” he said. As well as GameStop, BlackBerry, also favored on Wallstreetbets, advanced 4.9% and is up 185% this year. An earlier tweet by Musk sent Etsy up almost 9% before it reversed its gains. The surge in recent days - GameStop has increased more than seven-fold to $147.98 from $19 since Jan. 12 - has spurred concerns over bubbles in stocks that hedge funds and other speculative players had bet would fall in value. Trading in GameStop stock was halted for volatility nine times on Monday and five times on Tuesday. To some stock market professionals, the recent moves look symbolic of a stock market that may be overvalued at the end of a year dominated by floods of fiscal and monetary stimulus to ease the coronavirus crisis. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 70% from lows last March caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “This is hardly an environment where informed investors are transacting to establish price discovery,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. Venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya said in a tweet that he had bought $115 call options on GameStop on Tuesday morning after an exchange with Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian. Short sellers in GameStop are down $5 billion on a mark-to-market, net-of-financing basis in 2021, which included $876 million of losses early Tuesday, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. “GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well as social media platforms,” wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics. Another stock popular with Reddit investors, Virgin Galactic Holdings, surged 17%, and is now up 77% year to date. Much of the recent action among Reddit traders has centered around shares that have been heavily “shorted” by other market players - traditionally an area dominated by hedge funds. Shares in Evotec rallied 8% on Tuesday with three traders reporting that hedge fund Melvin Capital Management was closing its short positions after suffering losses on some bets. Melvin previously held a 6.2% short bet against Evotec, according to filings with the German regulator. The fund did not respond to requests for comment. Short sellers typically bet against stocks of companies that they view as outdated in their business models or otherwise overvalued. Noted short seller Andrew Left is as convinced as ever that GameStop is a dying business and its stock price will fall sharply. Left shorted the company’s stock when it traded around $40 a share and forecast publicly that it would tumble to $20 a share. He said on Tuesday that he was still short the stock. “Will it end badly? Sure. We just don’t know when,” said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York."

14.157316911942608," Retail trading frenzy sparks jitters for noted GameStop short-seller BOSTON (Reuters) - Short-seller Andrew Left does not usually smoke. But on Monday he had a cigarette to calm his nerves as shares of GameStop Corp, the stock he had shorted, continued to rocket higher. Left, who has built a reputation by targeting companies he thinks are overvalued, is as convinced as ever that videogame retailer GameStop is a dying business whose stock price will fall sharply someday. He said on Tuesday he is still short the stock, which means he has bet that the price will fall, and more convinced than ever of his position. “If I had never been involved in GameStop and came to this right now, would I still be short this stock? 100 percent,” Left, who runs Citron Research and a hedge fund, told Reuters on Tuesday. “This is an old school, failing mall-based video retailer and investors can’t change the perception of that.” GameStop did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Shares of GameStop jumped 22% on Tuesday after surging 144% a day earlier, as individual investors again piled into a number of niche stocks, prompting short sellers to scramble to cover losing bets. Left shorted the company’s stock - selling borrowed shares in a bet that the price will fall and that the shares can be bought back at a lower level - when it traded around $40 a share and forecast publicly that it would tumble to $20 a share. Since Left spoke out publicly about GameStop earlier this month, other investors have turned out en masse to take the other side of short-sellers’ bets, forcing the stock up some 308% this year to trade at $112.45, or up 47% on Tuesday. Along the way, Left said he has been threatened - although he declined to specify how - and asked authorities to investigate. “Everyone thinks this stock sucks and the only reason people are buying it and own it is that for them it is a game.” He added, “I created this game, based on uncovering the truths ... so I can’t get mad at people for taking the other side.” The market fury, however, is something that Left, who has been posting his research for two decades and has taken on prominent hedge fund managers like Bill Ackman at companies like Valeant, has not seen before. Short selling is something every hedge fund is technically able to do but only a handful of firms - including Citron, Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates, Carson Block’s Muddy Waters Research, and Ben Axler’s Spruce Point Capital Management - specialize in. Many hedge funds acknowledged over the last months that shorting had hurt their performance and Melvin Capital, a $13 billion hedge fund, on Monday received a financial lifeline from hedge funds Citadel and Point72 Asset Management after having been deeply hurt by short bets that went the other way. The pain continues for short investors as some of the market’s most shorted stocks like retailers Bed Bath & Beyond and Dillard’s Inc have marched higher in the last days. “I don’t smoke but yesterday I was outside smoking a cigarette,” Left acknowledged with a laugh, explaining his current stress. Last year his two-year-old fund returned 155%, after gaining 43% in 2019. This year the Citron fund is off 2.5% since the beginning of January, Left said. “This kind of situation teaches you proper allocation,” he said."
14.157316911942608," GameStop shares soar on short squeeze, then ease in wild trade session NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. videogame retailer GameStop skyrocketed by 144% on Monday as short sellers scrambled to cover their positions in the stock, which then pared gains in a roller coaster session that featured nine trading halts for volatility. Options activity also surged in the stock, which had gained 245% so far this year as of Friday’s close. It closed Monday’s session up 18% with $16.7 billion worth of GameStop shares traded -- more than triple the company’s actual stock market value. Short sellers had bet against the stock because they viewed GameStop’s retail business model as outdated. But GameStop shares began to rise after the video game retailer’s announcement on Jan. 11 about appointments to its board to double down on digital sales. The buying frenzy as short sellers rushed to cover positions enticed retail investors to pile on in hopes of riding the stock’s momentum higher. “Many traders leveraged positions betting the stock would go down and as it became a hot topic on social media and saw artificial demand created among short sellers, there was fuel added to the fire,” said Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst at TrendSpider, a technical analysis software company for traders. “Traders were being shopped out of their short positions and forced to buy back and a significant amount of artificial demand was created,” Wujastyk added. Short sellers typically borrow and sell shares they expect will fall, hoping to buy them back at a lower price, pay back the loan and pocket the difference. Users of social media circulated memes mocking the losing bets by intuitional traders and gains made by “mom and pop” retail traders long derided on Wall Street as “dumb money.” Over a quarter of all posts on three main Reddit investing groups last Friday were about Gamestop, compared to an average of about 1% in November, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis. Another stock with an unusual surge was Blackberry which put out a statement noting it had not disclosed anything to prompt the move. Retail traders “making a complete mockery of Wall Street and sophisticated institutional investors is absolutely hilarious,” wrote Rob Paone, founder of Proof of Talent, a blockchain recruiting firm. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York also appreciated the absurdity. “You know it’s not going to end well but while it is happening it just becomes this sideshow where people just sit back in disbelief,” Hogan said. The short betting was evident with 100% of the shares available to borrow to speculate against the company already out on loan, according to FIS’ Astec analytics data as of Friday. “Over the last seven days we saw shares shorted increase by +769 thousand shares, worth $50 million, an increase of +1.08% as its stock price rose +83%,” according to Ihor Dusaniwksy, managing director at S3 Partners, a financial data, analytics and services firm. Last week, short-seller Citron Research said the stock would be “back to $20 fast”. Citron did not respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Melvin Capital Management had a short position against GameStop. Melvin on Monday announced a $2.75 billion investment from Citadel and Point72 Asset Management to stabilize the fund. Melvin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Volume has also surged in GameStop options, hitting a record of 2.13 million contracts on Friday. On Monday, about 1.25 million GameStop options contracts had traded as of 3:04 pm E.T. (2004 GMT), about four times expected volume, according to Trade Alert. Given the surge in GameStop shares, expectations for volatility have likewise climbed. Based upon Trade Alert data, options are now pricing in an average move of about 22% over the next 30 days. Among the eight analysts who cover the stock, four rate it “hold” and the rest recommend “sell.” The median price target is $12.50, an ~85% discount to current levels, according to Refinitiv. GameStop did not respond to a request for comment."

The company’s shares were down 4.2% at $16.13 in extended trading, as it said comparable store sales fell 24.6% during the quarter. A rise in the popularity of videogame streaming and surging digital downloads of console games have hit GameStop’s sales growth, with coronavirus-driven curbs heaping more pressure on the videogame retailer.

The company did not provide a current-quarter forecast. Net loss narrowed to $18.8 million, or 29 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 31, from $83.4 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.

GameStop, which already sells Microsoft's flagship Xbox gaming console, said here it would now offer a two-year digital subscription package with the consoles to players at no upfront cost. Several analysts are expecting the November launches of the XBox Series X and rival Sony’s PlayStation 5 to boost sales for GameStop, which has been reeling under losses driven by coronavirus-led disruptions and delayed console purchases ahead of the new cycle. Brokerage Jefferies said the agreement provides GameStop access to revenue created at the gamer level, instead of solely on the piece of content sold. GameStop, which did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, said it planned to roll out Microsoft’s 365 services and workplace messaging app Teams in its stores and equip store associates with new Surface devices.

26.77165354330709," Investor group to nominate two directors to GameStop board: sources BOSTON (Reuters) - An investor group plans to nominate two directors to GameStop Corp's GME.N 11-member board, less than one year after reaching a cooperation agreement with the videogame retailer, two sources familiar with the matter said. Hestia Captial Partners LP and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP, which jointly own 7.5% of GameStop’s shares, are criticizing the board for poor strategic planning and capital allocation. The two, working together, plan to nominate Hestia partner Kurtis Wolf, and Paul Evans, an executive who has experience as a chief financial officer and board member, as directors, the sources said. The two sides squared off in 2019 when the investors pressed management to buy back shares and refresh the board. As part of a cooperation agreement, GameStop agreed to add a director to the board who was proposed by the investors. The peace has not endured, however, and the shareholders, who stress they are “long-suffering investors” rather than activists, said missteps have sent the share price tumbling 63% over the last year and that one new director was not enough to change board room dynamics. Hestia has owned shares for eight years. The company’s stock price closed trading at $3.76 on Friday leaving it with a market capitalization of $250 million. “We believe adding a large stockholder, as well as another stockholder supported voice with financial expertise, will give stockholders a greater say in the future of the Company; something that is greatly needed,” Wolf and Permit partner John Broderick, wrote in a letter to shareholders, that was seen by Reuters. Earlier this month GameStop announced changes to the board and appointed three independent directors. Hestia and Permit called it a “move in the right direction” but said it was too little and came too late. Two directors will stay on until the 2021 annual meeting and will essentially become “lame duck” directors."

-35.02304147465437," GameStop shares slump 20% as weak console demand prompts forecast cut (Reuters) - GameStop Corp cut its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday as the video-game retailer struggles with customers delaying console purchases ahead of new launches and a shift to digital downloads of games, sending its shares plunging 20%. The company, which gained popularity by selling video games for Atari consoles in the 1980s, now also faces the rise of game streaming services from technology giants such as Alphabet unit Google and Apple Inc. “With console makers set to introduce new and innovative gaming consoles late next year, we anticipate this trend to continue until the fourth quarter of 2020,” Chief Executive Officer George Sherman said in a statement. Newer versions of Sony Corp’s PlayStation and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox are expected to be unveiled next year. In an effort to counter the weak trends, GameStop said it would wind down operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, while staying on course to achieve its $200 million annualized operating profit improvement goal by 2021. The company, which earlier this year abandoned efforts to sell itself after failing to get a buyer on favorable terms, is looking at strengthening its website and targeting higher margin items such as gaming accessories. GameStop’s credit and cost controls will be enough to weather the rough year ahead, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. In the third quarter ended Nov.2, GameStop reported a 23.2% drop in comparable store sales, bigger than estimates for a 13.8% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. New hardware sales tanked 45.8%, while software sales plunged 32.6% despite a growth in Nintendo Switch titles, GameStop said. The company also reported a surprise loss of 49 cents per share against expectations for a profit of 11 cents.

The company’s shares plunged 15% in extended trading. GameStop reported a 41% fall in new hardware sales for the second quarter, as users preferred to wait for the next generation of Microsoft’s Xbox consoles and Sony’s PlayStation scheduled in 2020.

Credit Suisse analysts said the dividend elimination was not entirely surprising, but acknowledged that the move to pay down debt is prudent. “That said, the implication that dollars may be reallocated to transformation initiatives, adds risk at a time when gross profit is already declining.

-49.10485933503836," GameStop halts dividend as console sales slow; shares fall 26% (Reuters) - GameStop Corp shares plunged 26% on Tuesday after the video games retailer halted its quarterly dividend and reported a 13.3% fall in first-quarter revenue that missed analysts’ estimates on the back of slowing sales of video games and consoles at its stores. Shares of the company fell to $5.88 in extended trading, and if losses hold, they are set to open trading at its lowest level since 2003. Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd said the consumers were postponing their purchase of consoles, as the current models PS4 and Xbox One console are in late stages, and they are awaiting new versions from Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp. “The last time we experienced the console transition period (was) when Sony and Microsoft announced new generation consoles,” Lloyd said. The gaming retailer has been struggling with shrinking profits as consumers shift to downloadable videogames instead of buying physical versions from stores. GameStop also faces a major threat from the rising advent of game streaming, with technology giants like Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft and others getting into the still nascent space. “While GME said the dividend elimination would provide flexibility to drive value creation for shareholders and transform GME for the future, Apr-Q results and intensifying competition from Apple Arcade and Alphabet’s Stadia suggest it may be game over,” CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said. GameStop said it would use the capital meant for dividend payments towards debt reduction and investing in driving margin improvement through better sourcing, pricing and promotion activities. The stoppage of dividend will save about $157 million per annum, besides helping in cutting its nearly $500 million debt burden. New hardware sales plunged 35%, with an increase in Nintendo Switch sales more than offset by a decline in Microsoft Corp’s Xbox One and Sony Corp’s PlayStation 4 console sales, GameStop said. The company forecast comparable sales for the full-year to fall between 5% and 10%, while analysts were expecting a 4.9% drop in same-store sales.

The company, which is exploring a potential transaction after receiving a buyout interest, last week said it would sell its Spring Mobile business to Prime Communications LP for $700 million. “We are evaluating all aspects of our business, including our store and omni-channel experience, cost structure, strategic and economic partnerships ...,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Lloyd said in a statement on Thursday. The company is unlikely to name a new chief executive officer until the board’s strategic review ends, Shane Kim, who has been the interim chief executive officer since May, said on a post-earnings call. The Grapevine, Texas-based company said it now expects full-year adjusted profit to range between $2.55 and $2.75 per share, down from $3.00 to $3.35 earlier.

Sales of pre-owned products fell 13.4 percent to $396.9 million in GameStop’s third quarter, while the technology brands business reported about 12 percent drop to $171.1 million. But, sales in the company’s hardware business increased 12.8 percent to $349 million, while sales in its video game retail business rose about 11 percent to $720.7 million. The growth was mostly driven by higher demand for Xbox One X and Sony PS4 and big game launches by Activision Blizzard Inc and Take Two Interactive Software Inc such as “Call of Duty: Black Ops 4” and the much-awaited “Red Dead Redemption 2”. GameStop reported a net loss of $488.6 million, or $4.78 per share, in the three months ended Nov.3, compared with a year-ago profit of $59.4 million, or 59 cents per share.
