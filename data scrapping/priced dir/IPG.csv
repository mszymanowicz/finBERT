-3.5007106920992377," Interpublic raises concerns of a rough 2019; shares slip (Reuters) - U.S. ad firm Interpublic Group of Cos Inc IPG.N raised concerns of a challenging second half on Tuesday, as it followed bigger rival Omnicom Group Inc OMC.N in keeping full-year outlook unchanged despite reporting an upbeat quarter. Interpublic’s shares fell 3% in morning trade, while those of Omnicom were down 1.5%. Like Omnicom, Interpublic profit for the three months ended June 30 beat analysts’ expectations, as it won more customers and international clients increased their spends. New York-based Interpublic reported a 3% rise in net organic revenue - a widely watched measure that excludes fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and mergers. Analysts on average had expected a 2.9% rise, according to research firm FactSet. European rival Publicis PUBP.PA, however, had reported a weaker-than-expected second quarter and cut its 2019 revenue growth guidance. The company said its international organic revenue rose 6.5%, much above estimates of 3.1%, and ahead of Omnicom’s 2.8%. While Interpublic is set to meet organic growth target at the high end of 2%-3%, the headwinds get a little worse in the second half and runs a little bit into the first quarter of next year, Interpublic Chief Executive Michael Roth said on a conference call with analysts. Excluding items, Interpublic earned 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 44 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income available to Interpublic’s common stockholders rose to $169.5 million, or 43 cents per share, in the June quarter from $145.8 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $2.13 billion from $1.95 billion but missed analysts’ estimates of $2.14 billion. Traditional advertisers such as Interpublic have been losing ground to new technology and software giants, such as Facebook FB.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O, especially in the United States, one of the largest markets for these companies. Total digital ad spending in the U.S. will grow 19% to $129.34 billion this year, exceeding traditional medium for the first time, and accounting for 54.2% of the total spending, according to data here from research firm eMarketer. The company, home to Madison Avenue icon McCann, last year lost the media business of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to Publicis and U.S. Army’s marketing contract to Omnicom. “This was also where we have begun to see the impact of the revenue headwinds from McCann’s loss last year,” Chief Financial Officer Frank Mergenthaler said."

Interpublic said organic revenue - a closely watched measure in the ad industry that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and income from acquisitions - rose 6.4 percent in the first quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of a 3.8 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. The company, home to Madison Avenue icon McCann, has been spending billions to acquire data mining firms like Acxiom Corp’s marketing business to compete with the targeted advertising models of Alphabet’s Google and Facebook. Interpublic said leading client sectors included consumer packaged goods, financial services and retail. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising company, on Friday reported a sharp drop in first-quarter underlying sales in North America as the loss of work from clients such as Ford took a toll on its most important market. Interpublic’s U.S. and international organic revenue rose 5.7 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, in the quarter, much above FactSet estimates of 2.9 percent and 3.6 percent.

Interpublic, home to Madison Avenue icon McCann, has been spending billions to acquire data-mining firms to compete better with the targeted advertising models of Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google, two companies that dominate online advertising. Organic revenue — a closely-watched industry measure that removes the effect of foreign exchange rate swings and income from acquisitions — rose 7.1 percent in the Oct-Dec quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had, on average, forecast a 3.7 percent increase. Shares of the New York-based company were up nearly 5 percent at $22.66 in morning trading. The company’s organic revenue growth easily outperformed rivals Omnicom Group Inc and Publicis Groupe SA. Omnicom posted a quarterly organic revenue growth of 3.2 percent on Tuesday, while Publicis posted a 0.3 percent fall in organic revenue last week. Top-performing client sectors were consumer goods, health care, retail and auto, Chief Executive Officer Michael Roth said on a post earnings call with analysts. Interpublic’s U.S. organic revenue grew 6.3 percent, largely above the FactSet estimates of 2.8 percent. International was up 8 percent, while analysts were expecting a 3.7 percent rise. “While there is shared concern around macro issues, which include the aging economic expansion, political turmoil, international trade and interest rates, the backdrop appears sound as we entered the new year,” Roth said. Interpublic said it is targeting 2019 organic growth of 2 percent to 3 percent. “2019 organic net revenue guide appears to be very conservative given the size of the 4Q18 beat,” analysts from Evercore ISI wrote in a note. Net income available to Interpublic’s common stockholders rose to $326.2 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $252.3 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Interpublic earned 89 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 79 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Interpublic, home to Madison Avenue icon McCann, has managed to keep pace with an industry that is shifting to targeted advertising models by Google and Facebook. While rivals have struggled with customers choosing to spend more on data-driven advertising, Interpublic has maintained market share by spending billions to acquire data mining firms like Acxiom Corp’s marketing business. “We saw both existing client increases from a year ago and the benefit of net new business wins,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Roth said on a post-earnings call. The company said organic revenue — a closely-watched measure that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and income from acquisitions — rose 5.4 percent, above analysts’ expectations of 4.3 percent, according to research firm FactSet. Shares rose as much as 5.4 percent as both the company’s profit and revenue easily beat analysts’ estimates. “The market didn’t expect such a beat, but overall strong performance wasn’t surprising given the good numbers IPG has posted all year,” said Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi. The company’s U.S. organic revenue grew 5 percent, largely above the FactSet estimates of 3.6 percent, while international was up 6 percent, about 2 percent higher than expectations. Interpublic also reaffirmed its full-year target range for organic revenue growth of between 4 percent and 4.5 percent. “IPG is certainly outpacing its peers in recent quarters in terms of organic revenue growth. (It) will be interesting to see if they can sustain it,” said analyst Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Earlier in the week, rival Omnicom posted a quarterly organic revenue growth of 2.9 percent and Publicis 1.3 percent. WPP PLC, one of the “big four” advertising agencies, is yet to report results.

9.36872696425544," Interpublic tops estimates as ad clients boost spending (Reuters) - U.S. advertising group Interpublic IPG.N topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly results and raised its annual forecast for a key revenue measure, outperforming rivals Omnicom OMC.N and Publicis PUBP.PA. Shares of Interpublic rose 7 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday, after second-quarter results showed that the New York firm is benefiting from higher client spending and grabbing market share from rivals. Organic revenue at Interpublic, home to Madison Avenue’s iconic McCann agency, climbed 5.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018, growing at twice the pace analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We had highlighted IPG as one of our few companies under coverage that had the potential to beat estimates, but we are surprised at the extent,” analysts at Jefferies said. “Organic growth ... will be about 500 basis points ahead of peers, a level we haven’t seen historically.” U.S.-based Omnicom reported disappointing earnings for the second quarter, while Publicis saw a surprise drop in organic revenue. Results from Britain's WPP WPP.L, another ""Big Four"" traditional ad firm, are expected in September. Interpublic, which counts Microsoft, Google GOOGL.O and Coca-Cola among its biggest clients, also increased its annual target for organic net revenue growth to a range of 4 percent to 4.5 percent. “Our organic revenue growth is an encouraging signal that certain marketers have, in fact, return to growth mode in their engagements with us,” Interpublic Chief Executive Officer Michael Roth said on a conference call with analysts. The results come as Interpublic and other ad firms seek new ways to compete better with Google and Facebook FB.O, which have transformed the industry in recent years by reaching much larger audiences through online advertising. In response, traditional ad firms have boosted their online businesses and rolled out data-driven marketing platforms. Earlier this month, Interpublic agreed to buy data-mining firm Acxiom Corp's ACXM.O marketing business for $2.3 billion to help clients better target consumers. Net income attributable to Interpublic common stockholders rose 35 percent year-over-year to $145.8 million or 37 cents per share in the three months ended June 30. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 43 cents per share, topping analysts’ estimates of 42 cents. Revenue climbed 9.4 percent to $2.39 billion.

The move means that Little Rock, Arkansas-based Acxiom will part ways with a business that comprises roughly three quarters of its revenue in order to double down on its fast-growing “LiveRamp” unit, which helps companies more easily access and manipulate data. The talks are advanced and a deal could be announced as soon as next week, though there is always a chance that discussions could stall at the last minute, the person added. After the deal closes, Acxiom will eventually explore a potential sale of its remaining business, though its board may choose to give the Acxiom some time to trade in the public markets before they run a sale process, the person said. Interpublic and Acxiom were not immediately available for comment. For New York City-based Interpublic Group, the deal will give the advertising company access to Axciom’s reams of customer data, helping it better compete in an industry where clients increasingly expect advertising companies to offer data-driven insights. Interpublic Group is comprised of a bundle of advertising agencies including major networks such as McCann Worldgroup and FCB as well as many smaller, more specialized businesses. Acxiom announced it was conducting a review for the business earlier this year as part of a broader reorganization that saw its various business lines consolidated into either the LiveRamp or marketing solutions units. Axciom acquired LiveRamp in 2014 for around $310 million. The deal highlights the value for advertising companies in owning their own customer data at a time when the companies most known for gathering data on consumers, such as social media player Facebook Inc FB.O, are under political pressure to be more cautious about how they collect and share data."
