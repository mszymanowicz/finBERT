-5.39130434782608," UPDATE 2-Nomura confident in sustainable profit ahead after best Q3 in 15 yrs * Q3 pretax profit for wholesale business 76.9 bln yen * Wholesale segment leaner after overhaul * To achieve cost cut target a year ahead of plan (Adds CFO comments, detail) TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc expressed confidence in sustaining high profit levels after Japan’s biggest brokerage and investment bank reported its best third-quarter profit in 15 years on solid global markets and investment banking. “We have narrowed down areas of focus and expanded our market share in those areas,” Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura said at a briefing on Wednesday. Having sharply lowered its break-even point, “we are confident that profitability is now far more sustainable.” Kitamura also said the bank is likely to achieve its 140 billion yen ($1.33 billion) cost-cutting target by March, one year ahead of a plan set out two years ago. October-December net profit jumped 72% from a year earlier to 98.4 billion yen ($937 million), its highest third-quarter profit since 2005. Nomura’s wholesale business unit has emerged as a key profit driver in recent quarters following an overhaul two years ago that included $1 billion in cost cuts and scaling back some of its lower growth business. The segment, which consists of the global markets and investment banking arms, posted a pretax profit of 76.9 billion yen, up 78%. Like its Western peers, Nomura experienced a jump in markets trading stemming from the high volatility caused by uncertainty around the U.S. elections and the release of coronavirus vaccines. Its investment banking business benefited from a rash of mergers and acquisitions, as well as emergency corporate fundraising by Japanese companies, including top airline ANA Holdings. A strong wholesale businesses bodes well for Nomura’s ambition of becoming a global investment bank, as the bank remains a mid-sized player internationally, competing with much larger and deep-pocketed U.S. and European rivals. It is also looking to rebuild its wealth management business in the rest of Asia and the Middle East. The bank’s retail division, which mainly serves individual investors, posted 28.3 billion yen in pretax income, up from 17.6 billion, thanks to improving investor sentiment."
-4.821428571428564," Nomura hires 20 private bankers to bolster Asia wealth business SINGAPORE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc has hired more than 20 private bankers and investment advisors in Hong Kong and Singapore in recent months as part of the Japanese financial services group’s ambition to expand its international wealth management business. “The initial focus of the recruitment drive has been to strengthen our presence across Greater China, Southeast Asia and the global South Asia market,” veteran banker Ravi Raju, head of the business, said on Tuesday. Singapore-based Raju, who headed UBS’ ultra high net worth and global family office business in Asia Pacific, joined Nomura last year. In a rejig last year, Nomura, a top wealth manager in its home country, brought its Asia ex-Japan wealth business under its wholesale division, which included the global markets and the investment banking segment. Though it aims to increase the assets under management of its international wealth business to more than $35 billion by 2025 from the current $10 billion, Nomura would still be dwarfed by Swiss private banking giants UBS and Credit Suisse and other rivals, including Asian players. The addition of more than 20 private bankers and investment advisors for Greater China and Southeast Asia takes the segment’s staff tally to about 180 in Singapore and Hong Kong, Nomura’s main wealth management centres, excluding Japan.

Seven & i Holdings and TDR Capital did not respond to requests for comment. Nomura declined to comment. Seven & i inked a deal in August to purchase Speedway’s roughly 3,900 stores in 35 U.S. states, in a bid to shift focus beyond Japan where its stores and supermarkets face a shrinking population, slow economic growth and tough price competition. The deal would leave Seven & i with some overlap between 7-Eleven and Speedway stores, which it is seeking to address by divesting up to 300 gas stations.

18.14159292035399," Japan's Nomura says cost-cutting to boost profits after second-quarter drop TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, on Wednesday posted a 51.2% drop in second-quarter net profit from last year, when a stake sale in its research-focused unit boosted income. It said profitability had improved and its Chief Financial Officer said a plan to cut costs by about 140 billion yen ($1.34 billion) by March 2022 was about 85% complete, compared with 70% at the end of June. The company’s July-September profit came in at 67.6 billion yen, down from 138.6 billion yen last year, compared with an estimate of 58.95 billion yen compiled by Refinitiv. Pretax income for the wholesale segment, which serves corporations and institutional investors, was 65.5 billion yen for the quarter, compared with a pretax income of 18.9 billion yen last year. The retail division posted 22.8 billion yen net profit for the three months, compared with 5.3 billion yen a year ago. The division, which has a 7,000-strong sales force, even before the new coronavirus outbreak had started shifting the focus to emails and phone calls from a traditional emphasis on face-to-face sales partly because of the increased popularity of online brokerages. “As we started rebuilding our business portfolio last year, we now realise the effect gradually has emerged and our profitability has improved,” CFO Takumi Kitamura said on an earnings conference call. In the second quarter last year, Nomura posted its strongest quarterly profit in more than 17 years, lifted by the stake sale in its affiliate Nomura Research Institute 4307.T with a one-off profit of 73.3 billion yen."
18.494623655913962," Japan's Nomura to start new grads in call centre as sales change - sources TOKYO (Reuters) - The brokerage arm of Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc will send new-graduate employees to work at its call centre for their first year to expose them to dealing with customers over the phone, two people familiar with the matter said. The move is Nomura’s latest pivot from a traditional emphasis on face-to-face sales, which have been under pressure since before the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the rise in popularity of online brokerages. Nomura Securities, the country’s largest brokerage, will send almost all of its 350 new-graduate hires to work at the call centre after they join the company in April, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information is not public. “Given we have fewer chances to meet customers directly, new graduates will be able to get experience by hearing a lot of customers’ voices at the call centre,” one of them said. Nomura declined to comment. Nomura would be Japan’s first major brokerage to make such a change. Japan’s biggest corporations traditionally hire new graduates all at once each year to replace retiring employees. New graduates tend to be rotated between departments during their first few years. At Nomura, many new hires spend their first years working in a branch, learning the “shoe-leather” sales culture of going out, meeting customers and trying to sell investment products. That face-to-face business model and Nomura’s 7,000-strong sales force have been under threat from retail brokerages. Top online brokerage SBI Holdings Inc in March surpassed Nomura for the first time in the number of accounts. Nomura last year said it aimed to strengthen its channels of contact with customers by building up its online service as well as the call centre. Still, a year-long stint in a call centre may not be attractive to recent graduates expecting a high-flying career in financial services, said the second person. “Their image of working at a brokerage may not match with working at a call centre.”"
4.125736738703339," Nomura Securities says employee in Japan leaked client information TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Securities, the securities arm of Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T, said on Thursday that information related to its corporate clients has been leaked outside through an employee. The employee leaked information on transactions affecting 275 corporate clients, mostly financial institutions, to Tokyo-based brokerage Nippon Institutional Securities, Nomura said in a statement. Just over a year ago in a separate incident, a Nomura research affiliate leaked information about expected changes to the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s listing criteria to the chief strategist of Nomura Securities. That cost then CEO Koji Nagai a 30% pay cut. Nagai took the helm in 2012, after his predecessor resigned over a widening insider trading scandal. In the latest case, the information was related to trading in ETFs (exchange-traded funds), but a Nomura spokesman did not elaborate. Nomura said the information was leaked to a former employee of Nomura who works at Nippon Institutional, an unit of asset manager Nikko Asset Management. Nomura said it is considering taking strict measures against this employee, whom the brokerage did not identify, and it would strengthen its information management system. In a separate statement, Nippon Institutional said an employee who joined the firm from Nomura in October obtained client information between January and July through a Nomura Securities employee. Nippon Securities said it has not found any further leaks of information."

13.439635535307534," Nomura and partners launch digital asset custodian Komainu NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japanese bank Nomura Holdings Inc and cryptocurrency partners Ledger and CoinShares launched Komainu, a custodian to safeguard digital assets for financial institutions, on Wednesday. The joint venture, announced in 2018, is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, the companies said in a statement. It will be led by CoinShares Co-Founder and Chief Executive Jean-Marie Mognetti. “We have been trialing the platform with a limited number of clients for four to five months and are now launching to new clients,” Mognetti said in an interview. Komainu’s debut comes as more established financial firms explore offering custody and other services for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and other digital assets. Several large financial institutions, including Nomura, are hoping that traditional assets such as bonds or stocks can be digitized and issued using blockchain technology to cut costs and simplify some processes. The dearth of back-office services by major financial service providers has long prevented a wider adoption of digital assets. “We have been very focused on the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem,” Jezri Mohideen, global chief digital officer for wholesale at Nomura, said in an interview. “For us it was critical that we solve the custody issue.” Investment manager Fidelity and exchange conglomerate Intercontinental Exchange Inc also offer custody for digital assets. Komainu can integrate with the technology systems of financial institutions, the partners said. It will only accept clients and tokens that have passed anti-money laundering and provenance checks. Komainu’s executive team includes Kenton Farmer as head of operations. He has worked at Credit Suisse Group Ag and Hermes Fund Managers. Andrew Morfill, former global head of cyber defense at Banco Santander, will be chief information security officer. Susan Patterson, a former regulator, will serve as head of regulatory affairs. She has previously worked at Credit Suisse, Brevan Howard and UBS."
13.302752293577983," For Nomura's shoe-leather sales force, an uncertain future after coronavirus TOKYO (Reuters) - For years Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T has relied on an army of retail salespeople to peddle stocks and bonds to investors sitting on one of the world's largest pool of household savings, generating revenue even in the bleakest of markets. But since the COVID-19 pandemic put a stop to in-person sales calls, Japan’s biggest brokerage has lost a key advantage and its 7,000-strong sales force now faces an uncertain future. The crisis has only deepened concerns about the viability of Nomura’s business model, which is more reliant on retail broking than rivals. It’s also being squeezed as online brokerages draw younger investors. For the last several years, Yorio Sawamoto, a 69-year-old small business owner in Osaka, has been trading with Nomura. Now he’s trading less frequently and refuses to place large orders over the phone. “As an amateur investor, it’s really tough to take the plunge and spend the money if you don’t meet with the salesperson,” Sawamoto told Reuters. “When it’s just on the phone, for some reason you get wary. You end up wondering, ‘Is what this person is telling me really true?’” Investors like Sawamoto can mean big business. Japanese households hold a staggering 1,903 trillion yen ($17.8 trillion) in assets, around half of which is in cash or in bank savings. The shift to telephone sales has made it harder to establish a connection with customers, said one Nomura salesman who has been with the firm for around 20 years, adding that last month he made just 60% of his monthly sales target. “We were like actors in front of customers, but now we are like radio DJs,” said the salesman, who, like other current and former Nomura employees, spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s really hard to sell products with only our voices.” Japan lifted a state of emergency last month but the salesman said he was still largely stuck at his office because customers don’t want to meet. Nomura declined to comment. Meeting face-to-face helps put customers at ease, one Nomura saleswoman said. “One time my customer noticed I was using a pen with a Disney character on it. The customer also turned out to be a big fan, and we got caught up in a Disney conversation,” she said. “Stuff like that seems trivial but it’s hugely important.” The customer eventually bought 10 million yen ($93,000) in bonds and investment trusts, she said. Another salesman said telephone calls made it awkward to deal with customers who had lost money on the market. In such cases, he finds it impossible to convey enough sincerity when apologising over the phone, leaving him to fear he might lose customers. Despite a global reputation for investment banking, Nomura is better known in Japan as a brokerage, and its clout overshadows rivals such as Daiwa Securities Group 8601.T. Retail on average accounted for 39% of its pre-tax profit over the last five years, compared to 28% of recurring profit at Daiwa and 22% of recurring profit at smaller Mizuho Securities Co Ltd, according to Reuters calculations from filings. Nomura’s strength comes from a “shoe-leather” culture that stressed going out to meet customers and was instilled with an almost military discipline, according to one former employee. The former employee recalled being told there were only two acceptable answers to requests from superiors - “yes or yes”. Even before the coronavirus, the face-to-face retail model was under pressure from online brokerages, said Chizuru Tateno, a director at S&P Global Ratings. Therefore, it’s even more crucial that Nomura and other brokerages adapt to change after the pandemic, she said. SBI Holdings Inc 8473.T, Japan's largest online brokerage, surpassed Nomura in number of accounts for the first time in March, as more people appear to be trading from home. Nomura’s retail revenue in April was down around 20% from the average of the first three months of this year. May was similar to April, CEO Kentaro Okuda told Reuters last month. Nomura and other brokerages may need to reduce their sales staff or cut salaries if the trend continues, said Yusuke Maeyama of NLI Research Institute, a think tank. Michihiro Yamashita, a 48-year-old owner of an izakaya pub, has had an online account at Nomura for more than 10 years and has never used in-person sales. “Not only are transaction fees much cheaper for online trading, but you can now get a lot of information yourself online,” he said. “Who needs a salesperson?”"

Around 80% of staff at Nomura’s headquarters in the financial district of Otemachi have been working from home due to the outbreak. “Do we need such a lot of staff in Otemachi? Do we need that much workspace here? I would like to discuss those issues,” Kentaro Okuda told Reuters in an interview, adding that the company would conduct a review of the matter. Japan’s biggest investment bank and brokerage occupies most floors of the 22-storey Otemachi building, but it declined to specify how many people it employs there or what size of reduction in staff working at the offices it was looking at.

Japanese biggest brokerage and investment bank said in a business strategy update it was seeking new growth in private equity, private debt and infrastructure, as well as in offerings of digital bonds and security tokens. “To achieve sustainable growth, I have to take Nomura to a different dimension. How do we get there? Strengthening our expansion from public to private is the strategy,” Chief Executive Kentaro Okuda told an online investor briefing. Nomura said current revenue from business with private companies was “not that big” but declined to provide specific figures. This month Nomura posted a surprise fourth-quarter net loss, its first in five quarters, as the pandemic wreaked havoc on global stock markets. “It’s unclear if Nomura will be really successful in private markets but fee income from the new businesses could become stable and a key driving force for growth,” said Toshihiro Matsuo, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings in Tokyo. Nomura’s retail division saw revenue slide 20% in April after staff had to halt face to face meetings with customers due to Japan’s state of emergency to curb the spread of the virus. But the bank believes the problem is temporary, forecasting 110 billion yen in pretax income for the division for the year ending March 2023, more than double the amount booked for the past business year.

The firm posted a fourth-quarter net loss of 34.5 billion yen ($324.22 million), its first loss since the October-December period in 2018. Net profit for the year ended March came in at 217 billion yen, compared with an average estimate of 276 billion yen from five analysts polled by Refinitiv. “The quarterly results were tough as losses on trading assets and equities have grown due to drastic market moves in March,” Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura told reporters in a telephone conference on Friday. Nomura’s asset management division posted a pretax loss of 8.7 billion yen in the quarter, mainly because the share price of its affiliate American Century Investments fell during the period, it said in a statement, adding the total loss related to the company was 16.4 billion yen. It was the first quartely loss in the division since the October-December period of 2008. Pretax income for the wholesale segment, which serves corporations and institutional investors, came in at 10.1 billion yen for the three months through March compared with a 13 billion yen pretax loss a year ago. The retail division recorded pretax income of 18.4 billion yen, more than 5 times that from a year earlier. Nomura has been in a heavy cost-cutting mode for the past year, targeting about 140 billion yen in cost cuts by March 2022. About 70% of the plan has been achieved as of end-March, Kitamura said. While Nomura’s retail division was the most profitable among three segments, that will be difficult to sustain outlook as the government has asked its citizens to stay home as much as possible to halt the spread of the COVID-19 respiratory illness. Nomura has suspended over-the-counter business at all its retail branches nationwide after the government last month expanded the state of emergency to all areas of the country. That means that one of Nomura’s major strengths, face-to-face style sales to retail investors, might be scraped. “I’ve got used to face-to-face style and now I feel like I lost my weapon if I can’t meet my customer,” said a Nomura sales person in the retail division who declined to be named as the person is not authorised to speak to media. Sales persons are now only allowed to reach their customers via phone and email, Nomura said. “We were just like actors in front of customers but we are now like radio DJs. It’s really hard to sell products only with our voice,” the sales person said.

-23.19109461966605," Japan's Nomura posts fourth straight quarterly profit, led by wholesale business turnaround TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, on Thursday posted its fourth straight quarterly profit, primarily due to a turnaround at its wholesale business serving businesses and institutional investors. Net profit in the three months ended December came in at 57.1 billion yen ($521 million), beating one estimate of 38.94 billion yen by brokerage Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. Nomura, which is in the midst of a management reshuffle, had recorded a 95.3 billion yen net loss in the same period last year, its heaviest quarterly loss in nearly a decade, as it suffered a big write-off in its wholesale business. Pretax income for the wholesale segment came in at 43.2 billion yen for the three months through December compared with a 95.9 billion yen pretax loss a year ago. The retail division posted 17.6 billion yen in pretax income, up 26% from a year earlier, as market conditions improved, Nomura said. Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average .N225 rose about 8.1% in the three months through December. “The results were partly supported by market recovery. There are still things that we can do to get our business back at cruising speed,” Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura said at an earnings briefing on Thursday. Nomura has been in a heavy cost-cutting mode for the past year and is aiming for about 140 billion yen in cost cuts by March 2022, with close to 70% of that achieved as of end-December, Kitamura said. The investment bank has announced it is promoting joint Chief Operating Officer (COO) Kentaro Okuda as its new chief executive, replacing Koji Nagai, its longest-serving CEO in three decades, who will become chairman. The changes are effective April 1. Okuda in December pledged to speed up the pace of reform at Nomura. “Although the cost cut has been done relatively smoothly so far, (Nomura’s) retail division reform is one of challenges lying ahead,” said Toshihiro Matsuo, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings in Tokyo. “I am looking closely at how Nomura deals with the cost reduction while maintaining profitability.” Nomura also announced joint COO Toshio Morita would become the group’s representative executive officer in April and remain as a head of the core unit Nomura Securities, adding it would abolish the COO position."

The comments from Koji Nagai, Nomura’s longest-serving CEO in three decades, underscore the deepening sense of crisis for Japan’s top brokerage and investment bank amid a shrinking fee pool from trading that threatens financial services in the world’s third-largest economy. Nagai is due to become Nomura’s chairman in April and will be replaced by Kentaro Okuda, now co-chief operating officer, to lead a turnaround at the firm, which last year posted its first annual loss in a decade, has cut costs and also announced plans to shut 20% of its domestic retail branches. The headwinds from the “megatrends” will stay for another decade, Nagai said, indicating Nomura needs to focus on its primary business that include underwriting and deal advising. Already, Nomura has announced it will buy Greentech Capital Advisors, a U.S. mergers and acquisitions advisory firm which specializes in renewable energy. The size of the Greentech deal was not disclosed, although the Nikkei newspaper put it at 10 billion yen ($91 million). “This is really a business chance and unavoidable theme for us,” Nagai said in the interview last week which was embargoed for release on Friday. The new CEO will also keep trying to meet cost-cutting goals, Nagai said. Nomura is aiming for about 140 billion yen in cost cuts by March 2022, with about 60% achieved as of December. Okuda has said he wants to speed up the pace of reform with “a sense of urgency”, but has not provided details. A senior company source says Nomura is likely to sharpen its focus on its domestic retail business as that could be a strong source of revenue. Nomura posted a 57% year-on-year plunge in retail investment pretax profit in the quarter to September. A three-decade bank veteran, Okuda, 56, has worked overseas, including as head of Nomura’s U.S. arm. When asked about Okuda’s lack of experience in the domestic retail business, outgoing chief Nagai said it would be “short-sighted” to judge his potential ability based on such factors. “Management is operated by a team in which each member can help and complement each other. There is no ‘Superman’.”"

A three-decade bank veteran and currently co-chief operating officer, Okuda, 56, is tasked with remaking Nomura into a firm that can better compete with the hordes of fintech and other non-traditional rivals breaking into financial services. Never realizing its ambition of becoming a global investment bank or even gaining a strong footing after its 2008 disastrous acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ Asian and European businesses, Nomura last year posted its first annual loss in a decade. In April, it announced $1 billion in cost cuts for its wholesale business, which serves corporations and institutional investors, and said it would shut 20% of domestic retail branches. “I have a sense of crisis over whether today’s main players in the financial industry can remain so down the road,” Okuda told a gathering of investors, a day after he was named to succeed CEO Koji Nagai from April. “I want to speed up our pace of reform, taking it into account the change that is affecting our customers and financial markets,” he said. Okuda did not go into details. But a senior company source said the bank was likely to first sharpen its focus on its domestic retail business as that has the potential to be a strong source of revenue generation for the bank in the next few years. In Nomura’s strategy update to investors in April, Okuda said the bank needed to overhaul its wholesale business structure and reduce lower growth, lower profitability businesses. To date, he has been mainly focused on Nomura’s investment banking business, which has been hit by a shrinking fee pool as banks chase fewer deals as well as by new regulations that have increased costs. While Nomura is expanding into China, with its majority-owned securities joint venture securing regulatory approval last month, boosting revenue from overseas businesses will remain a challenge said the company source, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to identified. Overseas, Nomura remains a mid-sized player seeking to compete with much larger and better established U.S., European and homegrown rivals in those markets."

Nomura received the regulatory nod to set up the venture Nomura Orient International Securities in March this year, as part of Beijing’s move to open its financial sector up to foreign firms. With the latest approval, the Shanghai-based Nomura joint venture will be able to launch its operations. “Through the new business, Nomura aims to leverage its global expertise to provide clients with diverse investment products and services for the Chinese market,” the Japanese brokerage said in a statement on Friday. Nomura Orient International Securities is 51% owned by Nomura, 24.9% by Orient International Holding, and 24.1% by Shanghai Huangpu Investment Holding Group. China has unveiled a slew of measures in the last couple of years to open up its trillions of dollars worth of financial sector to give foreign firms greater access in areas including banks, fund management, brokerages and insurance businesses. The measures come as a crippling trade war with the United States exacerbates a slowdown in growth for the world’s second-largest economy. Goldman Sachs GS.N in August said it had applied for majority control of its Chinese joint venture, the latest international bank to do so ahead of Chinese plans to eventually allow foreigners full control. UBS UBSG.S was the first to get approval under the new rules as well as the stake it needed for control. Morgan Stanley MS.N is waiting for its stake purchase to be approved. Both JPMorgan JPM.N and Nomura got approval to work on starting majority-owned joint ventures from scratch in March.

6.485355648535557," Italian court convicts Deutsche Bank, Nomura in Monte Paschi derivative trial MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian court has convicted 13 former bankers from Deutsche Bank, Nomura and Monte dei Paschi di Siena over derivative deals that prosecutors say helped the Tuscan bank hide losses in one of the country’s biggest financial scandals. The verdict, read in court on Friday by lead judge Lorella Trovato, also ordered fines and asset seizures worth a total of 68 million euros ($62 million) from Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE and 91.5 million euros from Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T. Monte dei Paschi reached a settlement with the court over the case in 2016 at a cost of 10.6 million euros. The case centres on two complex derivatives transactions — known as Alexandria and Santorini — that Nomura and Deutsche Bank arranged for Monte dei Paschi in 2009. Prosecutors said the deals helped Monte dei Paschi, which was founded in 1472 and is Italy’s fourth biggest lender, hide more than 2 billion euros of losses racked up after the costly acquisition of a smaller rival in 2008. “We are disappointed with the verdict. We will review the rationale for it once it is published,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement. Nomura also said it was disappointed. “After thoroughly examining the content of the judgment, the company will consider all options, including an appeal,” it said. The scandal, together with more losses suffered by Monte dei Paschi during the euro zone debt crisis, threatened to destabilise Italy’s financial industry and forced the Siena-based lender to seek an 8 billion euro state bailout in 2017. In the trial, which started in Milan in December 2016 and took 100 hearings to complete, the three banks and 13 defendants faced allegations of false accounting and market manipulation between 2008 and 2012. Monte dei Paschi and its former top managers were also accused of misleading regulators. In recent years, instances of bankers being convicted of fraud have been relatively rare and experts said any conviction in this case would come as a surprise. While few executives from major global banks have faced criminal charges for their roles in the financial crisis, there have been several convictions of senior bankers at smaller European lenders. In 2017, four former managers of Spanish savings bank Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, and former International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato were jailed by Spain's High Court in similar corruption cases related to the financial crisis. (reut.rs/2rmCYKZ) In the Monte Paschi trial all defendants have always denied wrongdoing and none of them will serve time in jail before the lengthy appeals process is exhausted. First trial jail sentences in Italy can be significantly reduced or completely overturned in the appeals process. Some of the Monte Paschi former executives convicted on Friday have been acquitted by higher courts in related trials. Monte dei Paschi’s former chairman Giuseppe Mussari, one of five former executives from the Tuscan bank on trial, was given the heaviest sentence of seven years and six months in jail. Deutsche Bank and Nomura were both convicted as institutions for failing to prevent wrongdoing by their employees. All six defendants linked to Deutsche Bank and the two who once worked for Nomura were handed jail terms. They include sentences of four years and eight months each for Ivor Dunbar, former co-head of Global Capital Markets at the German bank, Michele Faissola, its former head of Global Rates, and Michele Foresti, its former head of Structured Trading. Nomura’s former chief executive officer for the EMEA region, Sadeq Sayeed, was also given a sentence of four years and eight months while Raffaele Ricci, the former head of the bank’s EMEA Sales, was handed a sentence of three years and 5 months. Lawyers for the defendants said they expected to appeal the verdict once the full ruling is released."
9.493670886075952," Japan's Nomura logs 17-year quarterly profit peak on stake sale and trading TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura Holdings 8604.T posted its strongest quarterly profit in more than 17 years, lifted by the sale of a stake in an affiliate as well as trading gains and improved performance at its wholesale division. Nomura, the country’s biggest brokerage and investment bank, has been in heavy cost-cutting mode after a bleak performance at its wholesale business led to the company’s first annual loss in a decade last year. Pretax income for the wholesale business, which serves corporations and institutional investors, has since rebounded sharply. It registered nearly fourfold year-on-year growth to 18.9 billion yen ($173.5 million) in its second quarter, helped by equities trading and investment banking. This helped to lift Nomura to post a net profit from a loss in the same period last year despite a 57% plunge in retail investment pretax profit. Retail operations in the three months to Sept. 30 were hurt by worsening investor sentiment against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war. Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura struck a cautiously optimistic tone at a post-earnings briefing on Tuesday. “While our bottom line was very much buoyed by the sale of shares in Nomura Research Institute, the main business didn’t do too badly in a difficult market environment,” he said. The company posted a profit of 138.6 billion yen in the quarter, against a loss of 11.2 billion yen a year earlier, helped by a one-off profit of 73.3 billion yen on the sale of the 13.5% stake in Nomura Research Institute 4307.T. This was the company’s third straight quarter of overall net profit and a second consecutive quarter of pretax profit for its international business. Nomura announced a plan in April to cut more than $1 billion in costs from the wholesale business and shut some of its domestic retail branches. Kitamura on Tuesday said that Nomura had achieved about 60% of the 140 billion yen in targeted cost cuts. Though its business is on a stronger footing than last year, Nomura’s reputation took another hit when it was censured by regulators in May after it was found to have leaked information related to listing and delisting criteria to clients. That led to the government leaving it out as an underwriter in a Japan Post share sale and Chief Executive Koji Nagai taking a 30% pay cut for three months. Nomura’s reduced costs and improved business focus helped the wholesale operations, said Shunsaku Sato at Moody’s Japan. He noted, however, that profitability at the unit was up from very low levels last year and was flat against the previous quarter. Revenue in the retail business was down 10% year on year at 76.9 billion yen, while revenue from net trading gains surged by 39% to 105.6 billion yen."

16.28959276018099," U.S. appeals court reinstates Nomura bond trader's conviction NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court reinstated the conspiracy conviction of a former Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T trader accused of lying to customers about mortgage bond prices, in a victory for prosecutors in their crackdown on improper sales tactics. Friday’s 3-0 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan makes Michael Gramins the only trader convicted at trial in the crackdown, which was unveiled in January 2013, whose conviction has survived the appeals process. Gramins’ trial judge in Hartford, Connecticut had set aside the June 2017 jury conviction a year later, after the appeals court had voided the conviction of former Jefferies Group trader Jesse Litvak in a similar case. The U.S. Department of Justice appealed, and Friday’s decision means Gramins can be sentenced. He could appeal his reinstated conviction and eventual sentence. “This is a temporary setback,” Gramins’ lawyer Marc Mukasey said in a phone interview. “We are still 100% in the fight. There’s a long way to go.” Thomas Carson, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut, declined to comment. Nomura agreed in July to pay $26.5 million in fines and restitution to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it failed to properly supervise Gramins and four other bond traders, without admitting wrongdoing. Prosecutors accused Gramins of training subordinates to lie to customers such as asset managers, hedge funds and insurers about bond prices, to make more money for Nomura. Gramins was convicted of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. His jury acquitted him on six other counts and deadlocked on two more. U.S. District Judge Robert Chatigny set aside the conviction in June 18, saying it was tainted because another trader, Joel Wollman, had testified that Gramins owed him a duty to tell the truth about bond prices. Chatigny said the 2nd Circuit had deemed such “point of view” testimony irrelevant in voiding Litvak’s conviction, the only other conviction in the crackdown, in May 2018. But in Friday’s decision, Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston said Wollman’s testimony had “some tendency to make it more probable” that investors would have deemed Gramins’ lies significant. “Wollman’s statements -none of which claimed that Gramins had acted as his agent or that Gramins owed him fiduciary duties - could not plausibly have prejudiced, misled, or confused the jury,” Livingston wrote. The judge also expressed sympathy for Chatigny, saying “this novel form of prosecution” raised new legal issues, and 2nd Circuit precedents were “at times obscure.” The case is U.S. v. Gramins, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-2007."

The recovery was led by a sharp improvement in its wholesale division, which had long been a drag and last year pushed Nomura into an annual loss for the first time in 10 years. Its vaunted reputation has also been dented. In May, Japan’s financial watchdog ordered it to improve internal controls after an information leak related to listing and delisting criteria at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. “Results of our structural reform started to emerge,” Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura told an earnings briefing on Wednesday. April-June profit came in at 55.8 billion yen ($514.24 million) versus 5.2 billion yen a year earlier. The result blew past the 14.9 billion yen average of two analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. The wholesale division posted 20 billion yen in pretax profit in the first quarter, due particularly to recovery in its U.S. fixed income business. That compared to a 7 billion yen loss a year earlier. Pretax profit at its asset management business increased by 76%, although the retail business saw a 60% drop from the same period a year earlier. Following the information leak this year, Nomura missed a chance to lead manage a mammoth sale of shares in Japan Post Holdings Co Ltd 6178.T as the government took the leak into account when choosing underwriters.

The accord relates to allegations that the traders misled customers about prices at which they bought bonds, understated the profit Nomura stood to make and sometimes pretended they were still negotiating to buy bonds that Nomura had already purchased. Without admitting wrongdoing, Nomura agreed to pay $1.5 million in civil fines and make $25 million of restitution to customers who bought and sold commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities from roughly 2010 to 2014. “Firms must have adequate supervisory procedures, particularly surrounding the sale of complex instruments,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC’s New York office. “Weak procedures, such as those found here, may enable employee misconduct to go undetected.” The SEC said the fines reflected Nomura’s cooperation and efforts to upgrade its supervision and other internal controls. A Nomura spokeswoman declined to comment. The former traders each faced criminal or civil charges over their alleged activity, but federal authorities have had only mixed success in holding them accountable. Three were tried on criminal charges in Connecticut. Tyler Peters was acquitted, Ross Shapiro was acquitted on all but one count, on which a jury deadlocked, and Michael Gramins had his conviction set aside. The other two traders, James Im and Kee Chan, were sued by the SEC in Manhattan. Chan settled in May 2017, while the civil case against Im remains open.

The sales staff then told clients. Nagai, who became the group CEO in 2012, has said he will take a 30% pay cut for three months over the scandal.

The bleak results underscore the challenges of Nomura, which recently announced a restructuring plan that includes cutting $1 billion in costs from its wholesale business and shutting about 20 percent of its domestic retail branches. Nomura posted a net loss of 100.4 billion yen ($897 million) for the year ended March, wider than an average estimate of 81.4 billion yen from seven analysts polled by Refinitiv. In the fourth quarter, profits were almost wiped out for Japan’s biggest investment bank and brokerage, sinking about 96 percent from a year earlier to 800 million yen. “The result was very much disappointing,” Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura told reporters at an earnings briefing. “We are making an effort to get our business back at the cruising speed as soon as possible,” Kitamura said. As part of its cost-cutting plans, Nomura has already said it will shut more than 30 of its 156 retail branches at home. It also plans to ax about 100 jobs in London, the center for its European investment banking business, Reuters has reported. On Thursday, Nomura said it would not pay the performance-linked portion of compensation to dozens of executives for the year ended March given the lackluster financial performance. Pretax profit at Nomura’s key retail unit plunged 85 percent year in the fourth quarter. “Stock prices have recovered in some degree since January but our customers remain wait-and-see,” Kitamura said. But it is the wholesale business, which serves corporations and institutional investors, that has been the biggest drag for Nomura. The segment swung to a pretax loss of 13 billion yen in the fourth quarter, from a 44.2 billion yen profit a year ago. The segment has been squeezed by lower trading revenue in fixed income. The sizeable loss speaks to the scale of the challenge ahead for Nomura and its CEO Koji Nagai. But Nagai has no plan to follow the lead of Wall Street rivals and seek a tie-up with a commercial lender, he recently told Reuters, eschewing a model that has redefined investment banking since the global financial crisis. While it lacks the lending firepower of a commercial bank, Nomura’s independence means it is not confined by the banking relationships of other lenders and can do deals with anyone in Japan, Nagai has said."

Even without capital ties to any of Japan’s three megabanks - Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group - Nomura has been able to retain its formidable presence in Japanese investment banking, particularly deals. It is advising Nippon Paint Holdings on a $2.7 billion bid for Australia’s DuluxGroup, announced this week. But it doesn’t have the lending firepower of a rival such as Morgan Stanley, which thanks to its tie-up with Mitsubishi UFJ, has been able to leverage the Japanese bank’s massive balance sheet to offer financing alongside of advisory services. ENVY & INDEPENDENCE Nagai said that while he felt “envy” toward competitors with lending power, a capital alliance with one of the megabanks would sacrifice Nomura’s independence - likely closing it off from clients allied to one of the other megabanks, given the Japanese corporate practice of sticking to a “main bank” and doing business with that lender’s affiliates. “We won’t give up our independence by joining a capital alliance,” he said. As part of the cost-cutting overhaul Nomura also plans to axe about 100 jobs in London, the center for its European banking business, Reuters has previously reported. The wholesale business has been squeezed by lower trading revenue in fixed income. Credit-ratings firm Moody’s has said that Nomura’s overhaul plans, if successful, would help it refocus its business and reduce earnings volatility. Nagai said Nomura is also focused on driving its mass-affluent customers - often defined as those with less than $1 million in investable assets - to its digital platform. The bank is looking to hire people from online brokerages to help drive that strategy, he said. ($1 = 111.9100 yen)"

-1.1142061281337057," JP Morgan, Nomura get nod for China brokerage JVs as market access expands SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - JP Morgan and Nomura have won Chinese regulatory approval to set up majority-owned brokerage joint ventures, in China’s latest move to open its financial sector up to foreign firms. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said on Friday it will continue to approve foreign brokerage joint ventures “efficiently”, after announcing its decision for the two banks. Allowing foreign banks a controlling stake in securities joint ventures is a key part of China’s pledge to ease ownership curbs, especially in the trillion-dollar financial sector. A lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for western investment banks, and a reason behind JP Morgan’s 2016 decision to sell its 33 percent ownership in its then Chinese joint venture. Western banks including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse run joint ventures, whose offerings include debt and equity underwriting and financial advisory, with varying degrees of operational control. Beijing gave UBS approval in November to hold a majority stake in its securities joint venture, making it the first foreign bank to do so under new rules announced in 2017. JP Morgan and Nomura applied to set up majority-controlled joint ventures in China last year. But unlike UBS, neither has a mainland joint venture and would need to start from scratch. The majority-owned securities venture will allow JP Morgan to further strengthen its China business and offer “a complete set of services and solutions” to its clients, the Wall Street bank said in a statement. “It’s a critical component of our growth plans globally as well as in Asia Pacific,” JP Morgan Asia Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Nicolas Aguzin, said. Nomura said it’s China joint venture would initially focus on the wealth management business, and expand its offerings “with the ultimate goal of growing the business into a full-fledged brokerage”. “With an increased presence in China, we aim to support economic growth in both China and Japan and firmly establish ourselves as a global financial services group with deep roots in Asia,” Nomura Chief Executive Koji Nagai said. The recent approvals for greater access to foreigners, from insurance to asset management, comes amid a festering trade war with the United States, with increased access to the financial sector among a host of demands from Washington. Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that Beijing will expand market access for foreign banks and securities and insurance companies, especially in financial services. China has in recent years allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in joint ventures. Besides UBS, HSBC also holds 51 percent of its securities business in China, which was launched in 2017, but the Asia-focused bank does so under rules allowing Hong Kong-based companies special access."

1.0638297872340436," Nomura reviewing wholesale business after posting biggest loss in a decade TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings has put its wholesale business under review after the segment drove Japan’s biggest brokerage and investment bank to its heaviest quarterly loss in nearly 10 years. “We will promptly review our business model. Especially on the wholesale business, we have already begun discussion and we will explain specifics shortly after the fourth-quarter earnings in April,” CFO Takumi Kitamura told reporters at an earnings briefing on Thursday. The wholesale business serves corporations and institutional investors. Kitamura did not elaborate on the review but said the bank will do further “selection and focus”, a term Japanese companies use that often flags disposal of assets. Nomura’s struggles highlight the challenges it faces in transforming the bank with the goal of cutting dependence on volatile markets and building up stable revenue flows. The bank said in a statement its October-December net loss came in at 95.3 billion yen ($876.64 million), down from a profit of 88 billion yen a year earlier and compared with the 30.9 billion yen average profit estimate of two analysts compiled by Reuters. Nomura said it booked an impairment charge of 81 billion yen during the period. It said the impairment is related to its U.S. securities trading execution company Instinet and Lehman Brothers, the failed Wall Street bank whose Asian and European businesses it bought in 2008. Impairment is an accounting practice in which companies reduce the value of businesses and other assets recorded on their balance sheets to reflect declines in profitability of the assets. “We eliminated any optimistic view about our wholesale business,” Kitamura said. The surprise second straight quarterly loss was the steepest since the January-March quarter of 2009 when the bank recorded a 215.8 billion yen loss, reflecting costs to integrate Lehman’s operations. Under CEO Koji Nagai, Nomura has been working to reduce reliance on global markets business, where the bank and its Wall Street rivals have been hit by weak fixed-income revenues. “Traditional trading business using our own balance sheet has reached the limit,” Kitamura said. For the third quarter, Nomura’s wholesale segment recorded a pre-tax loss of 95.9 billion yen, down from a profit of 14 billion yen a year earlier. Its retail business also suffered a steep profit fall, posting a pre-tax profit of 14 billion yen compared with 31.3 billion a year earlier, as individual investors sat on the sidelines amid turmoil in the market. Global stock markets slumped in December, weighed down by growing worries about the health of the world economy amid an escalating U.S.-China trade spat. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei average suffered its first annual loss in seven years in 2018 after logging a nearly three-decade high in October. Nomura said its equity business got a boost from SoftBank Corp’s $23.5 billion initial public offering last year. Nomura was one of its joint global coordinators, selling about 600 billion yen worth of shares, mostly to Japan’s retail investors. Japan’s largest IPO brought a bonanza to Nomura’s rivals as well, but ironically, it was also SoftBank that helped cool retail investor sentiment. “I would not say this is the whole reason, but SoftBank shares, since listing, have not gone above the IPO price of 1,500 yen,” Kitamura said. “A wide range of investors participated in (the IPO) and unfortunately, we are spending our time on following up (on customers) given such share performance.” Earlier this week, Japan’s second-biggest investment bank Daiwa Securities Group Inc said net profit for its third quarter ended in December fell by nearly 40 percent to 14.1 billion yen, hurt by a plunge in trading revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities. Daiwa CFO Mikita Komatsu said the SoftBank IPO helped attract new and dormant clients, noting it sold about 450 billion yen worth of the telecom company’s shares to domestic retail investors. But SoftBank’s share performance since its market debut in December “is one of the factors that retail clients’ investment sentiment remains weak,” he said. ($1 = 108.7100 yen)"

The bank is in the process of re-allocating global resources to shift its growth focus to the Americas, which has the world’s largest pool of investment banking fees. It is trying to build up businesses there without taking on bigger risks. “Our key words are ‘America’, ‘corporate clients’ and ‘solutions business’,” Koji Nagai told Reuters in an interview. He said Nomura’s global markets business - involving the trading of fixed income and equity - remains an important source of revenue but is not currently under consideration for further expansion. “Rather, our focus is on advisory and primary business, which are not subject to market risks to the same degree and do not use our balance sheet much,” he said. Primary business includes helping client companies issue stocks and bonds. “In addition, we will expand our solutions business such as acquisition finance and foreign currency exchange services for deals we advise on.” Nagai forecasts the expansion of Nomura’s client financing and solutions business in the United States and elsewhere to boost revenue by $250 million in the medium term. Nomura has made U.S. expansion of its investment banking arm one of its priorities as it strives to earn more stable income from advisory services. Its recent hires include bankers covering healthcare, technology and financial services. The U.S. push comes after major restructuring in 2016, which included significantly shrinking its European operations, resulting from its acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ Asian and European businesses in 2008. Nomura suffered three consecutive quarters of pretax loss in its overseas business through September. Earnings in the latest quarter were also weighed down by a one-time 20 billion yen ($181 million) charge, part of a settlement with U.S. authorities regarding the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. “We will absolutely keep our global platform though we have been shrinking businesses that are unprofitable and not needed by our clients,” Nagai said."

The results highlight Nomura’s struggle to consistently drive profit growth at its key businesses, and contrast with surging profits at top Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley which were helped by strength in stock trading and equity underwriting. And a third straight quarter of pre-tax losses in its overseas operations show it is unable to stabilise them a decade after buying parts of Lehman Brothers’ business in Europe and Asia in an attempt to expand outside of its domestic stronghold. Nomura said on Wednesday it clocked a net loss of 11.2 billion yen ($98.90 million) for its second quarter ended in September, versus a 51.9 billion yen profit a year earlier. It booked over 40 billion yen in charges, including 20 billion for a settlement with U.S. authorities over residential mortgage-backed securities that it had already flagged. The charges also reflected the loss related to closing of an overseas subsidiary. Brokerage SMBC Nikko Securities had estimated Nomura’s net loss at 2.9 billion yen for the quarter. Nomura said it does not expect a recurrence of such one-time expenses in the current quarter. “Still, we recognise profit levels at our retail and wholesale divisions show challenges,” Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura told an earnings briefing. He said the company is in the process of reallocating resources to strategic focus areas and reining in costs. Quarterly pre-tax profit at Nomura’s wholesale division, which serves corporations and institutional investors, fell 71 percent from a year earlier to 4.9 billion yen. And pre-tax profit at its retail division halved year-on-year to 12.2 billion yen as investors became cautious amid falls in emerging market currencies and uncertainty in market conditions, the company said. Revenue from Japan rose, driven by interest rates and equity derivatives but Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell due to subdued client activity, the company said. Losses from Americas and Europe widened from the previous quarter, with Nomura saying the increases reflect inclusion of the one-time charges. Daiwa Securities Group Inc, Japan’s second-biggest brokerage, reported earlier this week that second-quarter net profit fell 44 percent to 17.7 billion yen, with the retail division hurt by a decline in bond sales and wholesale business weighed down by a fall in revenues from equity and debt underwriting. Nomura CFO Kitamura said there is growing uncertainty in global markets, affected by factors such as U.S.-China trade war, Brexit and rising tensions in Middle East. “The business environment is getting very difficult.

Nomura knowingly bundled defective mortgage loans into marketable securities from 2006 to 2007 and misled investors about their quality, authorities said. The settlement stems from an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. “This settlement holds Nomura accountable for its fraudulent conduct in connection with its residential mortgage-backed securities offerings, which caused substantial harm to investors and contributed to the financial crisis of 2008,” said Richard Donoghue, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, whose office conducted the probe. Nomura said in a statement it did not admit any wrongdoing in connection with the settlement, and disputed the allegations. Authorities accused Nomura of falsely telling investors that it conducted extensive due diligence on the home loans that it securitized, when in fact they did not comply with underwriting guidelines or relied on fraudulent appraisals. Nomura continued the practices despite warnings from its due diligence staff, who warned that Nomura was “turning into the lemming of the mortgage business” and dealing with “extremely dysfunctional” loan originators, authorities said. Nomura’s misconduct caused “significant losses” for its investors, including retirement funds and university endowments, according to Donoghue’s office. Nomura was previously ordered to pay a total of $839 million together with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in a lawsuit brought by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which has acted as conservator of mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since their 2008 takeover by the federal government after the collapse of the U.S. housing market."

Its wholesale arm lost 7.4 billion yen before tax, its first quarterly loss since January-March 2016, driven by a slowdown in its rates, foreign exchange and emerging markets businesses that pushed down bond trading revenues. That, in turn, dragged Nomura’s overseas business into a 7.7 billion yen pretax loss, with the bank losing money in each of its three overseas regions - the Americas, Europe and Asia and Oceania. Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura said Nomura would continue its efforts to keep a lid on costs. The brokerage had made deep cuts two years ago in Europe and the United States. “We would not have stayed at this level if we hadn’t done anything,” he told an earnings briefing. “We will look to strengthen our top line, and continue strategic cost reductions.” The grim performance at Nomura’s wholesale unit, which serves corporations and institutional investors, was in stark contrast to recent results by Wall Street banks. There, volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes have put trading desks at the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley on track for their best year since 2011. Nomura’s relatively small scale means it faces a tough task in expanding revenues while controlling costs, Moody’s analyst Shunsaku Sato told Reuters. “They have more of a revenue problem than an expense problem, but they are trying to control costs while expanding business, which is often difficult to do,” he said. Pretax profit at Nomura’s retail unit, which serves mostly domestic individual investors, slumped by a fifth to 19.9 billion yen, its lowest for two years. The brokerage blamed worries over U.S.-China trade friction for a one-third drop in equities sales. CFO Kitamura said he did not expect market conditions to get better. “No major improvement has been seen, even in the July-September quarter,” he said."

Nomura, Japan’s No.1 brokerage and investment bank, said in a statement on Thursday its April-June net profit was 5.2 billion yen ($46.99 million) versus 56.9 billion yen a year earlier. Tokai Tokyo Research Center Co’s Tatsuo Majima had forecast a 52.50 billion yen profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Nomura’s wholesale division, which sells services to corporations and institutional investors, lost 7.4 billion yen before tax - its first quarterly loss since January-March 2016 - as a slowdown in the brokerage’s rates, foreign exchange and emerging markets business pushed down bond trading revenues. The unit’s performance was in stark contrast to recent results by Wall Street banks. There, volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes has put trading desks at banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley on track for their best year since 2011. The wholesale unit’s loss dragged Nomura’s overseas business into a 7.7 billion yen pretax loss, compared to a 15.5 billion yen net profit in the same period last year. All three areas - the Americas, Europe and Asia and Oceania - lost money. Stable profitability at the international operations has remained elusive for the brokerage 10 years after it bought Lehman Brothers’ equities and investment banking business in Europe and Asia in 2008, part of a bid to expand from its domestic stronghold. Pretax profit at Nomura’s retail unit, which serves mostly individual investors, also fell by 20 percent to 19.9 billion yen from a year earlier, with the brokerage blaming U.S.-China trade concerns for a decline in stocks trading and weak sales of investment trusts.

1.646090534979425," U.S. top court rejects Nomura and RBS appeal in mortgage-backed securities case WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear an appeal brought by Nomura Holdings Inc and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC seeking to overturn an order requiring them to pay $839 million for making false statements while selling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The court left in place a September ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that went against the banks, which had challenged the 2015 award on multiple grounds. Lawyers for Nomura and RBS could not immediately be reached for comment. The award stemmed from a lawsuit brought against Nomura and RBS by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2011. The FHFA has acted as conservator of mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since their 2008 takeover by the federal government after the collapse of the U.S. housing market. The lawsuit was one of 18 brought by the FHFA that year over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All the other lawsuits have been settled. The FHFA has recovered more than $23 billion from the settlements, including $5.5 billion from RBS in a different lawsuit, $5.83 billion from Bank of America Corp and $4 billion from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Following a non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled in 2015 against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals. She ruled that the offering documents for the securities did not correctly describe the underlying mortgages and ordered the banks to pay $806 million. The banks later agreed to pay another $33 million for costs and attorneys’ fees, subject to the outcome of their appeal."

-11.346153846153843," Nomura pushes back forecasts for ECB rate hike to September 2019 LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese investment bank Nomura said on Wednesday it had pushed back its forecast for the timing of a European Central Bank interest rate hike to September 2019 from March 2019 previously. Signs of slowing economic growth in the single-currency bloc and a political crisis in Italy have prompted investors to cut bets on an ECB rate hike over the next year. Nomura told clients in a note it also expected the ECB to announce a three-month wind-down of its asset purchase program from October through to December 2018 at its July meeting. The bank had previously expected a shorter two-month wind-down. The ECB’s current asset-purchase scheme is scheduled to end in September. “We think it more probable too that recent financial instability and slower growth could encourage the ECB to become more explicit in its forward guidance, possibly by suggesting what it means by its current statement that interest rate hikes will not emerge until “well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,” Nomura analysts said in the note."

-16.783216783216783," Nomura posts sharpest drop in quarterly profit in 4 years on Americas loss TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, posted its largest slide in quarterly profit in almost four years as its Americas unit lost money and retail clients grew cautious amid volatile markets. Nomura set aside 30 billion yen ($274 million) in provisions for “legacy transactions” preceding its 2008 purchase of Lehman Brothers’ European and Asian operations, leading to a pretax loss at its Americas unit, the company said on Thursday. It did not provide any further details. At its key retail unit, which serves mostly individual Japanese investors, pretax profit fell by nearly a fifth from a year earlier as trading slowed amid turbulent market conditions, underscoring how closely Nomura’s fortunes are tied to factors beyond its control. “The U.S. interest rate hike and stronger yen weighed on stock prices, and particularly in March there were remarkable moves to hold back from trading stocks and investment trusts,” CFO Takumi Kitamura told reporters at a briefing. Earlier in the day, Nomura reported a January-March net profit 22.7 billion yen ($207.6 million), down 63 percent from a year ago, the sharpest decline since April-June, 2014. It closed the financial year with an 8 percent drop in net profit to 219.3 billion yen, short of an average forecast of 256.58 billion yen from five analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Dragged down by the Americas, Nomura’s overall overseas operations recorded a pretax fourth-quarter loss of 18.7 billion yen and an annual loss of 0.7 billion yen. Profitability at its non-Japanese operations has been a long-cherished goal for Nomura, which implemented a painful round of cost cuts two years ago following six straight years of international losses after buying the Lehman assets. The retail and Americas performances masked solid growth at Nomura’s wholesale division, which counts corporations and institutional investors as clients. Pretax quarterly profit at the unit grew by more than 50 percent, as bouts of volatility saw clients transact more in capital markets. The performance echoed that of Wall Street banks such as Morgan Stanley MS.N and Goldman Sachs GS., which have also posted strong profits with capital markets flourishing during the first few months of 2018. However, on an earnings call, CFO Kitamura said both the retail and wholesale businesses had “gotten off to a slow start” this financial year as market participants were increasingly in a “wait-and-see mode concerning uncertainties surrounding monetary policy and geopolitical risk”. Nomura does not give a net profit forecast. Six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on an average expect the company to report 251.11 billion yen for the year ending March 2019. Nomura said it would buy back its own shares worth up to 70 billion yen, or 2.7 percent of its outstanding shares. Its shares closed down 0.1 percent, against a 0.5 percent gain for the overall Nikkei .N225. ($1 = 109.3500 yen)"
