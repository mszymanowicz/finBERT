53.883495145631066," Stock conversion allows China's Wanda to sell AMC shares amid retail frenzy SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Wanda Group, the major shareholder in AMC Entertainment Holdings Ltd, conducted a share conversion to permit sales of its stock in the cinema operator, a target of the recent WallStreetBets retail frenzy, AMC said in an exchange filing. Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a Wanda unit, converted its Class B common stock in AMC to Class A shares on Feb. 1 “in order to permit sales of its common stock,” AMC said in the filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb 5. The filing did not give details on the amount of stock converted to Class A shares or say whether Wanda had sold any shares in AMC. Wanda did not immediately return a request for comment. AMC shares touched $17.25 on Feb. 1, almost quadrupling from a week earlier, as social media platforms such as Reddit fuelled frenetic retail buying into heavily-shorted stocks such as AMC and GameStop. AMC shares plunged 41% the next day and the stock is now down about 60% from its Feb. 1 peak. The social media-fuelled trading frenzy has cooled over the past few days as U.S. financial regulators scrutinize GameStop’s Reddit-driven stock surge. Wanda, whose businesses range from real estate to entertainment, bought a majority stake in AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, in what was then the largest overseas acquisition by a privately held Chinese company. In 2018, the once-acquisitive Chinese conglomerate trimmed its exposure to the U.S. cinema operator amid tighter regulatory scrutiny by Beijing over Chinese companies’ overseas expansion. Wanda still owns a controlling stake in AMC, according to the group’s website. Wanda also owns Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment and Australian cinema chain Hoyts Cinema, the website said."

A swarm of buying by amateur traders over the past two weeks sparked big moves in shares of companies that hedge funds had bet against. Some framed it as a battle between Wall Street and Main Street. Many of the so-called ""Reddit rally"" stocks fell sharply this week. GameStop shares closed Thursday down 42% at $53.50, far from their peak of $483 a week ago. AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) has lost about two-thirds of its value after two weeks of wild swings. The family behind Koss Corp (KOSS.O) and some of the headphone maker's top executives raked in about $45 million from a surging stock price during the rally. read more Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said retail investors who got burned buying at the highs were likely to be more cautious bidding up shares of companies with a high short interest. Retail investors ""can see that this is a roller-coaster ride and not a one-way trip up, and that's probably given them a little more pause before pushing the buy button."" Some investors may once again be setting their sights on stocks they believe are overvalued. Health insurance startup Clover Health (CLOV.O), which is backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, ended down 12% after it was criticized in a report by Hindenburg Research. read more On WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum at the center of the squeeze that has hurt hedge funds and other ""short"" sellers, some denizens urged each other to hold the line and not sell GameStop. Others expressed frustration at the stock's big drop. “It’s funny how everyone on here is telling others to hold but stock keeps falling meaning y’all are actually selling,” said a user with the handle the_undergroundman. “You’re getting played by your own brethren.” Despite this week's declines, GameStop shares remain up 184% so far in 2021, AMC up over 200% and Koss over 400% year to date.  MARKET DISTORTIONS Ahead of the Thursday meeting, Yellen said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she and other regulators were seeking to ""understand deeply"" what had happened before considering action. read more Yellen was to meet with heads of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Analysts said they would likely look at online forums where mass buying of GameStop and AMC was discussed last week, and on the ever-larger role of hedge funds in financial markets. ""Any kind of market distortion by investors agreeing to cause the distortion goes against the smooth and transparent functioning of markets,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard. ""The reason this might not be covered by regulation yet is simply because it has never happened before. But now it might find its way into regulation in a more explicit way."" Credit rating agency Fitch said late Thursday that U.S. financial institutions face second order effects from GameStop volatility and that social media raises retail investors' impact, which may have long-term implications for financial firms. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester told CNBC she does not see the Fed making any adjustments in reaction to the GameStop frenzy.

The group added it was important investors understood the role of short-sellers and their research.

Meanwhile, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted his support for cryptocurrency Dogecoin, sending its value surging more than 50%. Musk's tweets about certain companies, including GameStop, and cryptocurrencies have contributed to the recent rally. read more Many analysts think the ""short squeeze"" is over and market attention has begun to turn to possible fallout. The number of GameStop shares shorted edged lower, according to the latest data from analytics firm S3 Partners. ""The retail frenzy that provided an unusual distraction over the last couple of weeks appears to have lost momentum,"" said Craig Erlam, market analyst at OANDA Europe.

32.44005641748943," 'Reddit rally' stocks bounce on day after selloff, then dip after hours (Reuters) - GameStop and other social media darlings rebounded in calmer trading on Wednesday from their sharp sell-off in the prior session as investors turned their focus to the possibility of tighter U.S. trading regulations. However, the so-called “Reddit rally” cooled again in after hours trade, as GameStop and AMC Entertainment, the main targets hyped on investment forums, fell. Mass buying over the past two weeks by amateur traders following posts on social media fueled a fierce rally in companies that big hedge funds had bet against, including videogame retailer GameStop and cinema operator AMC. GameStop had soared as high as $483 last week, fueled by posts on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, then dived and on Tuesday fell briefly below $90. On Wednesday GameStop shares closed up 2.68% at around $92.41. They seesawed all day but within a range, while shares of AMC rose 14.71% a day after dropping 41%. After the closing bell, GameStop was off 2.61% while AMC dipped 2.23%. Some professional investors bemoaned the volatility and warned that retail investors who piled in could ultimately face big losses. “The fundamentals are well known and obviously the stock prices have detached from the fundamentals,” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities. “I have told people just stay away, it is dynamite and who knows when, how or where it blows up.” Many Reddit users on WallStreetBets exhorted one another to stay in the stocks despite the big swings. “Hold and buy more” AMC shares, wrote Reddit user Avocadochicken93, “TO THE MOON AND BEYOND!” Silver prices advanced modestly after surging on Monday to eight-year highs, and analysts expected more volatility, even after Reddit posts urged traders to avoid silver. The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will meet with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and heads of the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as soon as Thursday, a Treasury official told Reuters. The SEC is reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud, Bloomberg News reported, citing unnamed sources. [L4N2K94J4] Yellen has asked to discuss volatility and promoting fair and efficient markets. Her meeting will probably include “some disguised reference to GameStop somewhere on the fringes, but it probably won’t be called out specifically,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Experts expect focus to fall on the ever-larger role played by hedge funds and other non-bank firms in financial markets. Online brokerage app Robinhood will allow investors to buy parts of shares in GameStop and AMC. St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said frenzied trading is not the result of the Fed’s loose monetary policy. Regulators have not yet signaled what form any official actions could take. Potential targets range from retail brokers’ capital requirements to questioning the fee-free brokerage model. This issue is global. European regulators are monitoring the risk that a surge in retail investors and online brokers could create bubbles inflated by social media, France’s AMF markets watchdog said. The benchmark S&P 500 closed slightly higher and the CBOE volatility index eased for the third straight session.

Other so-called “meme stocks” caught up in the Reddit rally rose on Wednesday, with headphone maker Koss Corp and home furnishing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond rising 27.95% and 10.40%, respectively. BlackBerry Ltd’s U.S.-listed shares were up 3.9%, following a 21% slide a day earlier. All of those shares also fell after hours. GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry and Koss did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Bed Bath & Beyond declined to comment. GameStop named three new executives Wednesday to further a push into e-commerce that began moving the stock in January. The number of shorted GameStop shares edged higher, according to the latest data from analytics firm S3 Partners. The retail trading boom drove volumes in U.S. equity options to a record monthly high in January.

The trade puts Silver Lake and its co-investors in the black following a $600 million convertible bond investment that the private equity firm made in AMC in 2018. Such an outcome looked unlikely when AMC, the world’s largest movie theater chain, was battling to stave off bankruptcy last summer, a move it avoided thanks to a debt restructuring deal with Silver Lake and its creditors. Silver Lake was able to convert the bonds into shares thanks to the rally pushing AMC’s stock above the bonds’ conversion price this week. AMC shares had dropped 70% in 2020 to close the year at $2.12, as many of the company’s movie theaters closed or operated with reduced capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the shares ended trading at $19.90 on Wednesday, as traders targeted heavily shorted stocks such as AMC and GameStop Corp. Silver Lake sold its stake over several open-market transactions that day, according to regulatory filings. The sale makes Silver Lake the latest investment firm to cash in on this week’s unprecedented rally in shorted stocks. Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan sold $497.4 million worth of stock it owned in U.S. shopping mall owner Macerich Co this week, regulatory filings showed. AMC itself also capitalized on the rally.

Data about posts and comments on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets, aggregated on swaggystocks.com, showed GameStop and AMC were by far the most discussed stocks on the discussion group that has fueled their recent surge, with both continuing to enjoy overwhelming positive sentiment. Swaggystocks.com was created by Reddit member swaggymedia, whose posts sharing data about Wallstreetbets sentiment have won thousands of “upvotes” from readers. Swaggystocks did not immediately respond to an email asking for his identity but gave permission for his content to be reproduced.

GameStop dropped 44%, but the stock remains up almost 900% since Jan. 12. AMC’s 57% drop reduced its gain since Jan. 21 to around 190%. Also falling heavily were Blackberry, Koss and Express, which Robinhood also restricted trading in. Wallstreetbets has ballooned in recent days to 4.8 million members. Many of those people have piled into stock heavily bet against by professional short sellers, overwhelming the professionals and forcing them over the past week to abandon their positions with heavy losses. AMC, GameStop, Nokia and Blackberry are currently the most discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets, eclipsing Tesla, which has long dominated chatter amongst its members. AMC and GameStop account for over 25% of recent comments on Wallstreetbets, with Nokia accounting for over 20%.

The world’s largest movie theater chain, with about 1,000 cinemas worldwide, suffered unprecedented turmoil after the pandemic last year forced it to temporarily close many venues while attendance dropped at those that remained open. AMC staved off bankruptcy through a debt restructuring deal last summer with its creditors and private equity firm Silver Lake, and a series of other financial transactions in recent months. AMC said on Monday it had raised $917 million since mid-December through equity and debt issues. “This means that any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table,” Chief Executive Adam Aron said in a statement accompanying disclosure of the additional funds. On Wednesday, AMC said it raised an additional $304.8 million by selling shares this week, cashing in on an unprecedented social media-driven rally powered by amateur traders taking on hedge funds that had shorted its shares. On Thursday, it said Silver Lake and other creditors decided to convert debt holdings to equity in a transaction expected to reduce AMC’s obligations by $600 million. AMC is considering attempting to raise even more money to capitalize further on the frenzy in its shares, the sources said. While its shares dropped about 57% on Thursday, erasing most of the week’s gains, they are still up more than 300% since the beginning of January. AMC said on Monday its “financial runway has been extended deep into 2021.” Still, it could use proceeds from a new capital raise to further trim its $5.5 billion debt pile as of the end of September, according to the sources. The cinema chain is considering a share sale while its stock remains high to reap hundreds of millions of dollars, which would give it additional cushion to navigate the pandemic, the sources said. Negotiating more debt-for-equity swaps is also under consideration to reduce the money it owes creditors, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has not made any final decisions on near-term financial transactions, and its calculations could change depending on how its stock performs in upcoming trading sessions, the sources said. AMC is consulting with its creditors and taking other steps as traditionally unpopular stocks have soared in frenzies fueled by social media. GameStop Corp has been at the center of the volatile trading. The trading is upending markets and presenting unanticipated opportunities for weakened companies to shore up balance sheets to brace for additional challenges wrought by the pandemic."

A $600 million bond investment that buyout firm Silver Lake made in AMC Entertainment Holdings in 2018 is now in the money thanks a 301% surge in the struggling movie theater chain’s shares on Wednesday, fueled by traders organizing on social media platforms such as message board Reddit. Silver Lake’s notes can be converted into stock at an exercise price of $13.51 per share. AMC shares, which had closed at $4.96 on Wednesday, jumped 301% on Wednesday to $19.90, leaving Silver Lake sitting on a $284 million gain, were it to convert its notes currently. Silver Lake declined to comment. AMC’s shares had fallen 70% in 2020 to close the year at $2.12 apiece, as many of its movie theaters closed or operated with reduced capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the company became the latest darling of retail traders this week, which organize in social media to bet on heavily shorted stocks such as GameStop Corp. In July, Silver Lake agreed to restructure its convertible bonds AMC as part of a debt restructuring deal that allowed it to stave off bankruptcy, and also gave it an additional $100 million in financing. Silver Lake, which is led by Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, has around $75 billion in assets and committed capital."

AMC was forced to raise capital to stay afloat after its ticket sales plunged 80% in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. It staved off bankruptcy last year thanks to a debt restructuring deal with its lenders and private equity firm Silver Lake. Shares of Leawood, Kansas-based AMC rose a cumulative 41% on Monday and Tuesday, as amateur investors, many of them organized online in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBest, decided to take on hedge funds shorting the stock. AMC disclosed on Wednesday that it had sold $304.8 million worth of stock on Monday and Tuesday, at an average price of $4.81 per share. The company’s shares, however, jumped as much as 310% on Wednesday as the speculative frenzy intensified. They closed at $19.90 a share, about 301% higher on the day. Had AMC sold the same number of shares at that price, it would have raised $1.26 billion. Although AMC could decide to sell more stock in the coming days, the money it left on the table shows how the speculative rally of the last few days in heavily shorted shares, particularly those of video retailer GameStop Corp, presents both an opportunity and a challenge for companies. An AMC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. AMC, which also operates Britain’s Odeon cinemas, said on Monday it had already raised enough money to rule out a potential bankruptcy. Through a combination of debt and equity issuance, it has raised $917 million since the middle of December to help cushion the blow from the pandemic."

The company’s shares, which have lost nearly half their value in the last 12 months as it was forced to shut theaters during the virus outbreak, jumped as much as 39% to $4.88. While AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron allayed investor fears by repeatedly raising fresh funds, the business has still not reached pre-pandemic levels. AMC, which also operates Britain’s Odeon cinemas, has reopened most of its theaters but new social distancing measures and a wider malaise over visiting public places have hit the company hard. The COVID-19 pandemic devastated the film business in 2020, and ticket sales in the United States and Canada sunk 80%. “Looking ahead, for AMC to succeed over the medium term, we are going to need for much of the general public in the U.S. and abroad to be vaccinated,” Aron said. Nearly 22 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S. as of Sunday morning, with the initial doses being given to health workers and older citizens. New York-based AMC said it had raised capital by issuing new shares, while executing commitment letters for more debt.

There was no further contingency planning on the table beyond raising additional capital at the moment, Adam Aron said in an interview. He did not mention the amount that the company was looking to raise. Aron denied an earlier Bloomberg report that said the company was considering a range of options, including a potential bankruptcy protection, calling it “false” and “completely inaccurate”. “At the moment there is no Plan B under consideration,” he said. “If we were literally running out of cash, we would have to come up with a Plan B and we have a pretty good sense of what that Plan B would be but that is not something we are actively considering today.” Lenders to the cinema chain have held preliminary talks among themselves about providing the movie-theater company with financing if it decides to file for Chapter 11 court protection, Bloomberg had reported bloom.bg/3nVNKRx.

Either all or vast majority being equity”, he added, when asked if the additional potential capital raise was going to come through equity. The company previously raised $300 million in new first lien financing in July and $500 million in April. “Now we are going to try to do it for a third time and push out our (financial) runway deeper into 2021,” the AMC CEO said in the interview.

The UK-based company had previously expected to start reopening theatres, which include Regal Cinemas in the United States, on July 10, but a number of important markets, such as Los Angeles and New York, have not yet given the go-ahead. Hollywood studios have also pushed back the debut of new releases, with “Mulan” and “Tenet” for example now scheduled only for August.

The company is the world's second largest cinema chain after AMC Entertainment AMC.N . AMC has also pushed back its reopening date in the United States by two weeks to July 30. The crisis has forced cinemas across the world to close their doors after governments imposed lockdowns to prevent the spread of the disease. Even as cinemas prepare to welcome back film fans, the experience will be different as social distancing measures will be in place for the screenings. Cineworld expects its cinemas to fill up to half capacity when they reopen.

Regal Cinemas, owned by Cineworld Group Plc, also said it would mandate masks for employees and customers to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. On Thursday, AMC, the world’s largest movie theater operator, had said it would only encourage mask wearing except in states where authorities required it. The policy drew immediate criticism from people who said they would not feel safe if others around them were not wearing masks. AMC said Friday that it had listened to reactions from its customers and scientists and reversed course. “It is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks,” AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said in a statement. “As we reopen theatres, we now will require that all AMC guests nationwide wear masks.” AMC plans to reopen 450 theaters in the United States on July 15, and the remaining 150 theaters in the country in time for the opening of Walt Disney Co’s “Mulan” on July 24 and Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” on July 31. Regal plans to reopen its theaters on July 10. On Thursday, AMC's Aron said in an interview with Variety bit.ly/319SN7Zmagazine that the company did not want to get into a ""political controversy"" by forcing people to wear masks inside movie halls. Several Twitter users accused the movie chain of not doing enough to protect customers’ health. Actor Elijah Wood, in response to AMC’s statement, tweeted: “And masks, you should require masks. Has nothing to do with politics, but rather, public health.”"

The world’s largest movie theater operator also said it would reopen the remaining 150 theaters in the country in time for opening of Walt Disney Co’s “Mulan” on July 24 and Warner Bros.’ July 31 release of “Tenet”. The company said it will adopt a four-phase approach to increasing limitations on the seating capacity, adding that social distancing will be enforced across all auditoriums. In phase 1, beginning July 15, ticket availability in all AMC auditoriums will be capped at 30% of the normal seating capacity and it will block every other row in non-recliner auditoriums. This cap will be increased to 40% of the seating capacity in phase 2 and 50% in phase 3, which is expected to begin around the Labor Day weekend. The company plans to operate at full capacity in Phase 4, expected around Thanksgiving.

-5.564387917329088," AMC to reopen theaters globally in July, shares rise (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC.N said on Tuesday it was expecting to reopen its theaters globally in July after shutting them down in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending its shares up about 4% in extended trading. The world's largest movie theater operator said it was planning to reopen almost all its U.S. and UK theaters in time to showcase Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"", slated for release on July 17, and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N ""Mulan"" on July 24. AMC said it expects to run with limited capacity and blocked seating to maintain safety at its theaters, besides taking the usual precautionary measures. Last week, it flagged “substantial doubts” about its ability to continue operations, if it was forced to keep its theaters closed for a longer period. Much like most other out-of-home entertainment businesses, movie theater chains have also been hit by lockdowns and social distancing measures, which further added to the challenges due to a broader consumer shift to streaming services. AMC on Tuesday said it was conducting an “exhaustive analysis” of its theaters to determine which ones to shut permanently, due to lack of profitability. The company, which operates Odeon Cinemas, recently reopened some theaters in Norway. “Even though those 3 theaters were limited in ticket sales to 25% of seat capacity, we sold 83% of our available seats this past weekend” Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said, adding that it also recorded strong sales of food and beverages.

Corporate America’s great liquidity rush is over – at least, judging by companies’ drawdown of backup credit facilities. Last week banks handed over just $850 million, most of it to discount store Dollar Tree. That’s barely a rounding error compared to the $265 billion firms siphoned off their lenders since March – including $140 billion in one frenetic week that month, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. It’s a relief for banks, which at one stage were inundated by clients tapping credit lines for fear of going under. And around a fifth of the borrowings have been repaid, reckons Morgan Stanley. That will mean less interest income, but at least players like JPMorgan and Bank of America have scooped up fees helping companies issue bonds and equity. And it’s good to know banks have firepower in reserve because if there’s a second wave of the virus, the race will be back on. (By Antony Currie) UNFRIENDLY SKIES. Chinese airlines can’t fly to the United States from June 16, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Wednesday. It’s not like many of their usual customers would want to, between social unrest and an ongoing pandemic. Yet it’s a symbolic retaliation, and a sign the White House is prepared to fight battles on many fronts. China had already blocked U.S. airlines. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines pushed to reinstate flights this month but haven’t received a response from authorities there. The Donald Trump administration’s order, which affects Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines, levels the playing field. It’s a bit of a hollow blow. The International Air Transport Association said daily flights have somewhat recovered recently but mostly in domestic markets. But it suggests that even as Trump faces conflict and economic turmoil at home, his desire to make China pay – or at least appear to – only gets keener. (By Gina Chon) MOUNTAIN RETREAT. The pandemic has not dented Klaus Schwab’s Rolodex. The World Economic Forum’s founder on Wednesday convened a virtual mini-summit to discuss his call for a “Great Reset”. Dignitaries including Prince Charles, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva, Microsoft President Brad Smith and BP boss Bernard Looney beamed in from their lockdown locations. The result was a 75-minute version of the earnest debates that characterise the four-day January shindig in Davos. The line-up suggests the 82-year-old may still be able to lure big names to the physical event in the Swiss mountain retreat next year. Less clear is whether executives, financiers and hangers-on still want to come. Aside from the risk of catching Covid-19, joining a party for the global elites will be even harder to justify after a severe global recession. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon joked recently that a coronavirus outbreak in Davos would have been “good news”. Perhaps Schwab should take the event fully online.

The global theater chain owned by China’s Dalian Wanda on Wednesday warned of “substantial doubts” about its ability to continue as a going concern ahead of a scheduled first-quarter earnings release next week. Shelter-in-place orders designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus have been brutal for cinemas. Even if AMC can reopen theaters soon, it doesn’t mean that moviegoers will flood back. Social-distancing rules and habits will last until a vaccine or at least better treatment for Covid-19 is found. Suppose there is pent-up demand for movie outings, there still may not be anything special to see. Movie studios like Walt Disney, Paramount Pictures and Universal are postponing openings and in some cases launching new films straight to their own streaming services. The silver screen may be quickly fading to black. (By Jennifer Saba) HALFWAY HOUSE. Sometimes it pays to battle a national regulator. Axa found this out on Wednesday after the French insurer said it would pay out half the dividend it had intended for 2019 and consider a special payout to shareholders later in the year if markets allow. The 44 billion euro insurer’s share price jumped 7% as investors welcomed the surprise. After all, the French insurance regulator had called for a dividend cull until October 1. Chief Executive Thomas Buberl had a strong case to make. Even though the European insurance watchdog EIOPA had called for dividends to be scrapped to better absorb losses from Covid-19, Allianz announced a full payout after taking advice from the German regulator. Italy’s Assicurazioni Generali distributed half its intended dividend. French rival Scor, however, scrapped its dividend last week. European insurance payouts remain something of a lottery.

Reflecting on the decision not to enforce a lockdown to fight Covid-19, Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, on Wednesday admitted on local radio that he would have adopted a firmer approach in retrospect. Such doubts are understandable. Sweden’s mortality rate of 436 deaths per million people is nearly equal to that of virus hotspot France, according to the World Health Organization, and is over six times worse than the average among other Scandinavian countries. A higher infection rate is also the reason Norway and Denmark have opened their borders to each other but have excluded their Nordic neighbour. Sweden has garnered praise for suffering considerably less economic damage than peers: its GDP actually grew quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year. But if its pariah status persists, that advantage could quickly disappear. (By Christopher Thompson) IN STOCK. It’s one small step for capitalism in Australia, where Woolworths is rewarding employees with equity in the $31 billion supermarket chain. In recognition for hard work throughout the Covid-19 outbreak and generally difficult circumstances, over 100,000 full- and part-time staffers will receive up to A$750 ($520) worth of stock. Financially speaking, it equals less than the typical weekly wage in the country’s retail sector, but there is greater significance. Even if 20 or so shares won’t mint millionaires, turning workers – who must hold their stakes for three years if employed by Woolworths – into owners can help change how they perceive their jobs and employers. Boss Brad Banducci acknowledged their essential role “as we all adjust to the new normal”. If more companies around the world are inspired to follow suit, or even up the awards, it will be one of the good side effects from the pandemic. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) QUANTUM COVID. Is bad data less severe if it’s released when nobody is around to analyse it? The Russian government appears to hope so. In May it began publishing statistics which show the adverse economic impact of Covid-19 late in the evening. Sources told Reuters on Tuesday that the aim is for the numbers to get less attention because journalists won’t have time to talk to experts and do a thorough analysis. Sneakiness will only undermine trust in the country’s response to the pandemic. GDP contracted 12% in April and is forecast to fall 5%-8% this year. On Tuesday Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Russia’s economic stimulus plan would cost around $73 billion over two years. At around 5% of GDP, that’s a fraction of what developed countries are spending. Tinkering with statistics is addressing the symptom, not the cause. (By Dasha Afanasieva)"

Mexico had one small reason to celebrate on Cinco de Mayo: tequila sales. Exports of the agave-based drink rose by 43% in March versus the previous year, according to data from Panjiva, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence last week. And Americans decided that drinking alone may not be so bad. U.S. retail sales of tequila rose 60% year-over-year in the four weeks through April 25, Nielsen reported. Sadly, shots alone can only do so much to help Latin America’s second-largest economy, which may shrink by a whopping 6.6% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. The country’s state-owned energy firm Pemex – which was supposed to serve as an economic engine – posted an almost $24 billion first-quarter loss. And spirit sales should suffer if temporary bar and restaurant closures become permanent. But for now, tequila may be making Mexico’s headache slightly better.

Gawande appeared to have the right attributes: A surgeon, he has detailed the high costs and inefficiencies of American healthcare, and focused on incentives – exactly what Haven was supposed to be targeting. But the startup has few visible accomplishments to date. The three companies backing the venture may be big, but the part of the economy Haven is taking on is a giant. Healthcare accounts for 18% of GDP and has multiple entrenched monopolies. Focusing on Covid-19 would certainly offer Gawande more satisfaction.

AMC is in a heap of trouble since the coronavirus brought a near total shutdown, refusing to pay landlords for instance. Its market value had cratered to just $427 million at Friday’s close. But just because something is cheap doesn’t make it a bargain. Amazon, which has a formidable video-streaming service, is churning out movies.

The ban always looked like a long shot, as Ankara would have struggled to curb trading in foreign markets. Still, the decision seems to have helped. On Monday the currency firmed slightly. It’s only a short-term boost for President Tayyip Erdogan. His cajoling of the central bank to keep rates low has caused investors to dump the lira. With foreign currency reserves dwindling, he will need to find ways to boost the currency by the back door, such as trading restrictions.

That’s not the case at Dignity, the UK provider of burial and cremation services, which scrapped its full-year outlook on Monday and said that operating profit had fallen 11% to 19.4 million pounds in the first quarter. The decline was largely due to customers looking for cheap funerals and eschewing luxury add-ons like polished, satin-finished coffins. Investors should brace for more bad news. Even though the spike in the UK death rate means more funerals, government guidelines on social gatherings mean Dignity has stopped offering more expensive items like church services and limousines. And extra deaths in 2020 probably mean fewer burials in 2021 and 2022. None of this will help Dignity’s share price, which is down nearly 60% since the beginning of the year.

AMC’s 1,000 theaters around the world were closed last week to help prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading. “This leaves AMC with no revenue, and substantial fixed costs that continue,” AMC spokesman Ryan Noonan said. The furloughs apply to Chief Executive Adam Aron and other employees at the company’s headquarters in Leawood, Kansas. Some workers will see reduced hours and reduced pay, while others will be cut to no hours and no pay. The step was “absolutely necessary to preserve cash and to ensure that AMC can reopen our doors once this health crisis has dissipated,” Noonan said. Movie theaters have gone dark worldwide and some operators are worried they will not be able to reopen if the shutdown extends for months. The National Association of Theatre Owners has called on the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration to provide emergency relief. AMC’s furloughs will extend for the “hopefully short period of time” that all of its theaters are closed, Noonan said. Employees will retain health benefits during that time."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday issued here a guidance to cancel or postpone events throughout the country that consist of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. U.S. officials have so far recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 65 deaths. Globally, more than 162,000 have been infected and over 6,000 have died. AMC said it was adhering to CDC’s recommendation even though it was not a legal requirement for businesses in most U.S. jurisdictions. “We anticipate that these headwinds are transitory and we expect a growth reset over the medium term,” Benchmark analysts said after downgrading the stock to “hold” from “buy”. However, the brokerage said it was concerned if AMC will have enough financial flexibility to cover a longer-than-anticipated slowdown or a complete shutdown of its theatrical network.

-19.88517616541964," China's Dalian Wanda trims AMC exposure with Silver Lake deal (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc said on Friday it bought back 24 million shares from its top investor Dalian Wanda Group and issued $600 million worth of convertible notes to private equity firm Silver Lake. Earlier in September, Reuters reported Wanda was exploring a deal to cut its stake in AMC, as the Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin’s real estate-to-media conglomerate was under pressure from the country’s regulators to reduce overseas holdings. After the transaction, Wanda now owns about 38 percent of AMC shares, down from its previous majority stake of about 60 percent. As part of the deal, Silver Lake will get a seat on AMC’s board and a two-year right of first refusal on certain future transfers of AMC’s shares by Wanda. Wanda acquired a majority stake in AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, in what was then the largest overseas acquisition by a privately held Chinese company and Wanda’s first foray into the United States and Canada. In 2017, Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funding to companies such as Wanda, HNA Group Co Ltd and Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd for overseas acquisitions, amid concerns over financial overstretching."
-17.426633396511967," Exclusive: China's Dalian Wanda seeks to reduce AMC stake - sources (Reuters) - Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin's real estate-to-media conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group is exploring a deal to cut its stake in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC.N, the world's largest cinema operator, people familiar with the matter said. The move is the latest sign of how Wanda, like many of its Chinese peers, is under pressure from the country’s regulators to reduce overseas holdings after embarking on a major acquisition spree in the United States and Europe. Wanda is exploring a deal in which AMC would borrow hundreds of millions of dollars through a convertible bond, and then use that money to buy back some of Wanda’s 60 percent stake, the sources said on Wednesday. Wanda controls AMC though its ownership of Class B shares, and aims to retain control after any deal, the sources added. Private equity firms, including Silver Lake Partners and Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N, are in talks with AMC about making the debt investment, the sources said. They could obtain board representation at AMC as part of any deal, the sources added. The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Wanda and AMC representatives could not be immediately reached for comment. Silver Lake and Apollo declined to comment. AMC shares fell from their highest level this year following the news, dropping as much as 3 percent and trading down 1 percent at $19.05 on Wednesday afternoon in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. Based in Leawood, Kansas, AMC has more than 1,000 movie theaters globally. Wanda acquired a majority stake in AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, in what was then the largest overseas acquisition by a privately held Chinese company and Wanda’s first foray into the United States and Canada. In 2017, Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funding to companies such as Wanda, HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] and Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd [ANBANG.UL] for overseas acquisitions, amid concerns over financial overstretching. Wanda also owns Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment but had scrapped a $1 billion deal to buy television producer Dick Clark Productions last year. It has already sold several other overseas assets, including property developments in the UK and Australia and a stake in Spanish football team Atletico Madrid. Silver Lake does not have any other movie theater investments, but it owns talent agency WME IMG and was the lead investor in a $4 billion deal to buy mixed martial arts promoter UFC in 2016. AMC was partly owned by Apollo when it sold to Wanda for $2.6 billion in 2012."
