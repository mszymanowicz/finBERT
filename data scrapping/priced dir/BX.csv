27.58975937807223," Carlyle backs away from making offer for Signature Aviation (Reuters) - Carlyle Investment Management said on Thursday it would not make an offer for private jet services provider Signature Aviation, a day after the private equity firm’s unit bought the British firm’s engine repairs business. Signature Aviation earlier this month backed a joint offer from former Gatwick owner GIP, Blackstone Group Inc and Bill Gates’ investment vehicle Cascade valuing it at $4.73 billion. There has been interest from big buyout firms as the private jet industry is faring better than commercial airlines, with wealthy travellers avoiding crowded planes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Signature Aviation, which is one-fifth owned by Gates’ Cascade and provides full-service flight support and non-fuel services, said in January it got a takeover approach from Carlyle. Investors and analysts had kept an eye out to see if Carlyle or any other party made a higher offer for Signature, following a saga that culminated in rival bidders Blackstone, GIP and Cascade joining forces to buy the London-listed firm. Signature Aviation on Wednesday agreed to sell its engine repairs business to Carlyle-owned StandardAero for $230 million. Bloomberg News first reported on Wednesday that Carlyle was planning to bow out of the bidding after the StandardAero deal."
21.17861246727496," Bumble CEO's net worth nears $2 billion as stock rallies post debut (Reuters) - Bumble Inc Chief Executive Officer Whitney Wolfe Herd’s stake in the women-centric dating app operator was worth nearly $2 billion, as shares rallied for a second straight day after a blockbuster debut on Thursday. Bumble, backed by Blackstone Group Inc, was valued at $15.69 billion on Friday, with its stock price nearly doubling from the initial public offering price of $43 per share, underscoring investor’s insatiable appetite for tech shares in a buoyant U.S. equities market. Wolfe Herd owns 21.5 million shares in Bumble, equating to a 11.6% stake, regulatory filings showed. With the blockbuster IPO, Wolfe Herd, 31, became the youngest female CEO to ever take a company public as she rang the opening bell from Bumble’s Austin-based offices with her one-year-old son by her side. The women-first approach has set Bumble apart in a competitive online dating market, Wolfe Herd told Reuters on Thursday. Bumble users are more likely to pay for premium offerings to have a deeper level of connection or a different approach to connection, said Wolfe Herd, listing offering incognito mode as a popular feature for people to browse others’ profile while being anonymous. Wolfe Herd, who graduated with a degree in International Studies from the Southern Methodist University’s Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, launched the Bumble app in 2014. Wolfe Herd is also a co-founder of rival app Tinder, which she later sued, alleging that her co-founders subjected her to sexual harassment. Tinder parent Match Group Inc, which denied the allegations, paid about $1 million to settle the dispute. Bumble’s shares were up 13.5% in afternoon trade on Friday, after rising as much as 20.6% to $84.8 earlier in the session."

The company’s shares opened at $76 on the Nasdaq, well above its initial public offering (IPO) price of $43 per share. Austin, Texas-based Bumble operates two major apps, Bumble and Badoo, which touts over 40 million monthly active users worldwide.

This is a really phenomenal shift toward safety and engineering more accountable experiences,” said Wolfe Herd, who expects the trend to continue in a post-COVID 19 world. Bumble, unique among dating apps for its “women-first approach,” generates revenue mostly from premium subscriptions. The company reported $376.6 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2020, according to filings.

Wolfe Herd was named Bumble’s chief executive officer after the deal. Bumble also joins the ranks of Snowflake Inc, Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc, all of which had strong first-day pops when they debuted last year.

28.805910995316765," Blackstone invests in new hedge fund ApaH Capital, sources say BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group, the world’s largest hedge fund investor, is committing $150 million in start-up capital to a hedge fund run by a former senior executive at Lone Star Funds, two sources familiar with the matter said. Anand Balakrishna Madduri is launching ApaH Capital Management with roughly $200 million in assets, including the capital from Blackstone, one of the people said. Hong Kong-based ApaH will concentrate on public and private market investments across Asia, including in Australia, China, India and Japan. Madduri did not respond to requests for comment. Blackstone declined to comment. Madduri was a senior managing director at Lone Star Funds for five years and spent seven years at Och-Ziff Capital Management, where he rose to managing director. Blackstone, which invests $79 billion in hedge funds, is making the investment with cash from its $1.5 billion Strategic Alliance Fund III which backs new entrants into the hedge fund industry. Blackstone has seeded Palm Lane Capital, Tresidor Investment Management and Jones Road Capital Management among others from Fund III. Blackstone’s seeders take a 15% to 25% cut of the hedge fund’s business, people familiar with the terms said. Securing seed investments from Blackstone often helps new managers establish credentials and get up and running, while it allows Blackstone to get in on the ground floor with promising newcomers."
25.47200525378226," Signature Aviation dog fight ends as GIP bids with Blackstone and Cascade (Reuters) - A bidding war for Signature Aviation took a new twist on Friday as former Gatwick owner GIP joined forces with Blackstone and Bill Gates’ investment vehicle on an offer valuing the private jet services firm at $4.73 billion. Signature said it was recommending the new proposal and had withdrawn its support for a previous offer by GIP, which last month raised its bid to $5.50 per share. This topped a $5.17 joint offer last month by Blackstone and Signature’s top shareholder, Cascade. The latest offer of $5.62 per share could end a months-long takeover battle for London-listed Signature, which at one point attracted interest from private equity firm Carlyle. “We await with interest to see whether Carlyle or any other interested party make a higher offer,” Peel Hunt analysts said. The latest cash offer is to buy all of Signature’s shares other than the 19.01% owned by Cascade Investment and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. Signature’s shares were were down 2.7% at 413 pence by 0841 GMT, but still above the new 411 pence ($5.62) offer price. Interest from big buyout firms comes as the private jet industry is faring better than commercial airlines as wealthy travellers avoid crowded planes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Signature rejected an initial approach from New York-based GIP in December, saying the price was lower than the proposal outlined by Blackstone. The stock has jumped nearly 60% since Blackstone’s takeover interest was first disclosed in December, which Signature then said was its sixth such proposal.

37.82140547683255," Blackstone's earnings surge on strong asset sales NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets, said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter distributable earnings rose 60% year-on-year, driven by a surge in asset sales across its private equity and real estate business lines. Distributable earnings - cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - totaled $1.46 billion, up from $914 million a year earlier. This translated into distributable earnings per share of $1.13, outperforming analysts’ average estimate of 89 cents, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.Blackstone’s stock was up 3% at $66.78 in afternoon trading in New York on Wednesday. “They are entering 2021 with substantial momentum especially in insurance,” said JMP analyst Devin Ryan. “There may be market volatility in the near term and short-term risks to performance, but they’re well positioned to navigate it given that we just went to through a real life stress-test.”During the quarter, Blackstone completed the $14.6 billion sale of BioMed Realty Trust, America’s largest private owner of medical office buildings, and the divestment of its 36% shareholding in UK insurer and annuity provider Rothesay Life. A sharp rise in investment income helped Blackstone report net income of $748.9 million under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), up 55% from the previous year. Blackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 10.6% in the quarter, compared with an 11.7% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index over the same period. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 4.3% and 5.5%, respectively. On Tuesday, Blackstone agreed to acquire most of the life insurance business of U.S. insurer Allstate Corp for $2.8 billion. The deal is expected to increase Blackstone’s assets under management by $28 billion.Blackstone said it expects to do more deals with insurance firms given prevailing low interest rates. “What’s driving what you’re seeing us do and a number of firms in our industry is theextremely low level of interest rates out there, which is creating the need for greater returns for insurance company assets,” Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said in conference call with analysts on Wednesday.Blackstone’s total assets under management rose to $618.6 billion, from $584.4 billion in the previous quarter, driven by strong fundraising. It ended the quarter with $147.7 billion of unspent capital. Blackstone said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 96 cents per share."

Reuters was first to report on Sunday that special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp (WPF.N) was nearing a deal with Alight. read more Funding for the deal includes a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $1.55 billion. Alight's existing owners will retain a stake once it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ALIT"". Foley Trasimene's shares rose 9.4% in premarket trading. Based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Alight offers cloud-based benefits administration and human resources services to businesses, including 70% of the Fortune 100 companies, in 188 countries, according to its website. ""It is deeply embedded in health, wealth and payroll with all of these large companies,"" said Foley, who will become Alight's chairman. ""This is a company which is the kind of classic utility that I love to invest in."" Foley added he will advise Alight regarding its next growth phase, including boosting the percentage of its business done outside the United States from 10% today. Alight Chief Executive Stephan Scholl said the deal would help the company offer its integrated platform of employee benefits to more clients. With the pandemic causing severe economic dislocation, companies are being forced to cut costs as much as possible while also making benefits - especially around healthcare - easy to access. Outsourcing firms should benefit from this trend. The deal comes after Blackstone and peer CVC Capital Partners said last month they would merge Paysafe Group with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II (BFT.N) in a transaction that valued the payments processor at $9 billion. Alight was advised by a bank group led by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and law firm Kirkland and Ellis, while Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Weil, Gotshal & Manges provided financial and legal assistance respectively to Foley Trasimene.

The deal illustrates how Alight has become an attractive investment target during the COVID-19 pandemic, capitalizing on the outsourcing of human resources functions by many companies that are seeking cost savings to preserve capital. The transaction calls for Alight to merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp, and could be announced as soon as Monday, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Blackstone declined to comment, while Alight and Foley Trasimene did not respond to requests for comment. Buyout firms have traditionally cashed out on their investments by selling companies outright or taking them public. The potential deal for Alight underscores how Blackstone sees SPACs as a viable alternative. Based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Alight offers cloud-based benefits administration and human resources services to businesses, including 70% of the Fortune 100, serving 188 countries, according to its website. It was acquired by Blackstone in 2017 from insurance broker Aon Plc, in a deal that valued it at up to $4.8 billion. Blackstone pursued an $800 million initial public offering of Alight two years ago, but abandoned the effort amid concerns it would not fetch the terms it was seeking. Foley Trasimene raised $900 million in an IPO last May to merge with a private company. Like all SPACs, it did not tell investors in advance what that company would be. The deal will be the second involving Blackstone and a Foley SPAC in recent weeks. The private equity firm and its peer CVC Capital Partners announced last month they would merge Paysafe Group with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II in a transaction that valued the payments processor at $9 billion."

27.453640338658687," Dating app Bumble reveals steady revenue growth, losses in IPO filing (Reuters) - Dating app Bumble, which is backed by private equity firm Blackstone Group, on Friday made public its regulatory filing for an initial public offering, revealing steady revenue growth and higher operating costs that resulted in a loss. Bumble Inc’s plans to go public come at a time when companies are seeking to capitalize on what has been the strongest IPO market in two decades. Companies raised a record $168 billion through IPOs on U.S. stock exchanges in 2020, according to Dealogic data. Bumble also revealed it had identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting. “The deficiency we identified relates to a lack of defined processes and controls over information technology,” it said in the filing. Bumble said it was taking steps to rectify the issue, and will look to hire an external adviser and strengthen its compliance and accounting functions with new hires. The dating app, which has been immensely popular with millennials and competes with other apps such as Match Group’s Tinder, said it had 42 million monthly active users as of the third quarter of 2020, and 2.4 million paying users in the nine months ended September. For the period from Jan. 29 to Sept. 30, Bumble’s revenue came in at $376.6 million. It reported revenue of $362.6 million for the first nine months of 2019. During the January-September period last year, Bumble swung to a net loss of $84.1 million, while it reported a net profit of $68.6 million during the first nine months of 2019. Bumble filed for an IPO of up to $100 million, although that is a placeholder amount and is expected to change. The company confidentially filed its IPO paperwork with regulators late last year.

25.108674917286468," Blackstone hires co-head from university for hedge fund unit BOSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group, the world’s biggest hedge fund investor, is bringing in a former endowment chief at Brown University as the co-head of its Blackstone Alternative Asset Management (BAAM) unit. The company has hired Joe Dowling to join John McCormick who has run the $78 billion hedge fund unit since early 2018, the company confirmed on Monday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Blackstone’s hedge fund unit backs new hedge funds, invests alongside hedge funds, buys majority stakes in them and offers internally run hedge funds. All businesses have expanded since McCormick was promoted to head the unit. Performance, however, has been challenged. The hedge fund unit reported an 8.2% gain in 2019, according to internal Blackstone numbers and for 2020, the gain is said to be 5.5%, a person familiar with the numbers said. The average hedge fund gained 11.6% in 2020, according to Hedge Fund Research data.

22.677465097699937," Blackstone-backed Patria could reach $1.6 billion valuation in IPO - BTG SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian asset manager Patria Investments Ltd, which is backed by Blackstone Group Inc, is likely to reach a valuation of between $1 billion and $1.6 billion in its planned initial public offering on Nasdaq, Banco BTG Pactual SA said in a note to clients. Patria , which has $13 billion under management in private equity, real estate, credit and infrastructure funds, filed for an IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 30. The document does not disclose the offering size or potential sellers, but Patria said it plans to raise money to invest in its funds and expand its operations through buying asset managers, portfolios and distribution channels. BTG said the up to $1.6 billion valuation does not include proceeds raised in the offering and is based on Patria’s peers, such as Blackstone and Carlyle Group Inc. Patria, in which Blackstone acquired a 40% stake in 2010, posted revenues of $83.3 million and net income of $45.5 million in the first nine months of 2020. “We see plenty of room for investments to grow in Brazil, and with more money going toward independent players (ex-banks) like Patria, there are strong tailwinds for alternative investments to grow as well,” BTG said. J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Credit Suisse will manage the offering.

13.720513780976987," Exclusive: Blackstone in talks to merge Alight with blank-check acquisition firm NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc is in talks to merge U.S. benefits services provider Alight Solutions LLC with a blank-check acquisition firm backed by veteran investor Bill Foley, according to people familiar with the matter. The merger with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp would result in Alight becoming a publicly-listed company at a valuation of more than $8 billion, including debt, the sources said. The deal talks come more than a year after Blackstone canceled an initial public offering (IPO) of Alight as it was about to raise up to $800 million, amid concerns that it would not fetch the terms it was seeking. A deal with Foley’s blank-check acquisition firm would underscore the growing popularity of these vehicles as an alternative route to the stock market. The sources cautioned that the negotiations may not lead to a deal and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Blackstone and Alight declined to comment, while a Foley spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Foley Trasimene is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which raised $900 million in an IPO in May to merge with a private company, without telling investors in advance what that company would be. Buyout firms have traditionally cashed out on their investments by selling companies outright or taking them public. The potential deal for Alight highlights how Blackstone sees SPACs as a viable alternative. Earlier this month, Blackstone and another private equity firm, CVC Capital Partners, agreed to merge payments platform Paysafe Group Holdings Ltd with another Foley-backed SPAC, Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II, in a deal worth $9 billion, including debt. Based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Alight offers cloud-based benefits administration and human resources services to 30 million people in 188 countries, according to its website. It was acquired by Blackstone in 2017 from insurance broker Aon Plc, in a deal that valued it at up to $4.8 billion."

Private equity firm Blackstone is betting that plutocrats will be back in the air before the rest of us. Shares in London-listed Signature Aviation – which provides fuelling and ground services to private jets and charter flights – jumped by 40% on Thursday after it revealed Steve Schwarzman’s firm made a $4.3 billion cash takeover offer. A proposal from a rival investment fund, Global Infrastructure Partners, was rejected. The bid, a respectable 17% premium to Signature’s pre-Covid high in January, looks like a risky punt on a sector shellacked by Covid. The company made a $30 million pre-tax loss in the first half of 2020 whilst net debt of $2.2 billion equals a turbulent 5 times estimated 2021 EBITDA, according to Refinitiv data. Still, a core market of peripatetic executives criss-crossing the United States appears to have already achieved relative lift-off: its U.S. flight activity was down by around one-fifth year-on-year in October, compared to what IATA reckons was a 61% drop in domestic U.S. air travel more generally. (By Christopher Thompson) TAXING TIMES. Kering faces a fresh battle with the taxman. The luxury giant confirmed on Thursday that French prosecutors are investigating it for tax matters, but denied wrongdoing. A similar spat in Italy over transfer pricing at its top brand Gucci led to a 1.25 billion euro settlement last year. Swiss subsidiary LGI, at the centre of that probe, also offered services to Kering’s French brands, before overhauling the whole system in 2017. It’s not clear whether French authorities will take the same approach as their counterparts across the Alps. But Gucci’s tax bill was 60% of its 2.1 billion euro recurrent operating income in 2017. A similar hit for its French brands Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, which had combined operating income of 500 million euros that year according to Breakingviews estimates, would only imply a hit of a few hundred million euros. With Kering projected to report 3 billion euros of net income next year, Gucci boss François-Henri Pinault would be able to afford it. (By Lisa Jucca) MAGICALLY DELICIOUS. General Mills is on a lucky streak with more pet owners and bakers staying indoors. The Lucky Charms cereal maker’s fiscal second-quarter net revenue rose 7% to $4.7 billion as sales of dog food and baking stuff surged at double-digit rates. With Covid-19 cases still rising, the Minneapolis-based company expects those trends to stick around for another quarter or so. Moreover, earnings increased 19% in part because it charged more for premium products, like Blue Buffalo dog chow, offsetting higher advertising spending. Chief Executive Jeff Harmening said the brand, which General Mills bought two years ago, shows its deals “can add value.” Perhaps further acquisitions will be on the Cheerios maker’s 2021 resolutions list. (By Amanda Gomez) HEART IN THE DESERT. Israel and the United Arab Emirates have found a use for Finablr. A year ago the London-listed payments company was worth 1.3 billion pounds ($1.8 billion), but since then the Travelex operator has been hit by an accounting scandal involving $1 billion of undisclosed debt and its shares have been suspended. On Thursday Abu Dhabi’s state-backed Royal Strategic Partners and Prism Advance Solutions, whose non-executive chairman is former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, struck a deal to buy Finablr for a nominal fee of $1. The joint bidder will provide working capital to maintain the business operation, and will fork out a price of $190 million if the company succeeds in recovering the missing funds. For Abu Dhabi, it’s a way to save 3,000 jobs at Finablr unit UAE Exchange, which helps foreign workers send money home. For both parties, it cements the “normalization agreement” Tel Aviv signed with Abu Dhabi back in August. With $4 billion in expected annual trade between the two, that may make sense.

Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for Covid-19, the French presidency announced on Thursday, offering a potent reminder that even as vaccines are rolled out, the virus is still virulent and has no political allegiance. The centrist politician joins other leaders as diverse as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson among those to contract the disease. Those leaders recovered, which bodes well for the relatively healthy and youthful Macron. Yet his condition could still have consequences. It comes just as the European Union is trying to finalise a trade deal with Britain. Though the European Commission is leading the talks, an active Macron may be needed to approve any last-minute compromise. Meanwhile, France’s infection rate has been falling in recent weeks, allowing the country to slowly emerge from its latest lockdown.

That’s the bullish message from WPP, which reckons it can resume share buybacks next year, pay a progressive dividend and ramp up spending by up to 500 million pounds per year to win new clients. Most importantly, the world’s biggest ad agency is aiming to get net sales back to 2019 levels by 2022, one year ahead of the previous schedule. Chief Executive Mark Read’s plans to juice up the company’s margin caught the most attention. He intends to deliver an operating margin between 15.5% and 16% in 2023, a steep jump from the 11% analysts expect this year, according to Refinitiv. That could be delivered by 600 million pounds of cost savings and working with clients like L’Oreal and Ford Motor to move their marketing and sales online. Since companies slash advertising budgets when the going gets tough, WPP’s success rests on a wider economic recovery. (By Aimee Donnellan) ISLAND PARADISE. New Zealand is roaring back to business. After successfully containing Covid-19 cases, the country’s economy grew a record 14% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to September, beating the central bank’s own November forecast. Even more impressive, output actually expanded slightly compared to last year, pointing to a rebound back to pre-pandemic levels. It’s “as close as you can get to a true V-shaped recovery”, Kiwibank Chief Economist Jarrod Kerr marvelled. Strong domestic consumption – likely pent-up demand from strict lockdown measures earlier this year – seems to have offset the toll of closed borders and lost tourism. Fiscal and monetary stimulus also played a role, though house prices now risk overheating. Barring another outbreak, the momentum can be sustained by mass vaccine rollouts and a potential travel bubble with Australia next year. (By Robyn Mak) PLUS ÇA CHANGE.

20.356788569573844," Soilbuild Group chairman, Blackstone to privatise business REIT in $525 million deal (Reuters) - Soilbuild Group’s executive chairman will team up with Blackstone Group to take its listed unit Soilbuild Business Space REIT private in a S$700.3 million ($524.49 million) deal, the real estate company said on Monday. Soilbuild Group Executive Chairman Lim Chap Huat and Blackstone are offering S$0.55 per share in cash to take the Singapore-focused company private to help it weather challenging market conditions and an uncertain global economic recovery from the coronavirus fallout. “Given the various challenges and constraints faced by SB REIT ... we believe this proposal by Blackstone presents the best option for minority Soilbuild unitholders based on the offers received,” Huat said in a statement. As of Dec. 14, Huat and his family collectively own about 30.3% in the real estate firm. Soilbuild REIT, which was listed on the Singapore exchange in 2013, holds about 13 properties ranging from business parks to industrial complexes - largely in Singapore. The company saw a drop in its local portfolio value at the end of the third quarter due to the impact of the outbreak. The buyout offer of S$0.55 represents a 7.8% premium to the REIT’s last close on Dec. 8, when shares last traded before a halt.

10.448085931483474," Breakingviews - Blackstone’s SPAC foray puts price on convenience NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Blackstone isn’t known for leaving money on the table. But in merging Paysafe, a payments company it co-owns with fellow buyout group CVC, with a listed cash shell, Steve Schwarzman’s firm has shown there’s a price for convenience. In this case, it’s around $1.2 billion. Three years after they bought the digital payments firm, Blackstone and CVC are cutting their stake in Paysafe by just over half and merging it with a special-purpose acquisition company backed by financial mogul Bill Foley. Factoring in a 20% increase in the value of the SPAC’s shares on Monday, Blackstone and CVC will take out $2.3 billion of cash and hold on to just under $4 billion of stock, worth a total of $6.3 billion. On paper, that means the buyout firms are taking a haircut. Based on the SPAC’s share price on Monday after the deal was announced, investors think Paysafe’s enterprise value is around $10.4 billion. Deduct the $2.9 billion of net debt it has today – in other words, before doing the SPAC deal – and the theoretical value of the private owners’ stock is more like $7.5 billion. It’s as if they’ve given up $1.2 billion, a little more than 15% of their value, to list the shares, extract cash and bring payments expert Foley on board. While that sounds like a lot, it’s pretty attractive for a buyout firm like Blackstone. In a traditional initial public offering, shareholders would expect the owners to sell shares cheaply enough that the stock can rise on the first day. There would be fees to pay to bankers, perhaps $250 million on a deal of this size. Most importantly, it would be hard to raise a substantial amount of new money and sell lots of shares without sending a negative signal to new buyers, which might punish the valuation. There are likely to be more where this came from. Paysafe is not Blackstone’s first sale of a company through a SPAC. And many private equity owners have one eye on speedy exits, since U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to increase the taxes they pay on investment gains. The convenience afforded by SPACs comes at a price, but it’s one buyout firms will be happy enough to pay."

18.846209784605353," Breakingviews - Blackstone suited to be Crown buyer of last resort HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Crown Resorts saga could end with a deal after all. Regulators have suspended the Australian casino operator’s gaming licence for its new luxury Sydney complex. As the company and billionaire James Packer consider their options, private equity firm Blackstone looks well-suited to be a buyer. Delaying the December opening of the $1.6 billion waterfront property raises the spectre of authorities withholding the licence altogether. The company is trying to appease them, by shaking up its board, pay practices and corporate culture. It also vowed to stop working with unregulated junkets that bring high rollers from China. A year-long inquiry into compliance and governance took a disturbing turn last week, however. Local gaming officials were clearly rattled after seeing fresh evidence of lapses in Crown’s anti-money laundering protocols. Moody’s downgraded its credit rating on Friday. That intensifies the pressure on $4.6 billion Crown. Finding a new owner might be the best solution, even if it forces Packer to sell the last piece of his family’s empire with the shares down by a quarter over the last year. He has considered cashing out before. Talks with Wynn Resorts fell apart in 2019. And the billionaire agreed to offload a big slug of his stake to former joint venture partner Melco Resorts & Entertainment, before the arrangement unravelled just as the inquiry began. Blackstone bought a 10% stake in April and has a track record that suggests it could want more. It is no stranger to the gambling industry and knows how to wheel and deal in real estate. It arranged a leaseback arrangement for the Bellagio in Las Vegas which farmed out management, and risk, to MGM Resorts International while it collected steady rent revenue. Blackstone also sold pieces of Hilton Worldwide during its ownership and profitably broke up Sam Zell’s Equity Office Properties after paying $39 billion for it in 2007. Its lodging nous also might help reposition Crown as it faces the prospect of fewer Chinese VIPs. When they went missing amid President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown, the company’s bottom line shrank considerably in 2015. There will undoubtedly be other possibilities for Crown and Packer, but a Blackstone future may be in the cards."

Among the heavy hitters rounded up by Ackman for his Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd investment vehicle, according to the filings, are mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group Inc, investment firm Guggenheim Partners, hedge fund Baupost Group, Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers and private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc. Tontine raised $4 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) in July. It is the largest-ever special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and will use the IPO proceeds, as well as debt and new equity it can raise, to acquire a minority stake in a company valued at tens of billions of dollars. As is typical with SPACs, Tontine has not told its investors what specific company or type of company will be acquired. As possible targets, Ackman is eyeing family-owned businesses, public companies that want to spin off big divisions and “mature unicorns,” developed and privately financed companies worth more than $1 billion, a person familiar with the process said. This is where deep-pocketed SPAC shareholders come in handy. Were Ackman to seek an investment that exceeded his SPAC’s resources, the investors could boost its firepower by providing additional equity financing. Ackman’s hedge fund has also committed to investing between $1 billion and $3 billion to any deal. Tontine’s IPO was heavily oversubscribed, allowing Ackman to hand-pick the investors and what stakes to allocate to them, according to people familiar with the process, who requested anonymity. Tontine brings a “curated list of shareholders who are expected to be invested for many years,” Ackman told bankers working on the SPAC, according to one of the sources. A spokesman for Ackman declined to comment. Tontine is the highest-profile SPAC in a year in which blank-check companies raised $65.7 billion to date, smashing the previous record of $13.6 billion, according to SPAC Research. Lucrative SPAC deals, such as those for electric truck maker Nikola Corp, space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and fantasy sports and gambling company DraftKings Inc, prompted many others to follow suit. Many institutional investors have stayed away from SPACs, however, concerned that they pose too high a risk. Blue-chip investors’ endorsement of Tontine indicates Wall Street is confident of Ackman’s ability to find a successful deal. Guggenheim Partners owns 22 million Tontine shares worth roughly $507 million, while Seth Klarman’s Baupost owns 17.5 million shares or roughly $400 million, the filings show. Ontario Teachers owns a stake worth $257 million while the T. Rowe Price stake is valued at $174 million. Hedge funds Soroban Capital, Millennium Management, Fir Tree Capital Management, Citadel Advisors, Mason Capital Management, Moore Capital Management and Scoggin Management also have stakes in Tontine, according to the filings. Most Tontine investors are based in North America, but the SPAC also counts sovereign wealth funds in Asia, the Middle East and Europe as shareholders, sources familiar with the matter said. While many SPACs give their managers so-called founder shares that can result in them owning 20% of the merged company, Ackman opted out of that compensation structure. He is also set to receive warrants that require him to invest more money to own less of the target company than managers of other SPACs. Tontine shareholders also receive warrants, but unlike with other SPACs they forfeit two-thirds of their value if they cash out when a merger is announced. Ackman did this to discourage investors with a short-term horizon from participating in Tontine’s IPO. Tontine is not Ackman’s first SPAC. He co-sponsored Justice Holdings in 2011, which raised $1.5 billion and merged with Burger King Worldwide a year later. The company is now called Restaurant Brands International, and remains one of Ackman’s biggest investments. Ackman is best known for his big wins as an activist shareholder in railroad operator Canadian Pacific and Botox maker Allergan, though he also suffered deep losses at pharmaceutical company Valeant and nutritional supplements manufacturer Herbalife. Since his $12.5 billion firm’s launch in 2004, Ackman has returned an average 16% annually, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 9.3% gain. This year, his Pershing Square Holdings fund is up 55%."
34.5918066903697," Blackstone third-quarter earnings up on strong asset sales NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP said on Wednesday its third-quarter distributable earnings rose 9% year-on-year, as the world’s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate took advantage of a rise in corporate valuations to cash out on some of its leverage buyout investments. Distributable earnings - cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - totaled $772 million, up from $710 million a year earlier. This translated into distributable earnings per share of 63 cents, surpassing analysts’ average estimate of 57 cents, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Blackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 12.2% in the quarter, compared with an 8.5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index over the same period. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 6.4% and 3.5% respectively. Blackstone’s shares were down 2.9% in afternoon trading, in line with the broader market. Blackstone completed the $7 billion sale of Cheniere Energy Partners to Brookfield Asset Management and Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in the quarter, as well as the $625 million initial public offering of India’s second real estate investment trust (REIT), Mindspace Business Parks. “The record fee-related earnings and management fees is what investors focus on and kind of renewed momentum in deployments and realization shows the defensibility of the portfolio through this pandemic,” said Jefferies analyst Gerald O’Hara. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Blackstone reported net income of $794.7 million as growth in investment income was partly offset by compensation expenses. Total assets under management rose to $584.4 billion as of the end of September from $564.3 billion in the previous quarter, driven by strong fundraising. Blackstone had $152.4 billion of unspent capital as of the end of September. Asked by analysts about the impact of a possible Democratic victory in the Nov. 3 U.S. election, Blackstone executives said they took account of likely future higher tax rates when the firm converted to a corporation last year. They said they expected any new tax changes to result in only a low-single digit reduction in earnings. Blackstone said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 54 cents per share."

23.989051179707," Blackstone to buy Simply Self Storage from Canada's Brookfield for $1.2 billion (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N said on Monday that it had agreed to buy Simply Self Storage from Canada's Brookfield Asset Management Inc BAMa.TO for about $1.2 billion. Brookfield acquired Simply Self Storage for $830 million in 2016 and the company has a portfolio of 8 million square feet of self-storage facilities. Blackstone said Simply Self Storage is one of the top five private owners of self-storage in the United States, and the deal would make its real-estate investment trust, BREIT, the third biggest non-listed owner of such facilities. “Self-storage is a resilient sector through economic cycles because of low tenant turnover, minimal maintenance costs and stable cash flows,” BREIT Chief Executive Officer Frank Cohen said. The deal is expected to close before the end of 2020. BREIT was launched in 2017 and has a net asset value of $19 billion."
23.989051179707," Blackstone to buy Simply Self Storage from Canada's Brookfield for $1.2 bln Oct 25 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc has reached an agreement to buy Simply Self Storage from Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc for about $1.2 billion, a spokeswoman for the asset manager said late on Sunday. Blackstone’s non-traded real-estate investment trust, known as BREIT, is acquiring the 8 million-square-foot portfolio of self-storage facilities, the spokeswoman said, confirming an earlier report from the Wall Street Journal. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Brookfield was exploring a sale of the real estate company. The Canadian company acquired Simply Self Storage for $830 million in 2016 when it had 90 locations. The self-storage facilities provider now operates more than 120 locations across 23 U.S. states, including Texas, Florida, New York and California, according to its website. BREIT, which was launched in 2017 and has a net asset value of $19 billion, plans to continue to buy smaller assets in the fragmented industry and run them under the Simply brand, Tyler Henritze, head of acquisitions in the Americas for Blackstone’s real-estate group, was quoted as saying by the Journal earlier on Sunday. Self storage has remained resilient through economic cycles, evident more so during the COVID-19 pandemic as people no longer tied to office locations have moved out of cities or gone to stay with relatives, Henritze said."

17.20522618092456," Blackstone offers sweetener as tries to sell $1.2 billion of Spanish properties (This October 6 story corrects date of Santander buying Banco Popular to 2017 from 2016; removes name of spokesman) MADRID (Reuters) - Investment giant Blackstone BX.N is offering a sweetener to buyers as it tries to speed up the sale of 8,400 properties in Spain in the teeth of the country's deepest recession on record. Two Blackstone units, Aliseda and Anticipa, said on Tuesday they would reimburse buyers up to one tenth of the sale price if their property dropped more than a tenth in value in the three months after a deal is sealed. “We detected the current context was generating uncertainty for buyers, and wanted to provide them with security and send a message of confidence in the Spanish real estate market,” said an Aliseda spokesman. Blackstone bought the real estate portfolio, known as “Quasar”, in August 2017 from Santander, Spain’s biggest lender, which had acquired Quasar following the collapse of its previous owner Banco Popular earlier that year. Aliseda took control of the portfolio and placed it on sale in 2018, but many properties remain on the market as the COVID-19 pandemic plunges Spain into a deep recession. The portfolio being advertised is valued at 1.035 billion euros ($1.22 billion), with 640 million being handled by Aliseda, which is selling 5,700 properties. Hola Pisos - Anticipa’s commercial outfit - is selling 2,700 properties, valued at 395 million. To decide whether a buyer qualifies for the 10% reimbursement, Blackstone will consult the price index compiled by Spain’s infrastructure ministry for each province. Aliseda’s spokesman said the offer did not imply a prediction prices would fall in coming months, and that his company did not make forecasts. There are, however, signs that Spain’s economic paralysis has hurt real estate. The presence of funds as major property owners in Spain is politically controversial, with the current administration decreeing in March a four-month moratorium on rent for tenants whose landlords owned eight or more properties.

25.122442448443373," Blackstone sells 36% stake in UK insurer Rothesay Life LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone BX.N has sold its 36% shareholding in Rothesay Life to existing shareholders Singapore fund GIC and U.S. insurer MassMutual, the UK insurer and annuity provider said on Wednesday. The stake sale, which values Rothesay Life at 5.75 billion pounds ($7.37 billion), sees GIC and MassMutual each take on a 49% stake in the company, Rothesay Life said. The three firms have been shareholders in Rothesay Life, which insures defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes, since 2013. This so-called bulk annuity market has been growing in Britain in recent years as companies look to offload the risk of operating such schemes, which pay a fixed income to retired staff for life. Since the three firms’ initial investment, Rothesay’s assets under management have grown to 56 billion pounds from 7.5 billion, the insurer said. Addy Loudiadis, CEO of Rothesay Life, said the deal “provides the business with exceptional long-term support from two of the world’s leading institutional investors”. Qasim Abbas, senior managing director at Blackstone, said the growth of the Rothesay business since Blackstone’s initial investment had been “outstanding”, adding that MassMutual and GIC were “the natural long-term holders for Rothesay”."

KSU is recovering from what it has called a “horrible” drop in revenues driven by lower cargo volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It responded by slashing operating expenses and briefly halting share buybacks. Details of the bid from the private equity firms could not be learned. KSU is pushing for a higher offer, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. Kansas City Southern, which has a market capital over $17 billion, was not immediately available for comment. Blackstone and GIP declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer on Wednesday. KSU shares ended trading in New York up 5.1% at $193.78. KSU is the smallest among so-called Class I railways in the United States that account for a significant share of freight traffic. It operates in the central and south central United States and Mexico, and owns a 50% stake in the Panama Canal Railway Company. While the private equity bid could spur takeover interest in KSU among its larger peers, regulators would heavily scrutinze such a combination. The buyout firms, on the other hand, do not face any antitrust hurdles. In the second quarter, KSU posted a better than expected profit, helped by a 27% decline in operating expenses, even as its revenue fell 23%. Were Blackstone and GIP to succeed in their bid for KSU, it would be the latest private equity deal in the sector. In December, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP BIP.N and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC took over short line and regional freight railroad operator Genesee & Wyoming Inc for $8.4 billion, including debt."

13.539281813241752," Blackstone-backed Patria raises $2 billion Latam infrastructure fund SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian private equity firm Patria Investimentos has raised a 10 billion-real ($2 billion) fund to invest in infrastructure in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America, it said on Monday, adding that logistics, energy and telecoms would be key targets. The infrastructure fund, Patria’s fourth, was almost double the size of its previous such fund five years ago and underscored the opportunities investors see, especially in Latin America’s largest economy. Patria is 40% owned by U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N. The Brazilian government estimates the country needs 600 billion reais in new investments to expand and universalize water and sewage services that remain limited in many areas. “Despite the coronavirus pandemic, we saw that many investors understood how many opportunities there are in infrastructure in the region,” Patria’s founder and partner Otavio Castello Branco said in an interview. A steady drop in Brazil’s benchmark interest rates, which have now reached a record low of 2%, has fueled a quest for higher-return alternatives to government bonds. Domestic investors accounted for 25% of the fund, setting a record among Patria-raised funds. Although the fundraising was concluded only this week, Patria has already destined 40% of its proceeds for three assets: Brazilian solar and wind energy firm Essentia, highway operator Eixo-SP and a still unnamed cellular tower company. Felipe Pinto, another Patria partner, said the fund may invest in these sectors further while also looking for assets in gas power generation, sanitation and telecoms assets beyond towers. The executive said that although Patria had wanted to invest in the water and sanitation sector in the past, the lack of robust regulations governing the sector gave it pause. That changed in June with congressional approval of a new sanitation law. Nearly 80% of the fund’s proceeds are likely to be invested in Brazil, although Colombia and Chile may provide other targets, Pinto said. The fund’s investment phase is expected to be concluded by 2021, while it may take up to 12 years to sell off the assets. (In this story, Patria corrects the amount in dollars to $2 billion, not $1.8 billion, to reflect closing date)"

Japan’s largest pharmaceuticals company has been selling its over-the-counter (OTC) assets worldwide as it seeks to refocus its business and reduce debt following a $59 billion acquisition of Shire Plc last year. Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said via an online briefing the company had decided to sell the Japanese OTC unit because it would be difficult for Takeda to keep investing in OTC businesses while trying to develop new drugs for more serious diseases. “My responsibility is to make sure that we don’t destroy value (for OTC businesses) but create value, and to create value we need to grow businesses and it’s not good to keep business and not invest sufficiently into that,” said Weber. Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company, known for its Alinamin line of energy drinks, is valued at 242 billion yen ($2.29 billion) and the sale price will be determined after calculating its debt and other factors, Takeda said. Blackstone was among the final bidders for the OTC unit, Reuters reported in June, along with Bain Capital, CVC Capital Partners and Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings Co Ltd. Takeda said proceeds from the sale would boost its net profit by 105 billion yen. The transaction is expected close by March 31, subject to regulatory closing conditions, it said.

-2.925146897351315," Blackstone second quarter distributable earnings drop as asset sales slow (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest alternative asset manager, said on Thursday its distributable earnings fell 23% year-on-year in the second quarter, as the coronavirus outbreak made it more difficult to divest assets. Blackstone said distributable earnings, which includes cash it generates by selling assets, fell to $548 million from $709 million a year earlier. This translated into distributable earnings per share of 43 cents, matching analysts’ estimate, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Distributable earnings is a metric that Blackstone and other private equity firms focus on to describe their business. Using generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone reported an 86% rise in net income to $568.3 million, as a rally in the markets in the second quarter, driven by central bank intervention and government stimulus, boosted the value of its assets. The buyout firm said its private equity portfolio grew 12.8% in the second quarter, compared with a 20% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index over the same period. “It was a strong quarter for our firm despite the continued market volatility. We are very well positioned to navigate the road ahead with our long-term committed capital model and an industry-record $156 billion of dry powder,” Blackstone Chief Executive Steve Schwarzman said in a statement, referring to unspent capital. Total assets under management, which include real estate, private equity corporate credit and investments in hedge funds, rose to $564.3 billion from $538 billion reported in March, supported by strong fundraising. Many of these assets generated management fees that boosted Blackstone’s fee-related earnings by 28% year-on-year to $541 million. Revenue from performance fees that rely on asset sales, on the other hand, dropped 70% to $102 million. “Performance fees missed what the street expected, but that’s understandable given the current environment,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys. “This was partly offset by their beat on fee-related earnings driven by better management fees and lower compensation expenses.” In June, the U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance allowing private equity funds to be offered as an investment option to defined contribution retirement plans, including 401 (k) plans. Blackstone said it expects to gain a significant share of the capital that will flow into the 401 (k) industry. “We think this decision by the DOL was a step in the right direction for sure,” Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said in an analyst earnings call on Thursday. “And the size, it could be in the multiple hundred billions dollars for the industry in terms of additional assets.” Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of 37 cents per share."

The New York-based asset manager has launched its GSO Capital Opportunities Fund IV (Fund IV), which is looking to surpass the US$6.5bn raised by its predecessor (Fund III), the pension fund notes show. Fund IV will invest US$100m to US$450m in mezzanine debt for North American and Western European businesses that have enterprise values between US$500m and US$5bn. The Fund IV portfolio will consist of between 30 to 40 investments with a hold period of three to five years. Fund III posted a 6% net internal rate of return and a 1.1 times multiple on invested capital, according to Blackstone’s first quarter earnings results. A GSO spokesperson declined to comment. GSO raised its debut US$2bn mezzanine fund, which began investing in July 2007, Blackstone’s results show, at the cusp of the global financial crisis. Since then the market for direct lending has evolved significantly, said Steve Nesbitt, chief executive officer of investment advisory firm Cliffwater. “The mezzanine market has evolved since the global financial crisis as direct lending, particularly unitranche (loans), has become a popular financing tool for private equity as an alternative to mezzanine financing,” he said. “(Now) could be an attractive time to invest (in mezzanine debt), but investors also need to be cautious about being deeper in the capital structure during a time period where the length and severity of this recession is unknown.” According to the most recent data available from financial data firm Preqin, global mezzanine debt funds collected US$1.6bn in the first three months of the year. Of the total amount of investor capital currently being sought by all private credit funds monitored, 18% of it would go to mezzanine debt funds. If GSO meets or surpasses US$7.5bn, it would be one of the largest private debt funds raised, according to Refinitiv LPC data. In recent years, a slew of global private debt firms have gained market share. Fourteen percent of the funds in the market are seeking more than US$1bn but targeting 49% of the aggregate capital across all private debt strategies, which include direct lending, special situations and distressed debt. With US$121bn in assets under management, GSO invests in leveraged loans, high yield bonds, mezzanine debt and direct lending opportunities, among others. (Reporting by Andrew Hedlund.

-10.014789417682705," Blackstone adds Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat to its board (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N said on Thursday Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O finance chief, Ruth Porat, will join the private equity firm's board of directors. Porat would be the third female member on Blackstone’s board, along with former senator Kelly Ayotte and Rochelle Lazarus, former chief executive officer of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. Porat, who joined Google in 2015 as chief financial officer (CFO) after leaving the same position at Morgan Stanley MS.N, has also been CFO at Alphabet since it was created in October 2015. “She possesses a deep understanding of the financial services industry from her years on Wall Street and has had a front row seat in Silicon Valley to the technological revolution that is sweeping the world,” Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Stephen Schwarzman said. Porat led many milestone transactions at Morgan Stanley, including Blackstone’s initial public offering in 2007. During the 2008 financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley teams advising the U.S. Treasury on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank on American International Group Inc AIG.N."

-10.069329844402594," Exclusive: Blackstone, Taisho Pharma among final bidders for Takeda's Japan OTC unit - sources TOKYO (Reuters) - Blackstone, Bain Capital and Taisho Pharmaceutical are among the final bidders for Takeda Pharmaceutical's 4502.T consumer drug business in Japan, a deal that could be worth up to 400 billion yen ($3.7 billion), three people familiar with the deal said. Japan's Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings Co Ltd 4581.T is the front runner for the deal, all three people said. CVC Capital Partners is also among the final bidders, they said. The sale of Takeda Consumer Healthcare Co, known for its Alinamin line of energy drinks, is part of Takeda’s efforts to shed $10 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt following its $59 billion purchase of Shire Plc. That deal amount might fall to around 340 billion yen because Blackstone Group BX.N and the private equity firms consider the price too high, said two of those people. Taisho could go as high as 400 billion yen, they said. Blackstone, Takeda, Taisho and Bain declined to comment. CVC was not immediately available for comment. The price Takeda is seeking for the over-the-counter business is about 20 times EBITDA, or earnings before taxes depreciation and amortisation, said the three people. The company will close the third, and likely final, bid on Monday, they said. The sources declined to be identified because the bidding process is private. Shortly before the Shire deal closed in 2019, Takeda Chief Executive Christophe Weber said it was unlikely the drugmaker would offload its over-the-counter (OTC) business. But as major divestitures slowed, reaching $7.7 billion through May, the company has focused on ridding itself of non-prescription drug products, with Weber saying “we are not an OTC company.” The Japan OTC deal is separate from the deals Takeda has struck for two other OTC units. On June 11, Takeda said it would sell OTC assets in the Asia Pacific region to South Korea's Celltrion 068270.KS for $278 million. In April, it said it would offload European OTC and prescription products to Denmark-based Orifarm Group for about $670 million. “We view the Japan consumer healthcare business in the same light as Takeda’s ongoing divestiture of global OTC assets,” said Morningstar analyst Jay Lee. “It works towards the company’s goal of paying down debt and also allows management to focus on Takeda’s core business areas.”"

-13.391988319516143," Breakingviews - Corona Capital: U.S. recession, Grubhub, Airlines NEW YORK/DALLAS/LONDON/MILAN/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights. - U.S. recession data - Grubhub’s bidders - Airline optimism RECESSION COMPRESSION. The U.S. economy ended its longest expansion on record in February and went into recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research on Monday. The peak came 128 months after the post-financial crisis recovery began in the middle of President Barack Obama’s first year in office. The committee that referees such things noted that because of the very sharp dropoff in economic activity in March, the peak quarter for the U.S. economy was the last period of 2019. The date mismatch is one more challenge to traditional data norms created by the coronavirus pandemic. Typically the peak month and quarter are the same or at least adjacent. The NBER also designated this a recession unusually quickly. That reflects the breadth and depth of the downturn, but it’s also a nod to the possibility that it could be over quickly. Six months is the shortest to date. Maybe that’s yet another record that will fall to the pandemic. (By Richard Beales) SHOTGUN. Grubhub is trying to take the wheel from Uber Technologies. Rivals Just Eat Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero are also interested in buying the U.S.-based food delivery service, according to CNBC on Friday. Those deals make less sense – unless they were used to force Uber’s hand. The ride-hailing service and Grubhub are haggling over the exchange ratio for an all-stock deal and the reverse break fee. Because of overlap, watchdogs will likely take a critical view. But market similarities are also crucial: UBS reckons a merger could result in more than $500 million in cost savings. Meanwhile European competitors would have a lower bar for regulatory clearance, but, consequently, meager benefits from a deal. They could overpay, but a transaction ultimately is less likely. So Grubhub is best sticking to its other power play. Covid-19 has boosted business as delivery has come in high demand. That’s not the case for $65 billion Uber, which is suffering from a dearth of riders. (By Jennifer Saba) DIFFICULT TAKEOFF. Wanderlust is returning, fitfully. Almost one-fifth of respondents in a UBS survey say they are ready to travel, over twice as many as two months earlier. And over 440,000 people passed through security on June 7, according to the Transportation Security Administration, more than quadruple the average in early April. It is a start, but there is a long way to go. Airport traffic is still 80% lower than a year ago. American Airlines is preparing severance packages for high-level employees for when the terms of a recent government bailout expire, according to CNBC. Delta Air Lines said last week it will stop serving 11 cities. Stock prices of major U.S. carriers are above their mid-March levels. But that says more about government support than imminent recovery. Over 40% of UBS respondents still don’t plan to travel for six months or more. That suggests a long summer of empty seats and dwindling cash piles. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin) FLOWERS FOR BLACKSTONE. Steve Schwarzman’s buyout group in February struck a deal to buy Dutch bank NIBC for 1.3 billion euros. It has been clear for a while that the pre-pandemic price would have to be renegotiated. But Blackstone seems to have turned adversity into opportunity, knocking one-fifth off the price according to a statement on Monday. Though it’s risky to take a bank private at the start of a downturn, Schwarzman’s dealmakers have a margin of safety. At 7 euros a share, Blackstone is paying investors like J.C. Flowers – which first bought into the bank in 2005 – two-thirds of 2020 tangible book value, using ABN Amro forecasts. That’s roughly where the top 20 European banks trade, before any takeout premium. Moreover, Citigroup analysts are forecasting an 8.5% return on equity for NIBC next year – higher than many other banks. Crisis dealmaking, when sellers have few other alternatives, has its advantages. (By Liam Proud) TOUGH JOB. Economists are bad at predicting the future – now understanding the present may be tough too. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report on Friday showed a shocking decline in the unemployment rate to around 13%. But as the bureau conceded, the rate would have been roughly 3 percentage points higher if workers classified as employed but not currently working for “other reasons,” above normal May levels, had been labeled as unemployed. So does this change the story? Not really, because the same caveat applied in April: The 15% rate for that month would have increased by almost 5 percentage points. The numbers are slippery but the direction still holds. Monthly economic reports don’t normally deal with such dramatic change, definitional uncertainty or distortion from massive government stimulus. The result, though, is that odd data points can easily appear to contradict other statistics. Financial pundits can still try to find trends – but with a big dose of humility. (By Anna Szymanski) PUBLI-CAN’T. The British government’s plan to reopen pubs and restaurants on June 22 lifted stocks in chain Mitchells & Butlers by more than 15% while Marston’s, which also has breweries, rose 12%. Allowing establishments with outdoor spaces to operate two weeks earlier than previously expected is obviously good for the sector, but that reaction looks anything but rational. Analysts are more sober. They predict a revenue decline of 30% for Marston’s and 36% for Mitchells & Butlers in the year ending in September, according to Refinitiv. Social distancing measures, even if reduced to keeping punters a metre apart, are going to eat into capacity, and many punters will stick to parks and gardens this summer. Investors, in their thirst for good news, are getting ahead of themselves. (By Dasha Afanasieva) ELECTRIC FEEL. Boris Johnson may be following Angela Merkel’s lead. The UK prime minister is considering mimicking Germany’s plan to subsidise electric cars. According to the Telegraph, drivers will be given up to 6,000 pounds if they trade in their gas guzzlers for a battery-powered vehicle. Ironically, emissions-free cars were the only section of the market to register a year-on-year increase in sales last month as the rest of the market collapsed, but only by 429 vehicles, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Electric cars have accounted for just 4% of total sales so far this year, or roughly half Germany’s proportion. If Johnson wanted to double that it would cost him around 454 million pounds based on last year’s totals, assuming the full subsidy is applied. Faced with uncertain Brexit negotiations, the move might also buy him some goodwill with Nissan Motor and BMW, both of whom produce electric models in Britain. (By Christopher Thompson) FASHION FRENZY. Wobbly brand Salvatore Ferragamo is enjoying a market revival. Shares in the Italian maker of finely crafted leather shoes jumped 8% on Friday amid hopes it could fall prey to luxury giant LVMH. This seems premature. The coronavirus crisis has clearly turned the 2.4 billion euro Italian brand into a target. But the French giant remains preoccupied with its $16.2 billion bid for famed U.S. jeweller Tiffany & Co. At 2.7 times expected revenue, Ferragamo looks cheap compared to peers. But it’s too small to move the needle at Bernard Arnault’s 200 billion euro behemoth. Ferragamo needs a fresher look and investment. Assuming a 30% premium, a buyer would need to double the company’s operating margin and grow annual revenue by 5% a year until 2025 to earn a positive return on capital, Breakingviews calculations show. A private-equity takeover, or a marriage with a similar-sized local peer like Ermenegildo Zegna makes more sense. (By Lisa Jucca) CHEQUE PLEASE. Suntory boss and government adviser Takeshi Niinami reckons more than 20% of bars and restaurants could fail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The owner of premium spirits brands Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark depends on the $230 billion local dining scene, and that explains why Suntory is backing Saki-meshi, a dining app that allows customers to pay for meals up to 180 days in advance to help restaurants with cash flow. It’s similar to how American restaurants have sold dining bonds, or discounted gift certificates, but those unsecured debts can have little recovery value if the lights go out in ramen joints and tapas-style izakaya bars. With Japan’s vast economic stimulus package favouring subsidy support for premium ingredients like wagyu beef and melons over eating establishments, no wonder Suntory is tweaking the menu.

-4.5256490939646214," Italy's RCS says court ruled 2013 sale to Blackstone valid, may still win damages MILAN (Reuters) - Milan's Arbitral Tribunal has judged that the 2013 sale of RCS' RCSM.MI headquarters to Blackstone Group BX.N was valid but found that the purchaser's behaviour may entitle the Italian publisher to compensatory damages, RCS said late on Tuesday. In relation to potential damages, RCS said that the arbitral court had ordered two expert witnesses to report separately on the financial situation of RCS in 2013 and on the market value of the property at the time. A spokesman for Blackstone on Wednesday said that the only decision the court had taken was on the validity of the sale. “There was absolutely no decision or assessment about any right to damages for RCS,” he said in an emailed statement. Shares in RCS, the publisher of Corriere della Sera daily, rose as much as 16.6% on Wednesday, before trimming gains after Blackstone’s statement to stand 7.9% higher by 1409 GMT. The case centres on the ownership of RCS’s historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought for 120 million euros ($132 million). After a change at the helm, RCS launched proceedings in Milan in 2018 to nullify the sale, saying Blackstone had paid too low a price because RCS was facing financial difficulties. Blackstone in turn has accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the building and of improperly blocking its sale to Germany's Allianz SE ALVG.DE. The U.S. investment firm filed two lawsuits in New York which were put on hold last year pending the outcome of the arbitration in Italy. A Blackstone representative said late on Tuesday the company was “pleased that in this ruling, the arbitrators have dismissed the overwhelming majority of RCS’ claims”, adding Blackstone would continue to seek “compensation for the meaningful and growing damages caused by RCS.” RCS said the court’s decision was partial and non-definitive and the arbitration proceeding continued."
-3.13377521696145," Blackstone risks paying damages in dispute with Italy's RCS MILAN, May 26 (Reuters) - Milan’s Arbitral Tribunal has judged that the contracts over the sale of Italy’s RCS headquarters to Blackstone in 2013 were valid but found that the purchaser’s behaviour may entitle the Italian publisher to compensatory damages, RCS said on Tuesday. The case centres on the ownership of RCS’ historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($131.71 million) in 2013. RCS, owner of influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings in Milan in late 2018 to nullify the sale of the asset, saying Blackstone took control of the headquarters at too low a price, while RCS faced financial difficulties. It asked for the transaction to be annulled. Blackstone has in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property, and of improperly blocking it from selling the property to Germany’s Allianz SE. The U.S. fund consequently filed two lawsuits in New York, one against RCS and the other one directly against RCS’s chairman and controlling shareholder Urbano Cairo. They were put on hold last year pending the outcome of the arbitration in Italy. The Arbitral Tribunal ordered two expert witnesses to report separately on the condition of RCS in 2013 and on the market value of the property, the Italian company said on Tuesday. This is a partial and non-definitive decision and the arbitration proceeding continues, RCS added in its statement."
0.6626048646705947," NIBC says it will pay 2019 dividend to Blackstone to ensure acquisition AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch bank NIBC Holding NV NIBC.AS said late on Monday it has agreed to pay its 2019 dividend to its proposed buyer, U.S. equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, before the deal settles, in order to remove one hurdle to the proposed 1.36 billion-euro ($1.47 billion) takeover. NIBC said in April it would delay payment of its 0.53 euro ($0.5785) 2019 final dividend amid the coronavirus outbreak, following guidance from the Dutch Central Bank. That prompted Blackstone to warn that the special purpose company it had set up for the intended offer for NIBC might not have sufficient funding to complete the acquisition. Blackstone also said regulatory hang-ups could jeopardize the deal. “After further discussions NIBC has now committed to ... pay the dividend before settlement, in order to enable the offeror to pay for the offer at 9.32 euros per share,” the bank said in an after-hours statement. NIBC shares closed at 6.48 euros on Monday. Blackstone is due to submit its request to review the proposed deal to Dutch regulators by Tuesday. U.S. private equity firm JC Flowers, which holds 60.6% of NIBC’s stock, and Dutch investment firm Reggeborgh, which owns 14.6%, have agreed to Blackstone’s proposed offer. NIBC said on Monday that as part of the deal JC Flowers and Reggeborgh would waive their right to the 2019 dividend “until such time that in the opinion of the management and supervisory boards of NIBC, payment is feasible and appropriate in light of the impact of COVID-19 on the business.” NIBC, which services around 600 small firms and 400,000 retail clients in the Netherlands, made a net profit of 194 million euros last year."
5.235426351587325," Blackstone shale oil venture Gavilan Resources files for bankruptcy HOUSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group's BX.N Gavilan Resources LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late on Friday, citing this year's oil price collapse and a bitter legal battle with a partner. Formed following the $2.3 billion acquisition of Texas shale oil properties in 2017, Gavilan listed secured debt of more than $550 million in its filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. It plans to sell its assets, according to the filing. It has hired investment banker Lazard Freres & Co and named attorneys Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Vinson & Elkins as bankruptcy advisers. Oil prices this year are off more than 60%, hurt by a collapse in demand for fuels due to coronavirus-related lockdowns and a market glut spurred by shale and a battle for market share among the world’s top producers. Gavilan’s bankruptcy comes amid an “increasingly unworkable relationship” with partner Sanchez Energy Corp, the filing said. The pair acquired 155,000 acres in Texas’ Eagle Ford Shale oil field from Anadarko Petroleum. Blackstone declined to comment. Gavilan and Sanchez have been embroiled in a lawsuit over the development and ownership of the properties. That lawsuit is set to resume May 22. Sanchez also filed for Chapter 11 last year blaming low prices and the more than $2 billion in debt it took on to help it grow through acquisitions. Its restructuring plan has been confirmed but is not yet effective, the court filing said. This year’s oil-price collapse has led debt-laden shale producers including Occidental Petroleum and Chesapeake Energy to seek to restructure their loans. In April, Whiting Petroleum became the largest shale bankruptcy since the coronavirus pandemic cut demand."
2.6510438018808107," Blackstone takes $360 million stake in Australia's Crown, stoking buyout hope SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Private equity company Blackstone Group Inc BX.N bought a near 10% stake in Australian casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd CWN.AX from Macau's Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd MLCO.O, sending Crown shares soaring amid hopes of a buyout. The deal accomplishes Melco’s plan to exit its Crown holdings as casino companies around the world rein in spending to cope with a shutdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Crown disclosed the deal in a market filing on Wednesday. Blackstone’s purchase makes the private equity investor the second-largest holder in Crown after the company’s billionaire founder James Packer. The investment has stoked speculation that Blackstone, with $570 billion assets under management, may lob a bid for more or all of the Australian company. Packer had planned to sell more of his 37% stake in Crown to Melco as part of a broader retreat from the business, but that deal encountered regulatory hurdles even before the coronavirus shutdown largely halted both companies’ operations. Shares of Crown jumped as much as 12.3% to their highest since March 6 and were up 10% against a 1% gain on the benchmark ASX200 index .AXJO. “The sale has certainly stoked the fire of perceived corporate activity in Crown,” said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut. “Hard to say if (a takeover) is imminent but as with big game hunting, it’s easier to track prey when it is weakened. COVID-19 has certainly done this to the casino and resort sector,” McGlew added, using the name for the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Blackstone decline to comment. Crown did not comment other than a short statement confirming the sale of 67.7 million shares by Melco to the private equity firm for A$8.15 each, putting the transaction value at A$551.6 million ($359.04 million). Crown shares were trading at A$9.45 by early afternoon, a premium to the Blackstone purchase price, indicating investors are expecting Blackstone may add to its holdings. The company’s shares have declined 21% since Feb. 20 when restrictions on movement, including border closures, battered industries that depend on public entertainment and tourism."

Crown said an entity controlled by Blackstone had bought about 67.7 million of its shares from Melco, which in February had shelved a bid to raise its holding in the Australian firm due to a plunge in traveller numbers.

6.142608534579129," Blackstone says coronavirus crisis could derail NIBC deal AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone BX.N said on Tuesday its proposed 1.36 billion euro ($1.47 billion) takeover of NIBC Holding NV NIBC.AS might not win regulatory approval, sending shares in the Dutch bank 12% lower. “There is substantial uncertainty concerning the business plan and it continuing to be a realistic basis for obtaining regulatory clearance,” Blackstone said. “The relevant regulators have not yet given any indication of their views in this respect.” NIBC shares traded down 12% at 0900 GMT in Amsterdam. Blackstone also warned that NIBC’s decision to postpone its dividend payments meant it could no longer guarantee the financing of the deal. NIBC this month decided to postpone dividend payments at least until the second half of the year, as European banks came under pressure to improve their capital positions to be able to weather losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Blackstone said this decision left a hole of almost 60 million euros in its offer, as it had committed to provide a little over 1.3 billion euros in equity, with the remainder to be financed with NIBC’s dividend payout. It said it would try to work out a solution with NIBC that would lead either to direct payment of the promised 0.53 euros final dividend per share or at least a guarantee that the money would be paid before the settlement date of the offer. Under Blackstone’s original proposal, U.S. private equity firm JC Flowers, which holds 60.6% of NIBC’s stock, would sell its stake for 8.93 euros per share. Dutch investment firm Reggeborgh, which owns 14.6%, would sell for 9.65 euros per share. JC Flowers bought NIBC from Dutch pension funds in 2005 for 1.8 billion euros, but the financial crisis of 2008 derailed its plans to sell the bank at a profit. The U.S. firm eventually sought a listing for the bank in 2018, selling a 25% stake at 8.75 euros per share. NIBC, which services around 600 small firms and 400,000 retail clients in the Netherlands, made a net profit of 194 million euros last year."
6.142608534579129," Blackstone says NIBC deal uncertain without dividend payout AMSTERDAM, April 28 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone said on Tuesday it would not be able to finance its proposed 1.36 billion euro ($1.47 billion) takeover of NIBC Holding NV if the Dutch bank continues to withhold its dividend over 2019. NIBC decided earlier this month to postpone its dividend payments at least until the second half of this year, as European banks came under pressure to improve their capital positions to be able to weather losses caused by the global coronavirus outbreak. Blackstone said this decision left a hole of almost 60 million euros in its offer, as it had committed to provide a little over 1.3 billion euros in equity, with the remainder to be financed with NIBC’s dividend payout. It said it would try to work out a solution with NIBC that would lead either to direct payment of the promised 0.53 euros final dividend per share or at least a guarantee that the money would be paid before the settlement date of the offer. “In the absence of this being the case, the offeror is not able to fund the acquisition of the shares,” Blackstone said in a statement. Under Blackstone’s original proposal, U.S. private equity firm JC Flowers, which holds 60.6% of NIBC’s stock, would sell its stake for 8.93 euros per share, while Dutch investment firm Reggeborgh, which owns 14.6% of the group, would sell for 9.65 euros per share.

17.89439994877491," Blackstone's first-quarter profit rises but coronavirus weighs (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, reported a 4% rise in first-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, driven by a surge in management fees, even as its funds took a hit in the coronavirus-induced downturn. Blackstone, whose shares were up 5.3% at $48.78 in early afternoon, posted a 16% rise in management and advisory fee revenue thanks to its continued fundraising. That offset a 32% drop in revenue generated from performance fees it books when it cashes out on assets. Distributable earnings (DE) rose to $557.1 million from $538 million a year earlier. This translated into DE per share of 46 cents, lower than the 50 cents that analysts estimated on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Global stock markets have tumbled as stay-at-home measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic have shut down large swathes of the economy, weighing on Blackstone’s portfolio. Blackstone said the value of its private equity funds fell by 21.6% in the first quarter, compared with a 20% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX over the same period. This reflected the economic impact not just of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also of the steep decline in oil prices that weighed on Blackstone's holdings in the energy sector. Excluding the energy sector assets, Blackstone said its private equity portfolio declined 11.1%. Blackstone’s opportunistic and core real estate funds depreciated by 8.8% and 3.9%, respectively, during the quarter. While this plunge in the mark-to-market value of its holdings does not affect Blackstone’s cash position, it takes a big toll on its earnings when reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Blackstone posted a net GAAP first-quarter loss of $2.6 billion, compared with a year-ago profit of approximately $1.1 billion. “We entered this crisis in a position of great strength, having recently completed a two-year fundraising cycle of nearly $250 billion. With ample capital reserves, long-term fund structures, and over $150 billion of dry powder capital – more than anyone in our industry – we are uniquely positioned to invest on behalf of our clients at a time of historic dislocation,” Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said in a statement. A $2.3 trillion U.S. economic stimulus package provides aid to small and mid-sized businesses impacted by the pandemic through the Small Business Administration (SBA) and programs rolled out by the U.S. Federal Reserve. However, none of the companies that Blackstone controls have applied for funding through the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program or the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, and they are unlikely to do so, Blackstone President Jonathan Gray told analysts on a conference call. The New York-based firm has invested $11 billion in public equities and liquid debt since the onset of the pandemic, and is looking to provide rescue financing to companies in distress, Gray said. Blackstone said it expected the pace of its fundraising activity to slow down given the travel restrictions imposed by governments battling the new coronavirus and the impact of the crisis on the portfolio of its fund investors. “I’ve been talking to all of our big limited partners, who say they do have to pause. Some retail investors, we’ve seen a slowdown in that channel,” Gray said. “That being said, a number of our customers are sort of still open for business, and that’s the reason why I still think we’ll have a healthy year for fundraising, but not the pace we were expecting, certainly six weeks ago.” Some of Blackstone’s fund investors include large public pension funds, whose state finances are under pressure because of the crisis. But Gray said he expected them to meet their funding commitments to Blackstone, as they did during the 2008 financial crisis. Blackstone is seeking to raise $7 billion for its fourth GSO credit opportunities fund to provide funding for companies, sources told Reuters on Thursday. A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment. Bloomberg had earlier reported the fundraising. Blackstone’s total assets under management fell to $538 billion in the quarter, from $571.1 billion in the prior quarter. It declared a quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share."
17.89439994877491," Blackstone's first-quarter profit rises but coronavirus weighs April 23 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, reported a 4% rise in its first-quarter distributable earnings driven by a surge in management fees on strong fundraising, even as its funds took a hit in the coronavirus-induced downturn. Distributable earnings (DE) rose to $557.1 million from $538 million a year earlier. This translated into DE per share of 46 cents, lower than the 50 cents that analysts estimated on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Since the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock markets have steeply declined as the stay-at-home measures imposed to contain the pandemic shut down large swathes of the economy.

16.381781395771206," Tallgrass shareholders approve Blackstone-led buyout of pipeline operator HOUSTON (Reuters) - Tallgrass Energy TGE.N shareholders on Thursday backed a buyout by a Blackstone-led BX.N group that valued the U.S. oil pipeline operator at $6.3 billion, a rare case of a pre-market crash deal going ahead without a price cut. Terms were struck ahead of this year’s collapse in energy prices that has U.S. oil producers cutting output and pipeline operators reducing their fees to hold onto dwindling business. About 30% of global fuel demand has been lost from business shut downs to combat the coronavirus pandemic, hitting high cost U.S. shale producers the hardest. Tallgrass shares would have dropped to $8 apiece had Blackstone walked away from the deal, estimated Ethan Bellamy, a senior equity analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. The stock traded on Thursday morning at $22.35. The pipeline’s former owners “are getting a better deal than they otherwise would in this turmoil, but it doesn’t mean Blackstone investors will suffer,” he said. The new owners likely view the turmoil as transitory and may use Tallgrass to build a larger business through acquisition, Bellamy said. The Blackstone group previously acquired a 44% stake in Tallgrass and in August offered $19.50 apiece for the remaining shares. Four months later, it sweetened the bid to $22.45 a share after big holders criticized the original offer. Sticking with the pre-crash price spared Blackstone from having to write down the value of existing holdings, said Simon Lack, managing director of investment firm SL Advisors, which focuses on pipeline and other energy infrastructure deals. It continued with the deal even after other pre-crash deals were renegotiated. Banpu Kalnin Ventures (BKV), a Thailand-based investment group, this week shaved 25% off its $770-million deal for Devon Energy Corp DVN.N shale assets. Private equity firm Bayou City Energy Management earlier cut a third off a $320 million deal for Alta Mesa Holdings. BKV delayed closing its deal to 2021 but offered contingency payments if oil prices hit $50 a barrel before 2025. Oklahoma pipeline operator Glass Mountain LLC last week sued shale gas pioneer Chesapeake Energy for allegedly defaulting on an oil transportation contract it had only weeks earlier renegotiated. Tallgrass pipelines carry oil from fields in Wyoming, Colorado, and Kansas to the top U.S. storage hub in Oklahoma, and has proposed a line to U.S. Gulf Coast export markets. Co-investors in the buyout include Spain's Enagas SA ENAG.MC and Jasmine Ventures, an affiliate of Singapore's GIC sovereign wealth fund."

Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the company had sent a directive to its companies to do whatever it took to stave off a credit crunch, including tapping credit lines. “There is no firmwide directive to our portfolio companies to draw upon credit lines,” a Blackstone spokesman said in an email. “We are evaluating the financing needs of certain companies directly impacted by COVID-19.” A wide range of U.S. and European listed companies have been scrambling in recent days to draw down funds from existing credit lines and in some cases take out new lending as the extent of the impact of the outbreak on growth unfolds."

16.032122917452387," Exclusive: Blackstone in talks to take developer SOHO China private in $4 billion deal - sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc is in exclusive talks to take SOHO China Ltd private in a $4 billion deal, said two sources, in one of its biggest bets yet on the Chinese market and which sent the target’s shares to a 21-month high. The U.S. private equity firm entered exclusive discussions in early February with Hong Kong-listed SOHO China, a major prime office developer in China. The U.S. firm offered HK$6 ($0.77) per share to take the company private, said the people with direct knowledge of the matter. The price represents an almost 100% premium to the HK$3.03 average price of SOHO China’s shares in January. SOHO China’s shares jumped as much as 39.9% to HK$4.17 following the Reuters report - their highest since June 2018 - before trading in them was halted at 11:12 local time on Tuesday. The details of privatising SOHO China, founded in 1995 by Chairman Pan Shiyi and Chief Executive Zhang Xin, are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, said the people, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media. Blackstone would also take over the debt of SOHO China, said one of the people, which stood at 32.68 billion yuan ($4.70 billion) as of the end of June 2019, according to its interim report. The move demonstrates Blackstone’s confidence in the world’s second-largest economy in the face of a softening property market and economic slowdown. The New York-based alternative asset management giant is a long-time property specialist. In September, it raised $20.5 billion in the world’s largest-ever real estate fund. In 2018, it raised $7.1 billion for its biggest-ever property fund in Asia. China’s office rental sector is expected to come under strain from the economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak, although surveys have shown most investors so far expect the sector to bounce back rapidly. SOHO China’s investment properties were valued at $8.78 billion as of the end of June last year, showed its 2019 interim report. The developer started to sell prime commercial property assets last year as its founders looked to shift their focus to overseas markets. Among the sales were eight office projects in Beijing and Shanghai. Blackstone was one of the buyers, said the second source. Buying the company is simpler than acquiring its properties individually and would provide Blackstone with more certainty in completing a transaction, said both people. Husband and wife Pan and Zhang own 63.93% of SOHO China and plan to retain a small stake after any deal with Blackstone, said the second source. Blackstone declined to comment. SOHO China did not respond to requests for comment. SOHO China, known for its distinctive, modern developments and celebrity management team, went public in Hong Kong in 2007, as Chinese property firms tapped markets to fund expansion in what was then a booming sector. The IPO priced at HK$8.3 per share, but the stock plunged to a low of HK$1.006 during the global financial crisis in the following year. Pan, known for his outspokenness about the real estate market, has often appeared in fashion magazines and other media alongside Zhang, who worked at Goldman Sachs in the early 1990s. SOHO China changed its business model in 2012 to build-and-hold from build-and-sell to maintain a more stable income stream from rents rather than property sales, but that has led to a slide in underlying profit. SOHO China posted a net profit of 565 million yuan in the first six months of 2019, down 48% from the same period a year earlier. Blackstone’s China real estate investments include $1.25 billion paid for Mapletree Business City Shanghai and VivoCity Shanghai."

These meetings offer an opportunity for investors in the private equity funds to question managers about their performance and strategy, and decide whether they want to participate in the buyout firms’ future funds. A Blackstone spokesman confirmed on Thursday that the firm’s meeting this week in New York with investors in its tactical opportunity funds was postponed for a date that has yet to be determined. Apax Partners’ annual meeting with its fund investors went ahead as planned on Wednesday, but it was carried out remotely over a webcast, rather than in a physical gathering, according to a source familiar with the matter. Investors did not get the opportunity to ask questions during the webcast. Apax fund managers in London and New York presented on the portfolio companies and their strategy, the source added. A spokesman for Apax Partners confirmed the annual meeting was conducted digitally, adding: “This decision was taken as a precautionary measure to help investors avoid any unnecessary travel following the outbreak of coronavirus.” More than 96,500 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and over 3,300 people have died, according to a Reuters tally. Blackstone’s tactical opportunities business has $29 billion of assets under management, and focuses on investments which would traditionally be considered outside the realm of its main private equity platform. Among its investments are stakes in cloud services provider Cloudreach and British pension insurer Rothesay Life, according to its website. London-based Apax Partners makes long-term investments in four economic sectors: technology and telecommunications, services, healthcare and consumer. It has raised and advised funds worth around $50 billion it is history, according to its website."

On Tuesday, the Fed cut interest rates by a half percentage point in a bid to shield the world’s largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus, although the emergency move failed to comfort U.S. financial markets roiled by worries about a deeper slowdown. Speaking in Mumbai, Schwarzman said that it was too early to gauge whether the Fed’s action was effective since the impact on the markets had been negligible so far. “It’s unclear whether that response will re-establish confidence because the confidence is really about the disease and not about the financial markets per se,” he told reporters."

1.129991583455493," Blackstone to buy British student housing group iQ for $6 billion (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' GS.N merchant banking unit and medical charity Wellcome Trust have agreed to sell here the British student accommodation company iQ to Blackstone BX.N for 4.66 billion pounds ($6.06 billion), the companies said. Britain is the second largest market for purpose-built student accommodation outside of North America and rapid growth over the last decade means that the sector is now valued at more than 50 billion pounds, according here to Knight Frank. There were 142 universities in the UK in 2017, according to market and consumer data firm Statista, while a report by the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed here there were 2.34 million students studying at higher education institutions between 2017 and 2018. “British higher education is globally renowned and we are delighted to invest meaningful capital to support iQ’s further growth and continue to deliver the highest quality accommodation for students across the country,” James Seppala, Head of Real Estate Europe at Blackstone, said. Goldman and Wellcome said the deal would be the largest ever private real estate deal in Britain and was subject to regulatory approvals. iQ was established in 2006, with Wellcome as one of the founding investors, and merged with Goldman Sachs’ student housing business in 2016. It owns and manages more than 28,000 beds across Britain, with a development pipeline in excess of 4,000 beds. Property firms have turned to Britain’s budding build-to-rent sector, which caters to students and city dwellers seeking affordable accommodation, as traditional home building and selling falters. Student housing provider Unite UTG.L last year said it would buy rival Liberty Living Group for 1.4 billion pounds. The iQ deal follows media reports on Tuesday that Blackstone will use money from a $14 billion Saudi-backed infrastructure fund to invest in Britain. iQ’s portfolio is concentrated in London - where it is the largest owner of student accommodation - and also Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Birmingham. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley & Co. International and Eastdil Secured were as financial advisors to the sellers. Bank of America and Citi were financial advisors to Blackstone."

Unizo supports an offer from Lone Star, which has bid 5,700 yen per share. Lone Star’s bid is scheduled to expire on Friday. “Blackstone believes that the revised Blackstone offer offers the best option, not only for Unizo’s shareholders, who will be allowed to maximise the value of their shares, but also for all Unizo employees,” Blackstone said in a statement. Blackstone said it would only launch its bid if Unizo agrees with Blackstone’s conditions by April 30. Unizo in July became the target of a hostile bid by Japanese travel agent H.I.S. Co 9603.T. Unizo at one stage turned to U.S. buyout firm Fortress Investment Group to fend off that bid. But it now opposes Fortress’s bid which stands at 5,200 yen per share.

Blackstone is proposing to pay 9.85 euros per share for the Hague-based bank, NIBC said, a 7.8% premium to its closing price on Thursday of 9.13 euros per share. The lender’s shares rose 7.1% at the open to 9.79 euros per share in Amsterdam.

NIBC said its boards are considering the proposal, which may not lead to an actual offer, it added.

JC Flowers bought NIBC from Dutch pension funds in 2005 for 1.8 billion euros, but the financial crisis of 2008 derailed its plans to sell the bank at a profit.

-13.694899938644614," Blackstone quarterly profit rises on asset sales, fee revenue (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest alternative asset manager, said on Thursday fourth-quarter distributable earnings rose 27% year-on-year, as strong growth in its real estate and hedge funds businesses offset declines in private equity and credit divisions. Distributable earnings - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - came in at $914 million in the quarter, translating to 72 cents per share, higher than the 67 cents per share that analysts forecast on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. During the quarter, Blackstone sold off its remaining 10.8% stake in Invitation Homes Inc INVH.N, the largest single-family rental home operator in the United States, raking in more than $1.7 billion. The buyout firm also completed the sale of its 61% stake in Swedish property firm Hembla AB to German real estate company Vonovia SE VNAn.DE for about $1.3 billion. Blackstone said its private equity portfolio was up 1.5% in the quarter, even as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX rose 8.5% over the same period. Opportunistic funds and core real estate funds rose 4.7% and 2.9% in the quarter, respectively. The New York-based firm said fee-related earnings, the amount gained from management fees and a key component of its distributable earnings, rose 27% year-on-year to $551.8 million. Total assets under management rose to $571.1 billion in the quarter, up from $554 billion three months earlier. Blackstone said it would pay a quarterly distribution of 61 cents per share, totaling $1.95 per share for the year. Blackstone said it expects to raise up to $100 billion through funds spanning several strategies in 2020, including life sciences, Asia private equity, real estate debt, infrastructure secondaries and European direct lending. “We’ve launched fundraising for our second core private equity vehicle and expect a significant first close in the next few months,” Blackstone Chief Financial Officer Michael Chae told reporters on a conference call. “We’ve also started raising our new growth equity and impact funds, and later this year, we’ll start raising our second Asia private equity and fourth credit mezzanine funds.” Blackstone shares were down 2.2% at $61.27 on Thursday morning.

-13.694899938644614," Blackstone's Q4 profit rises on asset sales, fee revenue Jan 30 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, said on Thursday its fourth-quarter distributable earnings rose 27 percent year-on-year, as strong growth in its real estate and hedge funds businesses offset declines in its private equity and credit divisions. Distributable earnings - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - came in at $914 million in the quarter, translating to 72 cents per share, higher than the 67 cents per share that analysts forecast on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. During the quarter, Blackstone sold off its remaining 10.8 percent stake in Invitation Homes, the largest single-family rental home operator in the U.S., raking in more than $1.7 billion. The buyout firm also completed the sale of its 61 percent stake in Swedish property firm Hembla AB to German real estate giant Vonovia SE for about $1.3 billion. Blackstone said its private equity portfolio was up 1.5 percent in the quarter, even as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index rose 8.5 percent over the same period. Opportunistic funds and core real estate funds rose 4.7 percent and 2.9 percent in the quarter, respectively. The New York-based firm said its fee-related earnings, the amount gained from management fees and a key component of distributable earnings, rose 27 percent year-on-year to $551.8 million. Total assets under management rose to $571.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $554 billion three months earlier. Blackstone said it would pay a quarterly distribution of 61 cents per share, totaling $1.95 per share for the year. (Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

Guidon is engaged in deal discussions with a small number of parties after receiving acquisition interest from energy companies seeking to expand their presence in the Midland portion of the Permian, in which it operates, the sources said. Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Diamondback Energy FANG.O are among the companies studying a possible acquisition of Guidon, three sources said, cautioning that no deal is certain. Blackstone declined to comment. Guidon, Exxon and Diamondback did not respond to a request for comment. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Dealmaking in the oil and gas sector has slowed in recent months, as companies eschew growth to focus on cost-cutting and returning more cash to shareholders. Of the few deals consummated, most have been among producers focused on the Permian, an area spanning West Texas and Southeast New Mexico that has been at the heart of the U.S. shale revolution. [nL4N297285] One transaction announced in mid-December was WPX Energy Inc's WPX.N $2.5 billion purchase of Delaware basin producer Felix Energy from buyout firm EnCap Investments. [nL4N28Q30X] The positive reception from WPX shareholders for the Felix deal has resulted in other publicly-listed operators seeking out similar deals involving privately-held Permian players, including Guidon, three of the sources said. Blackstone helped launch Guidon in 2016 with a $500 million investment. Guidon now holds around 46,000 gross acres, following more than 150 acquisitions and land swaps, according to its website."
-15.78547834538917," Blackstone raises Unizo offer to $1.75 billion, topping rival TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group BX.N has raised its proposed offer for Unizo Holdings 3258.T by 12% to 191.6 billion yen ($1.75 billion), topping a rival bid from U.S. buyout fund Lone Star that is backed by the Japanese hotelier. Blackstone said on Tuesday its improved proposal was worth 5,600 yen a share, up from 5,000 yen previously. It comes ahead of a Feb. 4 deadline for the public tender offer at 5,100 yen launched by Lone Star. With its sweetened proposal, Blackstone is challenging Unizo’s shareholders to pressure the management, who are accountable for giving better returns to them amid a government push for better corporate governance. “Blackstone believes that the revised Blackstone offer is the best option for shareholders to maximize the value of their shares as well as the best means for enhancing Unizo’s corporate value,” the U.S. fund said in a statement, adding it would only launch its offer with Unizo’s support. A Unizo spokeswoman declined to comment on Blackstone’s revised proposal. Unizo’s shares closed at 5,190 yen, before the new proposal was announced. Unizo’s top shareholder is U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, which has built up a 13.14% stake in the company since August. Elliott in October expressed concerns about Unizo’s governance and pushed it to accept Blackstone’s earlier offer, after the Japanese firm had rebuffed Blackstone as well as other unidentified bidders. Elliott now has the right to call for an extraordinary shareholders meeting as it has held its stake for more than six months, the condition needed in Japan to make such a request. Japanese asset manager Ichigo Management has also built up a 9.28% stake in Unizo, which has attracted bidders because its shares are trading below the estimated value of its assets. Unizo in July was the target of a hostile bid by Japanese travel agent H.I.S. Co 9603.T. Unizo at one stage turned to U.S. buyout firm Fortress Investment Group to fend off that bid. But later it withdrew its support for Fortress' offer. While Blackstone tried to win over Unizo management following its initial approach in October, the Japanese firm turned to Lone Star, agreeing to create an entity that would be 73% owned by Unizo employees and 27% by Lone Star. Under that deal, Lone Star would provide as much as 175 billion yen of financing to the entity and gain the right to control 99.99% of Unizo’s voting rights indirectly. Unizo said it is unlikely Lone Star would exercise that right. Unizo has backed Lone Star’s offer and said if the deal was successful, all board members and other executives, including Chief Executive Tetsuji Kosaki, would resign. However, Unizo has not explained how an entity majority owned by employees would be run."

Dehaemers had come under fire from retail investors last month over a non-binding take-private proposal by the investment firm, which included a provision for management to be paid nearly 30% premium for shares in the general partner that owns Tallgrass. In August, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners and affiliates that together own a 44.2% stake in Tallgrass made an offer to buy the remaining shares at $19.50 per unit. Dehaemers, however, defended the management-pay provision against criticism it reflected poor governance in a conference call and blamed selling shareholders for a 23% drop in stock price. Shares of Tallgrass Energy on Monday closed up 1.3% at $18.30, below Blackstone’s offer for the remaining shares.

8.655640323358012," Blackstone to invest $400 million in gene therapy venture with Ferring (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N said on Monday it will invest $400 million in a joint venture with Swiss drug company Ferring that is working on an experimental gene therapy for bladder cancer, the private equity giant's largest ever bet on drug development. Investing in yet-to-be-approved medicines is a lucrative but also risky proposition for buyout firms, and only few have had the stomach to place such bets. Blackstone made its foray in the sector last year, acquiring Clarus, an investment firm specializing in life sciences. For its part, Ferring will invest $170 million in the joint venture with Blackstone, dubbed FerGene, bringing its total funding to $570 million, the companies said in a statement. FerGene is developing a gene therapy for bladder cancer patients with an aggressive form of the disease whose current options include having their bladder removed. The treatment works by entering the walls of the bladder where it releases a gene to trigger the patient’s own body to make a protein to fight off cancer. “We believe, and Ferring also believes, that this can change the standard of care in bladder cancer, a terrible disease,” Nicholas Galakatos, senior managing director of Blackstone Life Sciences, said in an interview. “Oncology is a new area for Ferring, but it is one that we as Blackstone Life Sciences have a lot of experience in” The team assembled by Blackstone has worked at several of the world’s largest cancer drugmakers, including Roche unit Genentech, Merck & Co Inc MRK.N, and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, now a part of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd 4502.T. To minimize its risk, Blackstone invests in the late stages of drug development, when a medicine has already gone through important milestones. Late-stage drug development can also be expensive because of the clinical trials involved, something that Blackstone is seeking to capitalize on by partnering with pharmaceutical firms looking to share the cost burden. FerGene’s therapy, named nadofaragene firadenovec, is currently in the final stage of clinical research, results from which will be presented on Dec. 5 at the Society of Urologic Oncology’s annual meeting. Since it launched its life sciences unit, Blackstone has also formed a new company with Novartis AG NOVN.S to study a type of heart drug. Blackstone invested $250 million in that venture."

23.385858410943143," Blackstone CEO is optimistic U.S., China will agree trade deal (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said on Wednesday he was optimistic that the United States and China would resolve their 16-month-long trade war, helping to ease tensions between two of the world's biggest economies. “It looks like things have lined up to go forward and I think there’s good faith at this point to start things,” Schwarzman said in an interview at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York. American and Chinese officials have been racing to finalize a “phase one” interim trade agreement before new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, including electronics, toys, and laptops, take effect from Dec. 15. That agreement is expected to be concluded later this month and signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, resulting a truce in the trade war. “If agreement number one is done, which I would expect would happen, then it will lead to the second agreement, which will have more things in it, so I think there’s reason for optimism in terms of what’s going on,” Schwarzman said. U.S. economic growth has slowed this year, reaching 1.9% in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department, due to a decline in business investment triggered by trade tensions. This slowdown has heightened concerns of an impending economic recession amid other warning indicators, including the inversion of the U.S. yield curve during the summer. An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession since 1955. But Schwarzman said he does not expect a recession to happen anytime soon since personal consumption, which accounts for 70% of the economy, remains strong. “The consumers are doing quite well and it’s the first time in many years that in part of our economic scale people are out-earning inflation,” Schwarzman said. “When that happens, people spend money. I expect there to be a continued wage pressure because we’re starting to run out of workers and this will continue as a sort of economic cycle for a while.” Schwarzman has had close links with China dating back more than a decade, when the country’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, paid $3 billion for up to 12.5% of New York-based Blackstone. CIC has since sold down that stake. Blackstone has become one of the biggest U.S. investors in China’s property sector. Schwarzman is also the founder of the Schwarzman Scholars, a one-year international scholarship program based in Tsinghua University in Beijing."

Greg Geiling was a senior managing director and Head of the Hedge Fund Solutions Special Situations Investing Group, which oversees the Blackstone Strategic Opportunity fund. He resigned from Blackstone earlier this year and left the firm last week, the sources said. It could not be learned which firm he plans to join next. Geiling declined to comment, as did Blackstone. During his nine years at Blackstone, Geiling, 47, helped launch the Strategic Opportunity fund, which invests more than $10 billion on behalf of public and private pensions and sovereign wealth funds. The fund made waves in the hedge fund industry by investing alongside some of the industry’s best known hedge fund managers in their best ideas. Hedge funds are often unable to super-size their favorite investments because such big bets could overstep their own risk requirements. Big investors liked the idea of putting money to work in this way and have allocated cash to the Blackstone fund which has largely made credit-oriented bets and put money into private, less liquid investments over the years. Geiling joined Blackstone in early 2011 after having worked for prominent macro investor Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital hedge fund. Since early 2018, Blackstone has made some changes to its most senior ranks. Jon Gray, the firm’s former real estate chief, was promoted to president in 2018 and John McCormick took over the reins at the hedge fund unit, which invests more than $80 billion, from long-time chief Tomilson Hill last year."
24.874563954590872," Blackstone third-quarter earnings drop less than expected (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said on Wednesday its distributable earnings in the third quarter fell 8% year-on-year, but still beat analyst estimates. Blackstone reported a drop in proceeds from asset sales in its private equity business, offset partly by a rise in distributable earnings in its real estate, corporate credit and hedge funds divisions. Distributable earnings per share came in at 58 cents, higher than the 53 cents that analysts estimated on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. The New York-based buyout firm said income per share on a diluted basis rose to $1.15, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), up 80% from a year ago. Movements in stock prices of companies affect private equity firms because their private investments are valued using public markets as a yardstick. Buyout firms also have large public market assets, which they are looking to sell off at a profit. Blackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 2.6% in the third quarter. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose by 3.8% and 2.3% respectively. The firm raised a record $26 billion for its flagship buyout fund during the quarter, as it benefited from a strong fundraising environment driven by institutional investors seeking higher returns amid low interest rates. Total assets under management rose to a $554 billion in the three months to September, up 2% from $545.5 billion in the prior quarter."

29.236054732665785," Exclusive: Blackstone, CVC seek to take Paysafe public - sources MADRID/FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firms Blackstone Group Inc BX.N and CVC Capital Partners Ltd are seeking to hire underwriters for an initial public offering (IPO) of Paysafe Group Ltd that could value the payments processing firm at more than $10 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The IPO would come as Paysafe expands its digital wallets offering to capitalize on the rise of online shopping and mobile phone payments, and brings in more technology partners such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google. It would also come two years after Blackstone and CVC took the company out of the London stock market with a 3 billion-pound ($3.9 billion) offer. Blackstone and CVC will interview investment banks next month to hire underwriters for an IPO, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the preparations are confidential. Blackstone, Paysafe and CVC declined to comment. London-headquartered Paysafe handles more than $80 billion of transactions annually, and employs 3,000 people in 12 locations spread across Europe, North America and Asia, according to its website. Last week, it launched its Mobile Pay point-of-sale system in the United States. Paysafe’s earnings are growing at a double-digit percentage pace, according to two of the sources, with one estimating the company will generate around $600 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in 2020, up from $525 million in 2019. Shares of publicly listed processing companies such as Global Payments Inc GPN.N, Fiserv Inc FISV.O and Fleetcor Technologies Inc FLT.N have performed strongly, boosted by ever-increasing e-commerce volumes. This has also emboldened them to use their stock as currency for acquisitions. Last month, Global Payments acquired peer TSYS in a $21.5 billion all-stock deal, while Fiserv in July acquired First Data Corp also in an all-stock deal for $22 billion. While Blackstone and CVC are focused on an IPO of Paysafe, it is possible they will consider an acquisition offer for it, should one emerge."
25.76711974298926," Unizo keeps door open for Blackstone, Fortress talks TOKYO (Reuters) - Unizo Holdings 3258.T said Monday it would continue talks with Blackstone Group BX.N and SoftBank-backed 9984.T Fortress Investment Group on a potential takeover, raising the possibility of a bid battle between the two global buyout firms. Potential rival bids from Blackstone and Fortress would mark another twist in the takeover saga surrounding the once-obscure hotelier, now seen as a test case for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push for greater transparency and corporate disclosure. Blackstone last week told Unizo it would launch a tender offer at 5,000 yen ($46.05) a share and said it would consider other options, including initiating a bid, if Unizo did not agree to the conditions by Wednesday. “We have carefully evaluated and considered Blackstone’s offer. And today all the board members agreed to continue talks with Blackstone as its proposals could help maintain and improve corporate value and secure shareholders benefit,” Unizo said in a statement. Unizo said separately on Monday it would also continue talks with Fortress, which in August emerged as Unizo’s white-knight bidder. But in September, Unizo had withdrawn its backing for Fortress. Unizo said it had asked Fortress to raise its offer price to 5,000 yen a share, the same as Blackstone’s offer, from 4,000 yen. Unizo said Fortress had said it was ready to discuss improving the bid. Unizo had said previously that Fortress did not respond to a request to raise its offer price to 5,000 yen from 4,000 yen. Unizo shares closed at 4,960 yen on Monday. Last week, Fortress had said it would extend its tender offer period for Unizo for a third time to Nov. 1. A Tokyo-based Fortress representative declined to comment on Monday. A Hong Kong-based Blackstone spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. Unizo has already rejected other buyout proposals from Blackstone as well as one from a “locally renowned” fund that it did not identify. In July, Unizo became the target of a hostile bid from a travel agent H.I.S. Co 9603.T. Last week, Unizo’s biggest shareholder Elliott Management had pushed Unizo to accept Blackstone’s offer, saying the offer of 5,000 yen was beneficial for shareholders. But Unizo is continuing to demand certain conditions that both Blackstone and Fortress have not agreed to. Unizo said it had asked both Blackstone and Fortress to allow it to create an entity that would have veto rights over the timing and method of a future exit of Blackstone. Unizo also said it had also asked the both funds not to break up the company."

26.731260374367498," Blackstone's financing for Merlin deal unsettles bond market (This October 17 story refiles to change Thursday to Wednesday in fifth paragraph) LONDON (Reuters) - A buyout consortium led by Blackstone BX.N sent a frisson through debt markets this week as it took advantage of a booming appetite for bonds to push through aggressive terms on financing for its leveraged buyout of Merlin Entertainments. Merlin, which owns and operates Legoland and Madam Tussauds, took on more than $3 billion of debt to help to fund Blackstone’s bid to take the company private in a deal worth $7.5 billion agreed in June, one of the largest European private equity transactions in recent years. Analysts and investors are worried that the European Central Bank’s unprecedented stimulus program is driving investors into riskier debt. They expressed concerns about aggressive terms both on pricing and in the debt documentation on the Merlin fundraising. Blackstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Merlin had already taken out a £2.193 billion ($2.81 billion) loan as part of the leveraged buyout. On Thursday, Merlin issued around $821 million-equivalent of bonds to help fund the buyout. Analysts and investors said the bonds, split between a 370 million euro ($411.63 million) eight-year issue with a coupon of 4.5% and a $410 million eight-year dollar tranche with a coupon of 6.625%, was pushing new boundaries in terms of yields achieved on such debt. “We don’t think at this yield you are remunerated for the risk associated with some of Merlin’s planned projects,” said Benjamin Sabahi, head of credit research at independent analyst firm Spread Research. “Merlin has a very strong track record, is well diversified, and has long-term agreements in place. But this time it’s something larger, more aggressive from a credit perspective,” he said. Bond issues for leveraged buyouts generally tend to have a higher yield. Blackstone’s buyout of Refinitiv in September 2018 was considered one of the most aggressive deals at that time, International Financing Review, a Refinitiv company, reported. Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters News, holds 45% of Refinitiv. Analysts highlighted the terms in the debt documentation on the Merlin debt deal, which was seen by Reuters, as a particular area of concern. The terms give Merlin significant leeway to raise further debt, allowing it to convert double the amount of its dividend payment allowance into capacity to raise debt, analysts at Covenant Review said. The analysts also said they had never seen such terms in a high-yield deal before. High-yield bond documents typically include restrictions on how much debt an issuer can raise, as well as how much it can pay in dividends and other distributions away from creditors – known as restricted payments. Sabahi of Spread Research said the terms allowed the company to take on another 1.2 billion euros of debt for future projects and acquisitions, which would increase leverage by an additional 2.4x. Merlin will have a leverage of 5.9 times after the buyout, analysts said. There have been a string of aggressively priced deals in the European junk bond market as investors demand for bonds has been supercharged by low supply and the ECB’s decision to restart asset purchases, including corporate bonds. “ECB purchases are providing a broad-based demand for risk. You go to these [investor roadshow] lunches and they are unbelievably well-attended,” said a London-based senior fixed-income analyst, who asked not to be identified speaking about the Merlin deal. “I think that the language on these deals is broadly recognized. But the ability for people to do some sort of cohesive pushback against these deals is simply not materializing as people are hunting around for risk.” he said."
28.295535468498663," RPT-EXPLAINER-What makes Japanese hotelier Unizo attractive for Blackstone and Elliott? (Repeats story published on Thursday) TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Little-known hotelier Unizo Holdings Co Ltd has found itself the centre of private equity attention, with global names vying for the opportunity to buy into Japan’s property market on the cheap. However, the rare-for-Japan takeover approach which sparked interest in Unizo has left the hotelier fighting off suitors both hostile and friendly, in an unprecedented manner that has made it a test case for government efforts to attract foreign investors via improved corporate governance and transparency. Blackstone Group Inc upped the ante on Tuesday with plans to launch a 5,000 yen-per-share offer valuing the firm at $1.6 billion, having already had two proposals rejected. That came after Unizo changed its mind about being bought out by Fortress Investment Group - backed by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp - whom it had enlisted to defend itself from an offer by Japanese travel firm H.I.S. Co Ltd. Unizo, which owns office buildings in Tokyo, New York and Washington, also rejected a bid from an unidentified local fund In the interim, U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management bought its way up to become Unizo’s top shareholder with 13.14%. Japan’s Ichigo Asset Management also disclosed a stake of almost 7% and British bank Barclays PLC said it holds over 6%. Unizo’s stock has risen about 150% to 4,945 yen since H.I.S. on July 10 first bid for a controlling stake in the hotelier. Yet that still pales in comparison to the value of its assets which UBS analysts pegged at over 7,800 yen per share. That means any buyer would gain Unizo’s properties at a discount. Moreover, though it is not uncommon for Japanese stocks to trade well below book value, Unizo lacks the defences from hostile takeovers that domestic companies traditionally enjoy. The firm, whose assets include hotels and offices, was a beneficiary of a surge in property prices when investors flocked to real estate in response to government efforts since 2012 to stimulate economic activity by reducing borrowing costs. Property firms’ stock prices, however, did not rise in tandem, resulting in a gap between lacklustre shares and surging asset values. That has given suitors the chance to gain expensive real estate by buying cheap landlords. However, unsolicited bids are rare in Japan as firms often have a web of cross-shareholding loyalties with domestic peers which together could block any takeover attempts. The consequent absence of such bids has also made them taboo. Making Unizo different is the lack of cross-shareholding as well as the reduced influence of founding firm Mizuho Financial Group Inc following a series of share sales. Those sales diluted holdings, made it easier for outsiders to buy Unizo stock and reduced the number of stable shareholders. Breaking the taboo was the offer from domestic firm H.I.S. led by a chief executive known for bold deal-making, Hideo Sawada. Unizo hired banks to find a “white knight” bidder and thwart a takeover by H.I.S., whose offer it dismissed as too low. It received 16 bids and in August said it would support a 4,000 yen-per-share offer from Fortress. However, it pulled its support for Fortress in September saying the asset manager would not agree to new - and unusual - conditions including establishing a mechanism where a group of 299 non-executive employees would control the new owner’s power to sell assets. Though spurned, Fortress nevertheless extended its offer period for the third time on Thursday to Nov. 1. Unizo also rejected two proposals from Blackstone, saying the U.S. firm would not meet the conditions placed on Fortress. Blackstone said it would consider options including pursuing its tender offer if Unizo did not agree to a third proposal by Oct. 23. On Thursday, Elliott Management said Unizo should consider Blackstone’s proposal, saying it would consider measures should the board fail to act in accordance with its duties. Unizo has also said it rejected a bid from a “locally renowned” fund which it said was unable to prepare the money needed. H.I.S. in August dropped its offer and has since sold most of its near 5% stake in Unizo, relinquishing the status of Unizo’s biggest shareholder to Elliott which built up its stake following the H.I.S. bid. Elliott demanded further explanation from Unizo as to why it pulled out of a deal with Fortress, saying it was “concerned about the lack of disclosure and the risk of conflicts of interest”. Unizo said it disputed Elliott’s claim. Unizo did not initially disclose the conditions placed on Fortress, prompting commentators to point to the government’s corporate governance push which they say has broadly succeeded in winning investor confidence, albeit for extreme cases. Such cases include Kansai Electric Power Co Inc saying executives had received payments from a local official, and the ouster and arrest of former Nissan Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn for financial misconduct, which he denies."
28.295535468498663," Elliott pushes Japan's Unizo to accept $1.6 billion Blackstone bid TOKYO (Reuters) - Unizo Holdings’ top shareholder Elliott Management pushed the Japan hotel operator to accept a $1.6 billion tender offer from Blackstone Group, warning it would take “all available measures” if it fails to do its “fiduciary duty”. Activist investor Elliott’s warning comes after Unizo had previously rebuffed an offer from Blackstone. The buyout group this week ratcheted up its pursuit of the company by launching the buyout offer, to which Unizo is still deciding its response. “We strongly urge you to consider in good faith, and not unduly obstruct, the Blackstone proposal,” Elliott, which owns 13.14% in Unizo, said in a statement. It said Blackstone’s offer of 5,000 yen is beneficial for shareholders and the employment conditions Blackstone has offered is “very generous to your employees”. A Unizo spokeswoman said the company is unable to comment on Elliott’s statement. Unizo was little known until travel services provider H.I.S. Co Ltd launched a hostile bid for it in July. Unizo ultimately rejected the bid but attracted the attention of other suitors who see the company as vastly undervalued. But Unizo has played hard to get: Last week it rejected a proposal from Blackstone as well as one from an unidentified “locally renowned” fund. This month Elliott ended weeks of silence and started to address its concerns about Unizo’s disclosure to its board. That included seeking explanation on its sudden withdrawal of support for a bid from SoftBank Group-owned Fortress Investment Group. Unizo originally welcomed the “white knight” bid from Fortress but later back-tracked. In a separate statement, Fortress said it would extend its tender offer period until Nov. 1 from Thursday. It did not sweeten its bid of 4,000 yen a share. Unizo shares closed at 4,940 yen on Thursday."

Co 9603.T in a failed hostile bid. Unizo had frustrated some investors by welcoming Fortress’s bid and then back-tracking. Last week, Unizo’s biggest shareholder, Elliot Management, went public for the first time to ask Unizo’s board to address its concerns about disclosure in relation to Unizo’s sudden withdrawal of support for the Fortress bid. Blackstone said in a statement it would offer 5,000 yen a share for Unizo, valuing the hotel chain at around 171.1 billion yen ($1.6 billion). That represents a slight premium to Unizo’s closing price of 4,700 yen and a sharp premium to Fortress’s proposal of 4,000 yen. Blackstone said it would consider “any possible options” including initiating the bid if Unizo would not agree with its proposals by Oct. 23. A Unizo spokeswoman said the company had received the offer from Blackstone but it had not decided yet how to respond. Unizo, which operates limited service hotels in Japan, has proved attractive to bidders because of perceptions that it is undervalued. UBS analysts have previously calculated Unizo’s net asset value - a measure of an entity’s net value - at more than 7,800 yen a share after taxes. Unizo has spurned potential bidders and pulled its support for Fortress by citing their failure to deal with Unizo’s concerns about employment. Blackstone has said it would maintain or improve employment conditions and provide benefits which most of Unizo employees have not received yet, such as owning Unizo stock and getting incentive payment systems. Blackstone has opposed Unizo’s plan to create a scheme where Unizo employees could exercise control over a new owner’s ability to later exit."

That compared with its closing price of 4,540 yen on Thursday. Unizo said it had rejected the offer because the fund was not able to prepare the money needed for the proposed buyout. Also the fund asked Unizo to secure 90 billion yen in a bank account as part of the deal financing. Unizo also identified Blackstone as the suitor it rejected in September, when it disclosed a bid from a “top global fund”.

The insurer is offering its entire portfolio of mainly residential buildings in Tokyo and other big cities after it failed to sell some of the assets last year, the sources said. “The sale process has just started. Anbang is planning to sell the entire portfolio it bought from Blackstone,” said one of the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the company’s plans. Representatives for Anbang and Blackstone declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A price has not been set as the sale is still in its early stages, they said. Anbang paid Blackstone about 260 billion yen ($2.4 billion) for the portfolio in 2017, then Japan’s biggest property deal since the global financial crisis. The Chinese government took control of Anbang in February last year, part of a campaign to reduce financial risk. Anbang’s former chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was later sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement. Since then Beijing has accelerated asset disposals at the insurance group, which was among the most aggressive Chinese buyers of foreign assets. Anbang tried to sell a portion of the Japanese portfolio last year, but failed to attract buyers because the assets were less attractive due to age and location, the sources said. They said Blackstone was among the bidders for the entire portfolio largely made up of apartment buildings catering to middle class clients in Tokyo, Nagoya and other large cities. Residential assets are attractive to Blackstone because they generate stable cash flow regardless of the economic cycle, unlike commercial office buildings, the sources said."

7.035509490076149," Blackstone reports better-than-expected Q2 distributable earnings (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said on Thursday its distributable earnings in the second quarter rose 1% year-on-year, more than most analysts expected. Higher earnings from the sale of assets in Blackstone’s private equity, credit and fund-of-hedge-funds divisions was almost offset by a plunge in proceeds from divestments in its real estate unit. However, Blackstone’s distributable earnings of 57 cents per share was higher than the 49 cents that analysts forecast on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. The New York-based firm reported net income per share on a diluted basis of 45 cents, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), down 59% from a year ago. Investors focused on the better-than-expected distributable earnings, which show the cash available for paying dividends, sending shares of Blackstone up 0.7% to $45.59 at midday. “We view this earnings release as very positive. Blackstone reported (sales of assets) of $10.6 billion, which was above our estimate of $8.9 billion and higher quarter-over-quarter,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research note. Blackstone said its assets under management rose to a record $545.5 billion in the three months through June, from $511.8 billion in the prior quarter. “We reported capital inflows of just over $100 billion in both 2017 and 2018, and will achieve significantly more in 2019. This ultimately drives growth in earnings,” Blackstone President Jonathan Gray told analysts on a conference call. Blackstone does not plan to give voting rights to outside shareholders in order to be allowed to join the Russell 1000 Index and gain more exposure to investors, Gray added. The firm said it would pay a second-quarter distribution of 48 cents per share. Blackstone said the value of its private equity portfolio appreciated by 0.7%, compared to a 3.8% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SXP. Opportunistic funds and core real estate funds appreciated 4.4% and 0.8% in the quarter, respectively. Stock market swings impact private equity firms because they often have large public market holdings in investments that they are in the process of exiting. Public markets are also used as a measuring stick when valuing private investments. Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said the trade war between the United States and China had limited impact on Blackstone because it does not own many businesses in the global supply chain, whether they are retailers or big exporters. This was Blackstone’s first earnings report since officially converting from a partnership to a corporation on July 1, a move designed to boost its share price. Since making the announcement in April, Blackstone’s stock has jumped by around 25%, outperforming the broader market."

3.133993711145218," UPDATE 2-CRH to exit distribution business in $1.9 bln Blackstone deal * CRH put the unit on review last year * To use proceeds for further acquisitions, share buyback * Transaction value is attractive - JPM analysts (Recasts, adds analysts comments, industry background) July 16 (Reuters) - Irish building materials supplier CRH is selling its underperforming European distribution unit to Blackstone-backed private equity funds for 1.64 billion euros ($1.85 billion), including net debt. With the sale, the Dublin-based company, which provides cement, asphalt and other building materials, would completely exit the distribution business as it tries to improve core profit margins. It put the European distribution arm, which operates in Germany, France, Switzerland and the Benelux, under strategic review last year and in April hired Bank of America to launch a sale. Sources had told Reuters it had drawn interest from buyout funds including Advent, Lone Star and CVC. JP Morgan analysts said at about 10.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), the transaction value was attractive and would help reduce CRH’s overall leverage. Its net debt as a share of total equity rose to 42% in 2018 from 39% in 2017. CRH, which employs about 90,000 people in more than 30 countries, said it would use the proceeds from the sale for further acquisitions and for its ongoing share buyback program. Over the last few years, CRH has been selling businesses that have not been delivering and buying attractive ones. While the company’s overall core earnings rose 7% to 3.3 billion euros last year, they fell 1% for the European distribution unit. In 2017, the Irish firm sold its U.S. distribution business, Allied Building Products, to Beacon Roofing Supply for $2.6 billion in cash and used the proceeds to fund the 3 billion euro purchase of Ash Grove Cement in 2018. Jefferies analysts said though the deal was at a lower multiple than what CRH had gained for the disposal of the U.S. business, it was still at the top end of recent deals in the sector in Europe. CRH’s peers have also been looking to shed non-core assets to contain rising costs. The world’s largest cement maker LafargeHolcim recently sold operations in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, while Saint Gobain put its German building materials business Raab Karcher on the block last year. The deal with Blackstone includes additional consideration of up to 50 million euros, which CRH would receive on completion of certain conditions, the company said."

14.442686580286408," Australia's Scentre sells Sydney towers to Blackstone for $1.1 billion SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The owner of Westfield-branded shopping malls in Australia, Scentre Group, announced on Thursday the sale of three city-center towers in Sydney for A$1.52 billion ($1.06 billion) and an A$800 million share buyback. The news prompted Scentre shares to swing from a loss to stand as much as 2% higher by mid-afternoon in a broadly steady wider market. The Australian company said it sold the retail and office towers in the central business district to funds run by U.S.-based private-equity firm Blackstone Group. With the sale of a half stake in another Sydney Westfield shopping center for about A$575 million last month, the deal takes to A$2.1 billion the total cash raised by the company in recent weeks, Scentre said in a statement. Scentre was part of Westfield Corp until the companies split in 2014. At the time, Westfield was the world’s biggest mall owner.

19.2314329504342," Blackstone chief donates $188 million to Oxford University (This story corrects currency of donation from dollars to sterling in June 18 story.) LONDON (Reuters) - The head of private equity firm Blackstone has pledged 150 million pounds ($188.37 million) to Oxford University, the biggest single donation in its history, to fund a center for humanities that would also house an institute to study the ethics of artificial intelligence. Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of Blackstone which has about $500 billion in assets, said the donation would fund the Schwarzman Centre that would support programs ranging from history to music. The center will also house a new Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI). “For nearly 1,000 years, the study of the humanities at Oxford has been core to Western civilization and scholarship. We need to ensure that its insights and principles can be adapted to today’s dynamic world,” Schwarzman said in a statement. The university said the center would consider the impact of AI, which could “challenge the very nature of what it means to be human and transform most aspects of our lives”. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, said in the statement: “If AI is to benefit humanity we must understand its moral and ethical implications. Oxford with its rich history in humanities and philosophy is ideally placed to do this.” About a quarter of Oxford University students study humanities, including modern languages, theology, philosophy and English. New facilities funded by the donation would include a 500-seat concert hall and a 250-seat auditorium. Schwarzman has also donated to U.S. universities, including $350 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and $150 million to Yale. He founded a $575 million international scholarship program in 2013 at China’s Tsinghua University."
26.439141661556604," Blackstone in record $18.7 billion deal to buy U.S. warehouse assets from GLP SINGAPORE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP is buying U.S. industrial warehouse properties from Singapore-based logistics provider GLP for $18.7 billion, in what the companies billed as the largest private real estate transaction globally. The deal by the world’s largest manager of alternative assets comes when investors are spending billions of dollars to snap up logistics assets as a surge in e-commerce activity spurs demand for delivery and warehouse services. Blackstone said the overall transaction totaled 179 million square feet of urban logistics assets, nearly doubling the size of its U.S. industrial footprint. “Logistics is our highest conviction global investment theme today, and we look forward to building on our existing portfolio to meet the growing e-commerce demand,” said Ken Caplan, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate. GLP had scaled up its U.S. business over the past four years to become the second-largest logistics player after Prologis Inc. Its clients include Amazon.com Inc, Walmart, Adidas AG and L’Oreal SA. Stephanie Lau, senior analyst at Moody’s, said that GLP’s U.S. assets were likely in locations where supply was constrained, making them more attractive, while high occupancy rates was another positive. Property-related dealmaking activity has picked up globally in recent years, with $353 billion worth of transactions announced last year, according to data from Dealogic. Including the latest deal, Blackstone said it had acquired over 930 million square feet of logistics assets globally since 2010. Blackstone will split the GLP assets between two funds, with its global opportunistic BREP strategy fund taking 115 million square feet for $13.4 billion and Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) taking 64 million square feet for $5.3 billion. Two years ago, Singapore-based GLP was acquired by management, backed by a China-led consortium, for $12 billion in Asia’s then largest private equity buyout. While it will maintain a presence in the United States after the Blackstone deal, the company’s balance will shift to Asia, where it had 212 million square foot of space in China, according to an October 2018 report by Moody’s, with another 56 million square feet in Japan. Financing activity in the logistics sector is picking up more generally in Asia. Asian logistics property developer ESR Cayman Ltd, a company backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, could launch a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.4 billion this week, two people told Reuters - although it delayed Monday’s planned launch due to volatile markets. GLP has $64 billion of assets under management in its property and private equity funds. Its real estate fund platform has assets offering a combined 785 million square feet, the company said on Monday. Citigroup, Eastdil Secured and Goldman Sachs advised GLP. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley advised Blackstone. Kirkland & Ellis was legal counsel to GLP and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett was legal counsel to Blackstone."

25.762737153173976," Blackstone-backed tech company, Bitfury team up on trade finance project NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mphasis Ltd, an Indian technology firm majority-owned by Blackstone Group LP, has teamed up with blockchain startup Bitfury to create either a digital token or a platform aimed at automating financial services such as payments in international trade transactions between countries, an Mphasis executive said. Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed. Andres Ricaurte, senior vice president and global head of payments for Mphasis, told Reuters in a recent interview that both companies will seek to facilitate instant settlement of export and import transactions, reduce reliance on complex foreign exchange systems, and increase flexibility in liquidity management for financial institutions. While there are projects trying to digitize other areas of international trade transactions such as document management and customer due diligence, the core financial services such as cross-border settlements and financing of transactions operate on “outdated and clunky” infrastructure, Ricaurte said. The result is a complex gridlock that limits visibility for all parties and hinders access to liquidity for those who need it most. Those conditions have contributed to a global $1.5 trillion gap between the demand and supply of trade finance, Ricaurte said. The collaboration with Bitfury will try to address this key weakness in the sector. Bitfury, which has a valuation of about $1 billion, is one of the largest companies that develops blockchain solutions for various clients and governments. It raised $80 million recently from investors including the merchant bank founded by billionaire Mike Novogratz, a former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the digital currency bitcoin, is a shared database maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Blackstone owns 52.3 percent of Mphasis, which currently trades on the National Stock Exchange of India. “Our goal is to accelerate the disruption and transformation in the trade finance space,” Ricaurte said. “The exact end-goal - whether it’s a platform, a trade token, or a consortia is still to be figured out.” He said the venture was not solely about creating a digital currency. “It’s about creating a digital representation of the liquidity that’s trapped inside this supply chain and leveraging that representation to make trade transactions more seamless and transparent to everyone,” Ricaurte said. Mphasis will use Bitfury’s Exonum blockchain platform to develop new technologies in the trade finance sector. Bitfury Chief Executive Officer Valery Vavilov said in a statement the two companies “will create inter-operable systems” that will improve fragmented financial systems."

17.53479937411987," Scout24 takeover offer by Hellman & Friedman, Blackstone fails BERLIN (Reuters) - A takeover bid for Germany’s Scout24 led by Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone has failed as it did not secure the required support of 50 percent of shares, the bidders said on Tuesday. The offer from private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, in partnership with Blackstone, had valued the Munich-based company at 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion) including debt. It was pitched at 46 euros per share. Best known for its ImmobilienScout24 home listings in Germany and AutoScout24 car listings across Europe, the company was previously owned by Hellman & Friedman, which acquired a controlling stake from Deutsche Telekom in 2013 before listing the business in 2015. The bidders said they had received acceptances for only around 42.8% of Scout24 shares. The minimum threshold was therefore not reached, they added. Scout24 CEO Tobias Hartmann said that although he was in favor of the strategic partnership with Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone, he respected the shareholders’ decision, calling it “a vote of confidence in the company’s future and management”. Share in Scout24 were down almost 6 percent at 43.04 euros in late morning trade. An initial offer of 43.50 euros per share was rejected by the company in January, prompting an increased offer in February, but some analysts had said that was still too low. The bidders repeatedly said they would not reduce the 50% threshold they set for the deal to happen, as the tender period, which ended on May 9 but was followed by several days to evaluate the outcome of the process, neared its end. “We will further focus on our growth strategy and continue to develop Scout24 as an independent company” CEO Hartmann said. The company earlier reported a 21% revenue increase in the first quarter which led to a 70.9 million euro operating profit, and confirmed its targets for the financial year."
18.965035772752614," Blackstone pursuing RCS owner for up to $600 million over HQ sale: source MILAN (Reuters) - Blackstone Group is seeking up to $600 million in damages from the chairman and controlling shareholder of Italian publisher RCS Mediagroup over a disputed property sale, a source close to the fund said on Thursday. In a lawsuit filed in New York on April 22, which was seen by Reuters, the U.S. private equity firm is suing RCS Chairman Urbano Cairo over the issue. The move comes on top of a lawsuit filed by Blackstone against RCS last November which was put on hold on April 24 pending the outcome of arbitration in Italy. “The complaint against Cairo seeks compensatory damages of up to $300 million for lost opportunities for Blackstone and its investors to sell the properties, as well as comparable punitive damages in an equal amount,” the source said. Asked about the lawsuit against him on the sidelines of RCS’ annual general meeting on Thursday, Cairo said he could not comment as he had no direct information on the matter. The case centres on RCS’ historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($134 million) in 2013. Cairo has said Blackstone bought the properties at too low a price when RCS faced financial difficulties, and the transaction should be declared void. The publisher, owner of influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings under Italian law in November to annul the sale. Blackstone has in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property and said the publisher improperly blocked it from selling it to Germany’s Allianz last summer, according to the two U.S. filings. “The decision to proceed with an arbitration was taken by the board,” Cairo said. “It was something that could not be helped after the due diligence analysis.” The private equity firm says in the latest complaint that it suffered damages as a result of Cairo’s alleged “intentional interference with (Blackstone’s) prospective business relations in an amount to be proven at trial”. Cairo said that RCS had told Blackstone that the valuation of the assets was too low long before news of the sale to Allianz emerged. “We informed Blackstone in writing in March last year,” he said on Thursday. RCS’ board has decided against setting aside funds to cover legal risks related to the dispute, a financial document published on Thursday showed. Cairo, who started off by selling advertising for the media group of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and went on to build his own media empire, took control of RCS in 2016 after a hostile takeover that pitted him against Italy’s business elite. Famous for his cost-cutting abilities, Cairo has been able to turn RCS around without job losses."

The case centers on RCS’ historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($134 million) in 2013. Both companies now claim ownership. RCS Chairman Urbano Cairo, who became RCS’ controlling shareholder after the 2013 deal, has said Blackstone took control of the headquarters at too low a price, while RCS faced financial difficulties, and the transaction should be voided. Blackstone has in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property, and improperly blocked it from selling the property to Germany’s Allianz SE. Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday put Blackstone’s lawsuit on hold pending the outcome of the Italian arbitration. That process could take one year. Aaron Marks, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis representing Blackstone, said his client would pursue its claims to the end, whether in New York or Italy. “We are entirely confident in our legal case and have no intention of settling,” Marks said in an emailed statement. Michael Carlinsky, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing RCS, said: “We are pleased with the court’s decision to respect the Italian arbitration and allow it to go forward in Italy.” RCS, the owner of influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings in Milan last year to nullify the 2013 sale under Italian law. The next hearing in that case has been scheduled for Sept. 16, according to two sources close to the matter. In the New York case, Blackstone had argued that the planned sale to Allianz was held up by claims from RCS that the transaction was “null and void.” The dispute has alarmed some real estate investors, who have said foreign investment in Italy could suffer as a result."

19.302713367707643," Blackstone to switch from a partnership to a corporation NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation, in a bid to get more investors into its stock. Blackstone is hoping the move, which will take effect July 1, will boost its share price, which has traded at a discount to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock Inc for more than a decade. Under the so-called C-Corp structure, Blackstone will pay corporate taxes on all its revenue, in exchange for enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock. The additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered effective last year to 21 percent from 35 percent. Two other private equity firms, KKR & Co Inc and Ares Management Corp, announced last year they would also make the switch. Passive investors such as mutual funds, which are becoming more important as they manage more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring the stock of publicly listed partnerships. Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees. Blackstone said the expanded investor base was worth what it called a “modest” tax hit. “We believe the decision to convert will make it significantly easier for both domestic and international investors to own our stock and should drive greater value for all of our shareholders over time,” Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said in a statement. Blackstone also announced first-quarter earnings on Thursday, reporting distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - of $538 million in the first quarter, up from $502 million a year earlier. This translated to distributable earnings per share of 41 cents, lower than the 51 cents analysts had predicted on average based on Refinitiv data. Nevertheless, the announcement of the switch to a corporation sent Blackstone shares surging about 10 percent in premarket trading to $39.20. “We believe this will unlock value, as the partnership structure made it too difficult for many of our long-only clients, and major indexes, to own,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research note. Fee-related earnings, the amount Blackstone earns from management fees, were up 11 percent year-on-year at $374 million. Blackstone said its assets under management reached $512 billion at the end of March, up 14 percent from a year ago. Blackstone declared a first-quarter dividend of 37 cents per share."

37.626998089050986," Blackstone buyout fund raises $22 billion, to set record: source (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP, the world largest alternative asset manager, has raised over $22 billion for its latest buyout fund, setting it on course to be the private equity industry’s biggest ever, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The strong fundraising underscores how investors are brushing aside concerns over the private equity sector overheating, as they search for returns that beat the stock market by a wide margin. The industry has raised some $3 trillion from investors since 2012, according to industry tracker Preqin. New York-based Blackstone, led by co-founder Stephen Schwarzman, expects to conclude the fundraising for what will be its eighth buyout fund later this year, said the source, requesting anonymity as the details are confidential. Blackstone has not set a fundraising target, but it anticipates the buyout fund will overtake Apollo Global Management’s $24.6 billion fund as the largest ever, the source added. This is a departure from the traditional fundraising model, whereby managers set caps on the size of the fund targeted to allay investor concerns over amassing more capital than they can prudently invest. Blackstone President Jon Gray had said in January the firm expected the fund to exceed $20 billion in size. A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment on the progress of the fundraising, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News. Blackstone has a target of reaching $1 trillion in assets under management by 2026. At the end of 2018, it had $472.2 billion in total assets under management. Blackstone, which had $44.4 billion in private equity funds it had raised but yet to invest at the end of 2018, has been pursuing several large leveraged buyouts in recent years. Last year, it purchased a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent company of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal. Acquisition prices in leveraged buyouts are rising on the back of increased competition for deals, setting off alarm bells among private equity backers. According to Cambridge Associates, a private equity investment adviser, the U.S. industry’s average internal rate of return (IRR), a key benchmark for private equity returns, was just under 10 percent in 2015, the most recent year for which it compiled data. Blackstone’s seventh flagship buyout fund, which raised $18.6 billion in 2016, has so far posted a net IRR of 21 percent. Its sixth fund, raised in 2011, has a total net IRR of 13 percent."

Their arrival in Latin America’s second-largest economy comes after a regulatory change in January 2018 that allowed foreign private equity managers to tap into $179 billion worth of pension fund assets for the first time and eased some restrictions on how pension funds invest their assets. Mexico’s lower house of Congress is about to vote on a draft law by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) that would give pension funds further flexibility. Blackstone Managing Director Matthew Pedley said in an interview that pension funds were taking advantage of the recent change in regulation to add exposure to international alternatives and diversify their portfolios. Others consulted by Reuters on their funds in Mexico declined to be identified. The private equity funds could help Mexican pension funds spread risk with international investments ranging from infrastructure to energy and special situations hedge funds. Luis Sayeg, investment management director at Citibanamex, which manages one of the leading pension funds in the country, said the new funds could benefit pensions. “It is a new opportunity to diversify the portfolio into alternative asset classes, with likely attractive returns, that do not necessarily exist in Mexico,” Sayeg said. The draft law was praised by ratings agency Fitch although some critics have expressed concern that the government wants to tap pensions to help finance pet projects. Black Rock was one of the first foreign asset managers to expand into Mexico, raising $615 million for two funds, one of which will focus on infrastructure investments, a non-public document detailing fundraising activity showed. KKR & Co raised $683 million for two funds, including one that will invest across private equity, growth equity, real assets as well as special situations hedge funds and private credit funds, the document showed. The new funds are all listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. Mexico is attractive to those looking to raise assets for long-term investment. The country has the largest and one of the fastest-growing private pension fund systems in Latin America, almost doubling in size in seven years, a global pension fund assets analysis by consultancy Willis Towers Watson found. Mexican pension funds’ investment outside the country is still limited to 20 percent of overall assets while their investment in alternatives like private equity is also limited to 20 percent. This gives them little room for diversification at a time when most other maturing pension fund systems are loosening investment restrictions to help address problems like funding gaps and an ageing population. Investing in new asset classes or geographies adds layers of complexity. This often requires more sophisticated investment processes, risk management and corporate governance practices. Tonatiuh Rodriguez, chief executive at one of Mexico’s leading pension funds, Afore Azteca, said its investment committee had decided not to invest in private equity for now. “The risk of these investments is a risk that needs to be monitored and managed in a different way,” Rodriguez said. “The returns we get from investments in the public market, which, by definition, is more regulated, are good.” Regulation stipulates that the private equity managers need to invest at least 10 percent of the capital in Mexico and commit at least 2 percent as co-investment alongside the pension funds. Despite his risk aversion, Rodriguez said: “The fact that those are large, well-known managers, with best practices, minimizes the risks for pension funds.” (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; additional reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Cynthia Osterman)"

27.725488808958737," Blackstone to buy drug maker in maiden Japan PE deal TOKYO (Reuters) - Blackstone Group said on Friday it had agreed to buy Japanese drug maker Ayumi Pharmaceutical Corp, a deal one person said was worth around $1 billion. The deal marks the first one in Japan by the U.S. private equity (PE) firm after it set up a local team in 2017 to broaden its focus beyond property transactions. Blackstone will acquire the maker of anti-rheumatism drugs from PE firm Unison Capital and medical information site business M3, Blackstone said in a statement. It did not provide any details on the deal value. It will pay around $1 billion for Ayumi, including debt, a person familiar with the deal said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public. “We look forward to working with the company to leverage Blackstone’s global footprint and expertise in this sector to help Ayumi meet the growing need for its RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and orthopedic products,” Atsuhiko Sakamoto, head of Blackstone’s PE business in Japan, said in a statement. Blackstone last year raised about $2.3 billion for its first Asia-focused PE fund."
29.394861563756713," Brookfield to buy most of Oaktree to build juggernaut to rival Blackstone (Reuters) - Brookfield Asset Management Inc said on Wednesday it will buy most of Oaktree Capital Management in a roughly $4.8 billion deal, creating an alternative-asset manager that will challenge the likes of industry giant Blackstone Group. The decision by Oaktree, led by distressed debt investor Howard Marks, to sell a majority stake of itself comes after a sustained period in which its stock has underperformed the broader market. Oaktree’s stock is down around 13 percent in the last five years, even after a price bump on Wednesday following the deal’s announcement. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index is up more than 50 percent over the period and Blackstone’s share price is up 4 percent. Brookfield approached Oaktree about the deal sometime during the fall season, a person familiar with the matter said. Oaktree is the second U.S. alternative-asset manager to sell itself in recent years, since Fortress Investment Group agreed to be acquired by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp for about $3.3 billion in 2017. The deal is a bet by Brookfield, which currently focuses on private equity, real estate, infrastructure and renewable power, on the prospects for investing in debt, which makes up around 70 percent of Oaktree’s assets under management. “This transaction enables us to broaden our product offering to include one of the finest credit platforms in the world, which has a value-driven, contrarian investment style, consistent with ours,” Brookfield Chief Executive Bruce Flatt said in a statement. The combined businesses will have about $475 billion of assets under management, including debt, Brookfield said. Industry leader Blackstone had $472 billion in assets under management at the end of 2018, though this does not include debt. Including debt, Blackstone’s assets under management would be at least $650 billion, a firm spokesman said. Oaktree shareholders can exchange each of their shares for either $49 in cash or 1.0770 Class A shares of Brookfield. Brookfield said the total amount will be paid in 50 percent stock and rest in cash. The offer is a premium of 12.4 percent per Oaktree Class A unit to Tuesday’s closing price, Brookfield said in a statement. The stock was up 12.2 percent in mid-afternoon trade. Both companies will continue to operate as independent businesses, while Marks, Oaktree’s co-chairman, would join Brookfield’s board of directors. Oaktree shareholders, consisting primarily of its founders, certain members of management and employees, will own the remaining 38 percent of the company. Starting from 2022, the remaining shareholders will be able to sell their remaining Oaktree units to Brookfield over time."

Blackstone will retain a majority, GIC will retain a minority stake and Enagas will own almost 25 percent of the holding company at closing, the Spanish energy company said in the statement. Enagas has also agreed, following the closing, to acquire an additional 3.5 percent of the holding company for approximately $83 million, subject to the completion of conditions, the company said."
27.93351840869624," HNA Group to sell stake in Hong Kong firm to Blackstone for $894 mln HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - China’s HNA Group is selling a controlling stake in its Hong Kong-listed construction firm to Blackstone Group for HK$7.02 billion ($894.31 million), according to a regulatory filing, the latest asset disposal by the embattled Chinese conglomerate. Hong Kong International Construction Investment Management Group said in a filing late on Friday that Times Holdings II Ltd, a company controlled by Blackstone, has agreed to buy all the shares owned by HNA Group’s finance arm HNA Finance I, or 69.54 percent of the firm. The purchase price represents HK$3 per share, a 14.5 percent premium over Hong Kong International Construction’s Friday closing price of HK$2.62. Blackstone has also offered to purchase the remainder of the shares in the market at the same price for a maximum of HK$3.7 billion, in compliance with exchange rules, though it does not intend to privatise the company, according to the same filing. Faced with soaring debts and China’s crackdown on aggressive dealmaking firms, HNA Group has been offloading its assets that spans property to aviation. Hong Kong International Construction, a property construction and investment firm, last month sold its last land parcel in Hong Kong. HNA is in active discussion to sell its budget airline Hong Kong Express to Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways , the companies said last week."
13.900221655551452," Blackstone CEO Schwarzman pockets at least $568 million in 2018: filing NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman pocketed at least $567.8 million in 2018 dividends and compensation, making him yet again the private equity industry’s highest earner, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. The was below the roughly $786 million Schwarzman, 72, took home in 2017. His net worth is pegged by Forbes at $13.2 billion. The private equity veteran received $69.1 million in compensation from Blackstone in 2018, largely due to investment gains. Blackstone no longer discloses the dividend payment to the class of stock Schwarzman owns, but based on the $2.15 per common unit payout, he received almost $500 million in dividends. The dividend for Schwarzman’s class of stock has historically been higher than for common units. Schwarzman last year elevated Jonathan Gray, 49, who turned Blackstone into the world’s biggest real estate investor, to president and chief operating officer, setting him up as his successor as CEO. In 2018, Gray received total compensation of $87.8 million. His bonus was $10 million, down from $25.8 million a year earlier. This is due to Gray opting to receive $30 million in stock which will vest over the course of 5-and-a-half years. Schwarzman earned much more than other co-founders of private equity firms. Apollo Global Management LP CEO Leon Black received $252,617 in compensation and $169.7 million from dividends in 2018. Carlyle Group LP’s three co-founders, David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D’Aniello, combined took home roughly $180 million, with the vast majority of earnings from dividend payments. KKR & Co LP co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts received $99.5 million and $103.9 million, respectively. This was more evenly distributed between compensation and dividends."

19.78481587150464," Private equity firms win over Scout24 with improved $6.4 billion bid FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone have won over Scout24 after raising their offer for the online classifieds group to 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion) including debt, setting up the biggest takeover of a listed German company by private equity. The investors said in a statement on Friday that Scout24’s management and supervisory board supported the sweetened bid of 46 euros a share. Last month, the German company rejected an offer of 43.50 euros per share. Scout24 shared jumped 11.8 percent in Frankfurt to 46.38 euros, above the offer price and suggesting some shareholders reckon a better alternative offer may yet emerge. “We think this bid values Scout24 at too low a multiple and raises the possibility that industry peers may look to buy some or all of the assets,” analysts at Liberum said in a note. They speculated a rival media house, such as Germany’s Axel Springer, Norway’s Schibsted or South Africa’s Naspers might be willing to pay a higher price for Scout24 than the private equity. Springer, which has its own German real-estate classifieds business, might have to dispose of that part of Scout24’s operations if it does do a deal to avert any possible antitrust concerns, they added. Schibsted, which is spinning off its own digital classifieds business, would probably have to ditch Scout24’s Spanish auto classifieds business for the same reason. The Scout24 deal comes amid a broader shakeup in the European media landscape, as companies seek to realize value by carving out or merging their digital classifieds businesses that are faster growing and more profitable than their media titles. Scout24 has the attraction of being a classifieds pure play, enabling it to command a valuation of 17 times estimated 2019 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Still, that is shy of the estimated 20 times EBITDA Silver Lake paid in its $3 billion takeover of ZPG, owner of UK property sites Zoopla and PrimeLocation, last May. Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone said their offer was subject to a minimum acceptance threshold of 50 percent plus one share. Scout24, best known for its ImmobilienScout24 home listings in Germany and AutoScout24 car listings across Europe, was previously owned by Hellman & Friedman, which acquired a controlling stake from Deutsche Telekom in 2013 before listing the business in 2015. The company’s rise has coincided with a boom in the German real estate market driven by ultra-low interest rates, urbanization and the attraction to economic migrants exerted by Europe’s largest economy. Other groups have also vied to buy all or parts of Scout24. After receiving an approach last year, Scout24 hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to explore its options. Among other proposals, German used-car dealing platform Auto1 suggested a deal for Scout24’s car listings business, sources close to the matter had said last month. Despite having well stocked war chests, private equity funds have found it difficult to invest without overpaying due to rich equity market valuations. In Germany, the private equity takeover of generics maker Stada, which became significantly more expensive after arbitrage funds like Elliott came in and demanded a cut, has also deterred public-to-private deals. (GRAPHIC: German private equity deals - tmsnrt.rs/2EcD1x9) A recent stock market correction, though has encouraged buyout groups to seek such deals. Separately, Bain and Carlyle are currently weighing an offer for lighting group Osram. Blackstone said in January its dry powder - the amount it has raised from investors but yet to invest - had hit $112.9 billion, and President and Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Gray said recent market volatility had created a buying opportunity."
16.55051006271605," Blackstone to back ex-Eton Park partner with $150 million seed BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP is backing a new hedge fund being run by former Eton Park partner Aaron Wertentheil with a $150 million commitment, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Wertentheil is launching Jones Road Capital Management with roughly $300 million in assets, including the capital from Blackstone, plus money from Eric Mindich, his former boss at Eton Park, and an unidentified endowment, said one of the sources. New York-based Jones Road will concentrate on special situations investments in the corporate credit, government credit and equities markets, among others, the sources said. Blackstone has already committed to also putting capital into a second portfolio that Wertentheil expects to raise after finishing fund raising for the first one, signalling the firm’s strong confidence in the manager. The sources could not speak publicly because the investment is private. Wertentheil could not be reached for comment. Blackstone, which invests $78 billion in hedge funds, is making the investment with cash from its $1.5 billion Strategic Alliance Fund III, as it bets that new players can succeed in an industry that has struggled with poor returns and investor withdrawals in recent years. It has so far seeded six managers from this portfolio, including Tresidor Investment Management and Seiga Asset Management. Blackstone’s seeders traditionally take a 15 to 25 percent cut of the fund’s business, people familiar with the terms have said. Wertentheil worked for years at Mindich’s multi-strategy fund Eton Park, which made industry history for hedge funds when it raised a record $3 billion in 2004. Wertentheil oversaw more than a billion in assets at Eton Park and stayed on to help close the firm. Wertentheil started generating buzz soon after Eton Park’s end in 2017 as someone who could start his own firm or join an existing one in a senior role. James Connolly, who also worked at Eton Park, is a partner and senior managing director at Jones Road. Robert Renda is the firm’s chief financial officer, having previously worked at Folger Hill Asset Management, and Michael Adams is the chief operating officer and general counsel. Securing seed investments from Blackstone often helps the new managers establish credentials and get up and running while it allows Blackstone to get in on the ground floor with promising newcomers. Competition for Blackstone’s seed money is always fierce. But some critics note that seeder funds’ records can be uneven no matter how thorough the due diligence."

20.201549322084976," Blackstone earnings sink 42 percent on lower fees; managed assets hit record NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets, said on Thursday fourth-quarter earnings slumped 42 percent from a year earlier to $722 million, hurt by lower performance fees. Distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - were 57 cents per unit in the fourth quarter, compared with $1 per unit a year earlier, when earnings were boosted by a windfall from the sale of European warehouse firm Logicor. Fee-related earnings, the amount Blackstone earns from management fees and a component of distributable earnings, were up 23 percent year on year at $433 million. Assets managed by Blackstone hit a record $472 billion at the end of 2018. Despite the earnings drop, the results were described as “modestly positive” by Credit Suisse analyst Craig Siegenthaler, who rates the stock “outperform.” At midday, Blackstone shares were up 1.7 percent at $33.70. Blackstone, which manages assets like private equity and real estate, also said it would pay a quarterly distribution of 58 cents per common unit, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates for 57 cents, according to Refinitiv data. The firm’s private equity portfolio was down 2.9 percent in the quarter as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped about 14 percent, its worst three months in more than 7 years. Its private equity portfolio surged 19.1 percent for 2018. Peer Apollo Global Management on Thursday reported its private equity fund depreciated 10.9 percent in the quarter and was down 9.8 percent for 2018. Blackstone said its dry powder - the amount it has raised from investors but yet to invest - hit $112.9 billion, and firm President and Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Gray said the recent market volatility has created a buying opportunity. “With pricing for risk assets down meaningfully over the past 6 months, it’s a more interesting time to deploy capital globally,” Gray said in an earnings call. Blackstone said last week it would focus on distributable earnings as its primary performance metric, instead of economic net income, or ENI, a non-GAAP measure that reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on its portfolio. The move follows those of peers KKR & Co and Carlyle Group in dropping the esoteric ENI metric, as they try to make their businesses easier for investors to understand. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone posted a net loss attributable to the firm of $10.9 million for the quarter. Rival Apollo reported an ENI per share loss for the last quarter of 2018."

17.66985338327273," Time is right to bet big on India, says Blackstone's Schwarzman: ET (Reuters) - A reform-oriented government, weak rupee, bumper exits and new opportunities in bankruptcy and structured capital services will likely make India favorable for aggressive purchases by Blackstone BX.N in 2019, its Chairman Stephen Schwarzman told the Economic Times in an interview bit.ly/2EkNkj9 published Friday. The chairman of the world’s largest private equity firm told the Indian daily that Blackstone could create more revenue for local companies by introducing clients. He added that Blackstone has plenty of scope to expand in the private credit sector as Indian banks are staring at 10.2 trillion rupees ($142.2 billion) of bad loans – and have shrunk their wholesale lending books. A debt crisis at a major infrastructure lender in September added to an already slowing economy, prompting the government to step up pressure on the Reserve Bank of India for boosting lending growth. Beyond technology or other export-oriented sectors which earn in foreign currencies, Blackstone’s focus is on domestic consumption – financial services and consumer companies. The distressed space will also offer more opportunities, Schwarzman told the Economic Times."
6.050276513065538," Exclusive: Blackstone plans IPO of U.S. benefits manager Alight - sources (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N is readying an initial public offering (IPO) of Alight Solutions LLC, a U.S. provider of healthcare and retirement benefits services that could be valued at more than $7 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The IPO could come in the first half of 2019, the four sources said, almost two years after Blackstone acquired Alight from insurance broker Aon Plc AON.N, in a deal that valued it up to $4.8 billion. It would allow Blackstone to turn a profit by gradually selling its Alight stake in the stock market. Blackstone has hired Bank of America Corp BAC.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N to underwrite Alight's IPO, the sources said. Blackstone will also consider any acquisition offers it may receive for Alight, even as it is focused on taking the company public, the sources added. The IPO could raise between $500 million and $750 million, one of the sources said, cautioning that its exact timing depended on market conditions. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Blackstone, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Alight and Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Buyout firms have been prolific investors in businesses that help companies cut costs by outsourcing large parts of their administrative functions, since such operations can generate strong cash flows. Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Alight offers benefits administration and cloud-based human resources services to 22 million people, and generated revenue of $2.3 billion in 2017, according to its website. Before selling Alight to Blackstone last year, Aon had taken ownership of it as part of its acquisition in 2010 of Hewitt Associates Inc for $4.9 billion. Dealmaking has heated up in the benefits sector this year, as some of these companies turn to dealmaking to counter fierce price competition for their services. In October, French IT services company Atos SE ATOS.PA completed a $3.4 billion cash deal to buy Michigan-based IT services provider Syntel Inc, and last week payroll processor Paychex Inc PAYX.O agreed to buy Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp for $1.2 billion in cash. In another deal by a private equity firm, Carlyle Group LP CG.O said in September that it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc, the largest U.S. insurance claims service provider, for $6.7 billion.

0.845970379706322," Blackstone, LLOG looking to sell Gulf of Mexico oil exploration venture: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buyout firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N and privately held LLOG Exploration Company are working with an investment bank to sell their Gulf of Mexico oil exploration joint venture for more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The attempted divestment is the latest to emerge from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as higher oil prices allow those with capital-intensive investments in the basin to sell them at much more attractive valuations than in recent years. This is a boon for both strategic players such as LLOG, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and China's Nexen Petroleum, which can deploy the cash from sales into other production areas, and private equity firms including Blackstone and First Reserve, which need to return capital to investors after holding assets for a certain period. The LLOG Bluewater joint venture between Blackstone and LLOG was announced in November 2012, with a pledge to invest more than $1.2 billion to bolster LLOG’s operations in the Gulf. The duo is working with Barclays Plc BARC.L to sell the venture, according to four sources aware of the matter. Initial information was sent out to potential buyers last week, one of the sources added. Blackstone and Barclays declined to comment. LLOG did not respond to a request for comment. Covington, Louisiana-based LLOG is one of the largest private oil and gas explorers in the Gulf of Mexico. Across its business, it had average gross daily production in 2017 of 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent, according to its website."

-3.2321221684936585," Blackstone to buy oil services firm Ulterra for $700 million: sources HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group has agreed a deal to acquire Ulterra Drilling Technologies, a manufacturer of drill bits and downhole tools for the oil and gas industry, for around $700 million, two sources familiar with the matter said. Fort Worth, Texas-headquartered Ulterra had the fifth-largest share of the global drill bits industry in 2017, bringing in about $200 million in revenue, or 8 percent of the global market share, according to data from oilfield consultancy Spears & Associates. Ulterra is one of a host of oilfield services firms which have been shopped around in recent weeks, as increased drilling activity coupled with higher oil prices encourages owners - many of them buyout houses - to seek a sale. Blackstone is buying the firm from fellow private equity house American Securities, which itself acquired the business in 2016. Blackstone and American Securities declined to comment. Ulterra did not respond to a request for comment. The acquisition of Ulterra is being supported by a debt package which is currently being pre-marketed ahead of a formal launch, one of the sources said this week. Other deals in the oilfield services space announced in recent days include the sale of downhole technology firm Magnum Oil Tools to Nine Energy Services for $493 million, and the purchase by Carlyle Group of EnerMech - an equipment provider to offshore oil and gas platforms - from Lime Rock Partners for an undisclosed price. Schlumberger has the largest share of the global drill bit market, with an estimated $787 million in revenue last year, followed by General Electric’s Baker Hughes, Halliburton and National Oilwell Varco, according to Spears & Associates."
-4.911741947051751," Blackstone waves off concerns over Saudi funding NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP BX.N, the U.S. buyout firm which is relying on Saudi Arabia to provide half the money for its planned $40 billion infrastructure fund, waved off concerns about funding on Thursday even as controversy rages over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist that has frayed relations between Wall Street and the oil-rich kingdom. Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman pulled out this week from a planned investment conference in Saudi Arabia, following other Wall Street and media leaders, over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh’s policies, who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi was murdered at the consulate and his body chopped up and removed. Saudi Arabia has denied involvement in the disappearance, and U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he needed to see evidence of any role by Riyadh. Blackstone Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Gray acknowledged that the firm “may get some questions” over its Saudi ties, but stressed Blackstone’s autonomy in investing the infrastructure fund. “Investors have enormous confidence in us, which is why we feel like this business is very much on the path to growing to large scale, regardless of obviously some near-term challenges,” Gray said about the infrastructure fund on a conference call discussing the firm’s third-quarter earnings with analysts. Blackstone, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, has long cultivated Saudi Arabia as an investor, and the Kingdom’s main sovereign wealth fund agreed last year to contribute up to $20 billion for its new infrastructure fund. Blackstone has so far raised around $5 billion for its infrastructure fund, half of which came from Saudi Arabia. Gray said Blackstone has been concerned by the recent media coverage, but that the firm takes “a long-term approach, both to our relationships and to building businesses”. For the third quarter, Blackstone modestly exceeded analyst expectations with an 11 percent jump in earnings, helped by climbing equity markets which buoyed its holdings. The New York-based firm’s economic net income (ENI) per unit for the three months through September was 76 cents, compared to the mean forecast for 74 cents, according to Refinitiv data. A year earlier, Blackstone reported ENI per share of 68 cents. Blackstone shares were down around 0.2 percent in midday trading in New York against a broadly lower market. ENI reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Blackstone’s portfolio and is a closely watched earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms. Stock market swings often impact the valuation of private equity firms' holdings because they mark many of their holdings to market. The benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX rose 7.2 percent in the third quarter. Blackstone also benefited from a 19.9 percent appreciation of Gates Industrial Corporation GTES.N, in which it still holds a majority stake. Assets under management totaled $457 billion at the end of September, up from $439 billion in the prior quarter. Distributable earnings - the cash available for paying dividends - were $769 million, up from $626 million a year ago. Blackstone said it would pay shareholders a quarterly distribution of 64 cents per common unit, including a 10 cent special distribution. Earlier this month, Blackstone closed its biggest acquisition since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, buying a 55 percent stake in the Financial & Risk unit of Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TO, the parent of Reuters News. The deal valued the unit, now a standalone business called Refinitiv, at about $20 billion, including debt."

-4.911741947051751," Blackstone concedes defeat to Canada's Oxford in battle for Australia's Investa SYDNEY (Reuters) - Private equity giant Blackstone Group BX.N has quit a takeover battle for Australian office-block owner Investa Office Fund IOF.AX after it was gazumped by Canadian landlord Oxford Properties Group's A$3.35 billion ($2.4 billion) bid. Blackstone told Investa it would not match the offer, Investa said on Thursday, all but handing the sought-after target to Oxford as office rents boom, especially in Sydney where Investa’s 20 towers are concentrated. With Investa’s board now recommending the Oxford buyout, notwithstanding a better offer, it also ends a takeover battle running since the Canadian firm emerged as 11th-hour contender last month. “There’s only the formalities to go through. I think that’s as high as it’ll go,” said Winston Sammut, managing director of property investor Folkestone Maxim Asset Management. “The question really now is what does Blackstone do given that it’s got some cash available.” A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group. “This is an excellent opportunity for IOF unitholders to crystallize their investment in IOF at an attractive and certain price,” IOF Fund Manager Penny Ransom said in a statement. The transaction, which requires shareholder and regulatory approvals, comes as tight supply in downtown office markets is driving a slew of deals in a sector that is defying softening home prices in Australia. British-based consultant BIS Oxford Economics, unrelated to the bidder, forecasts vacancy rates for Sydney offices to hit an all-time low of 3 percent by the end of 2019 and office rents to rise 56 percent over the next five years. “Some people think this is over, but it’s not,” Frank Gelber, economist and a director at BIS said by phone. “We reckon this cycle’s got another four to five years to run.” In other deals, Miami-based Starwood Capital has three times raised its offer for Melbourne-based landlord Australian Unity Office Fund AOF.AX to A$480.4 million. Industrial and office landlord Propertylink Group PLG.AX on Tuesday dropped its A$755 million bid for peer Centuria Industrial REIT CIP.AX while it mulls a A$732 million takeover offer from Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] controlled ESR Real Estate. Investa, which first drew interest from Blackstone in April, and a A$3.08 million bid in May, is regarded a particularly valuable because it is the largest office owner not diversified into the weaker-performing residential or industrial sectors. Before Oxford emerged as a spoiler two days before shareholders were set to vote on Blackstone’s buyout, the private equity giant had already lifted its bid once. It raised it three times before Oxford beat it out by A$48 million. Investa shares closed 0.36 percent lower, in a flat market, at A$5.55, just below the Oxford offer price of A$5.60. Oxford’s offer will be voted on by shareholders at a meeting to be scheduled in December. Investa must also pay a break fee of about A$32 million to Blackstone. ($1 = 1.4037 Australian dollars)"

Corbin Capital Partners also committed money to Antara, said one of the people, who were not permitted to speak publicly about the private fund. Corbin Capital is expected to add additional money over the coming year, the person said. Antara, Blackstone Group and Corbin declined to comment. Before launching his own fund, Gulati was the head of U.S. Distressed Credit and Special Situations at Man GLG for three years. Before that he worked at Perry Capital, Richard Perry’s former hedge fund which was shuttered in 2016. At Antara, Gulati will be working long-term colleagues Rick Paige and Eric Mason.

-18.1939116582166," Blackstone buys Clarus to bulk up in life sciences (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP said on Thursday it has agreed to acquire life sciences investment firm Clarus, in an effort by the world’s largest alternative asset manager to scale up its investments in healthcare. Terms were not disclosed. The push into life sciences is one of Blackstone’s new strategic initiatives under Jon Gray, who was promoted to president and chief operating officer earlier this year. Blackstone already manages $439 billion across alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, and is looking for ways to grow further. “This is a platform we will build on in the life sciences area,” Blackstone’s global head of private equity, Joe Baratta, said in a telephone interview. The acquisition kicks off Blackstone Life Sciences, which is the New York-based firm’s effort to put more money into research funding where its sees a gap due to the retreat by larger pharmaceutical companies under earnings pressure. Blackstone will initially have two investment areas: partnering up with major pharmaceutical companies to help fund elements of research and development programs they do not want to focus on; and growth equity investments that typically fund growing companies past the venture capital stage of fundraising. Clarus, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has raised $2.6 billion since its founding, according to Blackstone. Clarus is currently investing out of a $900 million fund, and the successor fund is expected to be “meaningfully larger,” Baratta said, without giving an exact number. With Clarus, Blackstone is targeting top-quartile private equity and venture capital-like returns, Baratta said. In private equity, the average global top-quartile fund posted a net internal rate of return of around 20 percent, according to industry tracker Preqin. Blackstone has in the past made acquisitions to expand quickly, as with its purchase a decade ago of GSO Capital Partners, which became its credit investment arm, and Strategic Partners in 2013, for its business of buying and selling stakes in private equity funds. “Both GSO and Strategic Partners are a model for this business, Clarus,” Baratta said.

-20.873248931701582," Thomson Reuters closes deal with Blackstone TORONTO (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TOTRI.N said on Monday it had completed the sale of a majority stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N. The news and information provider agreed in January to sell a 55-percent stake in the business, which provides data and news primarily to financial customers, in a deal which values the total F&R business at about $20 billion. The transaction is Blackstone’s biggest bet since the 2008 financial crisis and pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg’s eponymous terminals are the market leader in providing traders, bankers and investors with news, data and analytics. It also gives Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, an ally as it seeks to reinvigorate a business facing challenges from a shrinking and budget-conscious customer base. Thomson Reuters retains a 45-percent stake in the F&R business, which has been renamed Refinitiv, a name derived from the 160-year-old Reuters brand with the objective of enabling “definitive action in financial markets.” The business will be led by David Craig, previously head of the F&R unit, who became CEO of Refinitiv following completion of the deal. Thomson Reuters said it received about $17 billion in gross proceeds at the closing, out of which it plans to return $10 billion to shareholders. As part of that process, the company launched a $9 billion share buyback in August. The tender offer is scheduled to close on Tuesday. From the remainder of the proceeds, the company said it would redeem $4 billion of debt, keep $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet to fund acquisitions, and use $1 billion to cover expenses related to the transaction. Following the deal, Thomson Reuters had said it expects its legal business to account for 43 percent of its revenue. Reuters News will remain a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. Under the terms of the deal, Refinitiv will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years to secure access to its news service, equating to almost $10 billion."

The debt-laden Chinese insurer, which was taken under the government control in February after spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions in recent years, is selling a portion of its Japanese residential assets to shore up its balance sheet, the people said. The assets on sale are part of the portfolio of apartment buildings Anbang bought from Blackstone for around $2.3 billion, in its first foray into Japan’s real estate sector. A spokesman for Anbang declined to provide immediate comment, while Blackstone declined to comment. The divestment comes as Anbang, which also owns New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel, is looking to offload $10 billion worth of overseas properties as part of a government-led restructuring effort. China’s government over the past year has sharpened its scrutiny of highly leveraged companies with overseas investments. Some conglomerates such as HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] and Dalian Wanda Group Co Ltd have recently sold foreign real estate to pay down debt. Anbang’s Japanese real estate portfolio is scattered in major cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, said the people, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified as the deal process was not yet public. The insurer wants to first sell assets deemed less attractive - mainly due to their location and age - as Japan’s property market rebounds from a slowdown spanning the last three decades, one of the people said. Japan’s average residential land price is falling but the pace of decline has slowed, showed a government survey released last week. Some potential bidders including Blackstone want Anbang to add more attractive assets to the portfolio on sale, the people said.

-26.365109100723515," Blackstone looks to manage $1 trillion by 2026 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP BX.N, the world's largest manager of alternative investments such as private equity and real estate, said on Friday it could be overseeing $1 trillion in assets by 2026. The firm currently manages $439 billion, a five-fold increase since it went public in 2007. The ambitious target highlights how Blackstone, like many peers, is eager to take advantage of healthy investor demand for private equity and other forms alternative asset management. There is, however, concern in the industry that fundraising will suffer when the next economic downturn comes, as it did in 2009 during the financial crisis. “Now you may ask ... have you tapped out? Are you hitting some ceiling? The answer to that is a definitive ‘no,’” Blackstone President and Chief Operating Officer Jon Gray said at an investor day event, the firm’s first since 2014. Gray was promoted earlier this year from head of Blackstone’s real estate division. In a presentation, Blackstone said assets under management could hit $600 billion in the next two years or so, $800 billion in four to six years and pass $1 trillion in eight-plus years. The outlook underscores comments by Blackstone Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman in July about the alternative asset management industry entering a fundraising “super cycle,” and his belief that Blackstone still has plenty of room to grow. A growing asset base will boost the amount Blackstone earns from management fees, typically 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the assets it manages. These fees tend to be valued at a premium by investors because they are considered more stable than performance fees, Blackstone’s other main revenue stream. In its presentation, Blackstone said it had a “clear path” in the next two years or so to achieve at least 50 percent growth in fee-related earnings. Blackstone shares rose as much 5.1 percent, reaching $39.70, their highest since July 2015.

Blackstone is the largest owner of office buildings in India and sees the potential deal as an opportunity to expand into retail space and create synergies in the housing finance sector, the report said, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the development. The report did not mention the value of the offer made by Blackstone. After winning the bid, Blackstone is expected to make a consortium, the report said, adding that non-binding bids were submitted by Aug. 25. The successful bidder will first acquire 51 percent stake in PNB Housing Finance and subsequently raise it to 66 percent or beyond through an open offer. More than 20 private-equity firms and large home financiers had initially bid for a stake in the company. The first round of short-listing is expected to close by the end of this week and the process may close by December, the report said.

The company said it intended to seek judicial advice to adjourn the meeting set for Sept. 17, where it intended to solicit shareholders over a takeover offer from Blackstone. A new date for the meeting was yet to be determined. Investa also said it would engage with Oxford Properties Group over a possible binding proposal after the Canadian landlord sweetened its bid for the company on Thursday. Oxford had offered A$5.60 for each share in Investa, A$0.10 higher than Blackstone’s offer and valuing Investa at A$3.35 billion. Blackstone had made a public A$3.08 billion play for Investa in May, and had increased its offer in August. Then Oxford came in with a A$5.50 a share offer earlier this month. Trumping Oxford’s first approach last week by 2 cents, Blackstone suggested its A$5.52 bid would be “best and final, in the absence of a superior proposal”.

-13.728144691979288," Oxford trumps Blackstone bid for Australia's Investa, wins over top investor SYDNEY (Reuters) - Canadian landlord Oxford Properties Group has sweetened its bid for Australian office owner Investa Office Fund IOF.AX to A$5.60 ($4.02) per share, escalating a bidding war with private equity giant Blackstone Group BX.N. The latest salvo from Oxford in the pursuit to buy Investa, which has for years attracted suitors, underlines the Australian firm’s value at a time when tight supply is lifting rents in the country, especially in Sydney where the company’s towers are concentrated. Blackstone has hiked its bid three times so far. Oxford’s new offer, backed by a top Investa shareholder, is A$0.10 per share higher and values Investa at A$3.35 billion. It comes just ahead of a meeting scheduled for Monday where Investa shareholders are set to vote on Blackstone’s A$3.30 billion, or A$5.52 a share, rival bid. Oxford has requested that the Investa “meeting to consider the Blackstone proposal be adjourned” to let the Canadian firm complete due diligence and submit a binding offer, said Paul Brundage, Oxford’s head in Europe and Asia Pacific. Brundage said Oxford had enough money to fund the deal and was prepared to do so with its own funds and third-party financing, and therefore its bid was no longer conditional on completing a financing package as it had earlier indicated. He made these comments in a letter that was attached to Investa’s statement to the Australian exchange on Thursday. Investa said while its directors continued to unanimously recommend Blackstone’s offer, the company was also considering an agreement that Oxford had reached with shareholder ICPF. The pact allows ICPF to sell up to 19.9 percent of its stake in Investa to the Canadian firm, if Oxford acquires the company. A Blackstone spokeswoman in Sydney declined to comment. The firm had previously criticised Oxford, the real estate investment arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, as lacking experience in Australia, and its offer as highly conditional. Blackstone made a public A$3.08 billion play for Investa in May. The companies agreed on a deal as the bid was higher than an initial A$5.05 per share approach in April that was kept confidential at the time. Then Oxford came in with a A$5.50 a share offer earlier this month. Trumping Oxford’s first approach last week by 2 cents, Blackstone suggested its A$5.52 bid would be “best and final, in the absence of a superior proposal”. Under Australian takeover rules, bidders must wait four months to re-approach a target after declaring an offer unequivocally final. Investa shares ended below Oxford’s new offer on Thursday. They have risen 11.5 percent since ICPF on Aug. 20 said it had agreed to sell a 9.9 percent stake in Investa to Oxford."

Luminor, the third-biggest bank in the Baltic region with assets of 15 billion euros, was formed by the 2016 decision to merge Nordea’s and DNB’s operations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. “The transaction represents the largest majority stake acquisition of a universal bank by private equity in the last decade globally, and one of the largest M&A transactions in Baltic history,” Blackstone said in a statement. In the long term, the plan is to seek a stock market listing for Luminor, it added. While DNB plans to retain a stake of 20 percent in the venture, Nordea has entered into a forward sale agreement with Blackstone for its remaining 20 percent stake over the near to medium term. “The decision for Nordea to sell the shares in Luminor is pursuant to Nordea’s overall ambition to simplify and focus operations to the Nordic core markets and become an even better bank for its customers,” the bank said. “This is a good deal for both Luminor and the current owners,” DNB Chief Financial Officer Kjerstin Braathen said. The transaction would not have any significant impact on its finances, DNB said, while adding that Blackstone would be a solid majority shareholder. Subject to regulatory approvals the deal is expected to close during the first half of 2019."

-13.105878127712419," Refinitiv accelerates Blackstone buyout financing LONDON (IFR) - Refinitiv has accelerated the loan part of its US$13.5bn debt package backing its takeover by Blackstone, the largest buyout since the financial crisis, while retaining the expected bond pricing date. Commitments on the US$8bn loan have been accelerated to Friday from September 17 and bond roadshow meetings in Amsterdam and Paris were canceled. But bond roadshow meetings in London will still take place on Thursday and Friday, while the deal is expected to price next week on September 18, unchanged from the initial schedule, according to sources. “The reason the bond books are being kept open until next week is to see if the size of the euro books grow,” said another source familiar with the deal. Sources said that the US dollar tranches of the bond are seeing good demand relative to the euros. The bond includes US$2bn and US$1bn-equivalent euro-denominated 7.5NC3 senior secured first-lien tranches, and US$1.8bn and US$700m-equivalent euro-denominated 8NC3 senior unsecured bonds. Initial price thoughts are low 7s, 5% area, low 9s, and 7% area, respectively. “The feedback we found was that the euro books are not at deal size and that leads were contemplating shifting some of the euros to dollars,” said a bond investor in London. Investors said they were concerned about the company’s complicated business model with high adjustments, and that the deal documentation was aggressive. “The covenants were so bad that it’s not even worth our time,” said a London-based fund manager. The first investor said competition with Akzo Nobel’s €1.385bn bond is also having an impact. Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals business is marketing the deal as part of the financing backing its takeover by Carlyle and Singaporean wealth fund GIC, which also includes €5bn in loans. “I spoke to one of the leads the other day and asked if people are viewing these as one or the other. The answer was: yes,” the London-based investor said. Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk business, which includes IFR, will be renamed Refinitiv following the close of the acquisition by Blackstone. A total of 25 banks are involved in the deal, with JP Morgan the sole physical bookrunner and B&D for the bonds. (This version of the story has been refiled to add missing comma.)"

-7.670589273271686," Blackstone ups ante in bidding war for Australia's Investa SYDNEY (Reuters) - Buyout giant Blackstone Group LP BX.N said it was willing to lift its bid for Australian landlord Investa Office Fund IOF.AX to A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion) on Thursday, to beat a rival offer from Canada's Oxford Properties Group. The bidding war heats up the tussle for the owner of 20 office towers as commercial rents boom, especially in Sydney where Investa’s holdings are concentrated and downtown capacity is tight. Blackstone, seemingly set to seal its takeover until Oxford’s last-minute bid on Tuesday, wrote to Investa offering A$12 million above Oxford’s price if Investa agreed, among other conditions, to recommend it and lift the deal’s break fee. Investa, which published Blackstone’s late-night letter and adjourned a shareholder vote on the buyout on Thursday while it mulls Oxford’s offer, said in a statement it intends to work with Blackstone to meet the conditions. It recommended the deal. An Oxford spokeswoman in Sydney had no immediate comment. “The whole sector is on a tear,” Morningstar property analyst Tony Sherlock told Reuters. “It’s that powerful search for yield from overseas that’s spilling over into Australia ... the fact that the share price keeps jumping each time it happens, the market’s not expecting this,” he added. Investa shares touched a nearly 10-year peak on the news, rising 1.4 percent to Blackstone’s offer price of A$5.52, suggesting the market is confident at least one of the deals will proceed. Oxford, which already owns 10 percent of Investa, offered A$5.50 per share, and Blackstone’s previous bid was for A$5.3485 per share. The prospect of a sweetener comes a day after Blackstone threatened to walk away from its offer if Investa adjourned Thursday’s meeting and deemed Oxford’s offer superior. Blackstone now wants Investa to reschedule the meeting as quickly as possible and before Sept. 14. “The acquirers consider this in increase in price to be extremely attractive,” Blackstone’s Head of Real Estate Australia, Chris Tynan, wrote in the letter to Investa. Australia’s commercial property sector has defied a softening in home values.

Oxford had lobbed a last-minute A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion) offer for Investa on Tuesday that was A$90 million higher than U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group’s bid which had already won the backing of the target. Investa said on Wednesday it is adjourning a planned shareholder meeting for Thursday that was set to vote on Blackstone’s offer while it weighs the attractiveness of Oxford’s bid. Blackstone, in a letter to Investa, said the Oxford offer was “not a superior proposal” and that it reserved its rights to terminate its bid and claim a break fee if the meeting were to be adjourned and Oxford’s offer deemed better. “The alternative proposal is subject to completion of full due diligence ... (and) there is a lack of funding certainty for the transaction,” the letter, which was released to media, said. A Sydney-based spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group, the real estate investment arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, was not immediately available for comment. Investa has been a takeover target for years, as tight supply and strong growth lift rents in Australia, especially in Sydney where the company’s towers are concentrated. Oxford’s offer is also slightly above the book value of the 20-property portfolio, which, besides Sydney, includes towers in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. But, according to Blackstone, its rival lacks experience in Australia and does not have funding secured for the deal. “It is our belief that pursuing the alternative proposal will provide uncertainty to IOF unitholders,” the letter says. Investa units closed 2.3 percent higher on Wednesday at A$5.44, below Oxford's A$5.50 per unit offer but above Blackstone's A$5.3485. The broader market .AXJO was 1.0 percent lower."

The bid lands two days before a scheduled shareholder meeting to approve Blackstone’s takeover that has Investa’s blessings. It caps years of suitors circling Investa as tight supply and strong growth lift rents in Australia, especially in Sydney where Investa’s towers are concentrated. Oxford’s offer, coming in A$90 million over Blackstone’s, is also slightly above the book value of the 20-property portfolio, which, besides Sydney, includes towers in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. “What that is telling us is that the bidders see greater value going forward than what they’re paying for the stock at the moment,” said Winston Sammut, managing director of Folkestone Maxim Asset Management, adding he rued selling out of Investa recently. “There’s still a window of opportunity, if the economy keeps improving and employment continues to be strong, that demand for space will continue to be strong and that because of short supply, rents have to go up,” he told Reuters by phone. Oxford, which already owns 10 percent of Investa, offered A$5.50 per share, a 3.4 percent premium to the last traded price for Investa shares, compared with Blackstone’s offer of A$5.3485.

Pebblebrook raised the cash component of its $37.80-per-share offer to a maximum of 30 percent of LaSalle’s outstanding shares from 20 percent. “The board...has determined that the unsolicited, non-binding proposal received from Pebblebrook on Aug. 21, 2018 could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal,” LaSalle said in a statement. Meanwhile, private equity firm Blackstone, which had made an all-cash offer of $33.50 per share, has decided against raising its offer, a person familiar with the deal said. If LaSalle reaches an agreement with Pebblebrook, Blackstone will walk away with a $112 million breakup fee. However, LaSalle said its board has not changed its recommendation in support of the Blackstone deal. The shareholders are set to vote on the deal on Sept. 6. Last week, shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co and ISS recommended against a buyout deal by Blackstone, while LaSalle shareholder HG Vora Capital Management Llc said it intended to vote against the deal.

ISS’s recommendation to LaSalle shareholders follows that of another shareholder advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co, on Thursday. Blackstone’s $3.7 billion all-cash offer is facing uncertainty as Pebblebrook on Tuesday stepped up its overtures with a higher offer to LaSalle’s board of trustees two weeks ahead of the final shareholder vote. ISS said Blackstone’s all-cash bid was less than the current value of Pebblebrook’s competing bid, and less than the current value of LaSalle shares. “While the adage “cash is king” has many axiomatic applications, it is less relevant as reasoning to forego investments that add up as being superior on a risk/reward basis,” the ISS report said. LaSalle and Blackstone declined to comment. Pebblebrook Chief Executive Jon E. Bortz said the company was pleased with the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations that LaSalle shareholders vote against the proposed deal with Blackstone. LaSalle, which has interests in hotels including the Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue in Chicago, has so far resisted Pebblebrook’s proposal on the basis that the mix of stock and cash in its offer is riskier for shareholders than the outright cash deal offered by Blackstone. A two-thirds majority is needed for the deal approval by shareholders.

Blackstone’s $3.7 billion all-cash offer is facing a wave of fresh uncertainty as Pebblebrook on Tuesday stepped up its overtures with a higher offer to LaSalle’s board of trustees two weeks ahead of the final shareholder vote. “Under the circumstances, we believe cause exists for investors to question the value offered in LaSalle-Blackstone proposal, and the August 21, 2018 revised offer only bolsters our view as it widens the spread over the board recommended cash offer,” the Glass Lewis report said. LaSalle, Pebblebrook and Blackstone could not immediately be reached for comment LaSalle has so far resisted Pebblebrook’s proposals on the basis that the mix of stock and cash in its offer was riskier for shareholders than the outright cash deal offered by Blackstone. “The LaSalle board has stated it is reviewing Pebblebrook’s revised offer, and in our view, the altered terms provide LaSalle directors an opportunity for further engagement with Pebblebrook,” Glass Lewis said. The upcoming vote already faced uncertainty given that it a two-thirds majority is required for approval and Pebblebrook had accrued a 9 percent stake in LaSalle, making it the fourth largest shareholder behind hedge fund HG Vora Capital Management, which also backed the unwelcome bid. For LaSalle, which has interests in hotels including the Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue in Chicago, the Blackstone deal represents “immediate and certain cash value” and is expected to close as early as this month, the company has previously said. “Pebblebrook’s proposal, which includes 80 percent stock consideration, continues to fail to address the significant price risks and uncertainties for LaSalle shareholders,” LaSalle said in June when siding with Blackstone’s bid.

Irving, Texas-based Exeter Finance is expected to be valued north of $1 billion by Blackstone in a transaction, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter was not public. A representative for Blackstone declined to comment. Exeter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Specialty lenders such as Exeter, which focus on providing debt to consumers with imperfect credit histories, have grown significantly in the decade since the financial crisis as traditional banks have pulled back from the practice. Lending into the sub-prime auto sector has raised some concerns though: Loans more than 60-days delinquent hit a 21-year high in February of 5.74 percent, according to Fitch Ratings. The rate has since fallen by 1.3 percentage points, the latest June data showed. Blackstone is likely to favor a sale of Exeter to a bank or another specialty lender, as opposed to a private equity firm, according to two of the sources, with one source noting that Blackstone had reached out to three potential buyers. Strategic buyers can often justify paying a higher price than buyout firms for deals since they can extract cost savings from the combined business. Should Blackstone not reach a sale agreement, it would look to list Exeter next year on the stock market, one of the sources added. If Blackstone is unable to achieve an appropriate valuation through either a sale or listing, it could retain the business. Blackstone acquired Exeter in 2011 from private equity firm Navigation Capital Partners (NCP). Blackstone said at the time it was investing up to $277 million, and that NCP and management would retain a minority interest in the company."
-7.0542989370836615," Blackstone's $13.5 billion F&R buyout debt readied for early Sept launch LONDON (LPC) - Syndication of the $13.5billion debt package backing Blackstone’s buyout of Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk (F&R) division is expected to launch in the first week of September, at the same time as a €7.3 billion debt financing backing the buyout of Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals business, bankers close to the deal said. Thomson Reuters’ loan and bond package is expected to launch in Europe on September 3 and in the US on September 4 after the Labor day holiday, the sources said. The deal is the largest buyout financing since the crisis and its launch has been eagerly awaited since the deal was underwritten in January. Syndication is likely to overlap with Akzo Nobel’s €7.3 billion-equivalent debt syndication, which backs Carlyle and GIC’s carve-out of the company’s specialty chemicals business, but arranging banks believe that there is sufficient liquidity in the European and US markets to absorb the two jumbo deals. “The market can take it; there’s a huge amount of liquidity out there,” a senior leveraged finance banker said, adding that the workload on investors will be spread among analysts as the deals are in different sectors. “The analysts on the buyside looking at these two deals are going to be different people so it shouldn’t be a problem,” the banker said. Lead banks JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup launched Thomson Reuters’ financing, which comprises a US$8bn Term Loan B and a US$5.5bn bridge loan, to large institutional investors in late June. BAML is leading the loans and JP Morgan the bonds. The financing package is largely unchanged, bankers said, despite a softening in the market in the early summer in Europe as investors took a tougher line with arranging banks amid a surge in supply. Indicative pricing on Thomson Reuters term loans is 400bp, of which US$2.5bn-equivalent is expected in euros. Several buyout loans, including a €2.6bn deal backing the buyout of German energy metering business Techem, closed at 375bp in July. Pricing was adjusted higher on Techem’s loan from initial guidance of 350bp. Ebitda adjustments and leverage for Thomson Reuters’ F&R division have not undergone any material changes from the previously reported numbers of US$650m and leverage of roughly six times respectively, which takes the business’s Ebitda from the $1.7 billion reported number to near US$2.4bn, the senior leveraged finance banker said. “The deal has a lot of the classic features of a leveraged buyout; there are a lot of opportunities for cost cuts. If anything the leverage may be lower than before but there’s not much change there,” he said. Leverage was previously expected to be around 4.5 times through the secured debt and 5.6 times total debt after Ebitda adjustments, which could be as much as 30%, as the transaction is a carve-out and involves reallocating costs. The deal also includes US$1bn of preferred equity – with a 14.5% Payment-In-Kind (PIK) coupon – US$3bn of cash equity from Blackstone and US$2.5bn of existing equity, based on the F&R unit’s $20 billion valuation, that will be rolled over. While Blackstone’s carve-out is still awaiting further regulatory approvals, including the US, after securing EU approval on July 23, this is unlikely to delay the debt syndication. Loan investors will earn a commitment fee on the bridge loan and a ticking fee on the Term Loan B before the deal closes. “With any leveraged buyout you don’t want to waste investors’ time if the deal isn’t sure to happen but Thomson Reuters is very well advanced,” the banker added. Blackstone announced on January 30 that it was buying a 55% majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC. The unit will be renamed Refinitiv. A Thomson Reuters spokesperson declined to comment."

-6.388091464378025," Blackstone invests $400 million in HEC Pharm via convertible bonds HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N has signed a deal to invest $400 million in Hong Kong-listed YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical Co. 1558.HK via convertible bonds, HEC said Wednesday. The H share convertible bonds will bear an interest rate of 3 percent per annum if issued, at an initial conversion price of HK$38 per share, HEC Pharma said in a stock filing on Tuesday night. The drugmaker, based in Yichang in central China’s Hubei province, is planning to use the funds to acquire drugs and other pharmaceutical products, it said. Blackstone, as a long-term strategic investor, will also improve HEC Pharma’s strategy, operations management and international cooperation, it added. Shares in HEC Pharma tumbled 7.4 percent to HK$33.60, hitting their lowest since April 18. Blackstone’s investment comes as Chinese drugmakers are faced with tighter regulatory scrutiny and rebuilding public trust after fresh scandals over faulty vaccines sparked anger on social media in the country last month. Fitch Ratings said in a report on July 31 such scandals highlighted the risks facing China’s pharmaceutical companies, which focus primarily on the bulk production of a small number of products, making them vulnerable to safety incidents. Seventeen-year-old HEC Pharma develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products used to treat endocrine and metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases, and in the anti-viral field. HEC Pharma has recently issued a positive profit alert for its interim results for the first half, expecting that it will record an at least 110 percent increase in profit attributable to equity shareholders compared with the same period last year. Blackstone raised about $9.4 billion in June for two new funds - $7.1 billion in the largest-ever fund dedicated to real estate investments in Asia, and its first private equity fund for the region."
-6.388091464378025," Blackstone may buy stake in India's Jet Airways loyalty arm: Bloomberg (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N is in talks to acquire a stake in the frequent-flier loyalty program of Jet Airways (India) Ltd JET.NS, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. A potential deal could value the loyalty program, Jet Privilege Private Ltd, between 30 billion rupees and 40 billion rupees ($429.1 million-$572.1 million) and would be dependant on Jet Airways securing adequate funding for its airline operations, Bloomberg said. The Indian carrier and its partner Etihad Airways will remain investors in Jet Privilege even after a potential Blackstone transaction, Bloomberg said. Etihad owns 50.1 percent of the loyalty program, while Jet Airways owns the rest. “As a minority shareholder (in Jet Airways), Etihad continues to work constructively with the Jet Airways board, promoter and management team,” an Etihad spokesman said in an emailed statement. Earlier this week, Jet said it was considering various options on priority to meet its funding requirements but called media reports on stake sale or plans to monetize its investment in its frequent flier program as “purely speculative”. The airline has also deferred its quarterly earnings report. Blackstone was not immediately reachable for comment, while Jet Airways was unavailable for comment on account of a public holiday. Jet Airways, along with Etihad, has embarked upon a reorganization of its JetPrivilege program to establish the unit as an independent loyalty and rewards company with a mandate to own and manage the operations of the loyalty program independently, according to Jet Airways website."
0.23576706189183802," Thomson Reuters on offense as Blackstone deal nears TORONTO (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp said it was thinking about acquisition opportunities after reporting quarterly earnings that were ahead of expectations on Wednesday and reaffirming its 2018 forecast. The news and information provider agreed in January to sell a 55-percent stake in the Financial & Risk unit, which provides data and news primarily to financial customers, to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP. It expects to use $1 billion to $3 billion from the proceeds of the Blackstone deal to make acquisitions in legal and accounting. “There are a couple that look quite interesting to us and we’ll continue to evaluate them,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Smith said in an interview, adding that the firm was “not going to let the money burn a hole in our pockets.” Thomson Reuters said it expects to complete the $20 billion Blackstone deal in the fourth quarter and Smith told analysts on a conference call that will clear the path for expansion. “Following the closure of the deal with Blackstone, Thomson Reuters will be in a position to play offense,” he said. The company said that, adjusted for special items, earnings were 17 cents per share, down from 19 cents per share a year ago. That was ahead of the average analyst forecast of 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares in Thomson Reuters, which have risen by 14 percent since May, were up 3 percent to C$55.19 at 10.00 a.m. ET. The U.S.-listed shares rose 3 percent to $42.20. “We were encouraged by growth in Thomson Reuters’ core businesses,” said analyst Brittany Weissman of Edward Jones. Quarterly revenue rose by 2 percent to $1.31 billion, in line with market forecasts. Operating profit fell by 6 percent to $204 million, which the company said was primarily due to costs ahead of the Blackstone deal. Blackstone is making its biggest bet since the financial crisis with the acquisition, which pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In the quarter, the Financial & Risk business - now counted as a discontinued operation - grew revenues by 2 percent in constant currency to $1.55 billion. The company’s legal business reported revenue of $882 million in the second quarter, up 2 percent when factoring out currency. The Tax & Accounting unit reported revenue of $359 million, up 4 percent when factoring out currency. Reuters News reported $72 million in revenues, down 5 percent from a year earlier in constant currency."

-1.1857525715579387," Blackstone seeks to boost assets with new fundraising 'super cycle' NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP BX.N, the world's largest manager of assets such as private equity and real estate, is kicking off a fundraising ""super cycle"" which could see it manage more than half a trillion dollars in assets, its chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said on Thursday. Blackstone has faced questions from investors in recent years over how much room it has to grow further after increasing its assets under management five-fold since it became a publicly listed firm in 2007, amassing $439.4 billion as of the end of June. This has left it with $88 billion in uninvested capital, yet Blackstone still plans to begin raising new flagship private equity and real estate funds in the coming months, Schwarzman said. “We expect our fundraising super cycle to bring the firm’s total assets under management above the $500 billion milestone, likely in the first half of next year,” Schwarzman said in an investor call. Blackstone Chief Financial Officer Michael Chae said the New York-based firm could amass around $300 billion in new fund capital between 2017 and 2019. A growing asset base will boost the amount Blackstone earns from management fees, typically 1.5-2 percent of the assets it manages. These fees tend to be valued at a premium by investors because they are considered more stable than performance fees, Blackstone’s other main revenue stream. Blackstone is paid performance fees when investments are successful. The private equity industry raised a record $453 billion in 2017, as investors sought returns that beat the stock market. Overall, Blackstone reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly distributable earnings, which it uses to pay dividends, as asset sales slowed even as many of its funds appreciated much more than the stock market. Its buyout funds increased in value by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, significantly outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index's .SPX 2.9 percent rise. Distributable earnings fell to $700.1 million from $781.4 million on a decline in total proceeds from asset sales, which help drive performance fees. Still, Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of 58 cents per common unit, including a 10 cent special dividend. This compared to 54 cents a year ago when there was no special dividend. Blackstone shares were down 1.7 percent in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, lagging the wider market. Economic net income per unit, which reflects the mark-to-market valuation of gains or losses on Blackstone’s portfolio, rose 55 percent to 90 cents from 58 cents a year ago. Analysts expected 75 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In January, Blackstone agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.NTRI.TO, the parent of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal.

23.352961551283755," Blackstone launches $5.5 billion F&R bridge loan LONDON (LPC) - Blackstone BX.N has launched a $5.5 billion bridge loan to support the pending bond issuance for its acquisition of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ TRI.TO Financial and Risk division (F&R), which is expected to complete later this year. The $5.5 billion bridge loan is separate from an US$8bn equivalent term loan B portion of Blackstone’s $13.5 billion loan and bond financing, which is also being shown to large institutional investors, Thomson Reuters LPC reported on Monday. The financing package supports Blackstone’s $20 billion acquisition of a 55 percent stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR and is the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis. The bridge loan includes a $3 billion, 7.5 year senior secured loan, which is split between $2 billion and $1 billion-equivalent euros, and an eight-year, $2.5 billion unsecured loan, which is split between $1.8 billion and $700 million-equivalent. The structure mirrors the expected sizes of the bond tranches. The senior secured tranche pays a margin of 400bp and the unsecured tranche has a margin of 625bp. A 50bp commitment fee is included for tickets of at least $150 million on the secured tranche and 25bp is payable for all other ticket sizes. The unsecured tranche has a 75bp commitment fee for tickets of at least $50 million and 50bp for all other commitments. A call is scheduled for Wednesday with commitments due on July 9.

24.036507526696635," Blackstone starts marketing huge F&R buyout loan NEW YORK (LPC) - The $8 billion-equivalent term loan B portion of the debt financing backing Blackstone Group’s $20 billion acquisition of a 55 percent stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk (F&R) unit is being shown to large institutional investors before an anticipated September launch, sources said on Monday. The $13.5 billion financing, which includes loans and bonds, is being led by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup and is the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis. The jumbo buyout loan is currently being premarketed and is expected to formally launch soon after Labor Day, which will be celebrated on September 3 in the United States, two sources said. “It’s a huge deal, they (banks) are trying to gauge interest,” a source close to the transaction said. Blackstone BX.N announced on January 30 that it was buying a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ TRI.TO F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR. The acquisition is expected to close in September or October, after regulatory requirements made a targeted July 1 close date look increasingly unlikely. The private equity firm was able to command favorable financing terms when the deal was underwritten in January, but the leverage finance market has softened in the interim, which makes placing a jumbo buyout loan more challenging. The F&R financing includes step-ups in market flex terms and debt caps to give banks additional protection as investor opposition to aggressively priced and structured deals grows, sources said. “They have gotten some accounts to look at it already, trying to get some feedback on the structure,” a loan trader said. The huge deal will also have to compete with other large US buyout financings that are expected to launch after Labor Day, including the $9.9 billion buyout of healthcare and national hospital based physician service Envision Healthcare EVHC.N.  Blackstone declined to comment. JP Morgan and BAML declined to comment. Citi did not immediately return a request for comment. The term loan B is split between US$5.5bn and US$2.5bn-equivalent in euros. The financing also includes $3 billion-equivalent of secured bonds, split between $2 billion and $1 billion-equivalent in euros, and $2.5 billion-equivalent of unsecured bonds, split between $1.8 billion and $700 million-equivalent in euros. The company will also place a $750 million revolving credit facility. Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Royal Bank Canada and SMBC have joined the deal as joint lead arrangers, a second source familiar with the deal said. Other banks that are expected to have joined the deal include MUFG, Mizuho, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered, Natixis, BMO, Toronto Dominion, Unicredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, ING and Jefferies. Additional funding comes from $1 billion in preferred equity – with a 14.5 percent Payment-In-Kind (PIK) coupon – $3 billion of cash equity that Blackstone is contributing, and $2.5 billion of existing equity, based on the $20 billion valuation, that will be rolled over. Leverage is expected to be around 4.5 times through the secured debt and 5.6 times total debt after Ebitda adjustments, which could be as much as 30 percent, as the transaction is a carve-out and involves reallocating costs, LPC previously reported. The size of the debt and leverage currently imply Ebitda of about $2.4 billion, including around $650 million of cost savings, based on the last 12 months’ Ebitda of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R unit. The currency splits and Ebitda figures may change depending on investor demand and the timing of the wider institutional syndication."

10.558468434493959," Blackstone raises $9.4 billion for Asia real estate, private equity funds HONG KONG (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP BX.N said it has raised about $9.4 billion for two new funds - the largest-ever fund dedicated to real estate investments in Asia as well as its first private equity fund for the region. The funds add to a massive industry-wide pool of money for Asian acquisitions and investments, with investors attracted by rapid economic growth compared to other major markets. It raised $7.1 billion for what it called its second regional “opportunistic” real estate fund. Growing urbanization and rising incomes, particularly in China and India, have boosted investor appetite for shopping malls, warehouses and other property assets. “The size of this fund...gives us flexibility to pursue a range of opportunities and commit capital with speed and scale,” Ken Caplan, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, said in a statement. Blackstone’s real estate business was founded in 1991 and has about $120 billion in capital under management. The portfolio includes hotel, office, retail and industrial properties in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Its first Asia-focused property fund, which closed in 2014, raised $5.08 billion. The Asian private equity fund closed at about $2.3 billion, Blackstone said, adding that it now has at least $3.8 billion to invest in Asia equity when “associated commitments” from its global buyout fund are counted. Roughly two-thirds of the private equity fund, as well as the contribution from its global fund, will be used to invest in China and India, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, declining to be identified as details of the investment plans were not made public. The fund will focus on buying controlling or significant minority stakes in sectors such as healthcare, high-end manufacturing and services, as well as goods and services geared to consumers who want to upgrade their lifestyles, people familiar with the plan told Reuters last year. Blackstone, whose previous private equity investments in Asia were from its global funds, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its capital deployment plans. Asia private equity deals have increased in size following corporate restructuring and as global funds become more established players in key markets such as China, India and Japan. Rival Carlyle Group CG.O is set to close its biggest Asia private equity fund at $6.5 billion, Reuters reported last month, after other global groups including KKR & Co KKR.N raised fresh capital.

18.781950631859605," Blackstone bets big on Australian offices with $2.3 billion Investa bid SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. private equity giant Blackstone Group BX.N is seeking to deepen its exposure to Australian commercial property with a A$3.08 billion ($2.3 billion) bid for Sydney-focused company Investa Office Fund (IOF) IOF.AX. IOF's directors said in a statement on Monday they would unanimously recommend the unsolicited and non-binding offer, which comes two years after shareholders rejected a A$2.5 billion bid from Australian firm DEXUS DXS.AX. Blackstone’s move is a bet on the future of commercial property across Australia’s east coast, where analysts expect strong demand to support yields even if interest rates rise from their current historic lows. “They have seen an opportunity to get a decent slab of commercial assets, primarily in the Sydney market, which has been the best-performing market for sometime,” said Winston Sammut, managing director of Folkestone Maxim Asset Management, which invests in real estate but does not own shares in IOF. “But they are paying a big price in an environment where interest rates are likely go up.” The offer represents a 13.2 percent premium to IOF’s ex-distribution closing price of A$4.55 per unit on Friday, equating to A$5.15 per unit. IOF shares surged more than 10 percent after the announcement, and by 0430 GMT were trading at A$5.11, their highest level in almost a decade. Less than two weeks ago, Blackstone struck a NZ$635 million ($439.4 million) deal to buy an office portfolio in Auckland, New Zealand, which was co-held by Goodman Property Trust GMT.NZ and Singaporean investor GIC. It was forced to call off the sale of its A$3.5 billion Australian shopping mall portfolio last year due to a lack of interest, amid the retail sector’s shift away from bricks-and-mortar stores to online shopping. While the retail property market is struggling, analysts forecast strong demand to underpin yields on office space in Sydney, where 21 of Investa’s 36 properties are located. Building of new office space in Sydney has slowed in recent years as developers turned to constructing high-rise apartment blocks amid record house prices. British-based consultant Oxford Economics earlier this month forecast vacancy rates for Sydney offices to hit an all-time low of 3 percent by the end of 2019."

(Reuters) - LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N decided to sell itself to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N for $3.7 billion in cash, rejecting a cash-and-stock offer from rival Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB.N. Blackstone’s offer values LaSalle at $33.50 per share and represents a premium of 5 percent to LaSalle’s closing price on Friday. Pebblebrook’s offer, which values the U.S. hotel owner at $35.89 per share based on Friday’s close, consisted of a maximum of 20 percent in cash and the rest in stock. “Blackstone offer provides immediate and certain cash value,” Baird Equity Research analyst Michael Bellisario wrote in a note. LaSalle Chairman Stuart Scott said it was in touch with 20 potential buyers and signed confidentiality agreements with 10 of them before deciding on Blackstone’s offer. Shares of LaSalle rose above Blackstone’s offer and were trading up 5.6 percent at $33.70 on Monday, indicating that the market was expecting a higher offer. “We believe Pebblebrook would likely have to raise its offer by 5-10 percent,” SunTrust analyst Patrick Scholes said in a note, adding that the company may not want to be involved in a bidding war. Pebblebrook could not be immediately reached for a comment on whether it would raise its offer further. Pebblebrook had raised its offer on April 20 to $31.75 per share, after LaSalle rejected its previous bid, saying it undervalued the company. Blackstone usually buys hotels and other real estate holdings at a discount, restructures them and sells for a profit.

17.586352603829116," Blackstone to end its stay at Hilton after 11 years (Reuters) - After holding an interest in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc for nearly 11 years, private equity firm Blackstone Group LP has decided to exit the hotel chain operator by selling its about 5.8 percent stake. The sale of 15.8 million shares would generate about $1.32 billion, based on Hilton’s Thursday close at $83.30. Hilton said on Friday it will not receive any proceeds from the sale and would repurchase about 1.3 million shares from the shareholders affiliated to Blackstone. Blackstone, which took the Virginia-based company public in 2013, started shedding its stake a year later. In June and November 2014, Blackstone raised $2.33 billion and $2.59 billion, respectively, from stock sales that progressively reduced its stake in Hilton. Blackstone cut its stake to under 50 percent in a $2.69 billion stock sale in 2015, which was then termed as the biggest ever selldown by a private equity sponsor through a block trade. Blackstone usually buys hotels and other real estate holdings at a discount, fixes them and sells for a profit. The private equity firm had taken Hilton private in a $26 billion leveraged buyout in 2007. In 2016, Blackstone agreed to sell a 25 percent stake in Hilton to China’s HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] for $6.5 billion, three times what it paid in 2007. HNA, the heavily indebted aviation-to-financials conglomerate, sold the stake about a year and a half later as part of its plan to shed assets and tackle a cash crunch. Up to Thursday’s close, Hilton’s shares had risen about 36 percent in the last year. They were nearly flat at $83.35 in premarket trading on Friday."

The deal was announced by the property trust’s manager, Goodman (NZ) Ltd, on Friday and represents a move away from commercial property for GMT in the country as it reorients itself closer to Auckland’s industrial market. The VXV portfolio is owned by Wynyard Precinct Holdings Ltd, a joint venture firm held 51 percent by GMT, with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC, holding the balance. The manager said both firms agreed to the sale, which is not expected to have a material impact on GMT’s earnings or distributions for fiscal year 2019. The manager did not name the Blackstone funds involved in the sale. The VXV portfolio includes seven low-rise office buildings, totalling about 88,000 square metres. “With an expected loan-to-value ratio of below 20 percent following this sale, we have substantial capacity for future development and investment opportunities,” said John Dakin, chief executive officer of GMT’s manager. Dakin said that following the deal and other contracted sales, GMT’s NZ$2.2 billion portfolio will be almost fully invested in the industrial market of New Zealand’s largest urban area. While Blackstone has been active in the Australia-New Zealand region, the Goodman deal marks the latest move in the countries’ real estate space for the alternative investment firm’s largest fee-grossing line of business. According to sources, a Blackstone unit was the buyer when indebted Chinese conglomerate HNA Group announced the sale of a Sydney office building for A$205 million ($154.00 million) earlier this year. The growth of Blackstone’s real estate business has been a factor in former real estate head and Blackstone lifer Jon Gray being named its chief operating officer and president in February.

11.861931439783016," Blackstone's F&R acquisition to close in late summer LONDON (LPC) - US private equity firm Blackstone Group’s US$20bn acquisition of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ TRI.TO Financial and Risk (F&R) unit is expected to close in late summer as regulatory requirements make a targeted July 1 completion look increasingly unlikely, sources familiar with the matter said. The acquisition is expected to close in September, most likely at the end of the month, which is also the end of the third quarter, several sources said. “It is likely to slip to September. It is easier to close at the end of the quarter when the numbers come through,” a senior source said. A deadline of the end of July has been set for EU approvals and the deal could close earlier if it gets swift regulatory approval, the sources said. Thomson Reuters said on May 2 that the acquisition is expected to close in the second half of the year and is subject to specified regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The company will report its first-quarter earnings on May 11, 2018. Blackstone announced on January 30 that it is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR. A US$13.5bn-equivalent loan and bond financing backing the acquisition is expected to launch in early September, after the market reconvenes after the August summer holiday. “The debt deal will come in early September. They will get back from holiday, do a roadshow then launch,” the senior source said. The deal, which is being led by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, is the biggest buyout financing since the financial crisis. A post-summer syndication will leave the underwriting banks on risk over the holiday period, something which is becoming more common as large cross-border acquisitions run into increasingly lengthy regulatory approval processes. The three lead banks reduced their risk when 21 senior banks were signed into the deal in March and underwrote 28% of the transaction. Invitations to participate in the deal at this level were linked to the amount of business that banks do with Thomson Reuters. Blackstone was able to command favorable financing terms when the deal was put in place before a period of increased market volatility in February, but step ups in market flex terms and debt caps have been included to give banks additional protection, several market sources said. Thomson Reuters declined to comment. JP Morgan, Citigroup and BoAML declined to comment. Blackstone was not immediately available to comment. The debt financing includes a US$8bn-equivalent term loan B, which is split between US$5.5bn and US$2.5bn-equivalent in euros. The financing also includes US$3bn-equivalent of secured bonds split between US$2bn and US$1bn-equivalent in euros, and US$2.5bn-equivalent of unsecured bonds split between US$1.8bn and US$700m-equivalent in euros. The company will also place a US$750m revolving credit facility. Additional funding comes from US$1bn in preferred equity – with a 14.5% Payment-In-Kind (PIK) coupon – US$3bn of cash equity that Blackstone is contributing, and US$2.5bn of existing equity, based on the US$20bn valuation, that will be rolled over.

12.794935225292429," Blackstone first quarter earnings better than feared as Gray lays out roadmap (Reuters) - Bets on Spanish housing and oil assets helped Blackstone Group LP BX.N mitigate stock market jitters that weighed on it in the first quarter, with earnings at the world's largest manager of alternative assets falling less than expected. Profits have soared at private equity firms such as Blackstone in recent years, as a U.S. stock market rally allowed them to sell assets for top dollar. That rally came to an end in the first quarter, amid a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China. Blackstone reported a 20 percent drop in economic net income per share on Thursday but still beat Wall Street’s expectations. “We had a solid start to the year,” President and Chief Operating Officer Jon Gray said in a call with reporters. Economic net income per share came in at 65 cents in the quarter, down from 81 cents a year ago. Analysts on average expected 45 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This backdrop for the first quarter was a bit more challenging than we’ve seen in some time in terms of just the broader markets, but they’ve performed pretty well against that,” said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan, who rates the stock “market outperform”. Blackstone’s assets under management swelled to $449.6 billion from $434 billion at year-end 2017, and a 14 percent rise in fee-related earnings that are linked to a management fee on the assets held for investors also supported results. As a sweetener for investors, Blackstone said it plans to pay a 30 cent special dividend in 2018, returning to shareholders a portion of the proceeds from the conclusion of its partnership with FS Investment Corp. Shares closed 1 percent higher at $32.12. Blackstone presented results for the first time since its Gray, formerly its real estate chief, was made president and COO earlier this year, a promotion which set him up as successor to Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman. “I start with a Hippocratic oath: to do no harm,” Gray said. “But I do have a few key areas of focus.” Gray indicated Blackstone wants to manage more money for retail and insurance investors and bolster growth investments in emerging markets and in areas like life sciences and technology. Attracting more retail and insurance money is not a new initiative for Blackstone - around 20 percent of its $18 billion inflows in the quarter were from retail investors - but Gray said this is still in “very early days.” “Retail is a $50 trillion market, insurance $30 trillion. Both have low single-digit exposure to alternatives,” he said. Blackstone could broaden its appeal to retail investors by meeting requirements to trade more easily in and out of their investments and to insurers by having more structured products with appropriate ratings, Gray said. In January, Blackstone agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.NTRI.TO, the parent company of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal.
