-4.411876882795509," Utility NiSource to pay $56 million to resolve Massachusetts gas blasts probe BOSTON (Reuters) - NiSource Inc will pay $56 million to resolve a probe into Massachusetts gas explosions in 2018 linked to a utility it owns that killed one person and destroyed multiple buildings, the state’s attorney general said Thursday. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said the settlement with NiSource and its subsidiary Columbia Gas of Massachusetts will provide debt relief to low-income gas customers and pay for clean energy programs. The settlement resolves Healey’s probe into Columbia for violating consumer protection laws and an investigation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities into its pipeline safety compliance and response to the explosions. The Sept. 13, 2018, disaster occurred in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, three communities northwest of Boston. Columbia was replacing aging cast-iron pipes with plastic lines. The blasts killed one person, injured 22 others, damaged about 131 homes and commercial buildings and prompted the evacuation of thousands of residents. “We are pleased to have reached resolution on all pending investigations related to the Merrimack Valley incident,” Dean Lieberman, a spokesman for Merrillville, Indiana-based NiSource, said in a statement. In March, Columbia pleaded guilty to violating a federal pipeline safety law as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department in which it agreed to pay $53 million. That deal, like Thursday’s state accord, also required the company to leave Massachusetts, prompting NiSource to agree to sell Columbia’s assets to Eversource Energy for $1.1 billion. The asset transfer is expected on Nov. 1, at which time Eversource will be required to implement a safety program and address any remaining remedial actions, Healey’s office said. NiSource has already spent about $1 billion addressing the explosions, including $143 million to resolve class action claims by businesses and residents."

-13.905393401083217," Utility operator NiSource to sell Massachusetts operations after gas explosions probe BOSTON (Reuters) - Utility operator NiSource Inc on Wednesday agreed to sell its Massachusetts operations to Eversource Energy for $1.1 billion after striking a deal with prosecutors to resolve a probe into catastrophic gas explosions there in 2018. News of the sale came after federal prosecutors in Boston said Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, the NiSource unit that Eversource agreed to buy, would plead guilty to violating a federal pipeline safety law and pay a $53 million fine. Columbia is scheduled to plead guilty on March 9 to violating the Pipeline Safety Act to resolve a probe into the disaster, which killed one person, injured 22 others and destroyed multiple buildings in three communities northwest of Boston. NiSource, as part of a deferred prosecution deal, agreed to sell Columbia and leave Massachusetts, a condition U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said was meant to “vindicate” the outrage of residents in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover. “Clearly what happened here is this particular company couldn’t be bothered to maintain the safety of its customers,” Lelling said. Merrillville, Indiana-based NiSource, which serves nearly four million natural gas and electric customers across seven states, said in a statement it took full responsibility for the “tragic events.” NiSource said it expects the deal with Eversource to close in the third quarter of 2020. Prosecutors said Columbia’s operations will be subject to monitoring during a three-year probationary period. Prosecutors said NiSource would forfeit to the government any profits from selling Columbia. Prosecutors said Columbia recklessly disregarded minimum federal safety standards, causing its gas pipelines to become over-pressurized, which led to the Sept. 13, 2018, explosions. The blasts occurred while Columbia was replacing cast-iron pipes with plastic lines. They damaged about 131 homes and commercial buildings and prompted the evacuation of thousands of residents. Prosecutors said Columbia failed to account for pressure detectors while workers replaced aging cast-iron pipes and failed to follow any plan to prevent the over-pressurization that resulted. The allegations mirrored the findings of the National Transportation Safety Board, which in September said that “weak engineering management” did not adequately plan and oversee the project. The accord is separate from a $143 million settlement the company reached in July to resolve lawsuits brought by residents and businesses affected by the explosions, and an $80 million accord it struck with the three communities. Columbia also last year reached a settlement with the family of a teenager killed during the gas explosions."

-7.7676462420242," NiSource settles Massachusetts gas explosion lawsuits for $143 million BOSTON (Reuters) - Utility operator NiSource Inc on Monday said it will pay $143 million to resolve class action lawsuits brought by residents and businesses that suffered losses caused by a series of gas explosions in three Massachusetts communities last year. NiSource and its Columbia Gas of Massachusetts unit said the accord will resolve claims by thousands or residents and businesses affected by the disaster, which killed one person, injured at least 21 others and destroyed multiple buildings. The blasts in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, communities northwest of Boston, occurred while Columbia Gas was replacing cast-iron pipe with plastic lines and prompted large-scale evacuations of thousands of residents. The settlement is separate from an $80 million accord that the company reached with the three communities in May and a recent settlement between Columbia and the family of a teenager killed during the gas explosions. The company said the class action settlements require court approval and are part of the $1 billion Merrillville, Indiana-based NiSource has dedicated to addressing the needs of customers, residents and communities affected by the disaster. “What happened last September was tragic, and we will always be mindful of its impact on our customers and everyone in the communities we serve, including those represented by this settlement,” NiSource Chief Executive Joe Hamrock said in a statement. The lawsuits were filed soon after the explosion and accused the company of inadequately maintaining its distribution system. Lawyers for the plaintiffs claimed in court papers the gas pipeline system used by Columbia Gas to service those communities was poorly maintained, antiquated and highly dangerous. “We believe this settlement will do the most good for the greatest number of affected people and businesses, as quickly as possible,” John Roddy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. In November 2018, the National Transportation Safety Board said NiSource Inc had failed to adequately draft and oversee natural gas pipeline work orders and those lapses led to the incident. Federal prosecutors in Boston and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have also opened investigations related to the disaster, the company has said."

6.208925033599373," NiSource lapses led to deadly Massachusetts blast: federal agency (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday that utility company NiSource Inc failed to adequately draft and oversee natural gas pipeline work orders and those lapses led to deadly blasts in three Massachusetts communities in September. The federal regulator said in a review of how Columbia Gas Co of Massachusetts, a subsidiary of NiSource, handled pipeline repair work that better construction orders could have prevented the disaster. Explosions and fires that killed one person, injured 21 and damaged 131 buildings erupted as Columbia Gas was replacing cast-iron pipe with plastic lines. Utilities have told state regulators that thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines in Massachusetts are leak-prone and need repairs. The National Transportation Safety Board said that a field engineer who developed the work orders told investigators that he did not recognize the critical role of pressure sensors in the work and did not document the location of the regulator-sensing lines that, when disconnected, flooded the system with high-pressure gas. The agency recommended that NiSource revise its review process, update its records and documentation and be able to immediately shut down gas pipeline systems during repairs. It said Massachusetts should require professional engineers to sign off on utility company work orders, which is not currently required. The review expanded on a preliminary study into the explosions and fires in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, Massachusetts. NiSource, based in Merrillville, Indiana, said in a statement that it would adopt the agency’s safety recommendations at all of its utility companies, and spend $150 million to install devices that would “slam shut” gas lines when they sense pressure reaching risky levels. The company said in a regulatory filing this month that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts was conducting a criminal probe of the company as a result of the disaster. It was the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline accident since 2010 in terms of structures involved. Eight years ago, an interstate gas transmission line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Co ruptured in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, destroying 38 buildings and damaging 70 others, according to the National Transportation Safety Board."
5.597155073613267," NiSource discloses criminal probe of Massachusetts gas pipeline explosions HOUSTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation of utility company NiSource Inc over gas explosions and fires in three Massachusetts communities that killed one person and injured at least 21 others in September, the company disclosed on Thursday. Grand jury subpoenas were served to NiSource and its subsidiary Columbia Gas of Massachusetts on Sept. 24, according to a NiSource regulatory filing. The company said it is cooperating with the investigation. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts is conducting the probe, NiSource said in its filing. The explosions occurred in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, all communities northwest of Boston, while Columbia Gas of Massachusetts was conducting repairs on its system. Fires erupted after the gas lines became over-pressurized, and critical valves controlling the flow of gas were not shut for almost 3-1/2 hours after the first alarm was raised. NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen declined to comment on details related to the investigation, and a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, whose office is overseeing the investigation, also declined to comment. NiSource recorded $461.9 million in expenses related to the incident in its third quarter and said it expected to recover most of those costs through insurance. The company has liability insurance for damages up to roughly $800 million, according to its filing. Shares of NiSource were up less than 1 percent in morning trading at $25.56. The disaster was the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline incident since 2010 in terms of structures involved, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Eight years ago, a gas transmission line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company ruptured in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, destroying 38 buildings and damaging 70 others. NiSource said it replaced all of the 45-mile distribution network necessary to return service to Massachusetts customers impacted by the explosions, but that it had further work to do. It anticipates restoring service to all customers affected by the gas-line explosion by Dec. 16, executives said on the call."
2.9382217632344827," Lawsuit targets Massachusetts utility over deadly gas explosions BOSTON (Reuters) - A resident of a Massachusetts city rocked by last week’s deadly gas blasts that damaged dozens of homes sued utility operator NiSource Inc on Tuesday, accusing it of inadequately maintaining its distribution system. The proposed class action lawsuit targets NiSource and its subsidiary Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which services Andover, North Andover and Lawrence, three communities northwest of Boston that staged large-scale evacuations following the Thursday afternoon blasts that killed one person and injured at least 25. The lawsuit in Essex County Superior Court is the first to be filed after Thursday’s explosions. It claims the gas pipeline system used by Columbia Gas to service those communities was “poorly maintained, antiquated, obsolete, and highly dangerous.” Merrillville, Indiana-based NiSource did not respond to a request for comment. It has set up set up a phone center and an office to accept residents’ claims for property damage and costs related to the fires and evacuation. The lawsuit said the company failed to implement reasonable safety and leak prevention practices and failed to replace obsolete high-risk materials in the system, which used pipelines constructed of cast and wrought iron rather than plastic. The complaint, filed by Lawrence resident Francely Acosta, who was forced to evacuate, accused NiSource of negligence and creating a public nuisance by failing to maintain gas pressure in its “antiquated” system, which it blamed for Thursday’s explosions. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of residents affected by the incident and an order requiring NiSource to stop operating its system in an unsafe manner. The blasts on Thursday destroyed as many as 80 houses in the largest natural gas pipeline accident in the United States since 2010. Some 8,000 people were displaced amid evacuations of entire neighborhoods as firefighters raced for hours from one blaze to another and utility crews rushed to shut off gas and electricity. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, which Columbia Gas has said affected 8,600 of its customers. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt on Sunday said over-pressurization of the gas distribution system was to blame and that the agency was looking at pressure sensors attached to a line that was taken out of service before the explosions. In a letter to NiSource on Monday, U.S. Senators Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats of Massachusetts, said the pressure in the pipeline system had been 12 times greater than it was intended to hold."

All that changed in the aftermath of Thursday’s gas explosions across three suburbs north of Boston that left at least one person dead, injured at least a dozen more, and drove thousands from their homes. The cause of the blasts remains under investigation. The area is served by the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts unit of NiSource, whose shares fell 11.7 percent to close at $24.79 on Friday. In an afternoon news conference officials including Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker criticized Columbia Gas for what they said was an inadequate response to the explosions. They cited issues including poor communications with local police and fire crews. Baker said he was using an emergency authority to put a different local utility, Eversource Energy ES.N, in charge of the local response. “The follow-through just wasn’t there,” Baker said of Columbia Gas. Asked about Baker’s comments, NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen referred to statements from Columbia Gas President Steve Bryant, who spoke to reporters at a separate news conference after Baker’s. Bryant said the utility is “sorry” and said that amid difficulties, “we advanced this as rapidly as it could possibly be advanced.” The share-price decline reflects concerns about potentially higher NiSource spending and penalties, said Morningstar analyst Charles Fishman. He expects regulators eventually will approve rates to cover more infrastructure spending at what is a minor piece of the sprawling Indiana-based utility holding company. “This is certainly a tragedy. From an investment standpoint, for NiSource, this is a small part of their system,” Fishman said. Guggenheim Partners analyst Shar Pourreza said his current ""neutral"" rating on NiSource mainly reflects its high valuation, driven by a strong earnings and growth outlook. With a gain of 138 percent over the past five years through Thursday, NiSource had outperformed all other utilities in the S&P 500 .SPLRCU, with that sector gaining just 46 percent in the period.
