6.794968831557781," U.S. FERC delivers blow to Oregon LNG terminal, upholds state's permit denial WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. energy regulators on Tuesday upheld Oregon’s denial for a clean water permit for the Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, dealing a blow to plans for an export terminal favored by the Trump administration. Last March, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had approved Pembina Pipeline Corp’s plan to build and operate a natural gas pipeline and LNG export terminal at Jordan Cove in Oregon. The Trump administration had also tried to fast track environmental reviews of the project. But amid opposition from tribes and environmentalists, the $10 billion project failed to get water permits from the state of Oregon. The project petitioned FERC to override Oregon’s decision saying it had waived its authority under the federal Clean Water Act. But FERC decided unanimously that Oregon had not waived its authority. Backers of Jordan Cove stressed that its position on the West Coast would put it closer to fast-growing Asian markets than terminals along the Gulf Coast, which have to send LNG through the recently congested Panama Canal. They had hoped the project would be operational by 2025. Jordan Cove is designed to produce 7.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, equivalent to around 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas, or enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. It would include five liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and the 229-mile (369-kilometer) Pacific Connector pipeline capable of transporting up to 1.2 bcfd of gas. Oregon Governor Kate Brown said on Twitter she was happy with FERC’s decision. “At every stage of the regulatory process, I have insisted that the Jordan Cove LNG project must meet Oregon’s rigorous standards for protecting the environment, or it cannot move forward,” Brown said."
19.101927467472667," Pembina Pipeline expects lower spending in 2021, suspends joint project (Reuters) - Canada’s Pembina Pipeline Corp on Monday forecast 2021 capital investment to be C$785 million ($616.27 million), lower than 2020 projection, and said it would suspend execution of a joint venture project in the Alberta province indefinitely. A sharp decline in global crude prices and demand destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have battered Canada, which was already selling its oil at steep discounts. Although prices have recovered from historic lows hit earlier this year, producers are resuming their shut-in drilling and increasing capital spending. Pembina also said significant risks, mainly project costs, arising from the pandemic require the company and partner Petrochemical Industries Co KSC to suspend execution of the their joint project, Canada Kuwait Petrochemical Ltd Partnership, indefinitely. Pembina announced a final investment decision for a C$4.5-billion plant in partnership with Kuwait’s Petrochemical Industries in 2019. The Canadian company said on Monday it expects 2021 adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of C$3.2 billion to C$3.4 billion. Last week, U.S. pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc said it expects to generate higher income in 2021, while Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc forecast higher core earnings in 2021 as the companies bet on a faster rebound in demand.

-13.565295517235926," E.ON sees regulatory risks as British grid up for sale FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - E.ON EONGn.DE on Wednesday stopped short of expressing interest in the British networks unit that U.S. utility PPL PPL.N put up for sale earlier this week, pointing to the shaky regulatory environment in the country. PPL on Monday said it had decided to launch a sales process for Western Power Distribution (WPD), which has a regulatory asset value of 7.7 billion pounds ($10.1 billion), adding it had hired JP Morgan JPM.N to run the process. “Last year Mr (Jeremy) Corbyn wanted to nationalise these assets,” Teyssen said when asked whether E.ON would be interested, referring to respective proposals by the former Labour leader in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Teyssen also said that the next regulatory regime for Britain’s networks, which sets fixed investment returns for grid owners, would only be decided next year. PPL said it aims for a deal in the first half of 2021. ""It's a deja vu for us,"" Teyssen said, adding E.ON previously owned part of the business before selling here it to PPL for 3.5 billion pounds in 2011."
88.17504143631785," U.S. approves Pembina's proposed Jordan Cove LNG export plant in Oregon (Reuters) - U.S. energy regulators on Thursday approved Canadian energy company Pembina Pipeline Corp’s plan to build and operate a natural gas pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal at Jordan Cove in Oregon. “The recent fall in LNG prices to record lows has not dented investor interest in setting up new LNG export facilities in the United States,” Neil Chatterjee, chairman of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), said after the agency authorized the Jordan Cove project. Chatterjee was referring to a decline in global gas prices to record or near record lows. Even before the coronavirus cut economic growth and reduced demand for energy around the world, gas prices were already at their lowest in years due to mild winter weather, record amounts of storage in Europe, the U.S.-China trade war and an oversupply of LNG after several new export plants entered service over the past year. FERC Commissioner Richard Glick, the lone Democrat on the commission, voted against the Jordan Cove authorization. “As is the norm these days, this order fails to consider the impact the projects’ greenhouse gas emissions will have on climate change,” Glick said, noting the project would significantly impact 20 threatened and endangered species, historic properties and create short-term housing issues. “We must evaluate whether the proposed LNG projects we are reviewing are actually going to be built,” Glick said. Officials at the company were not immediately available to say when they plan to make a final investment decision to build the project. In mid-2019, the company said the $10 billion Jordan Cove project could enter service in 2025. Jordan Cove is one of more than three dozen LNG export projects under development in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Analysts, however, have said they expect only a handful of those projects to enter service over the next decade. Jordan Cove is designed to produce 7.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, equivalent to around 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. It would include five liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and the 229-mile (369-kilometer) Pacific Connector pipeline capable of transporting up to 1.2 bcfd of gas. As proposed, the LNG terminal would be called upon by about 120 LNG carriers per year, FERC has said."

10.380149594790385," Pembina Oregon Jordan Cove LNG export terminal passes environmental test (Reuters) - Canadian energy company Pembina Pipeline Corp's PPL.TO proposed Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas export plant in Oregon took a step toward receiving federal approval for construction on Friday after U.S. regulators issued a final environmental report. In the report, known as an environmental impact statement, staff at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) concluded construction and operation of the project would result in some adverse environmental impacts, but most of these would be reduced to less-than-significant levels with mitigation measures. FERC acknowledged some impacts would be significant, however. Construction of the project would “temporarily, but significantly impact housing in Coos Bay,” it said, adding that the project would “permanently and significantly impact the visual character of Coos Bay.” The project could also have a significant impact on the Southwest Oregon Regional Airport operations, FERC said. Additionally, constructing and operating the project was likely to adversely affect 18 federally-listed or proposed threatened and endangered species, it said. Jordan Cove is designed to produce 7.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, equivalent to around 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. It would include five liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and the 229-mile (369-kilometer) Pacific Connector pipeline that would be capable of transporting up to 1.2 bcfd of gas. As proposed, the LNG terminal would be called upon by about 120 LNG carriers per year, FERC said in a release. Earlier this year, Pembina said the project would cost about $10 billion and could enter service in 2025. Officials at Jordan Cove said they were reading the federal report and could not immediately comment on it. Jordan Cove is one of more than three dozen LNG export projects under development in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Just looking at the projects under construction, U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 6.9 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 9.6 bcfd by the end of 2020 from 6.8 bcfd now. That keeps the United States on track to become the third biggest LNG exporter in the world in 2019, behind Qatar and Australia, and the biggest supplier of the fuel in 2024."
-1.496184142313446," Canada's Pembina Pipeline makes storage play with $3.3 billion Kinder Morgan deal (Reuters) - Canada's Pembina Pipeline Corp PPL.TO has agreed to buy Kinder Morgan Canada KML.TO and the U.S. portion of the Cochin pipeline for C$4.35 billion ($3.28 billion), bulking up its storage resources in Canada. Years of delay in building new pipelines have led to Western Canada’s oil production outpacing takeaway capacity and driven up demand for storage tanks. Pembina's deal follows an unsolicited bid for rival Inter Pipeline Ltd IPL.TO, highlighting growing interest in the midstream business of transporting and storing crude. The sale of Kinder Morgan Canada, whose parent is Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc KMI.N, also represents the exit of another foreign company from Canada's oil sector. The deal “makes sense” for Pembina, said Tortoise Advisors portfolio manager Rob Thummel. It receives stable revenue streams based on fees and take or pay contracts that are insulated from volatile commodity prices “It shows particularly in down markets, who’s got quality and who doesn’t. This thing’s going to be a rock through any market,” said Pembina Chief Executive Mick Dilger on a conference call. Kinder Morgan Canada shares spiked 35% reflecting the deal’s premium, while Pembina shares slipped 0.4% in Toronto. The Cochin pipeline can carry 95,000 barrels per day of U.S. condensate - an ultra-light oil - into Alberta to dilute the heavy crude it produces. Reversing that pipeline would ease constraints on Canadian export pipelines, and Dilger said the company may consider that option. The acquisition, including terminals at Vancouver, British Columbia and Edmonton, Alberta, would make Pembina a logical operator of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which the Canadian government is attempting to expand and sell, Dilger said. But the company is not interested for now in buying the project, which has attracted fierce opposition from environmental and some indigenous groups. ““We don’t want to subject our entire management team and reputation to all the noise that entails,” Dilger said. Pembina receives facilities to load trains with crude in Edmonton, Alberta that are co-owned by Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.TO, but is uncertain whether they fit with the company's business. “We’ll have a hard look at it,” Dilger said. “If either immediately or two years from now that doesn’t make sense for us, then we’ll do the right thing.” Pembina will pay C$2.3 billion ($1.73 billion) for Kinder Morgan Canada and C$2.05 billion for the U.S. portion of the Cochin pipeline system from U.S.-based Kinder Morgan Inc KMI.N. “This is the transaction the market wanted earlier this year,” brokerage Credit Suisse said, adding that valuation was in line with its original expectations. Kinder Morgan Canada had earlier explored sale options but in May decided to continue as a stand-alone entity. The company said it got Pembina’s proposal two months after the review was concluded. Shareholders of Kinder Morgan Canada will receive about 0.3068 shares of Pembina for each of their own shares, valuing Kinder Morgan Canada at C$15.12 per share based on Tuesday’s close. Kinder Morgan Inc will get about 25 million shares, or slightly less than 5%, of Pembina, which they eventually plan to convert to cash. Pembina expects the cash consideration for the Cochin US deal to be initially funded from debt and expects to raise its monthly dividend rate by 5% or $0.01 per share, after the deal closes. TD Securities acted as exclusive financial adviser to Pembina, while J.P. Morgan served as financial adviser to Kinder Morgan Canada. BMO Capital Markets was the financial adviser to Kinder Morgan Canada’s special committee."
