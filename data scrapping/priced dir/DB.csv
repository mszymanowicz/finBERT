29.213483146067425," Analysis: Merkel's vote of confidence in Deutsche Bank belies lender's problems FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Angela Merkel will give a welcome speech at Deutsche Bank’s annual New Year reception on Thursday, marking a rare appearance by the German chancellor at an event by a bank that for years has been battling losses and scandals. Merkel will be speaking just a week after the lender reported its first annual profit since 2014, an important milestone in CEO Christian Sewing’s efforts to revive Deutsche’s fortunes. But investors and analysts said that despite Merkel’s symbolic vote of confidence, the bank’s prospects remain uncertain. They applaud Sewing for cutting costs but question the bank’s ability to generate income after revenue in all its core businesses fell last year apart from the investment bank. Thanks to a pandemic-sparked trading boom, Deutsche managed to make lemonade out of lemons last year, said Alexandra Annecke, portfolio manager at Union Investment, a shareholder in the bank. “The bank is still on thin ice.” Deutsche, which is in the midst of a major overhaul, is forecast to make 1.6 billion euros less in revenue in 2022 than in 2020, a drop of 6%, based on a consensus forecast of analysts. All divisions are expected to generate roughly the same or less over that period, with the exception of asset management. The bank declined to comment for this story. “We have to ask Christian Sewing where he wants to earn his money in the next three to five years,” Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said. “The bank needs more fields where they can earn the money they need.” Deutsche has some ideas in the pipeline. The private bank division that focuses on retail customers, with its 22 million clients, hopes to broaden the number of customers that are charged fees for deposits, bankers at the unit have said. The asset management division is seeking to grow in Asia, while the corporate bank wants to expand in the area of merchant payments. “It’s actually crucial ... to revitalise the corporate banking franchise in those areas where they so far lack presence,” said Michael Rohr, analyst with Moody’s, one of the ratings agencies that has become more confident in the bank’s outlook. Increasing profitability in the other areas is important to diversify the bank’s revenue streams, Ioana Sima, a director at Fitch, said. “If the investment bank has a bad year, which it may have, then these other businesses are able to carry it,” Sima said. Sewing has said the investment bank should contribute only 30% of core revenues. In 2020, it accounted for close to 40%. Low interest rates and fierce competition have depressed profits for banks across Europe, which is why Sewing, who took the helm in 2018 to turn the bank around, has largely focused on costs. He is cutting 18,000 jobs and has closed some businesses. Merkel has largely kept her distance from the country’s banking industry since the 2008 financial crisis triggered unpopular taxpayer-financed bailouts. This year, Merkel’s office said she was delighted to accept Sewing’s invitation to Thursday’s reception, which will be virtual. “In view of the 150-year history of Germany’s largest bank, and the importance of the German banking industry in the current challenging situation, an appreciative tribute is only natural,” her office said. Privately, bankers have grumbled that Germany’s politicians are loath to support the industry as they would other sectors, like cars. As well as financial troubles, Deutsche has had to cope with a series of scandals and costly regulatory failings, including over money laundering. In his efforts to turn the page on this era, Sewing has bolstered the bank’s compliance operations. He has urged employees to reclaim their “hunter mentality” and has preached ruthless cost control. But it is too early to judge whether he has succeeded in turning the bank around. “The jury is still out,” said Giles Edwards, analyst with S&P."
33.90151515151515," Taiwan punishes Deutsche Bank, others in currency speculation case TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s central bank said on Sunday it had banned Deutsche Bank from trading Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards and suspended it for two years from trading forex derivatives as part of a crackdown on speculation. The Taiwan dollar is at its highest in more than 23 years against the U.S. dollar as the island’s trade-dependent economy booms on global demand for its tech products fuelled by people working from home. The central bank has been particularly concerned about a case where it said foreign banks helped grain companies engage in currency speculation through deliverable forwards, affecting the stability of Taiwan’s foreign exchange market. Sources told Reuters on Friday that the central bank had sent letters outlining punishments to Deutsche Bank, CitigroupInc, ING and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) for their involvement. Apart from the punishment for Deutsche Bank’s Taipei branch, the central bank said in statement that ING and ANZ’s Taipei offices would not be allowed to trade Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards for nine months. Citi’s Taipei office would be suspended from trading Taiwan dollar deliverable forwards for two months, it added. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: “We are working closely with the CBC and our clients to ensure that FX transactions involving the Taiwan Dollar have a genuine underlying need, and remain committed to playing a constructive role in the ongoing development of Taiwan’s capital markets.” Citi and ANZ declined to comment. Representatives for ING did not respond to a request for comment. The punishments will come into effect on Monday, the central bank said. Eugene Tsai, head of the central bank’s foreign exchange department, told Reuters that transactions made by the banks in accordance with the rules before Friday had been completed on schedule. He added that the punishment against Deutsche meant it would not be able to trade forex options or swaps. The central bank announced its probe into the case last month, which it said involved eight grain-trading companies."

28.7223823246878," Unilever's back to the future goals disappoint (Reuters) - Unilever restored its pre-pandemic sales growth target on Thursday, underwhelming investors seeking more ambitious goals amid strong consumer demand for plant-based food products and home care brands. The Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soap maker said it would be “laser focused” on driving top line sales growth and would invest 1 billion euros in each of 2021 and 2022 in high growth areas including business to business e-commerce retailing, plant-based food and beauty products. This would help Unilever to achieve a long-term underlying sales growth target of 3% to 5%, restoring a previous forecast set in 2020 but pulled in April due to uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Unilever shares were down about 4%. “Even though we have come close to hitting the 3-5% target range in 2020, it is not enough,” Unilever chief executive Alan Jope said. Jope also said the company would be focused on making acquisitions in hygiene, skin care, functional nutrition and plant based foods. Rival consumer goods group P&G last month raised its fiscal 2021 sales growth forecast to a range of 5% to 6%, from 3% to 4%, mainly on the back of a strong first half. The coronavirus pandemic has boosted sales of packaged food companies such as Unilever, Nestle and Kraft Heinz, but there have also been sharp declines in foods served in public places such as on beaches and at restaurants. Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said the company expected the food service business to continue to be hit in Europe, where a spike in cases has led to stringent lockdowns. Pitkethly also said he expects a mid-to-high-single digit rise in raw material costs in the first half of 2021, which Unilever hopes to offset by raising prices. “Looking forward the group sees a return to more predictable sales growth as we move beyond the pandemic later this year,” Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown said. “Ongoing restructuring to position the group further toward digital commerce will hold back earnings in the near term, perhaps explaining the market’s lack of enthusiasm for the numbers this morning,” Clayton said. Unilever’s full-year underlying sales growth came in at 1.9%, in-line with market estimates. Emerging market sales rose 1.2% in the full-year. China returned to growth in the second quarter as restrictions were eased, while India returned to growth in the third quarter. Sales accelerated into the high single digits in the fourth quarter in these two markets. “Slower EM’s (emerging markets) in Q4 is the root cause of the top line miss to Jefferies estimates, playing out against a background of extended lockdown activity worldwide,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. The brokerage expected fourth quarter underlying sales growth of 4.4%. Developed market sales rose 2.9% in 2020, driven by strong demand for in-home foods, ice-cream and hygiene products in North America. In Europe, sales were driven by home care products. The company’s results end a historic year for the company which in November ditched its Anglo-Dutch dual-headed structure in favor of a single corporate entity based in London. Turnover for the quarter came in at 12.1 billion euros ($14.53 billion), versus analysts’ estimates of 12.16 billion euros. Full-year 2020 turnover came in at 50.7 billion euros, slightly lower than the 50.81 billion euros, analysts had expected. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were 2.48 euros, one cent lower than analysts’ estimates. ($1 = 0.8328 euros)"
28.7223823246878," Breakingviews - Deutsche’s trim investment bank is model for peers LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - In recent years, the mere mention of Deutsche Bank’s wholesale business has been enough to elicit a titter from rival bosses. They assumed that Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s 2019 decision to shrink the unit and scrap businesses like equities trading would prompt a client exodus. It hasn’t worked out that way. Sewing revealed on Thursday that Deutsche’s investment banking division generated 1.9 billion euros of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. That was 24% higher than a year earlier, more than double the year-on-year increase reported by American rivals including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Deutsche’s fixed-income and currency trading operations now account for about three-quarters of the unit’s income, with debt underwriting bringing in almost a fifth. Fees from equity offerings and advising on mergers contributed a token amount. Meanwhile costs for the full year, excluding restructuring and legal charges, were about one-tenth lower than in 2019. The slimmed-down franchise is holding its own. In the second half of 2020, Deutsche’s revenue from trading bonds and currencies was 14% of the combined total of the big five American banks, using average quarterly euro-dollar exchange rates. That’s almost exactly the same proportion as in the first six months of 2019, just before Sewing started wielding his machete. Deutsche’s average quarterly share of global debt underwriting fees rose slightly to 3.5% in 2020, according to Dealogic. It’s too early to declare Sewing’s restructuring a success, though. The bank finally climbed out of the red in 2020, but a target for a group-wide 8% return on tangible equity for 2022 still looks hopeless: analysts on average expect less than half that. And investors are apt to feel nervous about the risks building up in the investment bank given Deutsche’s chronic history of control failures. Risk-weighted assets in the unit are now 10% higher than at the end of 2019. Wholesale revenues will probably decline if market volatility ebbs in 2021. Yet Deutsche’s surprising resilience nonetheless proves an important point. As with UBS’ 2012 decision to nix its fixed-income trading business, the German group has shown that it’s possible to lop a whole limb off an investment bank without fatally wounding what remains. HSBC, and Credit Suisse, which both have relatively new CEOs with a mandate to shake things up, ought to be watching closely."
28.7223823246878," Investment banking boom lands Deutsche Bank first profit since 2014 FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank eked out a small annual profit in 2020, its first since 2014, saying on Thursday it had made strong gains at its investment banking division. Over the past 10 years, Deutsche has lost a total 8.2 billion euros ($9.8 billion) and the return to profit marks an important milestone for Chief Executive Christian Sewing as analysts had been predicting another loss in 2020. “We have built firm foundations for sustainable profitability and are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these challenging times,” he said in a statement detailing the results. Sewing was promoted in 2018 to turn around Germany’s biggest bank after years of losses and fines over money laundering failings and its role in the mortgage crisis. Analysts expect Deutsche to deliver another profit in 2021, a consensus forecast of their estimates shows. Deutsche said its net profit attributable to shareholders for 2020 was 113 million euros ($136 million), which compares with a 2019 loss of 5.7 billion euros. Analysts had expected a loss of about 300 million euros for 2020. Deutsche’s shares, which were up 3.6% in early Frankfurt trade, were trading 1.3% lower at 0815 GMT. A big question is how sustainable the profits will be as Deutsche, like its competitors, experienced a trading boom amid market volatility linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. This boosted its investment bank, whose revenue rose 32% to 9.28 billion euros in 2020, and by 28% in its key fixed-income and currency sales and trading business. However, low interest rates and a slowdown in global trade pressured revenue at Deutsche’s other divisions, such as those for corporate and retail clients. A regulatory source said that the investment banking boom had provided welcome relief for Deutsche, but although it is on a firmer footing than a year ago its overall business strength still lags competitors in the European banking industry. Deutsche declined to comment on this. The bank has been trying to become less reliant on its investment bank in an effort to stabilise its business. Sewing, in announcing 18,000 job cuts and the closure of its global equities business in a major revamp announced in 2019, said the investment bank should contribute only 30% of core revenues. In 2020 it accounted for close to 40% of core revenue. Investment banking trading revenues soared globally for the entire industry 2020, research firm Autonomous said in a recent report which said “nobody thinks this is sustainable”. Deutsche believes a good part of its business is. “We see a substantial portion of investment bank growth as sustainable even as markets normalize, as we expect in 2021,” Sewing said, according to prepared remarks to analysts. Sewing told employees in a memo that the division was off to a “very good start” this year. The bank, which broke off talks to merge with Commerzbank two years ago, is trying to make itself fit for a potential merger if an opportunity arises, Deutsche bankers say. One banker with direct knowledge of the matter said Deutsche is getting closer to the issue of potential mergers as consolidation pressures rise. The bank is dealing with the topic, but has no concrete plans, the person said.

31.483253588516757," Staff on strike at Deutsche Bank call centre in for the long haul - union FRANKFURT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Employees on strike at Deutsche Bank’s call centre unit DB Direkt over pay are in it for the long haul, a union official said on Tuesday, signalling more disruption for consumers. About 650 staff in Berlin and Essen have been on an open-ended strike since Saturday as they seek a 6% pay increase, in a significant escalation of a months-long labour dispute. The employees are among the lowest-paid at the German bank, with starting wages of around 12 euros ($14.45) an hour, according to union officials. “The employees are up for a fight,” Roman Eberle, an official with labour union Verdi said. He said customers trying to get through to the bank were facing up to 45 minutes or longer of waiting time. “We are inflicting pain on the bank and are curious to see how sensitive the bank is to pain,” he said. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The bank has so far countered DB Direkt workers’ wage demands with offers of pay increases of 1.5% in two rounds. Banks, including Deutsche Bank, have had to rely more on call centres during the coronavirus crisis and also after branch closures to trim costs. The strike comes as Deutsche Bank is expected to award its higher-earning staff a 20% increase in bonuses for 2020, compared to 2019, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week, in line with an earlier Handelsblatt report."

30.791229742612014," Exclusive: Regulators press Deutsche Bank CEO to drop investment bank role - sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Regulators are pressing Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing to relinquish day-to-day oversight of its sprawling investment bank, two people with knowledge of the matter said. European Central Bank officials have held conversations with Deutsche Bank managers, including Sewing, in which they said the CEO should delegate direct control of the division to another board member, according to the sources, who were involved in or briefed on the discussions. It was unclear when regulators last voiced their concerns directly, but the two people said over the past week that the bank was well aware of their position, with one adding that contact with Deutsche was “constant”. They said regulators fear Sewing has too much on his plate, leaving the investment bank open to operational hazards. While they want Sewing to hand over day-to-say oversight to another manager, he would retain ultimate responsibility as group CEO under their proposals, the sources said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Sewing’s role or any conversations with the ECB on the CEO giving up direct control of the investment banking division. Germany’s biggest bank is one of the few major banks in the world to assign day-to-day oversight of investment banking to its chief executive. At most banks, other board members oversee the division. The investment bank is the German lender’s profit driver, but also the centre of risk for a bank that is deemed one of the most critical to the functioning of the global financial system. Such regulatory concerns come as Deutsche Bank is carrying out an internal investigation, which three separate sources familiar with the matter said was into the suspected mis-selling of risky investment bank products to customers in Spain and elsewhere. The alleged wrongdoing happened as recently as last year, and stretched back to at least 2018, one of those sources said, which would put it under Sewing’s watch. In response to queries about the probe into possible mis-selling of high-risk products, the bank reiterated its previous statement. “We initiated an investigation in relation to our engagement with a limited number of clients,” it said, declining to comment further because the probe is ongoing. One of the two people with knowledge of the conversations with regulators said Deutsche Bank’s internal probe, revealed this month, had hardened the regulators’ resolve to tackle Sewing’s overarching day-to-day duties. But the ECB has long viewed the arrangement with scepticism, while Deutsche Bank has resisted changing, according to both sources. In situations like these the ECB, the euro zone banking supervisor and Deutsche’s chief regulator, primarily relies on the power of persuasion to get its way. Such power can be significant, however, because a good working relationship with the powerful central bank is critical for running the bank. ECB supervisors make decisions on capital requirements, dispatch auditors to lenders and have sway over bonus and dividend payouts. At Deutsche, a New York-based banker, who does not sit on the management board, is in charge of the investment bank and reports to Sewing. But Sewing is responsible for briefing the board on the division’s activities and also gets involved in hiring decisions and client meetings. Sewing, who joined Deutsche in his teens, took control of the investment bank in 2019, a year into his tenure as CEO, in a management reshuffle and overhaul of global operations. Regulators made their concerns known at the time and were assured that the setup would be temporary in order to put a new management structure in place but Deutsche has since taken no action, the sources said. Several months later, in September 2019, the bank said in a public statement that speculation that Sewing would relinquish his investment bank role was false. When Sewing took the helm of the investment bank, it was viewed as Deutsche’s problem child following declines in revenue and scandals involving the sale of mortgage securities and the laundering of money from Russia. Deutsche managers said they would focus more on old-fashioned retail and corporate banking. It hasn’t worked out that way. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created so much volatility in markets that businesses like bond trading made the investment bank the group’s biggest profit engine by far. As a result, Deutsche may have eked out a small profit for 2020, its first since 2014, according to a consensus forecast of analysts ahead of a Feb. 4 earnings report. “A very good part, a substantial part of the outperformance which we have seen in 2020 is deemed sustainable,” Sewing told investors last month."

15.619047619047624," Time to pause? Wall St. grows wary of some stock bubbles LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street is abuzz about stock market bubbles as surges in the share prices of some loss-making firms, red-hot public markets and amateur investors chasing stocks at frothy valuations spark fears of a pullback. A flood of money supply, ultra-low or zero interest rates and COVID-19 vaccine rollouts have sparked a ‘buy everything’ rally, helping world stocks add a whopping $33 trillion in value from their lows of last March. The euphoria is evident in the small cap Russell 2000 index where its component companies with a negative operating profit outperformed the wider index by nearly 50 percentage points over the last year, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data showed. “Pockets of the market have recently demonstrated investor behavior consistent with bubble-like sentiment,” Goldman Sachs analysts led by David Kostin wrote in a note. Goldman noted the outperformance of negative earners was still a far cry from the 140 percentage points clocked during the dotcom boom of 1999-2000 and more in line with that of the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. While that might be of some comfort to investors, JPMorgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka expects “hot” areas of financial markets could be subject to bouts of profit taking which could spread to equity indices. However, he said, those dips could be buying opportunities. Stock valuations have soared to levels not seen since the early 2000s, but this has not caused investors major concern as interest rates are at record lows backed by pledges to keep them there until a recovery is firmly established. For examples of these selective bubbles, look at electric vehicle-related stocks - Tesla is up 8-fold and electric vehicle charging equipment maker Blink Charging by 2000% in the last 52 weeks, while an IPO index has surged 200% since last March versus a mere 57% for the benchmark S&P 500 index. Elevated retail participation has contributed to soaring prices. Retail broker eToro told Reuters it registered more than 380,000 new users in the first 11 days of 2021. U.S. videogame retailer GameStop’s 50% jump on Monday, on top of 250% year-to-date, was attributed by traders to short-sellers quickly buying back into the stock to cover potential losses, defined as a short-squeeze, and retail investors piling in to benefit from the surge. Ninety percent of the respondents in a recent survey by Deutsche Bank said they saw price bubbles in some parts of markets, with a majority expecting Tesla to halve in value by the end of 2021. However, not all the major banks see bubbles. “Everyone’s asking us about bubbles... even the frothiest equity indices still lag well behind performance during previous bubbles,” said Robert Buckland, Citi equity strategist. For example, the S&P trades at 22 times 12-month forward earnings, below the peak of 25 times seen ahead of the dotcom crisis. Citing premia over rock-bottom bond yields, Citi believes equity markets have a long way to go yet. At just over 1%, the yield on the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse index of 10-year government and corporate bonds worldwide is the lowest in the 22-year history of the index - less than half the rate of just two years ago and compared with 6.2% at the height of the dotcom bubble. A rollback of U.S. Federal Reserve easing is seen as a threat to markets but there is no signal of that yet from the central bank. “Equity bubbles are not delicate,” Buckland added. “They don’t burst on the first hint of tightening from central banks. They are run-away trains that misallocate capital, reshape the investment industry and end careers. They take some stopping.” What’s more, for all the signs of speculative excess from hedge fund and investor sentiment surveys - cash stashed in money market funds or in household or corporate savings is still far higher than before the pandemic emerged. “The picture is nuanced – heavy activity in certain stocks and options, but less extreme overall investment flows,” Morgan Stanley’s cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets told clients. “Hedge funds appear optimistic, but many businesses and individuals are still keeping cash on the sidelines given the uncertainty.”"

Fitch rates the German lender BBB, the lowest score from any of the top ratings agencies and just two notches above non-investment grade, also known as junk. The coronavirus pandemic last year prompted credit agencies to take a more pessimistic view of the banking sector but Deutsche’s ratings were already under pressure during years of losses. “The ratings could be upgraded within the next 18 months,” Fitch said on Monday, adding that the bank still faced a “challenging path” on its ambitions for cost cuts and revenues.

11.288888888888884," Bitcoin, U.S. tech stocks seen as biggest market bubbles - investor surveys LONDON (Reuters) - There is growing angst among investors over financial market price bubbles, and top of the list of concerns were the cryptocurrency bitcoin and U.S. tech stocks, two closely followed surveys showed on Tuesday. According to nearly 90% of respondents in Deutsche Bank’s monthly money-manager study, many price bubbles were now being blown. The most extreme though is bitcoin, with nearly half of those surveyed seeing it at a maximum 10 on a 1-10 bubble scale. More generally, too, when asked specifically about the 12-month fate of bitcoin - which surged 300% last year - and electric vehicle maker Tesla which soared nearly 750% and is seen as emblematic of highly priced tech stocks, a majority of respondents said they were now more likely to halve than double in value. A similar Bank of America (BofA) survey showed that buying bitcoin had replaced buying tech stocks as the trade which fund managers saw as most crowded, knocking tech off the top spot for the first time since October 2019 and into second place. The cryptocoin hit a record high $40,000 earlier this month, having rallied more than 900% since a low in March and having only just breached $20,000 in mid-December. Investors were bullish on the outlook for world growth, with the proportion of fund managers surveyed by BofA who said the global economy was in an early-cycle phase, as opposed to a recession, at its highest in 11 years. A record 92% expected higher global inflation over the next year, though Deutsche Bank’s survey also showed 71% expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to resist the temptation to start removing the stimulus that has helped markets rally. The biggest potential tail risks that could unsettle markets in the BofA study were seen vaccine rollout problems (30%), if the Fed did taper its asset purchases (29%) and the Wall Street bubble bursting (18%). For a graphic on Global stock valuations surge:  Still, although fund managers are wary of the bubbles, they weren’t yet backing away from them. BofA said a record 19% of investors - who altogether manage more than $500 billion worth of assets - were currently taking on more risk than normal in their investment portfolios. For a graphic on Risk:  A steeper yield curve - usually where longer-dated borrowing costs rise on expectations that economic growth will allow official interest rates to rise - was expected by a record 83% of BofA investors. That is more than after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the 2013 U.S. Federal Reserve’s “Taper Tantrum” or after the 2016 U.S. election. For a graphic on BofA:  Elsewhere, underowned UK equities saw some money flowing in. But at 15% underweight, it remained pinned as the most underweight region, BofA’s survey showed."

4.778156996587019," Deutsche Bank reaches $130 million settlement over U.S. bribery, commodities New York(Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - *To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel Deutsche Bank AG on Friday agreed to pay more than $130 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into a commodities fraud scheme. This is the latest blow for the German bank that has faced a series of scandals over financial crimes compliance failures. In response to the announcement, the bank vowed to bolster its anti-financial crime compliance program. The payout, roughly two-thirds of which is a criminal fine, is part of a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department and a related civil settlement with the SEC. The accords address activity that occurred between 2008 and 2017. They were made public on Friday at a hearing in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York. The charges stem from a scheme to conceal corrupt payments and bribes made to third-party intermediaries by falsely recording them on Deutsche Bank’s books and records, as well as related internal accounting control violations, and a separate scheme to engage in fraudulent and manipulative commodities trading practices involving publicly-traded precious metals futures contracts, the Justice Department said. “Deutsche Bank engaged in a seven-year course of conduct, during which it failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls regarding the use of company funds and falsified its books and records to conceal corrupt and improper payments,” said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Zink of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Separately, Deutsche Bank traders on three continents sought to manipulate our public financial markets through fraud for five years.” When contacted by Regulatory Intelligence, a bank spokesman cited a statement posted on the institution’s website. ""While we cannot comment on the specifics of the resolutions, we take responsibility for these past actions,"" the bank statement said[here]. ""Our thorough internal investigations, and full cooperation with the DOJ and SEC investigations of these matters, reflect our transparency and determination to put these matters firmly in the past."" The statement added that the bank has increased its anti-financial crime team to more than 1,600 people globally “and we’ll continue to invest significantly in technology this year and in the future, particularly as it relates to anti-financial crime compliance.” U.S. prosecutors accused Deutsche Bank of violating books-and-records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which bars companies with U.S. operations from paying bribes elsewhere. A statement[here] from the Justice Department said the violations included disguising bribes paid to a client's ""decisionmaker"" in Saudi Arabia as ""referral fees"" in order to retain that client's business, and concealing millions of dollars of payments to an intermediary for an Abu Dhabi official by recording them as ""consultancy"" fees. The Justice Department settlement amounts to $79.6 million in the FCPA case[here], $5.6 million for the commodities trading violations, and $1.9 million in victim compensation and interest over the commodities trading violations. The settlement reflects a discount over department guidelines, but less of a reduction that it otherwise would have been, given earlier misconduct by the bank, the department said. The commodities fraud charge arose from Deutsche Bank precious metals futures traders accused of placing fraudulent trades, known as spoofing, to induce other traders to buy and sell futures contracts at prices they otherwise would not have. The SEC order states that millions of dollars in bribe payments were inaccurately recorded as legitimate business expenses and involved invoices and documentation falsified by Deutsche Bank employees[here]. Deutsche agreed in the SEC settlement to pay $43.3 million in disgorgement and interest. “While third parties can assist in legitimate business development activities, it is critical that companies have sufficient internal accounting controls in place to prevent payments to third parties in furtherance of improper purposes,” said Charles Cain, chief of the SEC enforcement division’s FCPA unit. Deutsche Bank is trying to regain profitability after five years of losses, including by exiting some businesses and reducing its workforce by 18,000. The bank has also been trying to restore its image in Washington amid several investigations into its dealings with U.S. President Donald Trump, a longtime client. In 2019, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay more than $16 million to resolve SEC accusations it violated the FCPA by hiring unqualified relatives of government officials in Asia and Russia in order to win or retain business. Credit Suisse Group AG paid $77 million to settle a similar case last year, while JPMorgan Chase & Co agreed in 2016 to pay $264 million to resolve U.S. claims it hired the relatives of Chinese officials to win banking deals.

6.331309627059848," Deutsche Bank call centres disrupted by four-day strike FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank’s call centre staff ended a four-day strike on Wednesday that a union official said led to 45-minute waiting times for customers trying to get through to the bank. Some 650 staff, employed by Deutsche Bank subsidiary DB Direkt in Berlin and Essen, have been seeking a 6% pay increase, but they opted to strike after a fourth round of talks ended without an agreement. The official with the Verdi labour union, Roman Eberle, said the strike accomplished its goal of disrupting business at a critical time for the bank. He said that he had not yet heard from management about resuming talks. Banks, including Deutsche Bank, have had to rely more on call centres during the coronavirus crisis and also after branch closures to trim costs. “Call centres are more important than ever,” Eberle said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Stephan Szukalski, an official with the DBV bank union which also represents Deutsche’s call centre staff, said about 70% of employees participated in the strike."

Deutsche Bank, like most other banks, was forced to supply liquidity to corporate customers ailing from the pandemic, some of which eventually went bust. “That situation has very much normalised”, Muehlen said. “The real economy is entering a phase of repair work, where both public and the private sector will continuously require financial leverage. “We are not out of the woods but we feel certain parts of Asia are ahead of Europe in terms of recovery”, Muehlen said, adding that Asia - which accounts for 13% of Deutsche’s group sales - has the potential to become the single biggest RoTE contributor to the core bank. At group level, Deutsche Bank, which continues to restructure its operations, is aiming for 9% RoTE in its core operations by 2022, compared to 4.3% in the first nine months of 2020 when a pick up in trading after the summer saw it unexpectedly post a small profit. “The world is underinvested in Asia when it comes to capital markets. With a zero interest rate environment around the globe, money will try to go where the growth is and therefore we will see more import of capital into Asia”, Muehlen said. Deutsche Bank is continuing to invest in Asia, including in the region’s largest economy China where regulations for foreign financial institutions including wealth managers and asset management companies have eased further in the last couple of years. “[Wealth management] is one of several areas where China indeed may provide interesting opportunities. But we will not build a retail bank in China”, Muehlen said. Deutsche Bank’s 3 billion euros ($3.63 billion) in annual Asia revenues is generated fairly evenly between corporate banking, its fixed income and currency businesses, credit origination and advisory business and wealth and asset management, including retail banking in India.

To achieve this, we will have to take further measures”, the letter signed by Deutsche Bank board member Karl von Rohr said. The 350 redundancies affecting mainly the Postbank retail banking arm will be made by the end of 2022 and will be carried out in the most socially acceptable way possible, the letter said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Deutsche has lost money for the past five years and has been trying to reverse its fortunes through an overhaul by shedding staff and cutting costs. The bank has hoped to lean more heavily on its divisions serving private customers and corporations, and less on the investment bank, but revenue growth has stagnated amid the pandemic, low interest rates and fierce competition.

5.823293172690745," Exclusive: Tired of Trump, Deutsche Bank games ways to sever ties with the president - sources NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG is looking for ways to end its relationship with President Donald Trump after the U.S. elections, as it tires of the negative publicity stemming from the ties, according to three senior bank officials with direct knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank has about $340 million in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the president’s umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons, according to filings made by Trump to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in July and a senior source within the bank. The three loans, which are against Trump properties and start coming due in two years, are current on payments and personally guaranteed by the president, according to two bank officials. In meetings in recent months, a Deutsche Bank management committee that oversees reputational and other risks for the lender in the Americas region has discussed ways in which it could rid the bank of these last vestiges of the relationship, two of the three bank officials said. The bank has over the years lent Trump more than $2 billion, one of the officials said. One idea that has come up in the meetings: sell the loans in the secondary market, two of the bank officials said. But one of the officials said that idea has not gained traction, in part because it is not clear who would want to buy the loans and the attendant problems that come with it. While it was known that Deutsche Bank has been closely examining its relationship with Trump, including by setting up a working group in 2016 to review the bank’s relationship with him, its recent eagerness to end all ties and the contours of discussions in light of the election have not been previously reported. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. The German bank, which first started lending to Trump in the late 1990s, has been dragged into congressional and other investigations into the real estate mogul-turned-politician’s finances and alleged Russia connections. The probes and the bad press, seen by one senior executive as “serious collateral damage” from the relationship, are an unwelcome distraction for the bank, the three officials said. It comes at a time when Chief Executive Christian Sewing is trying to turn Deutsche Bank around after its decades-long run at becoming a major Wall Street bank left it nursing huge losses. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat member of the Senate banking committee, has previously called for an investigation into Deutsche Bank over its money laundering controls and has demanded answers from the lender about its relationship with Trump and his family. She told Reuters that she intended to keep pushing for a probe in the next administration. “You bet I’m going to continue to fight for accountability and strong enforcement of our banking laws, especially for giant institutions like Deutsche Bank,” she said. What happens next for the bank rests on the outcome of Tuesday’s elections, according to the three bank officials. If the Republican president loses, and Democrats take control of the White House and Congress, senior Deutsche Bank executives believe congressional investigations that have stalled amid a court battle over access to Trump’s financial records could be rejuvenated, the three bank officials said. In this scenario, however, Deutsche Bank executives believe they will also have more freedom to deal with the loans and end their relationship with Trump, the officials said. They hope doing so might help reduce some of the scrutiny, they said. The loans, which are against Trump’s golf course in Miami, and hotels in Washington and Chicago, are such that the Trump Organization has only had to pay interest on them so far, and the entire principal is outstanding, two of the three bank officials said. They come due in 2023 and 2024, the filings show. The businesses backing the loans face challenges. The coronavirus-driven economic slowdown has hit the travel industry, including hotels. Moreover, last month Reuters reported that Trump’s plan to make money by developing houses and hotels on his golf courses, including the one involving the Deutsche Bank loan, had not panned out so far. The Deutsche Bank executives are not unduly concerned about Trump’s ability to repay the loans, given the president’s personal guarantees and the time left before they come due, the three bank officials said. If Trump is not in office, Deutsche Bank executives feel that it would be easier for them to demand repayment, foreclose if he is not able to pay it off or refinance, or try to sell the loans, according to two of the three bank officials. Since Trump has personally guaranteed all the loans, Deutsche Bank could also seize the president’s assets if he is unable to repay, two of the three bank officials said. If Trump wins a second term, Deutsche Bank executives feel their options would be fewer, the three bank officials said. The bank wouldn’t want the negative publicity inherent with seizing assets from a sitting president and would likely extend the loans until he is out of office, two of the bank officials said. The bottom line, the three bank officials said, is that the matter won’t be resolved until well after the election."

13.405405405405407," Investment bank lifts Deutsche to surprise third-quarter profit FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE, Germany's largest lender, reported a surprise return to a third-quarter net profit and upgraded its annual outlook for investment banking revenue, as it navigates a restructuring and the coronavirus pandemic. The lender’s investment banking division, which has long been a drag on earnings, is proving a bright spot as market volatility spurs trading. Deutsche’s top executives said the revenue is expected to slow in the months ahead, but that the division will hold on to some recent market share gains. “We see our revenue growth in the investment bank as much more than just market driven,” Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing told analysts. The bank turned in a profit attributable to shareholders of 182 million euros ($215 million) for July-September, versus a loss of 942 million euros a year earlier. Deutsche last reported a quarterly profit in January-March 2019. JPMorgan, which had projected a quarterly loss, called the results a “positive surprise.” Deutsche shares were up 1.9%, reversing earlier losses and were one of a few gainers in the DAX index of bluechips. Analysts at Citi said it was a good set of results but that they remain sellers of Deutsche Bank’s stock because “the investment bank industry backdrop is unlikely to be as supportive” for Deutsche in 2021. Alexandra Annecke, portfolio manager at Deutsche shareholder Union Investment, said the road to adequate returns and attractive dividends “is still long.” ‘SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER’ Deutsche has lost money for the past five years and has been trying to reverse its fortunes through an overhaul by shedding staff and cutting costs. It has exited some unprofitable businesses, particularly in the investment bank, to allow it to focus on strengths like bond trading. The bank has hoped to lean more heavily on its divisions serving private customers and corporations, and less on the investment bank, but revenue growth has stagnated amid the pandemic, low interest rates and fierce competition. Analysts say the overhaul is starting to show results, but uncertainties stemming from the health crisis remain. For the quarter just ended, Deutsche’s revenue climbed 43% at the investment bank, boosted by a 47% rise in fixed income and currencies. In comparison, investment banking revenue at U.S. banks rose 21% in the quarter, analysts at Barclays said in a research note. Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager at Deka, an investor in Deutsche, said it was good to see the bank had won market share from its U.S. peers. Deutsche said it expected “significantly higher” revenue at the investment bank for 2020, versus prior guidance of “higher.” The bank’s executives said they were monitoring how credit losses accumulate after government measures to help businesses and consumers through the pandemic begin to taper off. Later in the day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold high-level talks to decide on new restrictions to break a second wave of coronavirus infections."
13.405405405405407," Breakingviews - Deutsche CEO will dust off Commerz merger in 2021 LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Christian Sewing has had a surprisingly good year, but 2021 will be harder. The chief executive of 17 billion euro Deutsche Bank will most likely have to abandon his medium-term profitability target. Reviving a merger with rival Commerzbank is the most logical Plan B. A pandemic-fuelled trading boom, relatively low loan losses and heavy cost cuts have helped Sewing in 2020. Deutsche’s shares are up 17% this year, while the Euro STOXX Banks Index is down 45%. In 2021, however, it will become clear that Sewing’s targeted 8% return on tangible equity for 2022 is out of reach. It would require Deutsche to generate 24.5 billion euros of revenue, according to Breakingviews calculations based on Sewing’s own cost targets and analysts’ estimates for loan losses. Even if investment banking income holds steady - which is unlikely as volatility fades - the rest of Deutsche would have to grow at a 1.1% average annual rate. Analysts expect the top line to shrink instead. Sewing’s alternatives are limited. There will be little fat left to cut by 2022, since he has pledged to reduce costs by one-quarter from 2018’s level, and exited businesses such as equities trading. Dusting off the aborted 2019 Commerzbank deal would help. A merger could generate 2.9 billion euros in annual savings, based on the 12% of combined expenses targeted in the recent Caixabank and Bankia merger. Add that to the two banks’ forecast net income, and the new group’s ROTE would reach 7% in 2022, according to Breakingviews calculations based on Refinitiv data. A solo Deutsche would churn out just a 3.1% return that year, analysts reckon. Sewing’s cleanup makes his bank a more appealing partner than in 2019, when the lenders called off talks citing execution risks and capital requirements. Deutsche has shed 27 billion euros of risk-weighted assets through its bad bank, and should finally generate a profit next year. European regulators have also made it clear they won’t necessarily raise capital requirements after mergers. Finally, Commerzbank’s equity value has slumped since early 2019. Assuming a 30% acquisition premium, Deutsche shareholders would own 70% of the new bank, versus 60% in early 2019, giving them more of the upside. Sewing’s revamp might not deliver the hoped-for returns. But at least it’s making Deutsche fit for a deal."

Germany’s biggest bank, which says it owns 55,000 works of art despite a recent streamlining, held its previous sales privately rather than at public auctions. Deutsche and its staff have been through a torrid few years and is in the process of cutting 18,000 jobs and exiting some businesses after years of losses. Over the past year, Deutsche has sold a large triptych by Gerhard Richter that hung in the lobby of its Wall Street office in preparation for a move to a smaller midtown office. It expects to raise more than 10 million euros ($11.8 million) from the planned sale, which will include works from artists including Paul Klee, Max Beckmann, and Hans Hartung. The bank said on Thursday it would reinvest a “significant portion” of the auction proceeds in up-and-coming artists. “We decided really to focus only on contemporary art,” Friedhelm Huette, head of Deutsche’s art activities, said. Deutsche began accumulating art for its offices, lobbies and conference rooms around the globe and as the collection grew, it became a powerful marketing tool, Huette said. “It’s really part of our corporate identity, the DNA of Deutsche Bank,” he added. Christie’s in London and Paris and Ketterer Kunst of Munich will manage the sales over the next three years, kicking off this month with an auction in Paris. “The bank couldn’t have chosen a better time for the sale ...

29.642857142857142," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank CEO to board: mergers not a focus now, sources say FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank chief executive officer Christian Sewing has told the lender’s supervisory board he is not focused on mergers at the moment and is instead concentrating on the bank’s overhaul until 2022, people with knowledge of the matter said. Sewing made the statement at an annual supervisory board meeting held to discuss strategy. It comes amid a growing sense of urgency in Europe about the need for banks to scale up as the coronavirus crisis deals a further blow to the industry after a decade of weak returns. Sewing has spoken before about wanting Deutsche to be an active player in European banking consolidation but he told the meeting, held in recent days, that for now he wants to focus on improving its profitability. The topic of mergers is currently not at the top of the bank’s agenda, the people said. They declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media about private deliberations. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Frankfurt-headquartered bank is finally making progress on a major restructuring, closing and shrinking some business lines while shedding 18,000 staff in an effort to regain profitability after years of losses. Sewing wants to focus on that strategy until 2022, the people said. Last year, Deutsche Bank called off merger talks with domestic rival Commerzbank. It also briefly explored a tie-up with Swiss lender UBS. Other banks are also casting around for possible deals to bulk up balance sheets and cut costs. UBS has looked at how it could absorb smaller rival Credit Suisse and in Spain, which has been badly hit by the pandemic, CaixaBank is buying Bankia for 4.3 billion euros and Sabadell has also held informal talks about a possible tie-up. For Deutsche, it is important that the bank play an active role in the merger process, rather than sit on the sidelines and get swallowed up. Last week, Deutsche Bank’s finance chief underscored the logic behind big bank mergers. “We’ve been very focused on executing on our own strategy, and we think that strategy would prepare us to engage in merger activity when the time comes and the right opportunities arise,” James von Moltke said. The coronavirus pandemic has put banks under additional pressure by keeping interest rates low and forcing them to set aside billions of euros to cover expected losses from soured loans. “The concentration of European banking business is on the way,” said Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW. “Corona will even speed up this process. Due to that 2021, will be a very interesting year on this front.”"

39.87499999999999," Commerzbank poaches Deutsche Bank's Knof as new CEO FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German lender Commerzbank CBKG.DE has poached a senior executive of its larger rival Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE to assume the role of chief executive, filling a leadership vacuum after months of turmoil. Manfred Knof, head of Deutsche Bank’s retail business in Germany, will assume the top spot at Germany’s No. 2 lender on Jan. 1. He succeeds Martin Zielke, who resigned this summer in the wake of a revolt led by the private equity investor Cerberus, one of the lender’s largest shareholders who was pressing for big changes at the bank. The appointment allows Commerzbank to move forward with a new strategic plan that was put on hold until a new leader was found. The bank is looking at branch closures and shedding international staff to save costs. Hans-Joerg Vetter, chairman of Commerzbank’s supervisory board since last month, has told employees that the lender is not a “restructuring case, but Commerzbank must become more efficient”. “It needs to increase its revenues, reduce costs, and to question the status quo,” Vetter told employees, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. In choosing Knof, Vetter overlooked two current Commerzbank board members who had been in the running. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank were in merger talks last year but called them off. Since then, Deutsche Bank launched a broad restructuring that sought to cut nearly 18,000 jobs, while Commerzbank has largely marked time. The initial reaction from one top investor was cautiously optimistic. The focus is now on implementing change, and success will very much depend on the relationship between Vetter and Knof, said the person with knowledge of the investor’s position. Knof will assume office subject to approval from its regulator, the European Central Bank. Knof is an “experienced and highly effective top manager who has proven himself in a wide range of tasks in the financial services industry”, Vetter said. Deutsche Bank’s deputy CEO, Karl von Rohr, will take over Knof’s responsibilities, Deutsche Bank said."

After a two-week trial, Cedric Chanu, of France and the United Arab Emirates, was convicted on seven counts of wire fraud, and James Vorley, of the UK, was found guilty of three counts of wire fraud, the department said in a statement. Vorley and Chanu engaged in a multi-year conspiracy to defraud other traders through spoofing, the placing of orders to buy or sell futures contracts that they never intended to complete, according to their indictment. Vorley worked for Deutsche Bank in London from 2007 to 2015, and Chanu worked for the bank in London and Singapore from 2008 to 2013, the indictment said. Their sentencing has been scheduled for Jan. 21."
33.785450061652284," Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank channelled suspicious money through Lithuania: Danish media COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank DANSKE.CO helped Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE facilitate suspicious trades worth over $600 million through its branch in Lithuania between 2012 and 2015, Danish media outlets reported on Thursday. The reports, by newspapers Berlingske and Politiken and public broadcaster DR, cited leaked documents from Deutsche Bank obtained by the German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung and later shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The documents appear to show that Deutsche Bank moved around 4 billion Danish crowns ($627 million) in so-called mirror trades through Danske Bank in Lithuania, the Danish outlets reported. Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and Danske Bank said it could not comment on specific matters due to ongoing investigations by authorities. In 2017, Deutsche paid a $425 million fine in the United States over a mirror trading scheme, which moved $10 billion out of Russia between 2011 and 2015. Mirror trades - for instance, buying Russian stocks in roubles for one client and selling the identical value of securities in U.S. dollars for a related one - are legal, but can create a pipeline for money laundering. Authorities in the United States and other countries are currently investigating Deutsche Bank’s role in a money laundering scandal in neighbouring Estonia, where 200 billion euros in suspicious payments were made through Danske Bank’s branch. “As we have previously communicated, as a natural consequence of the Estonia case, we are also looking at other parts of our historical business, including in Latvia and Lithuania,” Danske’s Chief Compliance Officer Philippe Vollot said. Danske has sold off its Baltic retail banking businesses, but still has administrative back office operations in Lithuania. Leaked documents known as the FinCEN Files prompted shares in the biggest global banks to drop on Monday after reports by BuzzFeed News and the ICIJ that they had allowed large sums of allegedly illicit funds to move through the financial system. The reports were based on leaked suspicious activity reports filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

30.466830466830448," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank to close 20% of German branches in coronavirus shift FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank plans to shutter one in five branches in Germany as it seeks to save costs and capitalise on the changing habits of customers during the coronavirus pandemic, an executive said. Philipp Gossow, who oversees the retail banking business in Germany, told Reuters that the reduction to some 400 branches from around 500 currently would occur primarily in urban locations and take place “as quickly as possible”. The cull comes as Deutsche Bank undergoes a broad overhaul of its global operations that began in 2019 after years of losses. German banks traditionally operate large numbers of branches compared with those in the Netherlands or Britain, where customers are more comfortable with digital banking. Banks throughout Europe are rethinking their branch strategies in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Deutsche’s rival Commerzbank recently opted to shut 200 of its 1,000 branches and is considering closing hundreds more. “Coronavirus has further changed the demands placed on advisory services and the branch business,” Gossow said. “Even customers who were previously not very familiar with online banking are now doing many simple banking transactions from home on their computer or iPad,” he said. Gossow said more complex advisory services were taking place increasingly by phone or video chat and the bank would invest an undisclosed amount to build out those services. He elaborated on the changes on Tuesday at a conference in Frankfurt and in a memo to staff, in which he acknowledged the changes would mean hardship for some. But the move is not expected to meet strong resistance from employees. The Verdi labour union said in a statement it was “generally right” for Deutsche to review its branch network."
30.466830466830448," Expected bank merger wave puts Deutsche Bank on stand-by FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is preparing for a wave of mergers, its finance chief said on Tuesday, in a potential change for Germany’s biggest lender, which has been focused firmly on a turnaround. Policymakers have long said Europe’s ailing banking sector needs to consolidate, but regulatory and political obstacles have hindered big deals over the past decade. This year, however, has seen major domestic bank tie-ups in Italy and Spain, with bankers saying regulators are now more willing to wave deals through. ""Already since late (2019), and since COVID, things are crystal clear,"" UBS UBSG.S Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti told an annual Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference. “The train left the station in that sense, and consolidation is inevitable,” Ermotti said, adding that Europe faced the risk of its banks becoming too small to survive or compete. Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE chief financial officer James von Moltke said it supported the ""appropriate or valid industrial logic"" of mergers among the region's larger banks. “We’ve been very focused on executing on our own strategy, and we think that strategy would prepare us to engage in merger activity when the time comes and the right opportunities arise,” von Moltke said at the same “virtual” financials conference. “So we are expecting this wave but we are also working hard to prepare on our side,” he said. MERGER ‘CHALLENGES’ There has been growing speculation about a potential deal in Switzerland, heightened last week when the board of UBS, which last year held brief tie-up talks with Deutsche Bank, gathered to discuss strategy. UBS recently examined a potential deal with Credit Suisse, whose executives also expect consolidation. Ermotti, who is due to be replaced at UBS by former ING INGA.AS head Ralph Hamers in November, declined comment on any role the Swiss bank might play in the consolidation. Mergers would be positive for the industry, so long as tie-ups were complementary, he added. Only last year Deutsche Bank called off merger talks with domestic rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE and von Moltke said domestic mergers ""frankly present some challenges"". Raimund Roeseler, who oversees banking supervision at German financial regulator BaFin, said mergers could be helpful, but were not always the solution. “Do we really believe that the problems of the German banking market would be solved if we only had 700 or 500 banks instead of 1,400? I don’t think so,” he told another banking conference."

27.697841726618712," Deutsche Bank: Global GDP to hit pre-COVID-19 levels in mid-2021 LONDON (Reuters) - World economic output will return to its pre-pandemic level by mid-2021 after a stronger-than-expected economic bounce in recent months, Deutsche Bank said on Monday, but bloated debt levels and a shift in policy could heighten the risk of a financial crisis. “Global economic recovery from the depths of the COVID-19 plunge this past winter and spring has proceeded significantly faster than we envisioned,” Peter Hooper, Deutsche global head of economic research wrote in a note to clients. “As Q3 draws toward a close, we estimate that the level of global GDP is about half way back to its pre-virus level, and we now see that journey being completed by the middle of next year, a couple quarters sooner than in our previous forecast.” Deutsche raised its forecast for global GDP, expecting it to shrink 3.9% this year after predicting in May a contraction of 5.9% for 2020. For 2021, Deutsche raised its growth forecast to 5.6% from 5.3%. Yet there was also a lot of uncertainty and potential trouble ahead, Hooper added. Fears over second infection waves gathering momentum in the United States and Europe had increased uncertainty over the economic outlook, with the U.S. election that was “too close to call” adding to the mix. Meanwhile, in Europe a hard Brexit shock was a risk, Deutsche said. And a shift in monetary policy - though some years away - could spell further trouble. “The expansion of debt and potential overvaluation of assets that has been fed by necessarily super easy monetary policy poses the serious risk of a looming global financial crisis as central banks begin to shift away from easy policy,” Hooper wrote. “Any upward surprises to inflation would heighten this risk.”"

The unit of Germany's largest lender, Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE, agreed to pay $157,500 for processing a large payment through the United States that involved a property interest of an oil company in Cyprus designated under the Ukraine sanctions. OFAC said the bank failed to conduct sufficient due diligence on the company. Separately, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas agreed to pay $425,600 for processing payments destined for accounts at a designated financial institution. The bank failed to stop the 61 payments because of lapses in its payment screening tools, according to the Treasury. The bank has said it will review the circumstances of the apparent violation and perform any necessary additional training or changes to the bank’s internal procedures."

The grim outlook from one of Germany’s top bankers comes as many countries in Europe and beyond see rising coronavirus infection rates and governments grapple with how to respond. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing forecast that the economy would not return to normal this year or next year, and that many sectors will be running at 70%-90% capacity, with “serious consequences”. “Many companies will have to adjust to this and manage to be profitable with longer-term lower revenues,” Sewing said at a banking conference.

15.800203873598356," U.S. House panel narrows Deutsche Bank subpoena for Trump records WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday said it had narrowed a subpoena to Deutsche Bank AG for President Donald Trump’s financial records so that it would fall in line with an earlier ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. “The Committee’s subpoena, as amended, clearly satisfies the Court’s new legal test for evaluating Congress’s need for the President’s personal information,” the panel’s chairman, Representative Adam Schiff, said in a statement. Schiff said in a memorandum to other lawmakers that the committee was limiting the timeframe covered by the subpoena and the type of information requested. Deutsche Bank said in a statement that it “will continue to cooperate with all authorized investigations.” The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee has investigated whether the Republican president’s dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments. The House Financial Services Committee has examined possible money laundering in U.S. property deals involving Trump. In a court filing on Wednesday, a lawyer for the House said the Financial Services Committee had narrowed a subpoena to Deutsche Bank and had withdrawn a subpoena to Capital One Financial Corp entirely. The two Democratic-led committees issued subpoenas in April 2019 seeking banking records of Trump, his children and his businesses. Investigators hope the records will reveal whether there are any financial links between Trump and Russia’s government, sources familiar with the probe have said. On July 9, the Supreme Court said lawmakers needed to further explain the need for the records at a lower court, which would then assess the burden placed on the president. That decision likely ensured that Trump’s financial documents, which he has fought to protect from disclosure, will not be turned over to Congress before the Nov. 3 presidential election. But the high court, in a ruling issued the same day, handed a major victory to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, who has also sought Trump’s financial records as part of an investigation into possible New York state tax fraud. The justices rejected a claim by Trump that he had “absolute immunity” from criminal investigation while in office, clearing the way for Vance to likely obtain eight years of Trump’s tax returns in the coming months. Trump has continued to challenge Vance’s subpoena on other grounds, and an argument is scheduled for Sept. 1 before a federal appeals court in New York."

In the country's biggest white collar criminal case, a regulator has accused the investment banks of colluding over a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) 2015 share issue to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX, is also defending the case. But the matter, which has nine defendants including the financial giants and their staff and former staff, has been crawling through the lower court in Sydney since the charges were laid in mid-2018 as defence lawyers question prosecution witnesses to determine the parameters of the complex case. The ruling that the parties must begin a case management hearing on Nov. 24, not Dec. 15 as requested by the prosecution, gives the matter a chance of moving to the Federal Court, where a trial would take place, before the end of the year. “We’ve reached the point where I have to say enough’s enough,” Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson told the Downing Centre Local Court in a short administrative hearing. “It’s not fair to people to leave it too much longer. It needs to leave this court,” she added. Prosecution lawyer Shanaka Jayasuriya told the court the later date would help all parties involved because “the reality is that organising nine separate case conferences is a challenge (and) some of the clients are located overseas”. The matter is being closely watched by financial markets participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted. None of the defendants has entered a formal plea but all have said they will plead not guilty to the charges which potentially carry prison terms."
10.08676789587852," Deutsche Bank ups 2020 GDP outlook on faster COVID-19 recovery (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said on Thursday it had revised up its GDP forecasts for 2020, noting that recovery from the coronavirus-induced plunge in economic activity was progressing faster than it had earlier expected. The biggest revision came in the euro zone where Deutsche now forecasts the economy to contract 8.6% this year compared to the previous expectation of a 12% decline. “In the Euro-area, the Q2 outcome tells us that activity did not plunge quite as far as feared in lockdown. It also tells us that the post-lockdown rebound was stronger than expected,” the bank said. It also raised estimates for the global economy by 1.5 percentage points, now predicting it to shrink 4.5% this year. Deutsche expects the U.S. economy to contract by 5.2% in 2020, versus the previous minus 7.1% forecast. It also seen the world’s biggest economy to grow 3.1% next year, rather than the 2.6% it had earlier predicted. The German bank’s estimates on inflation were less optimistic, with euro zone price growth in particular coming under downward pressure from recent euro appreciation against the dollar. It does not expect euro area inflation to return to pre-COVID levels until 2025. “We are not expecting the structural impact of the pandemic ...to outweigh the impact of the large output gap,” the bank’s research note added.

10.08676789587852," New York prosecutors subpoenaed Deutsche Bank in Trump probe: New York Times WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which has been seeking President Donald Trump’s tax records, subpoenaed his longtime lender Deutsche Bank last year, suggesting its criminal investigation into Trump’s business practices is more wide-ranging than previously known, the New York Times said on Wednesday. The prosecutors issued the subpoena last year, seeking financial records that the Republican president and his company had provided to the bank, the Times said, citing four unnamed people. The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance declined to confirm or deny the report. Deutsche Bank and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The Times said Deutsche Bank complied with the subpoena and provided prosecutors with “detailed records, including financial statements and other materials” that Trump had provided to the bank as he sought loans. Vance, a Democrat, this week suggested a grand jury subpoena for Trump’s tax returns was part of an investigation of “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,” including alleged insurance and bank fraud. Vance’s investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had had sexual relationships with Trump before he became president. Trump has denied the claims. Vance, who is seeking to dismiss Trump’s latest challenge to the subpoena for eight years of personal and corporate tax records, raised the scope of the probe in court papers filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday. While Deutsche Bank’s response to the subpoena “reinforces the seriousness of the legal threat” the investigation poses for the Republican president and his business, the inquiry is still at an early stage, the Times said, citing an unnamed person."
0.21691973969630773," 'Back from the brink' Deutsche Bank improves outlook FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE on Wednesday gave a slightly improved outlook for the year after a better performance in investment banking curbed a second-quarter loss and boosted shares on Wednesday. The German bank is undergoing a major restructuring, which it began a year ago after a string of annual losses. Executives and analysts said it is starting to pay off, although uncertainties linked to COVID-19 meant a hefty increase in funds set aside to protect against potential loan losses. The bank’s shares opened 3.3% higher in Frankfurt before easing to trade up 1.6%. So far this year, the stock has gained 17% and recovered from a record low in March. “It looks like Deutsche Bank is back from the brink of death,” Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy Opimas, said. Revenues for the year are expected to be “essentially flat” rather than “slightly lower,” as previously flagged, Deutsche Bank said. In the second quarter, investment bank revenues rose 46%, including a 39% rise in the important fixed income and currencies business. Deutsche Banke finance chief James von Moltke told reporters on a call the bank is “working toward” its goal of a pre-tax profit this year. Already last week, the bank said its results would be slightly better than analysts had expected, and the net loss attributable to shareholders of 77 million euros (69.90 million pounds) in the quarter was narrower than the 3.3 billion euro loss a year earlier. Given the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it increased provisions for credit losses to 761 million euros, up from 161 million a year ago. The bank last year said it would reduce headcount by 18,000 people, nearly one in five jobs, and exit unprofitable businesses. “The fruits of all our labour are already starting to show,” CEO Christian Sewing said in a memo to staff. But executives have said it will be difficult to repeat the first half performance in the second half and analysts still expect a full-year loss, although they say the restructuring is strengthening the company. “Restructuring measures have made it more resilient to weather the disruptive effects of the coronavirus pandemic,” Michael Rohr, an analyst with Moody’s, said. U.S. investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, also reported sharp fixed-income trading gains, benefiting from swings in financial markets generated by the coronavirus crisis."

-3.14136125654451," Deutsche Bank tightens fossil fuel lending policies FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, said on Monday it would end business worldwide with the companies most exposed to coal mining by 2025 at the latest, as part of a revamp of its policies on financing the fossil fuel industry. The German lender’s policy will cover companies making more than half their revenues from coal mining or, where that data is not available, those that have more than half of their reserves in coal. Effective immediately, Deutsche Bank said it would also cease financing new projects in the Arctic or oil sand projects. The reforms follow announcements earlier this year of new sustainability targets and the issuance of the bank’s first green bond. Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said the announcement was a step forward but “still too little, too late” and left the bank lagging many of its rivals in terms of ambition. ""Compared to international competitors the bank is still lagging behind on climate,"" it said, pointing to BNP Paribas BNPP.PA and Natwest Group, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, as front runners. Crucially, the new policy would still allow Deutsche Bank to lend to some of the world's biggest coal miners, including BHP BHPB.LBHP.AX, Anglo American AAL.L and Glencore GLEN.L, Urgewald said. Deutsche Bank said it would review all of its U.S. and European coal power activities by the end of this year with respect to clients’ diversification plans. It will begin a similar review in Asia in 2022. Deutsche Chief Executive Christian Sewing said the new policy “sets us ambitious targets and enables us to help our long-standing clients with their own transformation.”"

-3.388090349075976," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank’s shock absorbers get vital padding LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deutsche Bank investors can strike off at least one of the risks facing the 18 billion euro lender: a dicey mid-pandemic cash call. The group’s 13.3% common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, unveiled in an impromptu investor update on Tuesday, means Chief Executive Christian Sewing has bigger buffers to withstand a coronavirus-induced surge in bad debt. But there’s little else for shareholders to get excited about. The Frankfurt-based lender gave an ad-hoc update because its crucial regulatory measure of capital was almost a percentage point higher than the 12.4% analysts had pencilled in for the second quarter. Sewing’s CET1 ratio was boosted because corporate clients, who massively drew down on revolving credit facilities in the first quarter, have started paying them back. That shrank Deutsche’s risk-weighted assets, the denominator for regulatory capital, and consequently boosted its CET1 ratio. Just as well. According to an interactive Breakingviews calculator released in April, Deutsche was by far the most likely bank in Europe to dip below its regulatory minimum CET1 ratio – which is now around 10.4%. That’s because the perennially loss-making lender doesn’t have the earnings power to replenish its own capital. If bad debt kept rising, or if there were a second Covid-19 infection wave in Europe, shareholders might have had to stump up. That scenario is less likely now that Sewing has a 2.9% percentage point buffer over the minimum required, especially given ongoing regulatory capital relief. That means investors have one less reason to sell Deutsche’s shares. What they still lack is a reason to buy. Sewing’s group said on Tuesday that its financial results, besides capital, were only “slightly” better than the average analyst forecast. That’s a disappointment given the blowout trading quarter reported by U.S. peers like JPMorgan, and helps explain why Deutsche’s share price was down 2% after the announcement. Meanwhile, even Deutsche’s hitherto low levels of bad-debt charges will eat into any 2020 trading profits. And continued low interest rates may reduce the chances of it making an annual profit next year. Deutsche’s prospects are a little less precarious, but that’s hardly an enticing prospect for bank investors."

The fine is also another blow to Deutsche Bank’s reputation as it goes through a major restructuring, following five years of losses totaling more than 15 billion euros ($17 billion). “For years, Mr. Epstein’s criminal, abusive behavior was widely known, yet big institutions continued to excuse that history and lend their credibility or services for financial gain,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. New York found “significant compliance failures” in Deutsche Bank’s dealings with Epstein, who the bank had considered “high-risk”. It also knew of Epstein’s history of sex trafficking and abuse, including his 2007 guilty plea to state prostitution charges, yet ignored these “red flags” and processed hundreds of transactions “obviously implicated” by his past. In its statement New York also criticized unrelated dealings by Germany’s largest bank with Danske Bank’s Estonia branch, which is embroiled in a massive money laundering scandal, and the Federal Bank of the Middle East. Epstein was a Deutsche Bank client from August 2013 to December 2018, when the relationship ended after further negative press surfaced about his misconduct. The transactions processed by the German bank included payments to alleged accomplices, lawyers, victims, Russian models and women with Eastern European surnames, and “suspicious” cash withdrawals averaging $200,000 a year. ‘NOT SUSPICIOUS’ Email traffic showed that Deutsche Bank weighed the risks of retaining Epstein as a client but put them aside, enticed by the millions of dollars in annual revenue he might generate. According to a consent order, two Deutsche Bank employees visited Epstein in his New York home in early 2015 and asked about new allegations of sex with underage girls. But they appeared “satisfied” by Epstein’s response and did nothing to verify the allegations, the consent order said. The bank also chose in 2017 not to scrutinize payments to a Russian model and a Russian publicity agent. “[S]ince this type of activity is normal for this client it is not deemed suspicious,” a compliance monitor said in an email. New York said Epstein had more than 40 Deutsche Bank accounts, some of which were for the “Butterfly Trust”, whose beneficiaries included co-conspirators in alleged sexual abuse. This created a risk that payments could be used to “further or coverup criminal activity and perhaps even to endanger more young women,” the New York settlement, which reflected Deutsche Bank’s cooperation over several years, revealed. Accepting Epstein as a client “was a critical mistake and should never have happened,” Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing told staff in a memo. The New York regulator said Deutsche Bank was also sanctioned for ignoring warning signs while processing billions of euros of payments for Danske Bank, which it ranked as “high-risk” in 2007, before shortly afterwards identifying alerts on its foreign customers with Russian or Latvian connections. The German bank ignored internal warnings of the risks until late 2015, transferring at least $150 billion from Russia and other former Soviet states during that time. Deutsche Bank also acknowledged deficiencies in its monitoring of Danske Estonia and FBME. “We all have to help ensure that this kind of thing does not happen again,” Sewing said."

The comments from BaFin president Felix Hufeld are his most outspoken yet about Wirecard, which last week filed for insolvency owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro ($2.1 billion) hole in its accounts that auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud. “It is plain vanilla, old-fashioned criminal behaviour,” Hufeld said in an online panel discussion. BaFin, which oversaw Wirecard’s banking subsidiary, has defended its role after taking much of the flak so far for the scandal. Germany’s largest bank said it was working with BaFin and Wirecard’s insolvency administrator on the possible support for Wirecard Bank. “We are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary,” Deutsche Bank said. Wirecard’s insolvency manager Michael Jaffe said that Wirecard Bank continued to operate, but six German subsidiaries of Wirecard had also applied for insolvency proceedings. “Wirecard Bank AG is not insolvent. Payouts to merchants and customers of Wirecard Bank are being executed without restrictions”, Jaffe said in a statement. A source familiar with Wirecard said the equity value of the bank was around 160 million euros, and selling the asset to Deutsche Bank would help avert a bank run. Meanwhile, some of Wirecard’s customers and partners are breaking ties. Discount supermarket chain Aldi Sued, a major customer, said on Thursday that Wirecard was no longer processing its credit card payments as of July 1.

-1.6233766233766271," Deutsche Bank to pay $10 million over spoofing charges, reporting failures: CFTC (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE will pay more than $10 million to settle federal court charges of market manipulation and of alleged violations of data reporting obligations, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday. Deutsche agreed to pay a $1.25 million penalty to settle the allegations that two of the bank’s traders engaged in numerous instances of a type of market manipulation called “spoofing” in Treasury futures and Eurodollar futures contracts on CME, the bank said in a statement. The CFTC has been aggressively pursuing traders for the practice, a tactic designed to create a false appearance of demand. In 2018, the agency established a task force dedicated to rooting out this form of market manipulation. Deutsche will also pay a $9 million penalty over separate civil charges for failures related to its business continuity and disaster plans and for violations of swap reporting requirements. The charges stem from an issue in 2016, when an unprecedented outage in the bank’s swap reporting platform kept Deutsche unable to report data for multiple asset classes for five days, exacerbating existing report problems at the firm, the CFTC said. In 2015, Deutsche agreed to a CFTC order to improve its internal controls after being charged with failures in swaps reporting. The penalty was substantially reduced because of Deutsche Bank’s cooperation with CFTC staff, which included agreeing to have a court-appointed monitor, the agency said. “As reflected in both the settlement orders, we have taken meaningful steps to enhance our controls and are pleased to put these matters behind us,” Deutsche Bank spokesperson Dan Hunter said in an emailed statement."

44.69696969696971," Jersey jackpot of $2 million awaits Deutsche's lost shareholders FRANKFURT (Reuters) - While Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE employees fret about their jobs and pay, Germany's largest lender is trying to track down several hundred former staff to claim share payouts it has been holding in Jersey. The loss-making bank began transferring the assets, which are now worth a total of around $2 million, to a government body on the island last month as part of efforts to streamline its sprawling global network and cut costs. The assets, which are in the form of stock as well as accrued dividends, have been held for years by the outpost, which was the central depository for awards for Deutsche Bank employees globally, excluding those in Germany and the United States. Jersey court documents show that over the past year Deutsche Bank has used resources including LinkedIn, 192.com, Google, and the investigative group Kroll to hunt down the ex-staffers. Although the documents show the effort has had some success, 274 “lost shareholders”, some of who could lay claim on up to 50,000 pounds ($61,460), have yet to be found. Deutsche Bank said it was hard to speculate on why the former employees had not been located. The relatively low value of their assets partly reflects an 80% drop in Deutsche Bank’s share price over the past decade to record lows. Employees, mainly those in senior roles, were given shares as part of their remuneration and in 1998, during a period of rapid global growth, Deutsche Bank began depositing these in Jersey, where at one stage it employed more than 100 staff and generated revenue of close to 30 million euros ($33 million). However, in 2018, Fabrizio Campelli, then in charge of wealth management and now on Deutsche Bank’s board, struck a deal with Bermuda-based Butterfield Bank to take over the business in Jersey, Guernsey and the Cayman Islands. Although the Jersey administrator normally charges individuals a 500 pound fee to collect assets it stores, Deutsche Bank is paying 75,000 pounds upfront so that its former employees will be off the hook. But the clock is ticking. If the ex-Deutsche Bank staff do not come forward within 15 years to claim their assets, then ownership will automatically transfer to Jersey."

Members of the management board as well as the bank’s group management committee will be affected by the move, chief executive Christian Sewing will tell shareholders at next week’s annual general meeting, according to a text of the speech published on Tuesday. The bank, which is undergoing an overhaul after five years of losses, is considering other potential cost savings drawn from its experience from the COVID-19 crisis. They include less office space as people increasingly work from home, and less travel with more video conferencing, Sewing said. “In this phase of upheaval we have to make our bank even more weatherproof - or, to be more precise, stormproof,” Sewing said. “No one knows exactly what the second- and third-round effects of this pandemic will be.” Deutsche Bank’s overhaul, announced last year, includes shedding 18,000 jobs. The bank had temporarily put a halt to job reductions, but Sewing said it would resume the effort as planned."

29.312762973352047," Deutsche Boerse chief would be good Deutsche Bank chairman: investor FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Theodor Weimer, the chief executive of Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE, would make a suitable successor for Paul Achleitner as Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE chairman, a leading investor in the lender said. The comments by Germany’s Union Investment, a top 20 shareholder in the bank, is a rare public endorsement in the succession wrangling that has so far largely remained behind the scenes. Achleitner, whose second-five year term as chairman ends in 2022 and has been under pressure to leave earlier, has been working on a succession plan, according to people with knowledge of his thinking. Weimer is a top contender to replace Achleitner, some of those sources have said. Weimer is up for election to fill a spot on Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board at the lender’s annual general meeting (AGM) on May 20. Vanda Heinen, Union Investment analyst focused on corporate governance, told Reuters she supported Weimer’s ascension to the board and to eventually become chairman. “After his departure from Deutsche Boerse, we believe he would be a suitable successor to Mr. Achleitner.” Investors have been frustrated with the 80% decline in Deutsche Bank’s share price over the past decade, billions of euros in losses, as well as the bank’s involvement in money laundering scandals. A top shareholder advisor, Glass Lewis, has called on investors to vote against ratifying Achleitner’s actions at the AGM in a blow to one of Europe’s most prominent bankers. Weimer is under contract to manage Deutsche Boerse until the end of 2024. There is no indication he would leave the well-paying CEO job at the exchange operator early for the less lucrative oversight role at Deutsche Bank. A spokeswoman for Weimer said he wouldn’t be available to chair Deutsche as long as he is at the helm of Deutsche Boerse. Deutsche Bank declined to comment."

The German bank, still considered by regulators to be one of world’s the most important in terms of financial market stability, is trying to recover after five consecutive years of losses totalling more than 15 billion euros ($16.22 billion). Crucial to the bank’s recovery is its efforts to shed 44 billion euros worth of complex assets held in a so-called “capital release unit” or “bad bank” that have plagued its balance sheet for years. But the coronavirus crisis is gumming up the market for the types of exotic derivatives Deutsche Bank is trying to sell, which means the biggest threat to the lender’s capital levels is likely to come from its bad bank, analysts, derivatives experts and sources within the bank said. Last year, Chief Executive Christian Sewing unveiled a plan to return the bank to profitability, shrinking its investment bank and axing 18,000 jobs globally, but the virus now threatens to delay his ability to execute it. The bad bank is central to Sewing’s plan, enabling Deutsche Bank to shed unwanted assets such as risky and illiquid derivatives and delinquent loans that have been a drain on its balance sheet for years and free up capital to support its core businesses. Deutsche said its plan to offload most of the assets within the bad bank by 2022 was on track. The bank said it “continues to see active participation in its disposal programme” in the second quarter. “Thus far we do not see the current market conditions as a major impediment to our plans,” it said in an emailed statement. The fallout from the coronavirus crisis has led analysts and derivatives experts to question whether the bank may need to swallow bigger losses. “It will be more difficult to unwind these positions,” said Robert Cranmer, a partner at financial services consultancy Sionic. “Without the market volume and with bargain-hunters abounding, there will definitely be additional cost.” The bad bank held 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets when it was created last year. Deutsche Bank has since exited its equities trading business, transferred staff and assets from its prime brokerage and electronic equities businesses to BNP Paribas and sold equity derivatives portfolios to Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley . It is now working its way through portfolios of assets, including complex long-dated interest rate swaps, currency swaps, options, credit derivatives and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) which are expected to be harder to offload, sources close to the sale process said. Even prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the current year had been seen as critical for the bad bank wind-down, testing whether Deutsche Bank can offload the more complex assets without losses spiraling. The bank has previously said it aims to slim it down to 38 billion euros of risk-weighted assets this year. “The task this year is not just creaming off the top of the de-risking but getting to grips with unwinding the whole thing,” said a Deutsche Bank source with knowledge of the plan. Deutsche Bank has not revealed the expected cost of shedding the assets but has said it would be covered by its overall restructuring budget of 7.4 billion euros. The bad bank made a pretax loss of 767 million euros in the first quarter. Separately, Deutsche said last month that funds set aside to cover bad loans rose to 500 million euros in its latest quarter, more than three times higher than a year ago, as the economic impact of coronavirus intensified. Delays to the wind-down could be costly for Deutsche Bank, which is under pressure to protect its capital buffers, having warned last month it may miss its capital requirement target this year. “The last thing Deutsche Bank would want to do in a crisis like this is weaken its capital ratios unnecessarily,” said DBRS analyst Sonja Forster. Another Deutsche Bank source said the bank would make decisions on a “case-by-case” basis, weighing the anticipated losses from sales against the cost of keeping the assets. Some of the assets have 30-year durations and were previously housed in an earlier bad bank set up by Deutsche Bank in 2012, meaning the bank has already been trying to sell them for eight years without success, one of the sources familiar with the plan said. Potential buyers will be harder to find, analysts say. Rival banks are focused on coming through the crisis unscathed while private equity firms can take their pick from any number of distressed assets. “There are a lot of other more appetising things to do,” said David Hendler, an analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors.

24.75524475524475," Deutsche Bank chairman faces fresh shareholder scrutiny FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A top shareholder advisor, Glass Lewis, has called on Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE investors to vote against ratifying the actions of the bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, at this month's annual general meeting, citing ""performance"" concerns. The recommendation not to endorse his actions is a blow to one of Europe’s most prominent bankers as Germany’s largest lender tries to reverse five years of losses with a major overhaul while navigating the coronavirus outbreak. Glass Lewis, in a report published on Friday, said that removing Achleitner was not in the bank’s best interests but that the company’s failings should be at least partially attributed to him given the numerous changes in leadership and strategy shifts that he has overseen. “We believe that a vote against the ratification of Dr. Achleitner for the past fiscal year is warranted,” Glass Lewis said in its report to shareholders. Deutsche Bank said in a statement that Glass Lewis’ concerns were backward looking and unrelated to the past year. “We appreciate that Glass Lewis recommends stability in the supervisory board,” Deutsche said. At this year’s annual shareholder meeting, to be held online on May 20, Achleitner also faces for a third year in a row a vote to remove him from his post, motions that he survived by a wide margin in past years. Investors have been frustrated with the 80% decline in Deutsche Bank’s share price over the past decade, billions of euros in losses, as well as the bank’s involvement in money laundering scandals. The bank has said that it has made progress in addressing various compliance issues and is on the right path after a restructuring announced last year that foresees shedding 18,000 staff. Last month, it said that the “entire supervisory board continues to have no doubts concerning Dr. Achleitner’s comprehensive personal and professional skills and integrity”. Such votes are highly symbolic in Germany. When dissatisfaction is high, companies tend to work with investors to respond to their concerns in a well-established good corporate governance practice, according to ISS, another shareholder proxy service. ISS, in contrast to Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders endorse Achleitner’s actions at this year’s shareholder meeting. Last year, Achleitner received approval from 71.63% of shareholders, down from 84.4% the previous year, in what ISS called “a significant level of dissent”. In 2017, Achleitner was elected for his second five-year term with 93.51% of the shareholder votes. Achleitner's current term ends in 2022. A former partner of Goldman Sachs GS.N and finance chief for Allianz ALVG.DE, Achleitner is in search of a successor, people with direct knowledge of the matter have said."

Alexander von zur Muehlen, currently head of strategy at the loss-making bank, will replace Werner Steinmueller, who is retiring in a long-expected move. Von zur Muehlen, who has been with Deutsche since 1998, was instrumental in merger talks with rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE, that were aborted and in plan to shed 18,000 staff in a 7.4 billion euro ($8.05 billion) overhaul. Deutsche, still in the throes of that revamp, is expected to post a sixth consecutive loss this year, according to analysts, and is reeling from the shock of the coronavirus outbreak. Deutsche believes Asia-Pacific, with 13% of the bank’s revenue and 22% of staff, offers growth potential, particularly for its corporate bank as it serves German heavyweights like Siemens in the region. Deutsche Chairman Paul Achleitner said in a statement that Von zur Muehlen “possesses all the skills and attributes needed to ... further advance our regional strategy.” The decision was finalised on Thursday at a meeting of the bank’s supervisory board.

20.208604954367676," Deutsche Bank CEO does not expect German banks to need bailouts BERLIN (Reuters) - The chief executive of Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE does not expect German banks will need to be bailed out because of the coronavirus pandemic like they were during the financial crisis, he said on television on Wednesday. “We are really dealing with stable banks in Germany,” said Christian Sewing, the German lender’s chief executive, noting how banks’ balance sheets had been reduced and equity capital increased since the financial crisis in 2008/2009. “We have more than 200 billion (euros) free liquidity reserves, that’s more than 20% of our total balance sheet, and that means for us, too, that we have to be part of the solution now, especially at this time,” Sewing said on Germany’s ARD TV. Earlier on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank swung to a loss in the first quarter and the outlook for the full year darkened, underlining the impact of a costly overhaul and pressure on revenue as the coronavirus crisis devastates the global economy. Sewing said government stimulus measures, as well as the support of the banks, should limit the fall in economic growth to between 6% and 8%. “That’s severe, but still manageable.”"
20.208604954367676," 'Perfect black swan': Deutsche Bank 2020 outlook dims after first-quarter loss FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE swung to a loss in the first quarter and the outlook for the full year darkened, underlining the impact of a costly overhaul and pressure on revenue as the coronavirus crisis devastates the global economy. Christian Sewing, the German lender’s chief executive, described the outbreak as “the perfect black swan event” and the deepest crisis since World War II. The bank’s shares nevertheless rose nearly 8% by 1325 GMT, building on the sharp gains of the last two days. Deutsche reported on Wednesday a bottom-line loss of 43 million euros ($46.64 million) attributable to shareholders in the quarter, compared with a 97 million euro profit a year ago. Late on Sunday, it had published separate measures of profit and revenue in an unscheduled statement. Wednesday’s figures, like those disclosed on Sunday, exceeded analysts’ expectations and reflected a revenue lift from a surge in trading in volatile markets. The quarterly performance may not be a guide to the rest of the year as the bank tries to engineer a turnaround following five years of losses. Some investors fear the pandemic could undermine those efforts. The lender had hoped its pre-tax profit would at least break even this year, but Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told a telephone press briefing it was too early to say whether it would be profitable in 2020. Last year, Deutsche posted a 5.7 billion euro loss, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings. The coronavirus outbreak did not begin in earnest until the quarter was well underway, and the bank has said it may miss some targets. Some senior bankers have privately grown more pessimistic about the speed of the economic recovery in recent weeks. “In the current crisis, we have shown robust numbers and demonstrated strong performance in support of our clients across all core businesses,” Sewing said in a statement accompanying the results. Deutsche, now in its 150th year, has not fully recovered from the last financial crisis more than a decade ago. Bankers hope the current crisis will allow it to gain market share in Europe as U.S. banks retreat and the lender helps funnel loans, mostly backed by the government, into the nation’s companies. Von Moltke said foreign banks had retreated from Germany, calling it “not an unexpected reaction” to the global crisis. Analysts and investors said the earnings looked relatively good but there were doubts about how the bank would handle potential credit losses. “The extent to which the corona crisis will affect Deutsche Bank’s credit defaults and capital resources is still largely unclear,” Benjardin Gaertner, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, said. Revenues at the investment bank provided cause for cheer, rising 18% in the quarter. Revenue in the important fixed income and currencies business increased by 13%. But the bank warned of a deteriorating performance for the investment bank in the quarters ahead, meaning that for the full year revenue will be only slightly higher than in 2019. In contrast to the strong revenue at the investment bank, quarterly revenues in the division for corporate customers fell 1%, while they rose 2% at the division for individuals. Deutsche, as part of its restructuring, has been striving to rely more on income streams from those two divisions, and less so on the investment bank. But the bank expects revenue at the two will stagnate this year. It already warned last month that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak may affect its ability to meet its financial targets. Until the outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe, Deutsche has appeared on track. Its shares had rallied, it successfully issued a risky bond, regained market share in Germany and added a new top investor."

42.75037369207773," Deutsche Bank beats on profit, warns on capital buffers BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE beat first quarter earnings forecasts, lifting its shares, though the German lender warned it might miss its capital requirement target this year as it extends credit and defaults spike due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an unscheduled statement late on Sunday, Deutsche Bank said it expected to report quarterly net income of 66 million euros ($71.42 million) on revenue of 6.4 billion euros. Provisions for credit losses hit 500 million euros, more than three times higher than a year ago. Deutsche Bank said it would give full details of the results as planned on Wednesday. Analysts had expected the bank to post a net loss in the quarter and revenue of 5.7 billion euros. The figures indicate that Deutsche, like its competitors on Wall Street, got a revenue lift from a surge in trading as markets swung wildly. Its shares jumped almost 12% on Monday morning in Frankfurt. Andreas Thomae, a fund manager with Deka Investment, said the profit and revenue figures look “very positive” and that the loan loss provisions were still reasonable. Deutsche Bank has been trying to engineer a turnaround, and some executives and investors privately fear that the pandemic could stall the bank’s restructuring efforts. “We are firmly committed to mobilising our balance sheet to support our clients, who need us now even more,” Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said. Germany’s biggest lender said it was possible that the bank would fall “modestly and temporarily” below its previous common equity tier 1 (CET 1) target of at least 12.5% due to the current global recession sparked by the coronavirus. The ratio was 12.8% at the end of the first quarter, down from 13.6% at the end of 2019, including 30 basis points of negative impact from a revised securitization framework and approximately 40 basis points due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “This revised outlook acknowledges that credit extension to support clients at this time could increase risk weighted assets for several quarters,” it said, adding that pending regulatory changes could also improve the bank’s reported CET 1 ratio. Deutsche said it remained committed to keeping a “significant buffer” above its regulatory requirements. Andreas Plaesier, an analyst with Warburg Research, said that the bank needs to make sure the ratio doesn’t fall toward 11%. “This could lead to renewed questions about capital strength and speculation about a capital increase,” he said. The bank said it was also unlikely to reach its 2020 fully-loaded leverage ratio target of 4.5% without regulatory adjustments to the leverage ratio calculation. It confirmed its other financial targets, including for 2020 adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and reimbursable expenses of 19.5 billion euros. Deutsche Bank already warned last month that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak may affect its ability to meet its financial targets as the bank undergoes a major revamp after years of losses. Last year, Deutsche posted a 5.7 billion euro loss, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings. Until the outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe, things had been looking up for Deutsche this year. Its shares had rallied, it successfully issued a risky bond, regained market share in Germany and added a new top investor. Europe’s banks are expected to have to set aside billions for potential loan losses because of the coronavirus crisis when Credit ratings agencies have lowered their outlooks for banks in Germany and throughout Europe. S&P last week tweaked its outlook for Deutsche to negative from stable, noting the bank’s restructuring was “fundamentally on track” but acknowledged “substantial downside risks”."

61.51260504201679," Deutsche Bank refuses to give U.S. senators information on recent Trump dealings FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has declined a request by prominent U.S. senators to provide information about the German lender's recent business dealings with U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, according to a letter this week seen by Reuters. Four Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, earlier this month demanded details from Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing about the bank's interaction this year with Trump and his family's companies. (here) The bank is one of the largest creditors for Trump’s hotels, golf courses and other properties, according to filings.

Deutsche’s counsel rejected the senators’ request on privacy grounds, according to the letter dated April 21 seen by Reuters. “We hope that you will understand Deutsche Bank’s need to respect the legal, as well as contractual, boundaries that exist with respect to such confidential information,” the bank’s law firm, Akin Gump, wrote. Deutsche “must answer our questions”, Warren said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Saturday. “It’s outrageous we don’t know what secret favors the President and his family might be getting from the bank, or what favors the bank may be getting in return,” she said. Senator Chris Van Hollen, who worked with Warren on the request for information from Deutsche, said on Saturday that Deutsche’s response was “inadequate and unresponsive”. “The American people deserve answers and anything less is unacceptable,” Van Hollen said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The White House, the Trump Organization, Kushner Companies, and Akin Gump didn’t respond to requests for comment outside of business hours.

Deutsche’s counsel, in the letter dated April 21, rejected the senators’ request on privacy grounds. “We hope that you will understand Deutsche Bank’s need to respect the legal, as well as contractual, boundaries that exist with respect to such confidential information,” the bank’s law firm, Akin Gump, wrote. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The White House, the Trump Organization, Kushner Companies, Akin Gump and Sen. Warren didn’t respond to requests for comment outside of business hours.

The steps were part of a sweeping move by S&P for multiple lenders in Germany and elsewhere, and follow a similar effort by Fitch, another credit rating agency, last month. “We expect bank earnings, asset quality, and in some cases, capitalization, to weaken meaningfully through year-end 2020 and into 2021,” S&P said in a statement. S&P, which expects a “severe” recession in Germany this year, said of Commerzbank that it would “become increasingly challenging for it to deliver on its essential multi-year restructuring”. S&P said Deutsche’s restructuring was “fundamentally on track” but acknowledged “substantial downside risks”. Both banks, which are now rated BBB+ with a negative outlook, declined to comment."

52.44648318042814," Deutsche Bank investor files new motion to oust chair at shareholder meeting FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank investor Riebeck-Brauerei on Friday filed a motion seeking a vote to oust the lender’s chairman Paul Achleitner at this year’s annual general meeting, according to a document prepared by the activist shareholder’s lawyer. This is the third consecutive year that the small German investor has sought the chair’s removal and comes as Deutsche Bank is the midst of a major restructuring. The motion, filed by Riebeck lawyer Jan Bayer, criticises the payment of billions of euros in bonuses despite record losses, millions in severance packages for former board members, and a failure to rein in money laundering issues. “Personnel changes must be made,” said the letter from the lawyer seen by Reuters. Deutsche Bank, which holds its shareholder meeting on May 20, declined to comment. Last year, the bank said its supervisory board had “full confidence” in Achleitner’s performance. In 2019, the Riebeck-Brauerei’s motion garnered 9.75% of the vote, up from 9.05% in 2018. Riebeck-Brauerei has disclosed ownership of 200,000 Deutsche shares.

The credit ratings agency also lowered its view of other German lenders, saying in a statement released on Monday that it “considers the risks to banks’ credit profiles to be clearly skewed to the downside”. Fitch, which last year downgraded Deutsche Bank to BBB, said the negative outlook was due to “heightened near-term risks to the bank’s earnings, capitalisation and additional execution risks to its restructuring”.

28.75536480686695," Deutsche Bank studies state aid for staff in coronavirus crisis FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is for the first time considering asking its German staff to cut their hours and take government money instead as it tries to navigate the coronavirus crisis. After years of losses, Germany’s biggest bank has been trying to engineer an overhaul that includes pulling back from some of its international operations, but its recovery plan and share price have been hit hard by the pandemic. Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. It has been widely used by industry, including Germany’s car sector, but not by banks. Germany recently expanded its short-time work program to ease the burden on firms during the coronavirus crisis and Deutsche Bank is just one of several banks studying its options. If Deutsche Bank employs the scheme it would be likely to largely affect those of its staff who work in branches that are temporarily closed, perhaps only several hundred of the bank’s 40,000-strong workforce in Germany, sources told Reuters. By contrast, the nation’s carmakers are using the scheme to cover the costs of hundreds of thousands of its workers. Deutsche said it was not at present using short-time work but it was “examining whether and where it might be useful”. “At the operational level, the bank is preparing for such scenarios,” the bank said. Such measures could also meet some union resistance. The Verdi trade union voiced scepticism about invoking the measure, which could mean employees earn less, because banks could face even more work in some areas. This could include processing a surge in loan applications from companies seeking funds amid the crisis, Jan Duscheck, head of Verdi’s banking division, said. Banks around Europe have been scrambling to respond to a flood of requests for loans and relief from businesses to keep the region’s economy afloat during the pandemic. “There are already collective agreements and numerous company regulations in place to manage fluctuations in work volume and safeguard employment,” Duscheck said. Nevertheless in Germany, some banks, mainly the country’s cooperative lenders, have already applied for short-time work, Stephan Szukalski, head of banking union DBV, said. “Short-time work is something completely new and unknown to banks,” Szukalski said."

Commerzbank CBKG.DE said nearly a third of the thousands of inquiries it has received fulfilled the criteria of the KfW program. The companies are mainly small and medium-sized companies that make up the backbone of the German economy. Germany is guaranteeing up to 90% of the loans for small companies with fewer than 250 employees, and up to 80% for larger companies.

60.069444444444464," Deutsche Bank warns virus may 'materially' impact targets FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE said on Friday that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak may affect the lender's ability to meet its financial targets as the fragile bank undergoes a major revamp after years of losses. The warning is the first time that Germany’s largest lender has sounded the alarm on the outbreak, which has upended the bank’s operations by causing it to split teams globally and cancel major events. Deutsche’s shares have fallen to a record low amid a broad market rout. “We may be materially adversely affected by a protracted downturn in local, regional or global economic condition,” the bank said in its annual report. The bank said on Friday that its forecasts in its annual report didn’t factor in the effect of the virus. The bank is expected to provide an update on the outlook later in April when it reports earnings for the first quarter. The bank has been trying to engineer a turnaround, and some executives and investors privately fear that the outbreak could stall the bank’s restructuring efforts. Last year, Deutsche posted a 5.7 billion euro ($6.13 billion) loss, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings. Until the outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe, things had been looking up for Deutsche this year. Its shares rallied, it successfully issued a risky bond, regained market share in Germany and added new top investor. Separately, the bank announced that Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE chief Theodor Weimer will be nominated to the bank's supervisory board. “We will gain an expert with deep knowledge of the German and European financial industry as well as an outstanding banker,” Deutsche Bank chairman Paul Achleitner said. Reuters reported last year that some big investors would like Weimer to take over from Achleitner. Weimer “will join as a normal member of the supervisory board”, a Deutsche Boerse spokeswoman said."

69.8010849909584," Deutsche Bank opts not to redeem $1.25 billion of debt next month LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has said it will not exercise an option to redeem $1.25 billion of bonds next month, a rare move in the industry that could pave the way for other lenders to follow suit. With the appetite for risky debt severely hit by recent market volatility, Germany’s biggest bank said on Wednesday it would hold on to $1.25 billion of so-called Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds rather than repay them at the first opportunity. AT1 bonds - more commonly known as a type of contingent convertible, or CoCo, bonds - are the most risky debt banks can issue. They are designed to be perpetual in nature, though banks can repay them after a specified period. In this case, Apr. 30 was the first chance for Deutsche to redeem it. It is usual for banks to repay them at the first opportunity, but this could change now given the recent blowout in CoCo debt after the coronavirus outbreak hampered risk sentiment and economic expectations. Deutsche Bank could be the first of many to take this option, according to analysts. “If the market conditions persist like this, we may start seeing bank treasurers start to look at this option more and more,” said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Federated Hermes. “I don’t love it as an investor, but as long as there an economic justification for this and the chain of reasoning is clear, we can live with it.” AT1 securities were designed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to try to ensure investors, rather than taxpayers, would be on the hook if a bank ran into financial difficulties. Banks have almost always redeemed them at the first opportunity, though Banco Santander SAN.MC was one high-profile exception last year, though the Spanish lender did eventually repay bondholders. “Because of the blowout in this market, there’s a lot more expectations that borrowers will leave AT1s alone and not redeem them,” said a banker who manages bond sales for European companies, including Deutsche Bank. “It is much cheaper for them to hold on to it than to call it.” He asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak publicly about his clients. Other recently issued CoCo bonds have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, especially those by banks in Italy, which has borne the brunt of Europe’s epidemic and has been locked down by the government. UBI Banca's 400-million-euro AT1 bond issued in January fell seven cents on the euro on Monday, pushing the yield up 174 basis points to 7.17%, while Banco BPM's CoCo bond is now yielding 9.67% compared to 6.6% at the start of the month.

48.338368580060425," Deutsche Bank party short lived as coronavirus threatens recovery FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE cancellation of its 150th anniversary ceremony is not the only celebration that Germany's biggest bank is having to shelve as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The rapid spread of the flu-like disease has also sparked fears among some of its own bankers and investors that a long-hoped for turnaround is at risk. Shares in Deutsche Bank fell to a record low on Monday, sliding by as much as 17% in one its biggest drops in decades as the bank announced new measures to shield employees from the coronavirus outbreak, including the cancellation of its Berlin birthday bash on March 21. Deutsche Bank is not the only lender whose prospects are dimmed by the coronavirus outbreak, which is hitting German peers such as Commerzbank CBKG.DE and European rivals. But as one of the continent’s biggest and most fragile banks, it is desperate for a reprieve after five years of losses. Bankers at Deutsche were until recently basking in a rally in its shares, the successful issuance of a risky bond, regained market share in Germany and a new top investor in a significant vote of confidence in the bank. The investor, Capital Group, declined to comment. But the shares have slipped since mid-February as the epidemic gained a foothold in Europe, spooking financial markets and sparking emergency meetings and measures by policymakers. The turmoil will make it much harder for the bank to execute its turnaround plan, a senior banker told Reuters. And BlackRock, a top Deutsche Bank investor, took a short position in it as of last week, a filing showed. BlackRock declined to comment on Monday. Deutsche Bank, whose finance chief James von Moltke last month conceded that “no one really knows the path of this situation”, also declined to comment. Another top shareholder is concerned that the coronavirus has been wreaking havoc on Italy, China and South Korea, which are all important markets for Deutsche Bank, a source close to the investor said. “That is certainly something that will work against Deutsche,” the source said. A third top investor said it is possible that Deutsche Bank will have trouble meeting its closely-watched cost target as expenses to combat the virus’s spread rise. ‘BAD LUCK’ Deutsche Bank expanded measures to protect employees from contagion on Monday, splitting some trading and infrastructure teams in London. It had already imposed such measures in locations including China, Italy and Switzerland. Deutsche Bank, which last year called off talks to merge with Commerzbank, is now counting on other measures to turn around its fortunes, including shedding 18,000 staff, selling off complicated assets and exiting some businesses. It has been aiming to focus more on its home market after years of rapid global expansion. In a sign of progress, Deutsche Bank has gained market share in organizing syndicated loans for German companies, data compiled by Dealogic for Reuters show. The data, for the period from the start of the year through Friday, also showed a slight gain in market share for Deutsche Bank’s role in issuing bonds for German corporates and the fees it gets for advising them on mergers and acquisitions. But analysts still expect it to swing to a net loss for the quarter ending on March 31, and a 9% drop in total revenue from a year ago, a consensus forecast posted last week on Deutsche Bank’s investor relations website shows. “We can’t relax,” another top Deutsche banker said. Hans-Peter Burghof, a professor at the University of Hohenheim, said Deutsche Bank needs positive developments. “It’s very bad if a new strategy meets bad luck,” he said. The German economy’s heavy reliance on mid-sized export oriented firms, known as the Mittelstand, also poses a particular challenge, Burghof said. Such companies are especially threatened by supply-chain disruptions, which could in turn hurt their banks. Shares in Commerzbank, which counts the Mittelstand as a key clients base, also hit a record low, down as much as 14%, representing a 32% drop since the start of the year."

48.338368580060425," Manure and a broken arm: Activist priest's 30-year tangle with Deutsche Bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In the last three decades, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has expanded and shrunk its global footprint, made and lost billions, and its shares have soared and sunk. But there has been one constant: A priest-turned-activist's determined mission against the bank. Since 1990, on the first Thursday of every month, Gregor Boeckermann and about a dozen others have gathered at Deutsche’s Frankfurt headquarters to protest free-wheeling capitalism he says the bank represents. He is still at it 30 years later. Boeckermann, 79, personifies the poor public perception of Germany’s largest lender, which is desperate to reverse its flagging fortunes as it marks 150 years in March. He has over the decades chained himself with others to block Deutsche Bank’s parking and spilt liquid manure at its main entrance. A security guard once tackled him, and his arm broke. The scene was more muted at this month’s protest on Thursday. Spotting a furry trapper hat, Boeckermann stood under a rainbow umbrella and “peace” flag as fellow protesters beat drums. He said Deutsche was the “ideal symbol” for the capitalism he disdains for sustaining what he considers an unfair economic system which keeps wealth concentrated among a few elites while the poor get poorer. “But you almost have to feel sorry for Deutsche Bank these days,” he told Reuters. Deutsche is in the throes of a major restructuring, shedding thousands of staff and selling assets. After a decades-long global expansion and a series of financial scandals, the lender is now turning its focus to its home market. But German politicians and the public disapprove of its high salaries and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism that it represents. To address its image problem, Deutsche launched an advertising campaign two years ago. Its shares are, however, once again taking a beating amid fears related to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, hitting a record low early on Monday. The outbreak has cast uncertainty over whether it will go ahead later this month with its planned 150-year anniversary celebration in Berlin. “Deutsche Bank no longer has the significance for the German economy it once had, even though it has now rediscovered the German domestic market,” said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Deka Investment, an investor in the lender. Deutsche was in the midst of its global expansion when Boeckermann began his campaign. After a lengthy stint as a missionary in Algeria and student in Rome, he got a posting in the 1980s around the corner from Deutsche in Frankfurt’s swanky Westend neighborhood. In the 1990s, Boeckermann approached the bank’s twin towers, which dominate the skyline, and was wrestled to the ground by a security guard, breaking his left arm. He pressed charges against the bank. Then-CEO Hilmar Kopper sent him a bouquet of flowers, he said. Relations have since thawed. Boeckermann and his cohorts accept hot tea from time to time from a bank employee. “We value the dialogue with them, as we do with many other groups,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said. The bank allowed Boeckermann to plant an apple tree in 2017 on the far edge of its grounds. Standing under the tree, Boeckermann, who plans to retire as leader of the anti-Deutsche movement later this year, said he hoped the roots would one day grow strong enough to topple the bank and what it stands for."
54.07854984894258," Deutsche Bank in talks with home soccer team to expand partnership - source FRANKFURT, March 8 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank, seeking to strengthen its footing in Germany, is in talks to expand a business partnership with Frankfurt’s soccer team Eintracht, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday. If successful, the deal would be a blow to rival Commerzbank , whose name and logo have graced Eintracht’s home stadium for more than a decade. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank last year ditched talks to merge. Deutsche, in the midst of a strategic overhaul and years of losses, has reduced its global footprint to focus more on its home market. Both banks declined to comment. Eintracht did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung first reported the talks. Deutsche Bank currently is working on a payment system with Eintracht for events at the stadium. “We are talking to Eintracht about extending our business partnership,” the person said, adding that talks involved sponsorship, naming rights and regional engagement."
15.731707317073184," Deutsche Bank hands out bonus letters Wednesday, down 20% on year - sources FRANKFURT, March 4 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank staff on Wednesday are to receive letters with their bonuses for 2019, a pool that is down 20% from a year earlier, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Employees had been expecting smaller bonuses after the bank plunged to a bigger-than-expected loss of 5.7 billion euros ($6.36 billion) last year, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings. In January, the bank announced that management board members had decided to halve their own bonuses. The 20% reduction from 1.9 billion euros for 2018 is partly due to a smaller number of employees after downsizing. The decline in bonuses will be bigger for some individuals, the people said. Management has defended its bonus policy as necessary to attract and retain staff. “We must remain attractive for staff who are considering whether to join Deutsche Bank,” Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said in January. The bank declined to comment. Handelsblatt first reported the distribution of letters earlier on Wednesday."
13.267813267813267," ANALYST VIEW 3-Markets may need more than monetary talk from G7 (Adds Deutsche Bank view) SINGAPORE/TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - G7 finance ministers and central bank governors will hold a conference call on Tuesday to discuss measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and its economic impact. The call, which French and Italian sources said begins at 1200 GMT, comes as futures markets bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lead a round of global monetary easing. As it stands, the draft statement includes a pledge to work together but no specific fiscal or monetary measures, a G7 official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Here are analyst views on what could be announced and the likely upshot of the G7 call for markets: SAMEER GOEL, CHIEF STRATEGIST ASIA MACRO, DEUTSCHE BANK, SINGAPORE “The market is very much wanting a coordinated policy response, but the question here is whether a conventional interest-rate response is sufficient, or whether it requires also a fiscal response. “The problem is, the severity of the problem is not very clear. “It’s not an economic shock, it’s a shock driven by a non-economic factor. It’s still not clear how big the problem ultimately is, or could be, and until you know that, it’s hard to know how much medicine to apply to it.” DAISUKE UNO, CHIEF STRATEGIST, SUMITOMO MITSUI BANK CORP, TOKYO “You can’t give what you haven’t got. That is more or less true of every (G7) country. The euro zone and Japan already have negative interest rates, effective limit of monetary easing even if they want to. As for fiscal stimulus, it may have some effect after the epidemic is over but it cannot make people go out to spend. “These stimulus will help the economy only indirectly, though they could at least technically support share prices.” “The G7 statement as of now does not include any specific language calling for new fiscal spending or coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, Reuters reports. “This is hurting dollar/yen. But even if the news is accurate, the Fed will be under tremendous pressure to cut...this is a test of what matters more – the Fed or global easing. The Fed really only has the scope to cut, so I wouldn’t be too quick in selling risk on the headline. I vote the Fed!” JOHANNA CHUA, EM ASIA ECONOMICS AND STRATEGY, CITI, HONG KONG “Equities and other risk assets were in for a quick relief (on Monday) on back of expectations of coordinated easing by the G7 authorities. “The burden of expectations is arguably higher from the conference call between G7 finance ministers and central bank heads tonight. “A pull up in UST yields from lows seen in Asia session yesterday will likely diffuse the strong receiving interest for most low yielding Asian curves. However, situation remains fluid and a lot depends on how successful the G7 conference call is in keeping up with the expectations of coordinated easing.” ALVIN LIEW, SENIOR ECONOMIST, UOB, SINGAPORE “They need to announce something, just a motherhood statement would definitely disappoint the market. “Targeted measures or directed lending at the sectors that are affected are something they could do. “The policy rate aspect, I’m not quite sure that can deal effectively with the problems that are caused by the virus....at the same time, for them to all agree on something coordinated, I’m not quite sure there is anything (else) so straightforward.” JOE CAPURSO, FX ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY “We don’t have high expectations that the G7 are going to announce a coordinated policy easing. We can see some central banks being reluctant to pull the trigger on that. “(Some) may introduce liquidity measures. But the point we’ve been making recently is that a lower price of money does not fix the fear that people have of catching the virus. “That is what’s causing the economic disruption and lower interest rates aren’t going to fix the fear.” “They may commit to policy accommodation, to combat the downside growth risks, and probably leave it open ended as to whether it is going to be monetary alone or monetary and fiscal. “If they gave a timeframe as to when they are going to meet again, then maybe that is something concrete...(but) my sense is that global jawboning can only work for so long. “G7 communiques have certainly lost most of their weight in recent years, they just have a hodgepodge of things they want to do and things they are hoping to do. “I think the bigger theme is that because the correction in the equity market and the rally in the bond market have gone so far, they are kind of pricing in a recession story...I don’t think (talk) is enough to reclaim all the lost ground.” MASAYUKI KICHIKAWA, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST AT SUMITOMO MITSUI ASSET MANAGEMENT CO, TOKYO “Investors are already pricing global monetary easing into the markets, so the focus could fall more on fiscal stimulus. “It turns out that the biggest fiscal boost is likely to come from China. I am sceptical whether other countries can come up with fiscal stimulus that is large enough to impact the global economy. Expectations for the G7 are not that high. “The tool kit is different for each central bank. The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates. The European Central Bank may also cut rates and opt for some quantitative measures. The Bank of Japan will focus on buying exchange-traded funds.” “I’m not sure we’re really expecting a lot from them. “I’m not sure it’s really going to deliver a big dollop of fiscal stimulus, which is probably what the market would like to see but which I think it realistically doesn’t anticipate seeing. “I mean, can you really imagine any of the countries in Europe coming up with a meaningful contribution to spending that’s going to make a difference to what the virus is actually doing?” (Reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore and Stanley White and Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill)"

-39.67391304347825," Australia investigator met other regulators before Citi, Deutsche charges SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE told a court he met agents from another regulator in a cafe to discuss the matter but the talks were ""high level"" only. Citi, Deutsche, their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX and several of their current and former executives are accused of forming an agreement during an A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) ANZ stock issue to withhold selling unwanted shares to prevent them from falling when they hit the market in 2015. In pre-trial hearings, lawyers for the banks and their staff have suggested witnesses for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges in Australia’s biggest white collar criminal case, relied on evidence that was tainted by outside influences and pressure from above. ACCC enforcement director Michael Taylor was asked on Friday about a meeting with two investigators from another regulator, corporate watchdog the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in a Sydney cafe in early 2016, more than two years before charges were laid. “They would have told me they where they were at,” Taylor told the packed Sydney court room, referring to the cafe meeting. “They might have said, ‘we have’ or ‘we are about to issue notice,” he added, referring to notices which ASIC issued to the banks telling them they were under investigation. Taylor denied “careful coordination” with ASIC, and said his meetings with its investigators were “very short” and “at a very high level”. ASIC did not specify who they had issued notices on, other than the corporate entities, he added. Asked if he had requested ASIC get him recordings of two August 2015 conference calls between the bankers in which they allegedly discussed the share sale, evidence at the heart of the case, Taylor said, “it could have been discussed”. “I just heard that they had done this. I didn’t ask them to do it,” he told the court. Asked why he had not kept an email or other record of the cafe meeting, Taylor said the ACCC “team knew I was meeting with them. There were lots of things that weren’t necessary to put in an email.” The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications on the way they are allowed to run share sales. If found guilty, the banks face hefty fines while the individuals face prison time. A year and a half since the charges were brought, the matter is still at a pre-trial stage and none of the accused has entered a formal plea, although all have said they will plead not guilty. The hearings continue."
-34.0," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank taps U.S. tech companies for makeover - sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank has invited bids from Microsoft, Google and Amazon to overhaul the German bank’s outdated and fragmented technology networks, people with knowledge of the matter said. The bank’s approach to the U.S. tech companies, which has not been previously reported, is part of a 13 billion euro ($14.20 billion) technology investment Deutsche has planned up to 2022 as it restructures to recover from years of losses. Bernd Leukert, who recently joined Deutsche’s board as chief technology officer from software group SAP, is overseeing the initiative. Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “To help us evaluate our options, we have started a tender process with several cloud providers ... we expect to be able to complete the process in the coming months.” Microsoft and Google declined to comment. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Technology is a challenge for all global banks, but Deutsche Bank has particularly struggled to harmonize its networks in the decades after a rapid global expansion that included the acquisition of Morgan Grenfell in London and Bankers Trust in the United States. Even some of the bank’s most basic processes are outdated. Some retail customers still get their balances entered into savings books by printers for which spare parts are no longer manufactured. The three U.S. tech groups set up shop on site at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt last week to come up with proposals to fix technology and partner on projects across the bank, two of the people said. That will start a three-month pitch and bidding process following talks earlier this year between Leukert and tech executives in the United States and in Davos. The bank’s supervisory board recently signed off on plans for a broad tech overhaul. In an October memo to employees, four executives, including Leukert and Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing, highlighted the priority. “To succeed, we need to fundamentally shift how we build technology and move to a new way of working,” they wrote. In addition to helping to streamline and update technology, one idea under consideration is to set up a corporate credit marketplace that Deutsche and the technology company would own, one of the people said. It would be open to companies and other banks as a brokerage for loans. In the revamp, Deutsche is looking for a partnership that would be bigger in scope than work the tech companies have done for other banks in the past, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said. But Deutsche is not interested in a joint venture because it would result in overheads, boards and bureaucracy, the person said."
-32.71844660194175," Deutsche Bank to issue at least $1 billion in AT1 securities LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE said on Monday it would issue at least $1 billion in Additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities as the bank manages its regulatory capital requirements. The decision was made by the management board and approved by a committee of the supervisory board, the German bank said. Deutsche Bank’s decision to issue AT1 securities will soothe investor worries over an existing U.S. dollar contingent convertible (CoCo) instrument that is redeemable in April this year. AT1 securities are a type of CoCo instrument, which were designed in the wake of the financial crisis to try to ensure investors, rather than taxpayers, would be on the hook if a bank runs into financial difficulties. While CoCo debt is perpetual by nature, banks almost always redeem them when the first “call” date comes due, or risk stoking speculation over their cash and solvency position. Speculation was rife over whether or not Deutsche Bank would redeem the CoCo bond given its recent travails. The German bank’s decision comes at a time when the market for CoCo bonds has arguably never been better, with several Italian banks tapping that market more expected."

-34.42622950819672," Deutsche Bank shares soar after new shareholder steps in FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE on Thursday said Los Angeles-based Capital Group has taken a 3.1% stake, boosting shares in Germany's largest bank which has been hit by losses and misconduct scandals. Deutsche Bank shares rose as much as 13.6% to their highest level in 16 months and marking their biggest intraday jump in four years. They were the top performers in the Frankfurt's benchmark DAX index .GDAXI. “We are happy for any shareholders, especially those with the track record and credibility of Capital,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement. Capital Group in London declined to comment. The scandals and more recently an aborted merger with rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE mean Deutsche Bank is still in recovery mode more than a decade on from the global financial crisis. Last week, Deutsche Bank plunged to a bigger than expected loss of 5.7 billion euros ($6.3 billion) for last year, its fifth consecutive loss, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings. After Capital Group’s investment, Deutsche Bank’s largest shareholder remains the Qatari royal family, with a combined share of at least 6.1%, the bank’s website showed. That is followed by BlackRock with 4.49%, and Hudson Executive Capital with 3.14%. Capital Group previously owned a stake in Deutsche a couple of years ago but then sold, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Capital decided to go in again at the end of last year, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Deutsche Bank’s shares fell to record lows last year but are so far up 36% this year. “For Deutsche Bank, this is positive news and a sign of confidence, but the sharp rise in the share price seems a bit exaggerated to me,” said analyst Philipp Haessler of the brokerage Pareto Securities."

-20.322580645161295," Turnaround costs push Deutsche Bank to $6 billion loss FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE plunged to a bigger than expected loss of 5.7 billion euros ($6.3 billion) last year, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings. Misconduct scandals, a failed attempt to take on Wall Street heavyweights and, more recently, an aborted merger with Commerzbank mean Germany’s biggest bank is still in recovery mode more than a decade on from the global financial crisis. The latest attempt, under CEO Christian Sewing, is a 7.4-billion euro drive to cut 18,000 jobs, shrink its investment bank and focus on corporate as well as private banking. But its efforts are being hindered by a faltering global economy and ultra-low euro zone interest rates. “Our new strategy is gaining traction,” Sewing said on Thursday, noting revenues had stabilised in the second half of 2019, cost cutting was on track, the bank’s capital position had improved and the net loss was entirely down to revamp costs. But the 1.6 billion euros loss attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders in the fourth quarter was larger than analysts’ mean forecast of 1 billion, leading the full-year result to miss expectations of a 5 billion euros loss. The bank’s shares nevertheless erased early losses to rise 4% by mid-afternoon, as investors cheered the bank’s growing capital cushion. The results conclude a turbulent decade for Deutsche, including a cumulative loss of 15 billion euros over the last five years and an 82% plunge in the shares over the decade. In contrast, U.S. rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted its biggest-ever profit last year as its bond trading business bounced back in the last quarter of the year. (Graphic: Deutsche Bank shares vs European and U.S. bank indexes - ) ‘ON THE OFFENSIVE’ For analysts and investors, Deutsche’s ability to generate revenue has been a major concern. The bank has repeatedly trimmed its forecasts. Revenue fell 4% in the fourth quarter to 5.3 billion euros and was down 8% for the year to 23.2 billion euros. The quarterly figure included a 5% drop in corporate banking and a 4% decline at the private bank. The investment bank’s cash-cow bond trading arm saw a 31% jump, a big improvement on recent quarterly falls, but less than gains at some U.S. banks. “For us Deutsche Bank remains a ‘show me’ stock on revenues and we need evidence in future quarters to give credit on revenue turnaround,” JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said in a note. Deutsche is aiming for annual revenue of 24.5 billion euros by 2022. “Deutsche Bank is far from out of the woods, but if the slightly positive trend continues, I am cautiously optimistic,” said Klaus Nieding, vice president of the shareholder lobby group DSW. Investors were heartened that the bank was comfortably meeting regulators’ capital requirements, which Deutsche believes will allow it to allocate more capital to expand business. The so-called common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio stood at 13.6% at the end of the year, up from 13.4% at the end of September, due to the bank shedding riskier assets faster than expected. Andreas Thomae, a fund manager with Deka Investment, described the ratio as “very solid”. Sewing said the bank was feeling the benefits of its restructuring plan this month, and was bullish about 2020. “We will shift our focus over to growth. We don’t just want to defend our market position; we want to build on it,” he said. “We’re going on the offensive and we intend to sustain it. But not everywhere, just in those areas where we are relevant and have a leading position.” Deutsche said it was making good progress on reducing costs, another focus for investors, with global employee numbers down by more than 4,100 last year to 87,597 full-time equivalents. The bank said on Wednesday it would halve 2019 bonuses for individual board members, and told staff this week it would delay salary raises by a few months. Now in its 150th year, Deutsche is considered one of the global financial system’s most important banks, but has been hit by a string of misconduct scandals. Seeking to repair relations with Berlin and the general public, it last week appointed to its supervisory board former German government minister Sigmar Gabriel, who once criticised the bank for a business model built on speculation.

-30.57176196032672," Deutsche Bank names former German politician, critic to board FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE on Friday appointed here former German government minister Sigmar Gabriel, who once criticized the lender for a business model built on speculation, to its supervisory board. Deutsche Bank, reeling from a series of scandals and years of losses more than a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, is seeking to repair relations with Berlin. Gabriel, regarded as a proponent of strong European and transatlantic ties, has served as foreign minister, economy minister and environment minister. The former head of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) replaces Juerg Zeltner, who has stepped down after regulators rejected his appointment because of a conflict of interest. Deutsche Bank’s chairman Paul Achleitner proposed Gabriel for the post, two people with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Achleitner described Gabriel as a “dedicated proponent” of Europe and transatlantic relations. “We are experiencing a challenging geopolitical, economic and social era in which a global bank has to face completely new expectations and demands,” Achleitner said in a statement. Deutsche Bank is in the midst of a major overhaul. After failing to merge with rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE last year, it announced plans to close some businesses, revamp its management board, and cut its workforce by 18,000 employees. The bank has said it expects to post another annual loss for 2019 when it reports figures on Thursday. Investigations, such as those by the U.S. Department of Justice into money laundering affairs, have weighed on the bank. In 2016, Deutsche Bank faced a multi-billion euro fine for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis, causing concern among regulators, investors and politicians about the bank’s viability and the need for a possible bailout. Hedge funds placed bets against the bank. Gabriel said at the time: “I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry that the bank, which has made speculation its business model, is now declaring itself a victim of speculators.” In a statement on Friday, Gabriel said Deutsche “has the opportunity and the responsibility to help shape the future of the German and European economy. I want to play a part in this.” Gabriel’s ascension to the board follows questions about Achleitner’s tenure. Last year, Qatari investors were putting Achleitner under pressure to leave before his term ends in 2022, after he botched an attempt to place on the board their envoy, Zeltner. Gabriel has not been appointed to eventually succeed Achleitner, however, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW questioned whether Gabriel was a good choice. He would have preferred someone with “more financial experience who could advance the bank in terms of content,” he said. Other investors praised Gabriel’s political connections. “This helps the bank’s strategy, which is increasingly focused on Germany, and the improvement of its tarnished public image,” said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, a shareholder in the bank."

If the United Kingdom “wants to have good relations with the single market, we are ready,” Gentiloni said. “If there is availability from the UK government, I think we will have a deal.” “We can’t have zero tariffs and dumping together. We need a level playing field,” he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to strike a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, though Brussels has cautioned that doing a comprehensive deal in such a short time could be challenging. “We have to see how the trade deal is finalised and there is a risk that it’s not finalised,” said Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing, though he added that London would remain a key financial centre. “The clarity that has been given over the past 6 weeks is in the right direction The UK will be for us a material and very important location,” Sewing said. “London will also be one of the key capital markets, so... we will have a significant location over there. We prepared for the worst, so that we could do everything out of Frankfurt, but we believe there will be an agreement and that London will be an important capital market.”"
-27.803738317757016," Deutsche CEO calls on ECB to end negative rates to curb inequality DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The European Central Bank must ditch negative interest rates because they are increasing inequality and damaging society, Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing said. Sewing, who said negative rates also hurt lenders, on Thursday called on the ECB to use its upcoming strategic review as an opportunity to end a landmark policy that was once necessary but is now doing more harm than good. ECB rates have been negative for years and the bank is even keeping the door open for further cuts as euro zone growth dips and inflation remains below its target. “I personally think (the ECB) missed the exit,” Sewing, who is CEO of Germany’s largest bank, told a panel during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. “Because at some point this you need to leave this part of negative interest rates and we are at a point where monetary policy is at its limits.” He argued that more people in Germany are losing on negative rates than winning, scarring society: “The disparity between those people who benefit from this kind of monetary policy to those who have no benefit at all – they are actually losing money – is getting bigger and bigger.” The ECB has long maintained that ultra low borrowing costs are stimulating borrowing and lending, which has pushed employment to record highs, thereby benefiting the euro zone. The ECB meets on Thursday and will launch a one-year review but is not expected to change policy for most of this year. “I don’t expect a short term complete turnaround,” Sewing said about the review. “We have to leave negative rates, in particular for society.”"

Michelle Lim has been appointed as the head of China prime sales and business development, while Henry Lam has joined the Swiss investment bank as a director in China prime sales team, Credit Suisse said in a statement. Before joining Credit Suisse, Lim was co-head of Asia prime brokerage sales at Deutsche Bank and Lam was a director in Asia prime brokerage sales team at the German lender which last year exited from its equities business eliminating thousands of jobs. Prime brokers provide services such as clearing trades and lending money to hedge funds. “These appointments underpin our commitment ... to the burgeoning China hedge fund segment, as we gear up for our China onshore expansion in 2020 and beyond,” Neil Hosie, head of Asia Pacific equities at Credit Suisse, said in the statement.

-23.859191655801826," Deutsche Bank to no longer pay for advice from Cerberus: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Cerberus, one of Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE largest shareholders, will no longer provide paid advice to the bank on how to run its business, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Monday, a role that has been criticized for potential conflicts of interest. Cerberus, a U.S. private equity firm, bought a 3% stake in Germany’s flagship bank in 2017. The following year, Cerberus’ consulting arm also began advising the bank on how to cut costs and find new sources of revenue, for which Deutsche paid fees. That mandate, criticized by some other large shareholders in the bank, is ending, the person said on condition of anonymity. The person said the agreement had reached its natural conclusion. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said Cerberus’ advisory business “has been a great support since mid-2018 and helped us to get our deep transformation going. Now it is all about execution.” At the bank’s annual general meeting this year, Deka Investment, another big Deutsche shareholder, pointed to Cerberus as a “problematic” example of Deutsche’s corporate governance. “Is this a conflict of interest?” Deka portfolio manager Andreas Thomae asked the bank’s chief executive officer, Christian Sewing. Sewing defended the relationship, noting that Cerberus, as an advisor and owner privy to insider information, was bound by laws designed to prevent insider trading. Either party could exit the consultant contract with one month’s notice, he said. An exit from the contract in theory means Cerberus would have more leeway to increase or decrease its stake, which has lost more than 50% of its value since it was announced. “Cerberus is very supportive of the developments taking place under” Sewing, a spokesman for Cerberus said. “We remain confident in his team’s ability to execute on the restructuring plan to improve the bank’s financial and operating performance.” As a Deutsche Bank shareholder, Cerberus had pushed for a merger with Commerzbank CBKG.DE, in which it has a 5% stake, people familiar with the matter have said. Those talks failed, and Deutsche Bank is now in the midst of a major revamp, cutting staff and shedding business. In addition to advice on cost cuts, Cerberus has advised the bank on how to generate more money from its liquidity reserves. In 2018, Deutsche paid a single-digit million euro figure for the advice of a Cerberus team lead by former JPMorgan executive Matt Zames, Sewing told shareholders at the annual general meeting. The bank had expected to pay the same in 2019, he said."
-20.187165775401077," 'Out of market today': Australia brandishes four words crucial to case against Citi, Deutsche SYDNEY (Reuters) - A four-word handwritten note by a JPMorgan Chase & Co banker has been seized by Australian prosecutors as fundamental to a criminal cartel prosecution against Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG, a court heard on Friday. The note, which said “out of market today”, was taken by JPMorgan compliance chief Oliver Bainbridge at the time of a conference call with the other two banks, and prosecutors say it shows the three agreed to refrain from selling stock from a 2015 capital raising to boost its price, the court heard. “Mr Bainbridge has made contemporaneous notes with the words ‘out of market today’,” said Jennifer Giles, a local court magistrate presiding over the case which is yet to go to trial. Prosecutors say the note “seems to have been corroborated by what happened in the market,” Giles added. Though brief, the note’s existence may be used to support a federal case accusing the three banks of agreeing to withhold unsold stock from a A$2.5 billion capital raising for retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, misleading retail shareholders and violating cartel laws. The case, brought by antitrust regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct joint capital raisings. JPMorgan and several of its staff and ex-staff, including Bainbridge, have agreed to act as prosecution witnesses in exchange for immunity, the court has previously heard. Defence lawyers have been questioning the JPMorgan witnesses about how they came to cooperate with the authorities, how their signed statements were drafted and who was involved. So far, all of the witnesses said they did not take notes of the conference calls at the heart of the case. A day earlier, another JPMorgan witness who was on the calls, the bank’s local markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith, told the court the banks had not colluded on the capital raising, and that he was surprised when he was approached by the ACCC. Bainbridge lives overseas and will probably be called to testify in February, the court heard on Friday. A year and half since the charges were brought, no trial date has been set and none of the accused - Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their staff and ex-staff - has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will fight the charges which carry prison terms. The pre-trial hearings will resume in Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court on Jan. 30."
-26.948480845442536," Explainer: Why are banks watching Australia cartel case involving JP Morgan, Citi & Deutsche? HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Investment bankers the world over are paying close attention to court hearings in Sydney in a landmark legal case that alleges cartel activity by Citigroup and Deutsche Bank employees, with JPMorgan witnesses appearing for the prosecution. Many fear the proceedings could lead to increased scrutiny and tougher measures from regulators worldwide. Australian authorities filed criminal charges in June 2018 against the local units of Citigroup C.N, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX and six bankers over a A$2.5 billion stock sale. JPMorgan JPM.N, which also advised on the 2015 deal, has been collaborating with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission(ACCC) since as early as March 2016 in return for immunity from prosecution, a pre-trial hearing heard last week. The banks and their executives have yet to enter formal pleas but have said they will defend the case. They have declined to comment further on the matter outside of court hearings. Pre-trial hearings have been underway in recent months and appear likely to continue into 2020. No trial date has been set. The charges stem from the August 2015 sale of $2.3 billion of new ANZ shares and the subsequent trading of some of the shares by two of the underwriters - Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. The banks failed to sell all the shares to investors and so purchased some themselves. Prosecutors say the banks struck an agreement to keep the unsold shares secret to support the share price, and, in doing so, formed a criminal cartel. Charges have also been brought against six former or current executives at the banks, three from Citi, two from Deutsche and one from ANZ. For investment banks, the case will set a precedent in an area of financial markets activity that lacks clear rules and has never been tested in the courts. “Underwriting syndicates exist to provide the capacity to assume risk and to underwrite large capital raisings, and have operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades,” Citi said when the case was first made public. Bankers outside Australia fear a successful prosecution could prompt regulators elsewhere to take a fresh look at share sale practices. Cartel charges in Australia carry a maximum penalty of three times the profit made from the cartel activity or 10 percent of a firm’s revenue. Penalties for individuals found guilty carry fines or a maximum 10-year jail term. Representatives for the banks and their executives have cross-examined certain prosecution witnesses, including JPMorgan bankers. JPMorgan former markets head, Jeff Herbert-Smith, said that in his view the banks had not colluded, a position apparently at odds with the prosecution’s case. JPMorgan’s former head of equity capital markets, Richard Galvin, said he received a “letter of comfort” from the ACCC, as long ago as in June 2016, assuring him immunity if he co-operated with their investigation into the capital raising. This is one of many incidents to jolt Australia’s banks over the past two years, including a year-long public inquiry which leveled blistering criticism at the sector. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has sued ANZ over the same share placement. Last month financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC accused Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, saying the banking giant ignored red flags and for years enabled payments from convicted child sex offenders and ""high risk"" countries. Westpac’s chief executive and compliance head have stepped down. Previously, National Australia Bank's NAB.AX chairman and CEO, and the CEO and chairwoman of the country’s biggest financial planner, AMP Ltd AMP.AX, were forced to step down in connection with problems uncovered by a public inquiry."
-3.19888734353269," Deutsche paints gloomy picture at investor gathering FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE pared back its revenue growth target on Tuesday, highlighting the tough task facing Germany's biggest lender to revive its fortunes against a gloomy economic backdrop. Deutsche’s management gave a presentation to investors on its restructuring which aims to shift the bank away from Wall Street to its home market of Germany as it seeks to draw a line under years of scandals and heavy losses. But Europe’s slowing economy and action by the European Central Bank to cut borrowing costs is making it harder for Deutsche to grow. The bank said it expected revenue at its core banking business to grow by just 1% in the run up to 2022, half the growth level estimated in July. To arrive at that overall target, the bank cut growth forecasts for retail banking and wealth management to zero but predicted that its long-suffering investment bank would generate 2% more in earnings by 2022. Deutsche said low interest rates would hurt its retail bank as well as corporate banking in the medium term, but predicted that stronger growth at its investment bank would partly make up for this. The bank said it had taken steps to cope with low rates, including lending more and “selectively” passing on to customers the costs it faces for keeping cash at the central bank. Deutsche stuck with its profitability targets and highlighted efforts to cut billions of euros in costs and spinning off unwanted assets. Chief Executive Christian Sewing pointed to “significant progress” in recent months in turning around the bank in a statement ahead of the investor day. Deutsche Bank’s shares, which have more than halved in value over the past two years, dropped slightly. They were trading down roughly 1% to 6.47 euros at 1235 GMT. Andreas Thomae, a fund manager at Deka Bank, a Deutsche Bank investor, said the bank’s ability to grow was central. “You have to give the bank about a year before you can pass judgment,” he told Reuters. Deutsche said its bad bank - created to shed unwanted investments - was “running ahead of plan” and that its capital cushion would hold steady throughout its turnaround. The European Central Bank had also cut the capital ratio requirement for the bank, following a review. Earlier this year, the German government pushed for Deutsche to merge with rival Commerzbank. But the talks failed, leading Deutsche to announce a major revamp."

For its core bank, which excludes its internal bad bank, Deutsche Bank set a post-tax return on tangible equity target of above 9% in 2022. It said that it expected low interest rates to primarily impact the Private Bank and Corporate Bank division in the mid-term, although revenue growth from the investment bank should partially offset this. In a statement ahead of an investor day, the bank also said that asset reduction in the capital release unit was running ahead of plan. (Reporting By Arno Schuetze; editing by John O’Donnell)"
-3.19888734353269," Australia cartel case against Citi, Deutsche delayed by late night witness statement SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian criminal cartel lawsuit against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE was postponed on Tuesday after defense lawyers complained the prosecution had given them a redacted statement for a key witness late on the previous day. Though for just one day, the delay raises the chance of pre-trial hearings running into next year, eroding hopes of a swift resolution to a case that is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world since it may change how they run capital raising. The two investment banks and their former client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX, and several of their former executives are charged with withholding information from investors about a A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) share issue for ANZ in 2015. Defence lawyers had planned on Tuesday to start cross-examining investigators from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges, about how they took witness statements from a third investment bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, which also worked on the stock issue but cooperated in exchange for immunity. But the defense told the court on Tuesday they had been given what they deemed a crucial ACCC investigator’s signed statement, running to about 100 pages with some information obscured, at 9.30 p.m. local time on Monday. That meant they could not proceed with questioning as planned, it said. “It is particularly troubling that we are provided with these statements in this way at this time,” Citigroup lawyer Dean Jordan told a pre-trial hearing in Sydney. The defense had been trying to get information from the regulator about its case outside the courtroom “for a year (but) it’s fair to say the response has been less than helpful”, Jordan said. “It is entirely regrettable that it’s unfolding in this way.” The magistrate overseeing the hearing, Jennifer Giles, said the delay may mean the cross examination would run into 2020, instead of ending on Dec. 13 as planned. But she held over the questioning until Thursday. The ACCC has said the banks colluded on the share issue, at the expense of ordinary shareholders, during two conference calls during the stock issue to keep the stock price aloft. None of the defendant banks or their former staff has entered a formal plea but all have said they plan to fight the charges which carry prison sentences. Their lawyers have previously told the court they plan to question whether the JPMorgan banker statements were “contaminated” by the involvement of ACCC investigators. The regulator and banks have routinely declined to comment on the case outside the courtroom. ($1 = 1.4736 Australian dollars)"

5.1246537396121905," Deutsche Bank staffers cleared but bank fined in money laundering case BERLIN (Reuters) - Frankfurt prosecutors have dropped an investigation into two Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE employees accused of aiding tax evasion through a former Virgin Islands unit, although they have fined the lender for compliance lapses. In a two-day raid a year ago, 170 police officers searched Deutsche Bank’s headquarters in Frankfurt, hitting its share price just as management was battling with losses and a string of other financial and regulatory scandals. Sources close to the investigation said as recently as July that prosecutors were set to escalate the investigation, planning raids on wealthy former clients after searching the homes of eight people in May. Deutsche Bank said on Friday, however, that the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office had now closed the case due to a lack of suspicion. It was hit with 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in fines and forfeits to make amends for the shortcomings in its compliance setup. “With the closure of these proceedings it is clear that the prosecutors have not found any instances of criminal misconduct on the part of Deutsche Bank employees following the raid of our Frankfurt office in November 2018,” Deutsche Bank spokesman Joerg Eigendorf said in a statement. “The investigation that has now been closed due to lack of sufficient suspicion had a heavy impact on Deutsche Bank last year,” he added. “It is true that the bank had weaknesses in its control environment in the past. We identified these weaknesses and we have addressed them in a disciplined manner.” The proceedings were linked to German client interactions with offshore entities set up by the bank’s Virgin Islands subsidiary Regula Ltd. The subsidiary was sold by Deutsche Bank in March 2018. In a separate statement, the prosecutor’s office said the fines were imposed over the failure to promptly report suspected money laundering related to Regula; inadequate high-level oversight and understaffing of the bank’s anti-money-laundering team from 2015 until early 2018. Even though it dropped its investigation into the two Deutsche Bank staffers, the prosecutor’s office said it would continue to investigate German customers of Regula that it suspects of tax evasion."

19.471488178025027," Exclusive: U.S. digs deeper into Deutsche role in Danske money laundering scandal - sources FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has in recent weeks stepped up its investigation into Deutsche Bank’s role in the 200 billion euro ($220 billion) Danske Bank money laundering scandal, four people familiar with the inquiry told Reuters. One source said the DoJ's new line of inquiry is whether Deutsche DBKGn.DE helped move tainted money from DanskeDANSKE.CO, Denmark's largest lender, into the United States. If proven, that could lead to steep financial penalties. Officials from the DoJ, who have been working closely with Estonian prosecutors for around a year, have also begun cooperating with Frankfurt state prosecutors, the sources said. The Frankfurt prosecutors have been exploring Deutsche’s role in processing payments for the Danish bank. The DoJ’s focus on Germany’s largest bank and its work with Frankfurt prosecutors have not previously been reported. A Danske spokesman said it continued to cooperate with the authorities in Estonia, Denmark, France and the United States. The DoJ and Frankfurt state prosecutors declined to comment on the U.S. investigation, which two sources told Reuters is due to be completed next year. Deutsche Bank’s spokesman said it had significantly improved controls in recent years. “We have repeatedly stressed that we are in a good and constructive exchange with the authorities,” he added. Danske’s admission last year that suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros from Russia and elsewhere flowed through its branch in Estonia has triggered worldwide probes. The bulk of these payments were processed by Deutsche, sources have previously told Reuters. Although the Justice Department requested information from Deutsche last year relating to Danske transactions, at the time its executives believed that the investigation was focused onDanske and that the German bank itself was not a target. However, Deutsche officials were made aware in recent months that the scope of the DoJ probe had broadened to the bank’s role in facilitating the Danske trades and its possible failure to report suspicious transactions quickly enough, one of the people said. Deutsche has already paid nearly $700 million in fines by New York and British regulators in a separate money laundering case involving $10 billion in so-called mirror trades from Russia, which the DoJ is still investigating. U.S. investigators have spoken to current and former Deutsche compliance staff in the U.S. who raised concerns over possible suspect transactions with supervisors but were ignored, two people said, adding that some involved Danske. Estonian prosecutors are sharing their findings on Danske, hoping they will share in the proceeds in the event of U.S. fines, four people said. One source said Estonian prosecutors are examining more than ten transactions involving up to $2 billion of suspect criminal funds in total. Reuters could not ascertain the details of those deals. Deutsche alerted Germany’s money laundering data authority and state prosecutors in February to more than one million suspect money transfers, two people said, five years after a whistleblower raised the alarm at Danske. Washington and Frankfurt are now asking what led to the delay and whether there were lapses as some of the contested money transfers, which were earlier singled out by compliance staff, are among those Deutsche later flagged, two people said. Frankfurt prosecutors have also questioned Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche’s former top official in charge of anti-moneylaundering and the highest ranking of ten Deutsche bankers and executives they have interviewed. Matherat, who left Deutsche this year, and the others were interviewed as witnesses whose first-hand knowledge is being drawn on to form an overall picture, the person said. Matherat declined to comment. A Deutsche spokesman confirmed she had been interviewed as a witness."
22.01086956521739," Deutsche Bank sells $50 billion in assets to Goldman amid overhaul: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has sold $50 billion in unwanted assets to Goldman Sachs GS.N as part of its restructuring, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The assets, related to emerging-market debt, were part of Deutsche’s unit to wind down unwanted securities, the people said, confirming a development first reported by Bloomberg. As part of a broad overhaul, Deutsche has hived off billions in assets into a so-called capital release unit, also called a bad bank. The sale to Goldman marks the latest in a series of disposals of such assets. The unit contained 177 billion euros ($195 billion) in leverage exposure at the end of the third quarter. The bank aims to reduce that to 119 billion euros by the end of this year. It is unclear how much the sale to Goldman chips away at that goal because the nominal $50 billion is not comparable to leverage exposure, a measure of risk. Goldman purchased the debt at a deep discount and believes it can make a modest profit on the deal, according to a fourth person familiar with the matter. The book likely includes derivatives, as well as emerging-market debt, the person added. Deutsche has said it sold packets of equity derivatives in three auctions. It is now trying to sell more complex equity derivatives, a process that will take a couple of years. Deutsche has also struck a deal to transfer its prime brokerage business to BNP Paribas BNPP.PA.

In a complaint filed on Thursday night, the bank said Kingate Global Fund and Kingate Euro Fund exhibited “sellers’ remorse” by backing out of their 2011 agreement to sell the claims at 66 cents on the dollar, after the value of the claims had “materially increased.” According to Deutsche Bank, Kingate wrongfully concluded that the sale was no longer “binding” because too much time had passed and a related agreement had not been signed. The German bank is seeking to enforce the sale, or else obtain damages, in its lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court. Based in the British Virgin Islands, the Kingate funds filed for protection under Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on Sept. 5, citing the risk of litigation by Deutsche Bank. Robert Loigman, a lawyer for the Kingate funds, in an email called Deutsche Bank’s claims “utterly without basis,” saying the bank was trying to benefit improperly from a “lapsed trade” it refused to complete eight years ago. Troy Gravitt, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to comment. The Kingate funds were among “feeder funds” that supplied client money to Madoff, which he used to fuel his Ponzi scheme. They agreed in June to return $860 million in a settlement with Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee liquidating the former Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. The funds said the settlement also gave them a $1.66 billion claim in the Madoff firm’s bankruptcy that should result in an initial $262 million distribution to their own creditors. Picard has said the Kingate funds sent Madoff more than $1.7 billion. According to his website, the trustee has recovered $14.29 billion for former Madoff customers, more than 81% of the $17.5 billion he has estimated they lost in a decades-long fraud. Madoff, 81, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison term."

39.13043478260869," Toronto Dominion joins ranks of systemic banks, Deutsche drops a level LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's second-biggest lender, Toronto Dominion Bank TD.TO, has been added to a global list of systemic banks that must hold extra capital, while Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has dropped a rank within the list, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Friday. The international body, based in Basel, Switzerland, was updating its list of systemic banks, introduced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago when taxpayers had to bail out struggling lenders. The addition of TD Bank brings the total number of systemic banks to 30. Systemic banks are slotted into one of five buckets, although the fifth - where banks would be required to hold an extra 3.5% of capital to risk-weighted assets on top of minimum requirements - remains empty. TD has been placed in the first bucket, with a 1% surcharge. TD, along with Canada’s five other big banks, is already designated a domestic systemically important bank, which subjects it to a 1% common equity capital surcharge, according to Canada’s banking regulator. Canadian banks are required to hold 8% of capital to risk-weighed assets, and an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. “Management does not expect any impact to TD’s capital position with this designation,” TD said in a statement. The bank is “well-positioned to meet the (global systemically important bank) requirements starting in November 2020,” Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which regulates the industry, said in a separate statement. TD shares opened little changed at C$77.27 in Toronto. JP Morgan Chase remains the sole occupier of the fourth bucket, with a 2.5% capital surcharge. Citigroup and HSBC are in the third bucket, with a 2% surcharge. Deutsche Bank has dropped from the third to the second bucket, which has a 1.5% surcharge, in a sign of how the struggling German lender is shrinking and simplifying its operations. “This was primarily driven by reductions in leverage, strategic adjustments in the bank’s business and geographic perimeter and lower derivative volumes, together with wider industry developments,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement. Deutsche Bank is, however, still required to meet a 2% extra capital requirement as a “domestic systemically important bank”, and therefore the overall capital buffer is expected to remain unchanged, the German bank said. Changes to capital requirements come into effect in January 2021. Banks on the list also face more onerous requirements for issuing special bonds that can be written down to replenish capital burned in a crisis to shield taxpayers."
38.75338753387535," U.S. fines former Deutsche Bank subprime chief over alleged mortgage fraud (This Nov 14 story amends charges in first and fifth paragraphs to civil claims.) NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former head of subprime trading at Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE will pay a $500,000 fine to resolve civil claims he misled investors about the quality of loans backing $1.42 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) issued before the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday announced the settlement with Paul Mangione, who was also a former Deutsche Bank managing director, who did not admit wrongdoing. Settlement papers were filed with the federal court in Brooklyn, New York. According to a civil complaint, Mangione understated the risks of loans backing two securities offerings, ACE 2007-HE4 and ACE 2007-HE5, in April 2007 and June 2007, including borrowers’ ability to repay and whether the loans were underwritten properly. More than half the loans were made by Deutsche Bank’s DB Home Lending unit, then known as Chapel Funding. Mangione had been sued in a September 2017 civil complaint that stated claims based on mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. The case was announced eight months after Deutsche Bank reached a $7.2 billion settlement, including a $3.1 billion civil fine, with the U.S. government, and admitted to misleading investors about RMBS it sold. Other banks have reached similar settlements. U.S. authorities have long faced criticism that they have not held enough individuals accountable for RMBS failures. Mangione joined Deutsche Bank in 2000 after six years at Credit Suisse CSGN.S. His lawyer, Patrick Smith, said Mangione settled so he could devote his time and energy elsewhere. “Mr. Mangione did nothing wrong during his time at Deutsche Bank,” Smith said in a statement. “He acted in good faith in performing his customary job functions as a whole loan trader at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Mangione was not responsible for Deutsche Bank’s RMBS practices and disclosures to investors, which were at the core of the government’s claims against him.”"

36.43512450851901," Citi, Deutsche get go-ahead to probe regulator witnesses in landmark cartel case SYDNEY (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE may cross-examine four antitrust investigators involved in a criminal cartel prosecution against them, an Australian court ruled on Friday, a win for the defence in a closely watched legal battle. The two banks plus JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N worked on a A$3 billion ($2 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX in 2015. Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and eight of their staff were charged last year with withholding crucial information from shareholders about the sale. JP Morgan was granted immunity from prosecution when two of its former executives agreed to co-operate with regulators. However, lawyers for the defence have said they want to question staff of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in court about how they obtained evidence from the JP Morgan representatives. The ACCC opposed their request. On Friday, a local court magistrate ruled that the defendants’ lawyers may cross-examine the ACCC staff on the subjects of how they obtained witness statements from the JP Morgan personnel and the staff’s level of cooperation with corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. “The defence does not have an unfettered right to cross-examine witnesses (but) I’m not persuaded that I can or should oppose,” the magistrate, Jennifer Atkinson told the court in Sydney. “There will be examination of the following witnesses,” Atkinson said, before naming the four ACCC staff. Spokespeople for the ACCC, Citi, Deutsche and JP Morgan declined to comment. Prosecutors have accused the banks of forming a criminal cartel to restrict the supply of ANZ shares and maintain the price of ANZ shares after they were unable to sell them all to regular investors, court documents showed. Four phone calls in August 2015, which prosecutors said involved bankers from all the companies, are at the heart of the case. None of the accused companies or people have entered formal pleas and no trial date has been set, but all have said they would plead not guilty. The case could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. State prosecutors had opposed allowing the ACCC officers to testify, saying it may violate legal privilege and inappropriately expose the regulator’s private workings. The next hearing is on Dec. 5."

23.81596752368066," UPDATE 1-Deutsche looks to recoup lost ground in bonds * People & Markets * Private placements at heart of latest bond push (Adds Lewellen’s title in 11th paragraph) LONDON, Nov 1 (IFR) - Five years ago, Deutsche Bank’s bond franchise was riding the crest of a wave. After a period of post-crisis restraint, clients had once again begun to take on debt to invest or make acquisitions. Deal volumes were surging and, with many rivals still distracted by ongoing clean-ups, Deutsche seemed best placed to profit from the boom. The business posted a record year in 2014, earning €1.6bn in underwriting fees, more than any other European bank and 50% up on three years earlier. With the European Central Bank set to start a €1trn bond buying programme the following spring, the future looked even better. Deutsche, the region’s pre-eminent bond house, was widely expected to be the biggest beneficiary. But while the bond party has got into full swing since then, Deutsche seems not to have been invited. Deal volumes and fees hit new highs in 2017, and banks are on track to break that record again this year. But, at Deutsche, the reverse has happened: bond revenues fell by a third between 2014 and 2018 and are tracking another 9% lower so far this year. Unfortunately for Deutsche, the bond market boom coincided with a deep crisis at the bank that has seen it work through four CEOs, umpteen overhauls and a collapse in its share price. Uncertainty over strategy and – at least for a time – even its future existence hit the bank hard; the bond franchise, like the rest of the firm, suffered as a result. TURNING A CORNER? After another strategy overhaul in July, when the bank made its deepest cuts yet, shuttering equity trading and earmarking €288bn of assets for sale or winddown, the hope is that a corner has been turned. Debt capital markets will be at the heart of a new slimmed-down investment bank, with Deutsche’s bond bankers now tasked with recouping lost ground. The first step in that process was the closure of the financing and solutions group. Although only formally set up in 2015, the philosophy underlying it was a long-standing one at the bank, heavily incentivising bankers to push bespoke, highly lucrative – but often risky and long-dated – financing to clients. With that gone, DCM will go back to basics. “Coverage teams were prioritising these innovative financing solutions as opposed to doing core day-to-day DCM work,” said Frazer Ross, head of investment grade DCM syndicate for EMEA. “What we’ve done is re-focus the coverage. It is much better - in an area which is a highly commoditised, high flow - to have people at the coalface who are paid to originate bond deals, full stop.” Mark Lewellen, Barclays’ former global co-head of DCM, has been brought in as head of investment grade DCM origination for EMEA to help revive the corporate bond franchise in Europe. Deutsche has long been a top player in the region, but there are signs that the bank’s troubles have dented its standing. After ranking second for corporate bond deals in euros for six years running, it has slipped to third this year. PRIVATE PLACEMENTS Under the new strategy, Deutsche faces the difficult task of winning market share from larger rivals that have more resources at their disposal. Its investment bank has a loan book of just €71bn, compared with €150bn at BNP Paribas, number one in the euro league table. To address that disadvantage, Deutsche has opted to grow its private placement desk within the bond syndicate. “It’s a quirky little business, but we have invested in it as clients really value it and, in many cases, it is either a substitute for lending or standalone profitable for us,” said Henrik Johnsson, global co-head of capital markets. “If you get into the flow as to what’s going on, and start climbing the league tables, then all of a sudden you find opportunities that you didn’t think existed.” The bank hired David Costa from Goldman Sachs to run the team, which will be tasked with identifying pockets of demand for particular maturities or currencies and then presenting trades to clients. The hope is that such solutions will be not just lucrative, but also might open the door to winning future bond mandates from happy clients without Deutsche having to lend its way onto bond mandates. In recent months, the private placements desk has struck some big deals. In the sovereign space, it did a €500m 50-year deal for Israel, the country’s longest tenor, and a €105m 100-year deal for Ireland. In corporates, it placed big Norwegian krone deals for Deutsche Bahn and Aroundtown - as well as a Hong Kong dollar placement for the latter. “The team is incredibly proactive, they understand the investor base very well, and have very good direct access,” said Lewellen. “It relies on reverse enquiry from investors, so it’s important that sales people are close to the market as they need to be able to spot pockets of demand – for maturity, for currency, for issuer type – and then match that to the issuer’s needs.” US SLIDE Deutsche hopes the strategy will also help it in the US, where it is hard to fight toe-to-toe the big US banks. Deutsche once ranked seventh for US investment grade bonds but has steadily dropped back in recent years, falling to 13th last year with just half the market share it had in 2014. This year is slightly better, but the bank is still outside the top 10. The strategy has nonetheless yielded some fruit: last year, Deutsche was sole books on a €2bn private placement for AT&T. It believes that, rather than go after every US dollar deal, it needs to pick its spots such as taking US corporates overseas for funding. While it may lose places in the US league tables, it can still make money from US clients elsewhere. “We’re not going to try to cover every sector, we’re not going to try to cover every client,” said Marc Fratepietro, the US-based global co-head of DCM. “We’re going to pick our spots and go deep with those clients where we have sector banking expertise and, or if, they have a business profile that aligns with our global footprint and product strengths.” Another area where the bank has lost ground is in high-yield: globally, it was second just a few years back, behind only JP Morgan. But low rates, the ongoing search for yield and an explosion in private equity-led financings has tempted many banks into the space. While Deutsche remains a leader in European high-yield, globally it has fallen to fifth this year. PRIVATE EQUITY LINKS For Johnsson, a former high-yield banker, the space needs to remain a focus for the bank despite the increased competition. He believes that Deutsche’s long and deep history with private equity clients stands it in good stead. According to the bank, it the only one of its peers to underwrite every distributed €1.5bn-plus LBO financing in Europe over the past three years. “We have always been strong in high-yield, but it’s become a lot more competitive,” he said. “The reason why we like these clients and this business is because there is a certain life cycle. Sponsor activity is predictable in the sense that they buy and sell assets along a certain schedule. This means you can concentrate on a smaller group of clients and be very deep with them.” In emerging markets, too, the bank has lost ground. A pullback from emerging markets in 2015 – in part linked to past scandals and increased pressure from regulators to have better oversight over its clients – has led to it losing a lot of business in once-lucrative places like Mexico and Russia. The bank is looking at tentatively - and carefully - moving back into those countries. Third-quarter results on Wednesday indicate the bank is moving in the right direction – DCM revenues at €321m were the best in five quarters and 14% up on the same point last year. But with the new strategy just three months old and the new set-up really only in place for a few weeks, the jury is still out on whether Deutsche can reclaim its former DCM glory. “Of course, clients want to see the proof in the pudding of the new strategy,” said Ross. “But, most importantly, no-one is talking about the viability of Deutsche Bank or the credit risk of Deutsche Bank. They are listening to our ideas. It is early days, but we are starting to see a shift in attitude from clients.” (This article will appear in the November 2 issue of International Financing Review; Reporting by Gareth Gore)"

26.358695652173918," Deutsche Bank shares sink 8% after third-quarter loss FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE shares fell more than 8% on Wednesday after the bank reported an 832 million euro ($924 million) third-quarter loss hurt by restructuring costs and weakness in fixed-income trading. The bank had flagged in July it would make a loss this year and announced restructuring plans worth $7.4 billion including the elimination of 18,000 jobs. Deutsche’s new leadership, with CEO Christian Sewing at the helm, has tried to revive Deutsche’s fortunes, but problems have persisted. In April it called off nearly six weeks of merger talks with Commerzbank CBKG.DE. The third-quarter loss compares with a 3.15 billion euro loss in the second quarter and a 229 million euro net profit a year earlier. The bank is aiming to break even in 2020, but analysts are concerned about its ability to generate revenue. CEO Sewing said the bank’s four core divisions made a pretax profit. “These quarterly results are just an interim assessment, but they are encouraging,” Sewing wrote to staff. Analysts, unsure of the size of restructuring costs in the quarter, had largely held back on providing estimates. Their initial reaction was less than favorable. “One has to look very hard to find anything positive in Deutsche Bank’s results this quarter,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas. The bank’s shares fell nearly 9% late afternoon in Frankfurt and were heading for their biggest daily loss in almost three and a half years. Revenue fell 15% to 5.3 billion euros, short of a 5.6 billion euros expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The bank attributed the decline to its decision to exit its equities business as well as macroeconomic uncertainty and negative interest rates. But it lagged rivals facing similar headwinds. Credit Suisse on Wednesday reported a rise in third-quarter earnings buoyed by higher revenue in markets and international wealth management. Standard Chartered’s profits rose 16% helped by rising income from corporate and private banking clients. FIXED INCOME FALLRevenue at Deutsche’s cash-cow bond-trading division fell 13%, highlighting continued weakness at its investment bank. U.S. banks’ fixed income revenues rose 10% in the third quarter, according to Goldman Sachs. Citigroup said that Deutsche’s weak revenue in the quarter would be likely to result in a downgrade in analysts’ profit forecasts. Deutsche, founded in 1870, is considered one of the global financial system's most important banks, along with JPMorgan JPM.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Citigroup C.N. But after a string losses and scandals, Deutsche is going through one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis. Out of a planned 18,000 job cuts, Deutsche eliminated 1,500 in the third quarter, though the number of employees in its investment bank rose as an intake of new graduates offset staff cuts in equity trading. The bank said revenue at its private bank, which focuses on retail clients and Germany and is the bank’s largest division, would be “slightly lower” in 2019, due to lower interest rates. That is a downgrade from earlier expectations for little change from 2018. Deutsche highlighted some progress in winding down 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets, a pillar of its restructuring plan. Deutsche financial chief James Von Moltke said the bank had auctioned off three books of less complex equities derivatives, which was “quite successful”. The focus will now turn to more complex derivatives, which will take place slowly over coming years, he said."

If Britain were to hold another referendum, DWS said it expected the “Vote Leave” campaign to start with a “severe disadvantage”, especially if the alternative was a hard version of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposed deal. “Other paths toward ‘No Brexit’ include snap elections and/or revoking Article 50 if, at some point, that is the only way to stop ‘No Deal’,” the German asset manager said in a note to clients. More than three years after Britons voted 52%-48% to be the first sovereign country to leave the European Union, the future of Brexit is unclear. The European Union agreed to London’s request for a Brexit deadline extension on Friday but set no new departure date, giving Britain’s divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a snap election. Meanwhile DWS also trimmed its probability of a Halloween no-deal Brexit by 5 percentage points to 15%, saying it had become very hard to envision scenarios leading to such an outcome given both Boris Johnson and other Tory Brexiteers were now on record as preferring “their deal” to “No Deal”. DWS ascribes a higher chance of Brexit being abandoned than other international investment firms. Goldman Sachs has a 25% probability on Brexit not happening at all, while Nomura sees that scenario at 30% and ING at 10%. Peter Kinsella, head of FX strategy at UBP, said he thought it was very unlikely Westminster would end up revoking the Article 50 notice to leave the European Union. “I would not say more than 5%,” he said. “Would the EU even want a permanently divided UK in the EU?”"
8.481012658227847," Ex-Deutsche Bank traders avoid prison time for Libor scheme NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE traders will serve no prison time for conspiring to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate between 2005 and 2011, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, sharply criticizing U.S. prosecutors for treating the two men as ""proxy wrongdoers"" for a much larger scheme. Matthew Connolly, who once led Deutsche Bank’s pool trading desk in New York, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan to six months’ home confinement, while Gavin Campbell Black, who worked on the bank’s London desk, was sentenced to nine months’ home confinement, which he will be allowed to serve in England. McMahon also ordered Connolly to pay a $100,000 fine, and Black to pay a $300,000 fine. The sentence is a setback for U.S. prosecutors in one of the few criminal cases to emerge from a sweeping probe of Libor rigging. The prosecutors had asked the judge to order “substantial” prison time for both men, saying federal guidelines called for close to 10 years, along with a $3 million fine for Connolly and a $2 million fine for Black. McMahon, however, said the prosecutors were trying to hold Connolly and Black responsible for behavior throughout the financial industry. “I do think it is fair to say that the government has used Mr. Connolly and Mr. Black ... as proxy wrongdoers,” she said. “We’re pleased with the court’s ruling,” Kenneth Breen, Connolly’s lawyer, said after the sentencing. Black’s lawyer, Seth Levine, had no immediate comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, underpins trillions of dollars of financial products and is based on what banks say they believe they would pay if they borrowed from other banks. It is to be phased out by 2021. Investigations into whether banks manipulated Libor have led to billions of dollars in global settlements with financial institutions and U.S. and UK cases against several people. Two former Rabobank traders were sentenced to prison in the United States, but their convictions were thrown out on appeal. Connolly was the first U.S. citizen charged with Libor rigging. In a 2016 indictment, prosecutors said that from 2005 to about 2011, he, Black and others conspired to submit false estimates for U.S. dollar Libor rates to manipulate the rate for their own gain. Deutsche Bank agreed in April 2015 to pay $2.5 billion to resolve U.S. and UK investigations of Libor rigging."

The bank will likely cut a low double-digit percentage of jobs at the business, which employs several hundred staff, Bloomberg bloom.bg/2VZlwaR said, adding no final decision had been made. The bank is putting the finishing touches to a review of the unit, which has struggled with low profitability for some time, Bloomberg reported, citing people briefed on the matter. In a statement, Deutsche Bank said: “We are committed to a robust and broad-based rates platform and are investing in areas of our rates business where we see opportunities to grow our client franchise.” (This story corrects name of bank in fourth paragraph)"

Boersen-Zeitung, which cited no sources, said analysts had estimated the unit’s value at 400-500 million euros ($445-$556 million). BNP declined to comment. Deutsche Bank in July announced a 7.4 billion euro sweeping overhaul and retreat from investment banking after years of losing market share on Wall Street.

8.097686375321334," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank took years to flag suspect Danske money flows - source FRANKFURT/TALLINN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank did not disclose more than one million suspect money transfers with Danske Bank until February, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, about five years after a whistleblower flagged suspicious transactions at Danske. Deutsche sent alerts about the suspect money flows involving the Danish bank to Germany’s money laundering data authority and state prosecutors, the person said, prompting investigators to seek more information from Deutsche. Prosecutors are now investigating whether staff or management at Deutsche sanctioned the transactions, and whether they subsequently tried to cover them up, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Deutsche did not comment on the time taken to flag the transactions to authorities, which has previously not been reported, but said it ended its relationship with Danske in 2015 and had strengthened its anti-money laundering controls. Danske Bank was ejected from Estonia this year after admitting 200 billion euros ($220 billion) of suspicious money flowed through its branch there between 2007 and 2015. Deutsche was dragged into the scandal because it processed the bulk of the transactions for the Danish bank, leading German prosecutors to visit Deutsche’s headquarters last month with police and a search warrant. Asked about the case, Deutsche said in an emailed statement that it “remains committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations.” “We have considerably increased staff numbers in Anti-Financial Crime and more than tripled our staff since 2015. We invested since 2016 700 million euros in upgrading our key control functions there.” Following the information from Deutsche, German prosecutors visited their counterparts in Estonia in recent weeks to investigate the suspect money flows further, the person said. Prosecutors are now investigating a small fraction of the 1.1 million transfers flagged by Deutsche, involving Russia and former Soviet states in 2014 and 2015, the person added. If investigators find that Deutsche staff or management sanctioned and covered up its involvement in the suspicious transactions, those bankers or the group itself could face criminal prosecution, the person said. That would deal another blow to Deutsche’s reputation and a setback to Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s drive to turn around Germany’s biggest lender. Once Germany’s flagship bank on Wall Street, Deutsche has been shrinking to try to return to sustainable profitability and has been hit by a string of penalties, including a $7.2 billion fine in 2017 for selling toxic U.S. mortgages before the financial crash. Now, it faces a series of investigations, including one over sham trades to move hundreds of billions of roubles out of Russia, as it struggles to regain the trust of investors, staff and politicians in Germany. Deutsche is one of a number of large international banks to become embroiled in a money laundering scandal in the Baltics, former Soviet satellite states on the edge of Europe that often acted as a staging post for money leaving Russia for the west. A spokesman for Deutsche said it ended the relationship with Danske in 2015 after identifying “an increase in suspicious transactions from Danske clients over an extended period of time.” But it is unclear why Deutsche did not report the suspicious fund transfers until earlier this year. Germany’s Financial Intelligence Unit, which gathers the so-called suspicious activity reports, declined to comment. A person familiar with the matter said the time taken to report the transactions was unlikely to lead to a penalty from German financial regulator BaFin because Deutsche’s role as a so-called correspondent bank was secondary to Danske."
14.209115281501337," Deutsche Bank tells U.S. court it does not have Trump's tax returns NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank says it does not have copies of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax returns, a U.S. appeals court said on Thursday, closing one possible avenue for the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives to obtain the returns. Trump has asked the court to block Deutsche Bank from releasing banking records related to himself and his family, which the House Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee subpoenaed in April. The subpoena is part of Democrats’ broader efforts to gather information about the Republican president’s finances. Long a principal lender for Trump’s real estate business, a 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million in liabilities to Deutsche Bank. In a letter to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August, the bank acknowledged that records related to Trump and three of his children subpoenaed by the committees included tax returns. But while the previously redacted letter said Deutsche Bank held tax returns for two individuals named in the subpoenas, their identities were withheld. Media organizations including Reuters had asked the court to unseal the letter and reveal whose tax returns Deutsche Bank had on file from the Trump family. The court denied the motion on Thursday. However, in its ruling, the court said Deutsche Bank’s letter revealed the tax returns it has for individuals or entities named in the subpoenas were not those of the president. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the court’s ruling. A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. While campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old convention of candidates releasing their tax returns publicly. A decision on whether Deutsche Bank needs to hand over the banking records of Trump, his children and businesses is still pending, the court confirmed. The two congressional panels issued a joint 12-page subpoena in April seeking the records. Lawmakers requested documents that identify “any financial relationship, transactions, or ties” between Trump, his family members and his companies and “any foreign individual, entity, or government”, according to the subpoena. In a separate ruling on Monday, a federal judge said eight years of Trump’s tax returns must be provided to Manhattan prosecutors, forcefully rejecting the president’s argument that he was immune from criminal investigations."

The rejection is a further hiccup for the German lender, which has reshuffled management, is cutting thousands of jobs and closing down some businesses in an effort to make a profit. Deutsche Bank chair Paul Achleitner had announced in August the appointment of former UBS UBSG.S manager Juerg Zeltner, praising him as a valuable addition and ""a top-level European banker with proven expertise"". Zeltner was also to represent the interests of Qatar’s royal family - a top shareholder in the German lender. KBL is controlled by the same family. Deutsche’s regulators - the European Central Bank and financial markets watchdog BaFin - have now determined that Zeltner’s position on Deutsche’s board would be a conflict of interest because he is also the chief executive officer of KBL European Private Bankers (KBL epb), a business that overlaps with Deutsche’s. “It’s a done deal. It is now only a matter of finding a face-saving way out,” the person said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The bank said last month in a statement that all potential conflicts of interest that could arise from Zeltner’s activities and his relationship with one of Deutsche’s major shareholders had been reported to the supervisory board and the company. “They were reviewed by the Nomination Committee and considered to be low,” Deutsche said at the time. Achleitner chairs the committee that recommends new board members who represent shareholders. The ECB, BaFin, KBL and a spokesman for Zeltner declined to comment."

The bank also underscored in a statement that a “substantial” number of jobs will be cut in Germany, which is “by far” Deutsche Bank’s largest location. The lender, which faces a loss for 2019, earlier this year announced sweeping cuts and plans to close down some operations after it called off merger talks with rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE.

16.361071932299016," Deutsche Bank in strategy shift to address tech woes FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is creating a new technology division in a strategy shift designed to reduce complexity and lower costs while transforming systems that have held back the bank for years. The German lender’s legacy IT systems have been blamed in part for the bank’s failure to control costs and for its slow progress in keeping up with the wave of fintech innovation across the industry. Technology has long been a problem for Deutsche Bank. Former Chief Executive John Cryan complained in 2015 about “lousy systems” and “very slow processes”, and former operations chief Kim Hammonds last year described Deutsche as “vastly complex” and the “most dysfunctional” workplace she has known. The central technology division announced on Monday will be led by Bernd Leukert, overseeing tech security, data and innovation functions among others, the bank said in a note to employees seen by Reuters. “At its heart, our technology strategy empowers our businesses to control ‘what’ is produced, while technology has control of the ‘how’. In the past, the ‘how’ offered too much optionality and did not consistently follow group-wide architecture and tooling,” it said. The lender also established a board-level Technology, Data and Innovation Committee in May and has vowed to invest 13 billion euros ($14.2 billion) in technology by 2022. It will be doing so amid a technology arms race in banking. Research from UBS this year found that JPMorgan JPM.N has budgeted $11.4 billion for technology in 2019 alone. In its note to staff, Deutsche Bank also said that moving systems to the cloud would not happen overnight, meaning it would continue to invest in legacy infrastructure on which it operates today. However, it pledged to continue to reduce the number of applications and barriers to technology functions. “We have a bank-wide commitment to strengthen engineering expertise in the bank by increasing the share of expert internal technology staff,” it said.

2.93333333333333," REFILE-Deutsche Bank's bold gambit: betting big on private credit (Fixes formatting) * Illiquid positions in private credit: risky, perhaps; profitable, definitely LONDON, Sept 30 (IFR) - It’s not all doom and gloom at Deutsche Bank. In fact, one corner of the bank is thriving amid the turmoil and job cuts and is even outshining the performance of similar units at rival banks. That business is Deutsche’s colossal credit-trading unit. Credit has become a crucial money-making machine in recent years for Germany’s largest bank, accounting for roughly half of the €5.4bn in revenues its currency- and bond-trading operations pulled in last year, analysts estimate. Unlike most of its rivals, though, Deutsche has built a business focused mainly on trading and financing the least liquid and most complex areas of the credit markets. Some rivals say that is a risky gambit. But it is one that has put Deutsche at the forefront of the latest boom in debt finance: private credit. “The private credit space is growing much faster than the public markets. At Deutsche Bank we have been at the forefront of that, making sure this is at the centre of our strategy,” Chetankumar Shah, global head of credit trading at Deutsche, told IFR in an interview. So far, the strategy has paid off. The bank has steadily taken market share in credit trading in recent years, leapfrogging US behemoths Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs into the top tier alongside JP Morgan in terms of revenues, according to analytics firm Coalition. To get there, it has not been afraid to head into areas that others fear to tread, while largely shunning the more traditional “flow” business of buying and selling corporate bonds on behalf of clients. In the process, Deutsche has developed what may be the biggest distressed-debt unit on Wall Street and it has carved out a similarly large niche in lending against hard-to-value assets. It is also deeply involved in the burgeoning - and murky - market for bad loans in China [See Box story below]. Rivals say that focusing so intently on the less well-trodden and, they argue, riskier parts of credit markets could leave Deutsche vulnerable when the cycle turns. But, so far at least, Deutsche has avoided the kind of heavy losses seen at some rivals when credit markets have slumped in recent years. That’s because, executives say, they aren’t taking excessive risks. “Private credit risk is a different type of risk from the flow businesses. The flow business is subject to mark-to-market fluctuations. The structured credit businesses are more driven from fundamental credit evaluation and can be less volatile if managed well,” Shah said. Deutsche has long been known for its prowess in structured credit, spawning such industry figures as Gregg Lippmann, who figured prominently in Michael Lewis’ book “The Big Short”, and Rajeev Misra, who now heads SoftBank’s Vision Fund. For years senior management touted Deutsche’s pedigree as a “flow monster”, referring to the huge volumes it shifted in more standardised products. But chief executive Christian Sewing effectively drew a line under that era when he announced a retreat from equities and a significant chunk of the bank’s once-mighty rates trading business earlier this year. The credit unit, however, remains largely intact. Indeed, Sewing identified structured credit as a crucial business last year and said it merited investment. The world of structured credit has transformed since the financial crisis. The emphasis has shifted from designing funky-sounding products crammed full of credit derivatives, towards financing and investing in hard-to-value assets - or lending to funds that do so. That is because private credit markets have mushroomed. Private debt funds had US$764bn in assets at the end of 2018, according to data firm Preqin, a more than threefold increase over the past decade. In its financing unit, Deutsche provides leverage to funds that buy pools of soured loans or that lend to mid-sized companies. It also provides financing for commercial real estate, transport (such as aircraft leasing), infrastructure and energy projects. In distressed debt, Deutsche channels money more directly towards struggling borrowers. There has been no shortage of material to work with, particularly in Europe where post-crisis regulations encouraged regional banks to curb their lending operations and offload portfolios of bad loans. “Structured credit post-crisis is more on the financing side,” said Shah. “It caters to financing needs of segments of the real economy, and therefore the opportunity set is vast.” Other banks don’t tend to talk about their distressed debt desks in public. Deutsche’s senior management, on the other hand, referred to it in 10 of the past 17 quarterly earnings calls, according to transcripts, showing the division’s significance. Gavin Colquhoun, head of European credit, has risen up the ranks as distressed debt has grown in prominence at Deutsche. He joined from Merrill Lynch in 2002, where, he says, nine out of 10 of his graduation class moved over to Deutsche (including former credit supremos Boaz Weinstein and Colin Fan). Colquhoun joined the distressed business in 2004, became European distressed head in 2009, before taking over European credit flow trading as well in 2016. He said Deutsche allowed people to be “creative”, citing recent examples in special situations such as fronting a trade finance backed loan to the crisis-hit commodity trader Noble last year, or driving the restructuring of Spanish chocolate company Natra. “Just because it’s illiquid doesn’t mean it’s bad risk,” said Colquhoun. Distressed is an umbrella term, encompassing trading the publicly-issued debt of companies that have run into trouble; “special situations”, or lending to companies going through tricky periods; and non-performing loans - portfolios of smaller loans, such as mortgages, that have gone bad. Deutsche often competes for such deals with private investors, but Colquhoun said that the bank can be more flexible in its targeted business than a typical distressed fund. “The lower cost of capital allows banks to participate in the lower levered, more secured portions of the capital structure,” he said. Distressed exposures are typically held on a bank’s books for far longer periods than ordinary corporate bonds. By definition, they involve dealing with riskier borrowers with strained finances. And it can be a risky business: other banks that have suffered large losses in distressed trading in recent years include Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. As regards risk management, Shah said the bank monitors underlying credit exposures on a regular basis with an “emphasis on credit, structural risks.” There are even indications that Deutsche’s risk appetite has increased. When a rival bank tried to hire a Deutsche team focused on special situations around 18 months ago, Deutsche increased the amount of money the group could deploy by several times to over US$1bn, according to a person familiar with the matter, and said the team could retain virtually all of the risk rather than having to parcel most of it out to other lenders. FINANCING Distressed frequently goes hand in hand with the other business that makes up the lion’s share of Deutsche’s credit revenues: financing. Here, Deutsche partners with private investors instead of competing with them. Patrick Connors, European head of the credit financing and solutions group, said Deutsche’s financing business has expanded as competition to buy assets has intensified and deal sizes have ballooned. “We’re in a yield hungry world. The number of investors that are willing to look at unrated, unlisted financing facilities has grown by a lot,” he said. Two large deals in Spain illustrate how the market is shifting. In 2014, Deutsche bought a portfolio of bad loans from Spanish bank BBVA with a book value of €1.7bn, outbidding distressed funds such as Savia Asset Management and Lindorff Group, according to local media reports. More recently, Deutsche and Morgan Stanley arranged a €7.3bn loan to a joint venture between Blackstone and Santander to manage the real estate assets of failed Spanish lender Banco Popular, which were valued at around €10bn. Connors said that most of the financing trades have an average life of around two years and involve offering senior funding to an investor stumping up around 30%-35% of their own capital to buy the underlying assets. That provides Deutsche with a healthy buffer against any potential losses, Connors said, with the deals overall representing an attractive risk-return prospect. GO WITH THE FLOW Deutsche is now looking to turn around the more run of the mill area of any credit trading unit: buying and selling corporate bonds. After several years of losing money, Deutsche reported revenues were “materially higher” in flow credit trading in the first quarter of 2019 and indicated performance was strong in the second quarter. It has also made several senior hires. “Clearly the credit cycle has had a long run. Keeping those headwinds in mind, the objective of the bank is to continue to focus on [the credit] business and grow selectively,” Shah said. The bank nonetheless faces some obstacles, including a potential ECB investigation into whether it contravened regulations by allegedly trading its own Additional Tier 1 bonds between 2014 and 2017. And some are sceptical that Deutsche’s credit business can maintain market share amid the broader restructuring at the investment bank. “So many times we’ve heard before they’re investing in the business and going to turn a corner, but it’s never quite turned out that way,” said Jon Peace, head of European banks research at Credit Suisse. “We would expect them to give up market share [across fixed income] going forward.” Certainly, the most pressing issue may well be preserving the business that Deutsche has already built at a time when more banks and investment funds are looking to expand their footprint in private credit markets. “Maybe they have the right model,” said one head of credit trading at a rival bank. While Deutsche focuses on high-margin, structured transactions “the rest of us are competing for a few cents here and there.” Chetankumar Shah is based in Singapore, making him the only global credit head at a major international investment bank in Asia. It is, in part, a reflection of the importance of the region to Deutsche’s credit-trading division. Deutsche set up a specialist bad loan unit earlier this year in India. But China is arguably its biggest market in the region. China’s sprawling debt markets represents a huge opportunity for banks, though a risky one because of the political and legal uncertainties that are part and parcel of doing business in the country. Deutsche has developed a formidable financing and distressed debt business in China thanks to its joint venture with China Huarong Asset Management, Hong-Kong-based fund Clearwater Capital Partners and other unidentified firms. The unit, Huarong Rongde Asset Management, was established in 2006, according to the company’s website. Today, it has 14 subsidiaries, 33 branches across China and Rmb600bn in assets. “The challenge is making sure we find the right balance given the credit cycle and geopolitical situation we’re in,” said Shah. “We believe we have a good understanding of the business landscape and the legislation and jurisdiction in those markets.” (Reporting by Christopher Whittall)"
1.0554089709762544," German authorities raid Deutsche Bank over Danske scandal FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German authorities have raided Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE Frankfurt headquarters in search of information related to Danske Bank DANSKE.CO and a money laundering scandal, Frankfurt prosecutors said on Wednesday. They are investigating whether Germany’s biggest bank facilitated money laundering and whether it failed to alert authorities about suspicious transactions quickly enough, the prosecutors said. Danske Bank is under investigation in several countries, including the United States, Denmark, Britain and Estonia, over suspicious payments totalling 200 billion euros ($220 billion) moved through its tiny Estonian branch. Deutsche Bank acted as a correspondent bank for Danske. The search, which began on Tuesday and concluded on Wednesday evening, involved three prosecutors and nine agents from Germany’s federal criminal police. Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating. “Deutsche Bank has comprehensively examined the facts of the matter and has voluntarily provided the requested documents as far as possible,” the bank said in a statement. Prosecutors said the period in question is 2014 to 2018, and that there was a suspect who worked at the bank during that period. Deutsche Bank had alerted authorities to 1.1 million suspicious transactions, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also said that a double-digit number of transactions, with a volume of 12.5 million euros, were either registered by Deutsche too late with authorities, or the bank should have blocked them from the start. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung was the first to report the raid on Deutsche. Deutsche Bank has previously faced issues over money laundering and the controls in place to prevent it. Last year, dozens of police raided six Deutsche Bank offices in and around Frankfurt over money laundering allegations linked to the “Panama Papers”. Germany’s financial market watchdog BaFin last year ordered Deutsche to do more to prevent money laundering. In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million for artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that could have been used for money laundering. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice is still ongoing."

The two banks said on Monday they had reached an agreement to smooth the transfer of the business, which serves hedge funds. The deal is a pillar of Deutsche’s restructuring. Under the agreement, Deutsche would continue to operate the platform for global prime finance and electronic equities clients until the customers can be migrated to BNP, the banks said. A BNP spokeswoman said up to 1,000 staff could move. Deutsche’s shares were down 3.9% midmorning in Frankfurt, while BNP was down 2.5% in Paris. Deutsche Bank said in July it had struck a preliminary agreement with BNP covering the business, centered primarily in London and New York, as part of its 7.4 billion euro ($8.16 billion) overhaul. Finalizing of the deal would mark a milestone in Deutsche’s restructuring, in which the bank is seeking to shed 18,000 employees and close some business lines. BNP expects the deal to help it expand its dealings with institutional clients, such as alternative asset managers or quantitative funds, a BNP spokeswoman said.

-2.753441802252824," Commerzbank aims to cut jobs, branches after Deutsche merger fails FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank said on Friday it wanted to shed thousands of staff and close a fifth of its branches in a strategy overhaul, after the German lender’s attempt to merge with Deutsche Bank failed. The bank, partly owned by the German government after a bailout and struggling to generate profits, also aims to sell a stake in its Polish subsidiary mBank and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit. Commerzbank said the strategy plan would involve investment of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion), with 750 million euros going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring. The bank said the draft measures would be discussed at a meeting of the supervisory board on Sept. 25 and 26. It said no final decision had yet been taken. Shares in Commerzbank, which has been reviewing strategy in recent weeks, were 0.8% higher in late afternoon trade, with some investors saying the measures were not enough. Klaus Nieding, vice president of shareholder lobby group DSW, said the bank needed to do more than cut costs. “The big question remains how the bank wants to make money in the future,” he said. The bank was ejected from the blue-chip DAX index last year, highlighting the challenge facing banks in Europe’s biggest economy since the global financial crisis. The bank said it would cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in “strategic areas”, so the group headcount would fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce. It now employs about 40,700 people. The sale of mBank would reduce its staff by a further 6,600. It also aims to trim the number of branches by 200 to about 800. The sale of its 69.3% stake in mBank has a market value of more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Commerzbank said the proceeds would enable “a faster implementation of its strategy and the associated investments”. The bank, which owns 82% of Comdirect, foresees offering a 25% premium for shares it doesn’t hold. Comdirect shares jumped 26%. Germany’s banks have been battling a legacy of bad debts, bloated headcounts and fines a decade after the global financial crash.

-2.2304832713754723," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank has discussed adding assets to bad bank if sales go well - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some senior Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE officials have discussed the possibility of putting additional problematic assets worth billions of euros into a unit it created earlier this year, if the bank is able to sell assets already held within that ""bad bank,"" according to three bank sources. The discussions in recent weeks, which have not been previously reported, are preliminary, the sources said, adding that there is nothing imminent. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said the bank has no plans to add additional assets into the so-called capital release unit, or bad bank. Nevertheless, it is one of the options that has come up for discussion at the highest levels at the bank, as executives grapple with the problem of having to turn around the bank on a tight budget, according to the three people familiar with the talks. Deutsche Bank needs more capital to be able to absorb the losses that will likely come from shedding problematic assets, such as long-dated derivatives, that are still on its books, the people said. But, after raising 29.3 billion euros ($32.3 billion) in capital over the past nine years, it does not have room to ask investors for more, the sources added. For investors, still nursing a 75% fall in the bank’s share price over the past four-and-a-half years, it means that the road to recovery for the bank will most likely be long. Christian Sewing, who took over from John Cryan in April last year, is looking to reshape Deutsche Bank after a multi-year bet on building a global investment banking business unraveled. In July, he set up the bad bank, called a capital release unit (CRU), to house 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets the bank had identified for wind-down or sale, part of a broader restructuring that will see 18,000 jobs go as it exits unprofitable businesses. Deutsche Bank set aside a 7.4 billion euro budget to fund the restructuring. Some analysts have been skeptical whether the plan fully recognizes the extent of the problem assets still sitting on Deutsche Bank’s balance sheet. They remain particularly concerned about its exposure to Level 3 assets, which are the most illiquid and hard-to-value. “It’s a partial clean-up,” said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors. Hendler added that Deutsche Bank has 18 billion euros in hard-to-value assets on its balance sheet, which he estimated will take years to offload. “They’re trying to paint a picture of progress but there’s still a lot of sludge in there,” he said. Level 3 assets, which can include distressed debt and derivatives, are not necessarily loss making. Deutsche Bank has said that the CRU’s focus is on releasing capital rather than ring-fencing toxic assets. In a memo to staff on July 8, Sewing described the assets within it as “high quality” and said most were of a short duration. Only 30% of Deutsche Bank’s 25 billion euros worth of Level 3 assets have so far been placed within the capital release unit, according to a presentation the bank gave alongside its quarterly results in July. The bank has tried to shed some of those assets, which include longer-dated derivatives, over the past three years. But it had little success because it was not prepared to take the writedowns the sales would have required, the sources said. A sale of a financial asset can lead to a capital hit if the price is below what the bank values it at on its books, leading to a loss. Deutsche Bank must stay within the budget it has set for its restructuring to avoid having to raise funds from investors, the sources said. It set up the capital release unit with a view to shedding assets it could realistically find buyers for or wind-down in the next two to three years, the sources said. That, in turn, would free up capital to fund the sale of longer-term assets that will require bigger writedowns, the sources said. Of the assets currently in the unit, Deutsche Bank plans to run a formal auction of its equity derivatives book as soon as this month, several sources familiar with the sale process have told Reuters. If those sales are successful, the bank could move more assets into the restructuring unit, the three sources close to the bank said."
-3.846153846153852," ECB weighs investigating Deutsche Bank over alleged unauthorized bond purchases: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is examining whether to open a formal investigation into Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE for allegedly buying some of its own securities without authorization, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The alleged offense, which could result in a fine if the bank is found to have broken rules, comes as Germany’s biggest lender tries to improve its reputation with investors and relationship with regulators after years of misdeeds. Deutsche Bank and the ECB declined to comment. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung first reported the news. The securities at issue are known as AT1 and AT2 bonds. The bonds, which emerged after the financial crisis, are designed to protect taxpayers from potential bailout costs if a bank runs into hardship by putting the risk in the hands of the holders of the bonds. But it may defeat the purpose if the bank holds the bonds, which is why the ECB requires a bank to seek its authorization to do so. Deutsche Bank sought authorization in 2014 for the purchase of the bonds, but it was denied, the people said. The lender continued to buy them anyway, in an attempt to create a liquid market, one of the people said. The ECB eventually authorized Deutsche Bank to buy the bonds in 2017, but the ruling wasn’t retroactive. The ECB is now in a fact-finding phase to determine whether it should open a formal investigation, the people said. Deutsche Bank is in the midst of a broad restructuring, involving job cuts and the exit of certain business lines in an effort to become profitable.

-11.479289940828389," Deutsche Bank is first to settle bond-rigging lawsuit, amid federal probe NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG will pay $15 million to resolve claims it conspired to rig prices of bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, becoming the first of 16 financial services companies to settle litigation by investors. The German bank did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which also requires that it bolster its antitrust compliance procedures and cooperate with the investors. Court approval is required. The settlement was disclosed in filings late Wednesday in Manhattan federal court. Investors including Pennsylvania Treasurer Joe Torsella accused several of the world’s largest banks of exploiting their market dominance to overcharge for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds from Jan. 1, 2009 to Jan. 1, 2016, and secure more profit for themselves. The civil case began after a published report last year said the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal probe into possible price-fixing in the bonds. According to Wednesday’s filings, Deutsche Bank agreed in May to share information with the investors about other banks accused of price-fixing, in connection with its having received leniency in a related federal criminal antitrust case. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Deutsche Bank spokesman Troy Gravitt said the bank was pleased to settle with the investors. Lawyers for the investors called Deutsche Bank’s settlement an “ice-breaker” that could bring other defendants to the negotiating table. “This agreement is an important first step, but just a first step, toward greater accountability on Wall Street,” Torsella said in a statement. According to an amended complaint on Tuesday, the defendants underwrote $3.97 trillion, or 77.2%, of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds in the seven-year period. Deutsche Bank’s 6.95% market share was the fourth-largest, trailing Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and UBS Group AG. On Sept. 3, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said investors could sue Deutsche Bank and four other banks, calling chat room transcripts involving their traders “direct evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices” and a “rare smoking gun.” Rakoff dismissed claims against the other 11 defendants, but Tuesday’s complaint was intended to address his concerns.

-13.373493975903617," Deutsche Bank forecasts another 100 basis points of Federal Reserve rate cuts (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday that it now forecasts another 100 basis points of rate cuts and see growth falling to below 1.5% by mid-2020, assuming there is no escalation in the trade war between the United States and China. “If the conflict picks up, the U.S. risks zero rates and a mild recession,” David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist, said in a note to clients. He said the European Union is at even greater risk for a recession. The Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in more than a decade in July as it tried to insulate the United States from President Donald Trump’s trade war and a global slowdown. Market pricing suggests that investors expect another quarter-point reduction when the Federal Open Market Committee holds its two-day meeting beginning Sept. 17. “In the U.S., our economists have revised down their growth forecasts, largely as a result of trade uncertainty,” Folkerts-Landau said. “Manufacturing is contracting and there are cracks in the otherwise strong labor market.” Folkerts-Landau said: “Larger action from the Fed will raise the pressure on other central banks to respond.” He said the firm’s analysts expect the European Central Bank to cut policy rates and possibly restart asset purchases. “However, at a certain point, increasingly negative rates become counterproductive,” he said. “We’re not certain where the reversal point lies, but it would be better not to experiment with the world’s second largest economic area.” In China, growth is undoubtedly slowing due to the adverse impact of U.S. tariffs but officials have some space to respond, Folkerts-Landau said. “Policy support has not yet filtered through to the real economy, but we expect that rate cuts will begin to stabilize activity later this year, albeit with growth at a slower rate.” Folkerts-Landau said: “Although our economists think a recession can be avoided I would not be surprised if the EU tipped into one and the U.S. came close. My central scenario is still that the policy cushion available to the Fed will allow the U.S. to avoid a downturn, but I am not as confident anymore.” He said he believes that aggressive easing by the ECB will “only serve to rob investors and consumers of confidence and that it will be the last nail in the coffin of the expansion. The path for global economic activity and risk assets has become unusually dependent on the ability of the U.S. administration to avoid an outright trade and tech war.”"

-8.025477707006369," Exclusive: U.S. congressional probe finds possible lapses in Deutsche Bank controls - sources LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. congressional investigators have identified possible failures in Deutsche Bank AG's DBKGn.D money laundering controls in its dealings with Russian oligarchs, after the lender handed over a trove of transaction records, emails and other documents, three people familiar with the matter said. The congressional inquiry found instances where Deutsche Bank staff in the United States and elsewhere flagged concerns about new Russian clients and transactions involving existing ones, but were ignored by managers, two of the people said. Lawmakers are also examining whether Deutsche Bank facilitated the funneling of illegal funds into the United States as a correspondent bank, where it processes transactions for others, one of the sources said. The congressional probe, whose initial findings have not been previously reported, is at an early stage, and it is not yet clear whether it will lead to any action against the bank, the three sources said. A Deutsche Bank spokesman, Troy Gravitt, said the bank cannot comment on the work of the congressional committees but remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations. Addressing past deficiencies in the bank’s controls, the spokesman said: “We have worked to address them, taken disciplinary measures with regards to certain individuals and reviewed our client onboarding and monitoring processes.” The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee declined to comment. The Democrat-controlled House began examining possible money laundering in U.S. property deals involving President Donald Trump, a Republican, earlier this year. The lawmakers are also looking into whether Trump’s dealings left him subject to the influence of foreign individuals or governments. The White House and a Trump Organization spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, did not respond to requests for comment. Deutsche Bank has been drawn into the inquiry as Trump’s biggest lender and submitted documents to investigators in response to a subpoena. The stakes are high for the German lender, which is trying to engineer a turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing after a multi-year bet on building a global investment banking business unraveled. Graham Barrow, a financial crime consultant, said that while the bank had since sought to reform, it had taken too many risks in countries such as Russia. “The bank decided to go for becoming a global investment bank,” Barrow said. “They were compromised.” Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Barrow’s view. In 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay regulators in the United States and Britain $630 million in fines for organizing $10 billion in sham trades that could have been used to launder money out of Russia. Two of the sources said that the preliminary findings of the congressional investigators may have some overlap with that case but also include lapses unrelated to that matter. New evidence thrown up by the congressional probe could feed into further investigations by other authorities, regulatory experts said. If evidence of wrongdoing is found, it could also harm the bank’s efforts to strengthen its relationships with U.S. regulators and deter investors concerned about the possibility of future regulatory sanctions. Deutsche Bank’s shares hit an all-time low last month. Earlier this year, the House Financial Services Committee served a 12-page subpoena on Deutsche Bank. Reuters has seen a version with portions blacked out. Lawmakers requested documents that identify “any financial relationship, transactions, or ties” between Trump, his family members and his companies and “any foreign individual, entity, or government”, according to the subpoena. It also asks for hundreds of documents relating to other bank clients, including Russian oligarchs, the three sources said. These documents include account applications, know-your-client money laundering checks, internal assessments of “suspicious activity”, as well as information about loans and mortgages, according to the subpoena. Although Trump has challenged the release of his banking records in court, in April Deutsche started handing over information that is not directly related to the president and is continuing to do so, one of the people said. That includes material prepared by bank staff for filing so-called suspicious activity reports to the U.S. Treasury Department and documents about Russian deals circulated among the bank’s management and reputational risk committee, one person said. The bank has also assembled a large amount of the subpoenaed Trump material, pending the court’s decision on whether it should be released, the three people said. The House Financial Services Committee will continue its investigation of Deutsche Bank’s money laundering processes regardless of whether the court rules the lender should hand over the Trump documents to investigators, three sources familiar with the investigation said."

-4.144385026737974," Deutsche, Commerzbank CEOs warn of ECB rate cut side effects FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The CEOs of Germany’s two largest listed banks on Wednesday warned that a further cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank would deal a blow to savers and the financial system while having only minimal effect on the economy. The stern message comes a week before an ECB policy meeting at which decision makers are expected to lean toward a stimulus package that includes a rate cut. Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE CEO Christian Sewing told a banking conference that his company's customers had said they would not invest more if credit were 0.10 percentage points cheaper. A rate cut would “only drive up asset prices and further burden savers”, he said. Lower rates would help those who are indebted or invested in assets, but the majority of the population would not benefit, he said. “That divides society further,” he said. Over the long term, low rates are ruining the financial system, he added. Commerzbank CBKG.DE CEO Martin Zielke backed Sewing's stance. “I also don’t consider this a sustainable, responsible policy,” Zielke said. Banks in Germany and across Europe have long complained about ECB policy which requires banks to pay to park their cash at the central bank, hurting their profits. Banks in Germany paid 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) to the central bank to hold cash in 2018, the German government said in response to a parliamentary inquiry on negative interest rates. BlackRock's BLK.N chairman and CEO said at the same conference that the people of Germany and France believe bank accounts, despite rock bottom interest rates, are the best place to keep their money. “They are wrong,” he said, pointing to stock markets and property as alternatives. “It is financial craziness,” he added."

-1.5068493150684854," Deutsche CEO to invest 15% of monthly net pay in bank's shares FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE chief executive Christian Sewing will spend 15% of his monthly net salary buying the German lender's shares starting in September, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. The filing makes official a pledge Sewing made in July, when he announced a major restructuring of the bank. Sewing said at the time he would invest a “substantial amount” of his fixed salary in the bank. The CEO, who is shaking up Deutsche Bank to try to revive its profitability, said in July he wanted to put his money where his mouth was. Sewing will buy roughly 21,250 euros ($23,681.00) in shares around the 22nd of each month through to the end of 2022, the filing said. That would result in a total investment of around 850,000 euros, based on monthly purchases up to the end of 2022. Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low of 5.78 euros per share on Aug. 16. At 1203 GMT on Monday, Deutsche’s shares were at 6.64 euros each, up 1.1%. They are down 4.7% so far this year. Last month, Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner bought nearly 1 million euros of the bank’s shares."

-0.13850415512465078," BNP Paribas plans bid for Deutsche Bank's equity derivatives NEW YORK (Reuters) - French lender BNP Paribas BNPP.PA plans to bid for Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE equity derivatives book and is hopeful it can beat off rival bidders to secure a deal in the next few weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter. Deutsche Bank is selling the portfolio as part of a restructuring that will see it exit equities trading and other unwanted businesses and shed 18,000 staff globally. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is hoping the plan will turn around the bank, whose shares hit a record low this month. Deutsche Bank plans to auction its equity derivatives portfolio next month having received significant expressions of interest from banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, the sources told Reuters. It may sell the book in separate tranches rather than in its entirety, they said. BNP is already close to taking control of Deutsche Bank’s prime brokerage business, which serves hedge fund clients. A preliminary deal was struck in July which is expected to be formalized early next month. Any equity derivatives deal would be separate from that transaction, the sources said. BNP and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Reuters reported last month that Deutsche Bank’s derivatives exposure is tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros a year. Reuters also reported the bank has set aside over 1 billion euros to cover the cost of offloading derivatives moved to its so-called “bad bank,” or capital restructuring unit to be wound down or sold. The restructuring has seen the bank hive off 288 billion euros of assets into the bad bank. Equities, including equity derivatives, accounted for around 170 billion euros of those assets. Fixed-income assets, including long-dated interest rate and credit derivatives, accounted for 79 billion euros. The equity derivatives are short-dated and expected to attract a lot of interest from buyers, meaning Deutsche Bank may not have to take a discount to offload them. The bank’s longer-dated interest rate and credit derivatives are expected to be much harder to sell, as they require high levels of capital to be held against them, and could require deep writedowns, sources familiar with the situation said. BNP expressed its interest in Deutsche Bank’s equity derivatives business earlier this year but the German lender decided against entering into exclusive talks having also received interest from other parties, sources told Reuters. Deutsche Bank is under pressure to complete the prime brokerage deal quickly or risk losing clients. Barclay BARC.L is looking to take on a $20 billion portion of the $200 billion business, sources told Reuters last month. Deutsche Bank plans to close the prime brokerage deal in the first half of September and to begin the auction of its equity derivatives book shortly afterwards, the sources said. The deals are expected to take months to complete as buyers take over individual client accounts."

Two committees in the U.S. House of Representatives subpoenaed Deutsche Bank in April to provide financial records belonging to the president and his children Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. Deutsche Bank’s filing, in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, revealed that it had tax returns that it would need to hand over if it complied with the subpoenas, which the Trumps are seeking to block. It was not clear whose tax returns it had, because names were redacted from the filing. A lawyer for the Trumps could not immediately be reached for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The disclosure comes as Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee are seeking to obtain Trump’s personal and business tax returns, which the president has refused to turn over, from the Treasury Department. Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump’s real estate business. A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank. The subpoenas on Deutsche Bank, issued by the House Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, seek records of accounts, transactions and investments linked to Trump and the three named children, their immediate family members and several Trump Organization entities, including records of possible ties to foreign entities. Deutsche Bank said in Tuesday’s filing that it also had tax returns for people who “may constitute ‘immediate family’” as defined by the subpoenas, without giving any names. A lawyer for the Trumps last week urged the 2nd Circuit to block the bank from handing over the records, saying Congress did not have the authority to demand them. The court has not yet ruled on the case. The Trumps are also seeking to block a separate subpoena served by the Financial Services Committee on Capital One Financial Corp seeks records related to the Trump Organization’s hotel business. Capital One said in a court filing on Tuesday that it did not have any tax returns related to the subpoena. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 2nd Circuit judges had ordered both banks to disclose whether they had tax returns last week.

5.5954088952654315," Trump urges U.S. court to shield Deutsche Bank records from House Democrats NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump asked a federal appeals court on Friday to block Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE and Capital One Financial Corp COF.N from handing the financial records of the president's family and the Trump Organization to Democratic lawmakers. The case, before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, is one of several legal battles between the Democrats, who took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January, and the Republican president, who is seeking re-election in November 2020. In subpoenas issued in April, Democratic lawmakers asked the banks for records related to Trump, his adult children and the Trump Organization. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan ruled in June that the subpoenas could be enforced. Patrick Strawbridge, a lawyer for the Trumps, told the appellate panel that the committees did not have a “legitimate legislative purpose” for the subpoenas, which he described as too broad. “The subpoenas look for every debit card, every Diet Coke that a teenager purchased using a credit card from Capital One” if they are related to Trump, he said. Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump’s real estate business, and a 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank. The Deutsche Bank subpoena issued by the House Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee seeks records of accounts, transactions and investments linked to the Trumps, immediate family members and several Trump Organization entities, plus records of possible ties to foreign entities. The Capital One subpoena issued by the Financial Services Committee seeks records related to the Trump Organization’s hotel business. Douglas Letter, a lawyer for the committees, told the court that Congress needed the information to craft new legislation aimed at curbing money laundering and foreign meddling in U.S. affairs. “We’re investigating massive amounts of Russian money,” he said. Both sides said during Friday’s hearing that they might be willing to negotiate about the scope of the subpoena, and that they had made such offers before. Letter said he believed Trump’s offer to negotiate was “insincere,” which Strawbridge denied. At the end of the argument, whether they Circuit Judge Jon Newman asked lawyers for Deutsche Bank and Capital One have Trump’s tax returns or those of his children. Raphael Prober, Deutsche Bank’s lawyer, said he could not answer the question in open court because of the bank’s “contractual obligations.” Capital One’s lawyer, James Murphy, also declined to answer, saying simply, “I prefer not to.” Both lawyers said they would submit letters to the court responding to the question within 48 hours."
5.5954088952654315," U.S. fines Deutsche Bank $16 million to settle China, Russia corruption charges WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle charges that it violated U.S. corruption laws by hiring relatives of foreign government officials in order to win or retain business, the U.S. regulator said in a statement. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that Germany’s largest lender hired poorly qualified or unqualified relatives of officials in Asia and Russia at their request, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Between at least 2006 and 2014, it said Deutsche employed relatives of executives working at state-owned enterprises in China and Russia with the “primary goal” of generating business for the company such as initial public offerings. The SEC also found that Deutsche employees created false books and records that concealed corrupt hiring practices and failed to accurately document and record certain related expenses, violating internal accounting rules. Under the settlement, Deutsche Bank did not admit or deny the findings, the SEC said. “Deutsche Bank provided substantial cooperation to the SEC in its inquiry and has implemented numerous remedial measures to improve the bank’s hiring practices,” a Deutsche spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The $16 million settlement includes disgorgement of $10.8 million, interest of $2.4 million and a $3 million civil penalty, the SEC said. Deutsche is one of several global banks to be investigated over the hiring of so-called “princelings” in China. In 2016 JPMorgan JPM.N agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials to win banking deals, while Credit Suisse CSGN.S paid $77 million to settle a similar case last year. However there have been fewer investigations of similar instances in Russia. The SEC said that from 2009 to 2012 “Deutsche Bank employees hired relatives at the request of foreign officials in Russia to obtain or retain business or other benefits.” It gave an example from 2009 in which the bank was asked by an unnamed “deputy minister” at a Russian government entity to hire his daughter. “We must do it! We should have her in London as it is NOT politically correct to have her in Moscow!” the SEC quoted the bank’s Russia chief in an email to his supervisors back then. Deutsche hired the daughter as a temporary employee in Moscow, according to the SEC. Four months later the bank failed to win a deal it had sought from the Russian government. The lender then arranged for the daughter to be given a permanent job and transferred to London, and 10 days later Deutsche Bank received a request for proposal signed by her father for a “2 billion euro Eurobond issuance”, the SEC said. In a case in 2010 Deutsche hired the son of a senior executive at a Russian state-owned company in Moscow at that executive’s request, according to the SEC. The bank then transferred him to a graduate program in London despite the human resources department saying he was “likely not eligible” for the scheme. After two months the bank transferred him back to Moscow after human resources said he “failed to come to work, cheated on an exam and was a ‘liability to the reputation of the program, if not the firm.” The SEC said Deutsche had taken extensive remedial measures to fix its hiring compliance and internal accounting controls."

5.278174037089873," Deutsche Bank tightens worldwide procedures on new hires: memo FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, in the midst of a major restructuring and headcount reduction, is tightening its worldwide procedures for new hires, according to an internal memo. The memo, dated Wednesday and seen by Reuters, said that any new hires would require explicit approval from the bank’s chief executive officer Christian Sewing, as well as his deputy Karl von Rohr and finance chief James von Moltke. “Hiring will be restricted to positions that are viewed as critical to the bank’s success and future growth, with a greater emphasis on internal mobility and identifying tasks we can discontinue,” the memo said. The final stamp of approval from the trio of board members is a shift from the past when subordinates had more say over external hires.

4.734576757532282," Humbled Deutsche Bank faces battle in its own backyard FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Online retailer Zalando is just the kind of fast-growing German business with foreign expansion plans that Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing needs to help drive the struggling lender’s recovery. In an attempt to draw a line under years of scandals and heavy losses, Sewing is pulling back from investment banking and rebuilding Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE corporate division by deepening existing relationships and attracting clients beyond its traditional blue-chip customers. But when Deutsche has tried to expand its business with Zalando by offering to hold more of its cash for free, rather than charging a fee, Zalando ZALG.DE has declined. The company, whose revenue has grown to 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in the 11 years since it was founded, wants to continue to spread its risk by leaving its cash with a wide range of institutions, sometimes for a fee. “Deutsche Bank is a systemically relevant bank but, nevertheless, we see a possible risk and are trying to the best of our knowledge to mitigate the risk and to have a good sleep at night,” Dominika Kilka-Roth, who heads Zalando’s risk management, told Reuters. Zalando’s stance indicates it could be a tough slog for Sewing, who wants corporate banking to be the soul of Deutsche Bank, just as it was when the lender was founded in 1870 a year before German unification. Since Deutsche Bank embarked 20 years ago on its ultimately failed but costly drive to become a Wall Street trading powerhouse, a lot has changed in its domestic market. A growing number of domestic and foreign banks muscled in on its business while it was distracted by its global investment banking ambitions, leaving a far more crowded German market now. German lenders Commerzbank CBKG.DE and HVB, a subsidiary of Italy's UniCredit CRDI.MI, have been pursuing German corporate clients both large and small for some time and are bringing in more senior bankers to accelerate their push. At the same time, foreign banks, including U.S. giants JPMorgan JPM.N, Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, have been making inroads while Standard Chartered STAN.L recently set up shop across the street from Deutsche with a view to targeting German companies. What’s more, ever since the financial crisis, German companies are more likely to use multiple lenders, making it harder for Deutsche to re-establish itself as a so-called Hausbank for German corporates. Deutsche’s push also comes as Germany, which is Europe’s biggest economy, risks sliding into recession for the first time since 2013 after years of punishingly low interest rates. On Friday, shares in Deutsche Bank hit a record low below 6 euros. In 2007, before the global financial crisis took hold, the shares peaked at above 90 euros. ‘LOST OUR COMPASS’ Earlier this year, the German government pushed for Deutsche to merge with cross-town rival Commerzbank to stabilize the lender. But the talks failed, leading Deutsche to announce its major revamp and corporate push last month. Sewing recognizes Deutsche has lost ground but is determined to press on with his strategy to make the bank the go-to institution for company treasurers and to help more German companies become global powerhouses. “This is the business Deutsche Bank was founded for, however, we have to admit that we lost our compass in the last two decades,” Sewing said in July. “Now we will make the business stronger than ever before.” Deutsche plans to merge its corporate banking businesses across various divisions into one large unit, and target mid-sized German firms, known as the Mittelstand, as well as blue-chips. Michael Schleef, Deutsche’s head of corporate banking in Germany, told Reuters there had been a 58% increase in incoming orders since Oct. 1, though he declined to give details. Calls and visits to clients were up 50% per banker after years of stagnation and the feedback was “very positive”, he said. Deutsche is also planning to expand in new markets in eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, he said. “We aren’t feeling any uncertainty from clients.” Mittelstand companies are the backbone of the German economy but have long felt neglected by Deutsche, turning to smaller rivals instead. Mario Ohoven, president of a federal association of Mittelstand companies, said a lot will depend on whether Deutsche approaches them as a partner, or an arrogant banker. A big problem for Deutsche as it embarks on the new strategy is that it has been slipping down the German league tables. So far this year, Deutsche has been absent from several major deals involving German firms. When chipmaker Infineon Technologies IFXGn.DE bought America's Cypress Semiconductor CY.O for $10 billion - the biggest overseas deal by a German company in 2019 - it was advised by Credit Suisse CSGN.S, Bank of America BAC.N and JPMorgan. In the ranking for fees from mergers and takeovers involving German companies this year, Deutsche has slipped to sixth place, according to data from Dealogic. Deutsche had ranked among the top five banks since at least 2000, often in top spot. Deutsche has slipped down the table for syndicated loans for German companies too, according to Dealogic. It still ranks first for their bond issues but its market share has plunged by two-thirds since 2000, the data shows. Deutsche also dropped to sixth place from fifth in league tables for transaction banking between 2016 and 2018, according to Coalition, which analyses the banking industry. And in a sign companies are spreading their business around more, 22 out of 27 German companies active in deals awarded a smaller share of fees to their primary bank over the past five years than in the previous five years, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. ‘LONG JOURNEY’ The intensified competition at home is epitomized by the case of Duerr DUEG.DE, a 120-year-old company that makes factory equipment for the auto industry. In 2014, Duerr counted Deutsche among its seven main banks for a syndicated loan. In a new agreement this month, Deutsche is now one of 13, a wider circle that includes Bank of China 601988.SS, Dutch bank ING INGA.AS, and JPMorgan. “Nobody puts all eggs in one basket,” said Christian Aue, a vice president for corporate finance and treasury at Duerr. Andreas Thomae of fund manager Deka, which is a large investor in Deutsche, said: “It is now extremely important for the bank that corporate customers accept the new strategy.” “It will be interesting to see whether it can increase earnings in the division as planned. This will be a long journey,” he said. As Zalando turned down Deutsche’s offer, its bankers tried to assuage the company’s misgivings, Kilka-Roth said, but to no avail. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Zalando. The bank’s own data suggests Zalando is not the only corporate with doubts. Companies started reducing cash stored with Deutsche several years ago as the bank’s woes mounted, according to data from the bank’s annual report. Company deposits, which primarily come from Deutsche’s transaction business, fell 8% between 2015 and 2018. Narrower measures of short-term deposits from big customers - excluding deposits from banks and companies doing transaction banking such as cross-border payments - show an even steeper fall. Deposits with a maturity of less than a year, for example, fell 32% between 2015 and 2018. Deutsche Bank disputed any suggestion the decline in deposits was related to customer concerns about the bank. Instead, the drop is the result of an effort by Deutsche to convert deposits from large corporations into alternative investments to avoid negative interest rates charged by the European Central Bank, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said. Deposits from smaller corporate clients have risen by double digits over the past three years, he said. ‘COMPLETE CONFIDENCE’ Regulators say the bank is on firmer footing than in 2016 when they feared it was on the brink of collapse after it became public it would have to pay a multi-billion dollar fine for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis. Then, some of Germany’s top industrial companies discussed taking a symbolic stake in Deutsche Bank to help it through its turmoil. But no action was taken. Sewing, who became CEO last year, would now like to welcome anchor investors from corporate Germany, according to someone who has spoken with him. Deutsche declined to comment. It is unclear how widespread Zalando’s stance is in Germany because few firms speak publicly about banking relationships. RWE's RWEG.DE finance chief Markus Krebber, for example, told Reuters the German energy company had ""complete confidence in the strength and performance of Deutsche Bank and see it on the right path under its initiated restructuring"". Deutsche’s corporate banking business already accounts for 5 billion euros in annual revenue, according to the bank’s calculations. Sewing said it should be able to increase that to 6 billion euros by 2022, “not by doing rocket science, but by simply reaping low hanging fruit”. He pointed to the fact the bank already had relationships with all 30 companies in Germany's main DAX stock market index .GDAXI. “In the first half of 2019 alone, we facilitated payments worth more than 100 trillion euros,” Sewing said in July. A recent survey from the consultancy Bain & Company, however, found revenues and profitability in the corporate banking sector are the lowest in Germany since the financial crisis due to increased competition. “When we talk to our clients, they have very aggressive plans in the corporate banking space this year,” said Christian Graf, the report’s author and consultant to the banking industry."
4.255319148936168," Stimulus hopes drive up European shares for second session (Reuters) - European shares ended higher for a second straight session on Monday on signs that measures would be adopted to prop up growth in major economies, while bond yields rebounded amid improved global sentiment plagued by recession worries. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX, hammered since the start of August by worries of a possible global slowdown, ended 1.2% higher, with Frankfurt shares .GDAXI up 1.3%, recovering from last week's six-month low. Friday’s report that Germany’s coalition government may ditch its balanced budget rule to take on new debt and launch stimulus continued to help sentiment. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the country possessed the fiscal strength to counter any future economic crisis “with full force.” “It’s a continuation of what we saw on Friday, the hope that their government will step in to provide fiscal stimulus to boost growth in the economy,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist, Germany at ING. “Because news like that is a game changer.” The moves from Berlin come on the back of stalled growth across Europe that has been led by a slowdown in the region’s largest economy, with the U.S.-China trade war, Brexit uncertainty and Italy’s political woes adding pressure. Longer-term bond yields in the euro zone as well as the United States, whose slide below short-term rates last week set off alarm bells about a possible recession, were off their record low levels. “Its like we had a big storm and now there is a dry period with some rays of sunshine which will encourage more risk-taking, but it is still a highly volatile market,” said Brzeski. China’s central bank added to the stimulus cheer by unveiling interest rate reforms targeted at lowering corporate borrowing costs. The move comes after Beijing announced plans to spur private consumption to shore up growth last week. All Europe's stock market sectors ended the session in the black. Oil stocks .SXEP chalked up their biggest daily gain since January this year, benefiting from a rise in crude prices due to an attack on Saudi oil installations in Yemen.

Der Spiegel, citing unnamed sources, said the shareholders had “concrete thoughts” about replacing him. Der Spiegel didn’t name the investors it said were pressing for the change. Achleitner, under pressure from shareholders for some time, survived a confidence vote at May’s annual shareholders’ meeting. But Deutsche shares hit a record low on Friday, highlighting investor scepticism about the bank’s latest turnaround plan. Achleitner has begun the search for a successor but intends to complete his term, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Der Spiegel named Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Munich Re MUVGn.DE Chairman Nikolaus von Bomhard as two people who fit the profile for a possible successor, but it added that neither had been approached. Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “Mr. Achleitner is mandated until 2022. Furthermore, all questions regarding succession planning on the supervisory board are handled by the nomination committee.” The office of von Bomhard didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Bundesbank declined to comment. Munich Re didn’t respond to a request for comment. Deutsche Bank shares fell as low as 5.777 euros, below their previous record low of 5.8010 euros set on June 3, before closing up 4.7% at 6.16 euros."

Deutsche’s shares hit a record low in June, and executives have embarked on a major overhaul of the lender. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing recently announced he would invest a “substantial amount” of his fixed salary in the bank by “personally putting my money where my mouth is”. Deutsche Bank supervisory board members receive part of their annual compensation in shares, but Friday’s purchase is not part of that. The 992,380 euros in shares that Achleitner bought on Friday exceed his 2018 fixed salary from Deutsche Bank of 858,333 euros. Deutsche shares were down 1.2% at 1259 GMT, trading at 7.009 euros per share. Achleitner bought the shares at 6.844 euros per share, according to the filing. “Generally purchases by insiders and leadership are a good signal,” a trader said."

After its victory over activist shareholder Edward Bramson who failed in his bid to dismantle the British lender’s trading operations, Barclays is trying to build up its business serving hedge funds. Barclays declined to comment. Germany’s flagship lender said on July 7 that it will axe its equities trading business as part of a major restructuring, and that BNP Paribas had signed a preliminary deal to serve prime finance and electronic equities clients impacted by the plan. However, some of Deutsche Bank’s clients are weighing alternatives to shifting their business over to the French bank, the sources familiar with the matter said. “It is not unexpected and perfectly natural that some clients may wish to move balances to other providers as a temporary measure while our discussions with BNP Paribas are ongoing,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank told Reuters. “Our discussions with BNP Paribas are progressing well and we are confident that balances will move back once the deal has been completed.” The $20 billion worth of client business in Barclays’ sights includes around $10 billion with one client with whom it already has a relationship, and who has decided to shift its activities to the British bank following news of Deutsche Bank’s planned exit from equities trading, one of the sources said.

-0.2525252525252471," Deutsche Bank stumbles to big loss on road to reinvention FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE reported a bigger than forecast quarterly loss of 3.15 billion euros ($3.5 billion), underlining the challenges faced by Chief Executive Christian Sewing as he attempts to turn around the struggling business. Germany’s largest bank had already flagged it would lose around 2.8 billion euros in the quarter when it announced a restructuring plan that will see 18,000 jobs go and cost 7.4 billion euros overall. The size of the loss, compared with a profit of 401 million euros a year ago, prompted the bank’s shares to slide as much as 5.8% in Frankfurt before regaining some ground. The bigger loss stemmed from higher goodwill impairment charges than foreseen when the bank announced its restructuring on July 7. As it reshapes, the bank expects to post a loss in 2019, meaning that it will have been in the red for four out of the past five years. But it is aiming for profit in 2020. The bank also anticipates 2019 revenue to be lower than in 2018. That forecast marks a further scaling down in expectations from previous quarters. Founded in 1870, the bank is considered one of the most important for the global financial system, along with U.S. heavyweights JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. But Deutsche has been plagued by losses and scandal, prompting it to embark on one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis. CEO Sewing said on Wednesday that the bank had already taken significant steps in implementing the strategy. More than 900 employees had given notice or been told they would be made redundant from a bank that had around 91,500 employees. In a note to staff, Sewing said that the lender’s underperforming investment bank faced “strong headwinds” in the quarter, including questions about the bank’s future that spooked clients. “Now we can look ahead with more optimism,” he wrote. Deutsche’s troubles peaked with a $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market crisis, in a major blow that caused clients to flee. A new leadership, with Sewing at the helm since last year, has tried to revive Deutsche’s fortunes, but problems have persisted. In April, the bank called off nearly six weeks of talks to merge with cross-town rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE. It then embarked on a plan for “tough cutbacks” to its investment bank, representing a major retreat from investment banking for Deutsche Bank, which for years had tried to compete as a major force on Wall Street. Net revenue in the quarter fell 6% to 6.2 billion euros. Revenue at Deutsche’s cash-cow bond-trading division dropped 4% in the quarter, while equities sales and trading revenue dived 32%. The declines underscore the continued weakness at the lender’s investment bank, which saw an 18% drop in net revenues during the period. “I could make excuses,” about the division’s performance, Sewing told analysts. But “this simply doesn’t matter. We must do better and we will do better.” RBC Capital Markets wrote that Deutsche’s earnings illustrated the “long road until we have visibility on the many stepping stones” to a turnaround. Among details of the overhaul announced earlier this month, Deutsche said it planned to scrap its global equities business and scale back its investment bank. It also reshuffled management. The bank will set up a new so-called “bad bank” to wind down unwanted assets, with a value of 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets. Reuters reported on Tuesday that it will take years to shed those unwanted assets, tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros a year. Preparations to auction unwanted equity derivatives are “well advanced”, the bank’s finance chief told analysts. Some investors have said they doubted these moves would be enough to turn around its flagging fortunes in the face of intense competition and low interest rates. Others investors have said they were worried Deutsche Bank would backtrack on a pledge not to tap shareholders for additional cash, particularly in view of its capital constraints. “I really can’t say that I see the positives in this plan. I remain a bitter curmudgeon,” said Barrington Pitt-Miller, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors."

0.25380710659899064," New man on the board to clean up Deutsche Bank's act FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Qatari-backed lawyer tasked with trying to draw a line under Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE regulatory scandals has risen rapidly at the German bank, jumping to the management board after three years as a ""sparring partner"" on the bank's supervisory body. Deutsche Bank is desperate to clean up its act and restore its reputation after years of turmoil including the Libor rate-rigging scandal and money-laundering investigations, and Stefan Simon has an intimate knowledge of the bank’s rocky relationships with regulators and courts. The enigmatic corporate lawyer will soon be sitting on Deutsche’s management board, promoted from its external oversight board as part of a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) overhaul which will see the bank shrink and lose 18,000 jobs. Simon joined Deutsche’s supervisory board three years ago, with the backing of the lender’s largest shareholder, Qatar. He played an influential role on that board, impressed his backers and served on the very committee that engineered his own promotion. The 49-year-old former partner at Bonn-based law firm Flick Gocke Schaumburg has kept largely out of the public eye, but he has worked behind the scenes since his 2016 appointment to shake up Deutsche’s management. “The role of the supervisory board as a sparring partner for the management board...has become more important in recent years,” he wrote several months ago. Simon sits on six of the supervisory board’s nine committees, more than any other member other than Chairman Paul Achleitner. His seats include one on the most powerful committee - the chairman’s committee, which decides on the appointment and dismissal of management board members. This month, the supervisory board fired three of the bank’s nine management board members, including those overseeing the investment bank, the retail bank and the regulatory chief, the role that Simon himself will fill. Simon replaces Sylvie Matherat, a former French central banker appointed to Deutsche in 2015. Achleitner last week praised her for enhancing Deutsche’s “new compliance and risk culture”, but she fell out of favor with regulators and investors as Deutsche repeatedly landed in hot water. In 2017, the bank was fined $7.2 billion in the U.S. for its role in the mortgage crisis, nearly toppling the bank. It failed stress tests with the U.S. Federal Reserve, and German regulators took the rare step of condemning the bank for lapses in controls to prevent money laundering. In November, Matherat sought to downplay Deutsche’s role in a money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank and suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros from 2007 until 2015. But Simon, as head of the supervisory board’s integrity committee, opted to get an independent view and commissioned the law firm Gibson Dunn to advise the board on Danske, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Gibson Dunn didn’t respond to a request for comment. As a lender to U.S. President Donald Trump, Deutsche has also been subpoenaed by U.S. Congress to hand over information on his finances. The U.S. Department of Justice is separately investigating Deutsche for trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the bank being fined nearly $700 million. In Germany, prosecutors are escalating a money laundering inquiry involving Deutsche Bank using a subsidiary alleged to help clients avoid taxes. Deutsche has said it is cooperating with the investigation and Simon’s integrity committee vowed to devote “special attention” to it, according to Deutsche’s annual report in April. When asked last week about Simon, Deutsche’s chief executive officer Christian Sewing told analysts: “We have looked for somebody who knows, obviously, our legal portfolio, who has contributed to the clean-up over the last two to three years.” At Flick Gocke, Simon advised Deutsche on its involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That helped put him on the bank’s and Qatar’s radar. The bulk of Simon’s career was focused on mergers and acquisitions, insolvencies and corporate governance. He was made partner after just five years and his clients included the energy company E.ON and the bank HVB, according to Juve, a publication that follows the legal industry. Simon was “really entrepreneurial”, something “untypical” for a lawyer, said Thomas Roedder, a partner at the firm. He attracted unwelcome attention though, when the founder of one of his clients, an insolvent developer of offshore wind farms, filed a criminal complaint accusing Simon of acting against the interests of the company. Simon denied wrongdoing and prosecutors didn’t pursue the suit. When Simon left Flick Gock to join Deutsche’s supervisory board he founded his own firm, Simon GmbH, based in Zurich, locating himself close to where he likes to cycle in the Alps. He has also tried his hand at acting and film production and had a role in the 2017 film “Dirty Bomb” about wartime Germany. When he makes the switch to the management at the end of July, his income from the bank is set to increase to at least 2.4 million euros, plus bonus, from the 488,000 euros he earned last year from the bank. It is unusual for someone to jump to management from the supervisory board, but not unheard of. Former CEO John Cryan made the shift. Regulators are likely to have informally signed off on Simon’s appointment, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment and a spokesman for Simon declined to be interviewed. ($1 = 0.8925 euros)"
-2.737940026075619," Partial ECM exit to leave Deutsche Bank focused on Europe LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is focusing its equity capital markets (ECM) business such as initial public offerings (IPOs) on Germany and Europe, scaling back in the United States and retreating from most of Asia, banking sources said. Germany’s largest lender said on July 7 it would retain a “focused” ECM franchise as well as U.S. and European equity research teams as part of a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) shake-up which all but ends its ambitions on Wall Street. The bank’s “reinvention”, which is expected to lead to 18,000 job cuts by 2022, includes the closure of all of its equities trading and cutting some parts of its fixed income operations. Deutsche Bank’s plans to shrink its ECM business, which involves raising money for corporate clients on the world’s stock markets through IPOs and private placements, has left some bankers questioning how it can still compete. Its franchise is already under pressure. In the first half of 2019, Deutsche Bank ranked 13th in the league table for global equity capital market deals, down from ninth place in the same period a year ago, Refinitiv data shows. But in its home market, Deutsche Bank was third biggest in terms of fees in 2018, lagging its U.S. Wall Street rivals JP Morgan JPM.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N, the data shows. ECM league tables can be volatile given there are often large swings in IPO volumes from year to year, with revenues from such activities at investment banks already suffering from reduced issuance and fee pressure.. However, Deutsche Bank’s ECM practice made up just 3% percent of its total investment banking revenue last year and sources said a fall in proceeds would not hit its bottom line. Deutsche Bank has already axed a number of ECM banking roles in Asia, Europe and the United States since Chief Executive Christian Sewing announced his overhaul, sources said. Jason Cox, the Asia-Pacific head of equity capital markets was laid off and teams were disbanded in Japan, Australia and most of Asia, sources have previously said. At least three members of the London team lost their jobs on Monday, sources said, and the roles of global head of ECM and global head of equity syndicate, responsible for researching and marketing IPOs, remain vacant. And teams could gradually be reduced further, the sources told Reuters, with a likely knock-on effect. “The very small ECM team that we will have globally after this will mean that we won’t get senior roles in any of the IPOs,” a senior Deutsche Bank investment banker in Asia said. “So if a company in London or a unicorn in China is looking to do an IPO, they would not look at Deutsche as a lead, nor will we pitch for that role,” the senior banker said, adding that the bank could still pitch for junior roles in some deals. In the United States, it will continue to work on sectors that it deems strategic, a source close to Deutsche Bank said. The underwriting role it secured in the IPO of U.S. electric bus maker Proterra, was helped by the bank’s relationship with auto investors in Europe, another source said. Over the past year Deutsche won global coordinator roles for IPOs including Volkswagen's truck unit Traton 8TRA.F and luxury car maker Aston Martin AML.L, and bookrunner roles in the IPOs of ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies UBER.N. It also has a global coordinator role on the IPO of brewing firm Anheuser-Busch InBev NV's ABI.BR Hong Kong arm Budweiser, which on Friday delayed pricing the flotation. There are also more deals in prospect, with Deutsche Bank securing roles in up to 10 which should happen in the next 12 to 18 months in Europe, a third source said."

-3.6486486486486545," Deutsche Bank looks to boost wealth management as part of reinvention ZURICH (Reuters) - With other parts of its business facing hefty cuts, Deutsche Bank wants to expand its European operations handling the assets of rich clients and take market share from rivals after staunching the outflow of assets. Hiring new client relationship managers and perhaps making acquisitions in a few years’ time can help fuel growth, said Claudio de Sanctis, head of wealth management Europe and chief executive of Deutsche Bank (Switzerland) Ltd. The division is targeting entrepreneurs and rich families in core countries such as Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain as well as largely untapped markets in eastern Europe. Wealth management is seen as a growth area after a major restructuring announced on Sunday by Germany’s largest bank that will chop 18,000 jobs and scale back its investment banking operations. “It is not necessarily known but we already are among the biggest wealth managers in Europe in terms of assets. That will be helpful in terms of being credible with European entrepreneurs,” de Sanctis said in an interview. Deutsche Bank said last month it planned to hire 300 more relationship and investment mangers for its wealth management (WM) business by 2021. The business accounted for about 7% of the bank’s 25 billion euros ($28 billion) in revenue in 2018. “The bank has said it wants to focus on areas where we can compete and where we can win, and we think in wealth management that is the case,” Christian Nolting, Chief Investment Officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, told Reuters in a separate briefing. Wealth management is attractive to banks as it requires less capital and its earnings tend to be less cyclical than other parts of the business. But it is also highly competitive. Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse are already big players, while upstart fintech companies are also trying to make inroads. Deutsche Bank’s wealth management business has lost assets in Europe of late amid negative headlines over the bank’s struggles. This year, however, flows in Europe were “definitely positive”, said de Sanctis, himself the former head of private banking in Europe for Credit Suisse. Attracting new relationship managers tends to boost assets as some of their clients make the switch as well. Acquisitions could also be on the cards, albeit not immediately. “In principle, my view would be in the next two to three years we prove the organic case, which is very substantial. When we have that credibility then -- given that WM is important and Europe is core -- then we will look at potentially doing acquisitions,” de Sanctis said. Eastern European countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania seem attractive as well. “We have a very good corporate banking presence in these countries locally. However, we haven’t been very active on the wealth management side there – it is a full potential to be exploited. For now, it makes sense to do it on a cross-border basis, and Luxembourg will be the hub.” Nolting sees no issues in hiring to fuel Deutsche Bank’s wealth management push despite the job cuts that dominated headlines this week. “Relationship managers coming over to us see this as an opportunity. Otherwise they wouldn’t come,” he said. “They consider our investment process and our discretionary performance, because if they want to bring clients over they need to ensure that they have a very interesting and well-working platform to be able to deliver.

-4.670329670329668," Doubts over Deutsche Bank turnaround plan dent shaky shares LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DKBGn.DE shares extended losses on Tuesday on investor doubts that its chief executive can revive the lender by shrinking the investment bank and returning to its roots as banker to corporate Germany. Christian Sewing, CEO for just over a year, and his finance chief are on week-long roadshow to explain the restructuring. To underline his commitment, Sewing plans to invest a quarter of his fixed salary -- around 820,000 euros -- in Deutsche shares, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Deutsche’s stock price has fallen 10 percent since Sunday’s restructuring announcement to cut 18,000 jobs in a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) “reinvention”. It is the biggest two-day decline in almost three years. By 1312 GMT, shares were down 3.8% on the day, after sliding as much as 6.5% earlier. The bank’s bonds also fell. Analysts and investors say Sewing, who joined Deutsche Bank in 1989, is right to cut back its trading desks but question if he can make his plan work when interest rates are still low and U.S. banks have expanded their share of the German market. “There seems to be some concerns around the plan details, particularly the ability for the bank to retain revenues while cutting costs,” one of the bank’s top 25 shareholders told Reuters, citing worries the bank would need fresh equity to execute Sewing’s plan. Analysts with RBC Capital Markets wrote that the bank’s outlook for revenue growth was “ambitious” and there was a high degree of risk associated with implementing the plan. Ratings agency Fitch, which last month downgraded the bank to “BBB” status, the lowest investment-grade, echoed this. “Cutting back volatile, capital-intensive and underperforming sales and trading activities, and further reducing the cost base should improve profitability and strengthen leverage, but execution risks are high,” it said. Deutsche plans to return closer to its roots by focusing on corporate banking and asset and wealth management, areas that can offer more stable revenues than investment banking but are increasingly competitive. The bank began cutting jobs in its trading business on Monday, with staff laid off in offices stretching from Sydney to New York. Sewing, promising to make a break with a past of Deutsche’s “over-promising and under-delivering”, told analysts on Monday that his plan was a “real game changer”. At least one big investor is sold on the proposals. Douglas Braunstein, who holds an 3.1% share in Deutsche through his New York-based Hudson Executive Capital, said it would take a while for the market to appreciate what Deutsche Bank is doing. “Going back to basics for this 150-year old company is ultimately going to be a very successful strategic decision,” he said on CNBC. However, Deutsche Bank's capital instruments took a further hit on Tuesday, with a US dollar Additional Tier 1 (AT1) perpetual instrument callable in Nov 2021 dropping as much as 2.4 cents on the dollar to 84.62; setting the yield at a hefty 30.4%. DE107155147= The euro-denominated debt also suffered losses with a perpetual AT1 bond callable in May 2027 falling 1.5 cents to 86.56, with the yield rising to 11.89%. < DE107205454=>"
-4.670329670329668," Breakingviews - Deutsche creditors give ECB charity short shrift LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - When in need, help can come from unexpected places. Just ask Christian Sewing. As part of the Deutsche Bank chief executive’s bumper restructuring announced on Sunday, the European Central Bank allowed the lender to cut its common equity Tier 1 ratio target by 50 basis points. A sharp uptick in the yields of Deutsche’s equity-like debt instruments implies this is a mixed blessing. On one level, the regulator’s decision makes sense. Deutsche already has a CET1 ratio of 13.7%, among the highest in its peer group. The lender’s global rivals – including Barclays, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Société Générale – operate with CET1 ratios of 11.7%-13%. Deutsche’s new lower management CET1 ratio target of 12.5% releases 4.2 billion euros which can soak up restructuring charges, decreasing the potential need for Sewing to tap shareholders in what would be a deeply dilutive capital raise. Given that the ECB benefits from a slimmed-down and safer Deutsche, its charity is understandable. Still, that could mean Deutsche’s buffer to its regulatory minimum requirement of 11.8% shrinks to just 2.4 billion euros. That’s one reason why yields on its riskier additional Tier 1 debt, whose coupon payments would be threatened if Deutsche sunk below the lower threshold, shot up by around 3 percentage points to over 12% on July 9, according to Refinitiv data. Another is uncertainty over whether the ECB will allow the bank to operate with such a low safety cushion if Sewing’s gambit doesn’t work. For the plan to succeed the Deutsche boss needs minimal losses in his run-off unit and his remaining businesses to grow revenue at around 2% annually until 2022 – a big ask. That is why ratings agency Moody’s was more cautious: it said they would wait for more tangible results before revising Deutsche’s current negative outlook. Either way, the ECB’s decision will have raised the eyebrows of Deutsche’s competitors. True, none of them are so desperate they have to fire a fifth of their workforces and put a similar proportion of their balance sheets into run-off. But they will be interested to know if Deutsche’s regulatory leg-up is a one-off, and if not whether the supervisor might look the other way to help consolidation happen. The worst-case scenario is that banks feel emboldened to ask for special treatment – and Deutsche’s overhaul fails anyway."

The troubled German bank is piloting OakNorth’s technology with a view to formalising the partnership, the source said. The software uses data about a prospective borrower such as the financial performance of its peers and sentiment about its brand from online reviews to help inform lending decisions. Deutsche is seeking to return to its roots as a lender to companies in its home market as part of a sweeping restructuring. OakNorth and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. OakNorth, Britain’s most valuable fintech firm, earlier this month announced the first enterprise-wide agreement with a bank to use its technology when it inked a five-year deal with Dutch lender NIBC Bank NV. The British firm says its technology helps banks make better decisions on small business loans by using the level of data analytics that banks normally only use for $25 million-plus medium-sized deals. OakNorth is in talks with ten banks, OakNorth Chief Executive Rishi Khosla told Reuters last week, as it seeks to monetise its credit analysis platform by signing up lenders in the United States, Europe and Asia. The British firm raised $440 million from investors including Japan’s SoftBank Group in a February funding round that valued OakNorth at $2.8 billion. Deutsche Bank on Monday embarked on a 7.4 billion euro ($8.29 billion) restructuring that will cut around 18,000 jobs as it tries to reverse years of declining performance.

-4.670329670329668," Big ax falls as Deutsche Bank to lay off 18,000 in $8.3 billion 'reinvention' FRANKFURT/SYDNEY/HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank laid off staff from Sydney to New York on Monday as it began to slash 18,000 jobs in a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) “reinvention” that will lead to yet another annual loss, a plan that knocked its already battered shares. Germany’s largest lender said on Sunday it will scrap its global equities unit and cut some fixed-income operations in a retreat from a long-held ambition to make its struggling investment bank, with 38,000 staff, a force on Wall Street. Deutsche Bank has almost 91,500 staff around the world. (GRAPHIC: Deutsche Bank in numbers - tmsnrt.rs/2Jow9hq ) Its shares erased early gains and closed down 5.4% in Frankfurt after its finance chief flagged “significant uncertainty” over breaking even in 2020. Its bonds also fell. U.S.-listed shares dropped 6.1%. Some analysts were skeptical that the bank could grow future earnings quickly enough to reach a new target to achieve a return on tangible equity of 8% by 2022, compared with a negative return last year. “The question of where the real earnings power will come from for Deutsche Bank going forward has not been answered,” said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors. “It’s doubtful whether they will be able to build a better bank in just three years.” Ratings agency Fitch said that the bank’s future credit rating will depend on how successfully it executes the plan. Fitch downgraded the bank to “BBB” status, the lowest investment-grade status, just last month. “The restructuring measures involve large staff cuts and significant leadership changes, which could disrupt the aim to improve core earnings,” it said in a note published Monday. Rating agency Moody’s said there were “significant challenges” to executing the plan swiftly, adding it would keep its negative outlook. “It’s a risky maneuver, but if it succeeds, it has the potential to bring the bank back on course,” said a person close to one of the top 10 shareholders. JP Morgan analysts called the plan “bold and for the first time not half-baked” but questioned the credibility of execution, revenue growth and employee motivation. The bank said on Sunday that it would not need to raise capital to initiate the cuts, which will result in it making a loss of 2.8 billion euros in the second quarter. It will not pay a dividend either this year or next. Hundreds of employees at the bank’s Wall Street office were summoned to the building’s cafeteria on Monday morning to learn their fates, sources within the bank told Reuters. During one-to-one meetings with management and human resources, they were told they were being laid off and informed of their severance terms, the sources said. Deutsche Bank had been one of the few European banks to maintain a significant presence in the United States after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. However, it has struggled to compete with U.S. rivals, hampered by regulatory investigations and litigation. The United States had been seen as a likely focus of the cuts although the bank maintained it wants to keep a significant presence, in part to service European corporate clients doing business in the country. However, some shareholders have pushed for a full U.S. retreat. Deutsche Bank said it remained committed to the United States, its second-biggest market. “We will retain a significant presence here and remain a close partner to our U.S. clients and to international institutions that want to access the U.S. market,” it said in a statement. In London, where hundreds of job cuts were expected, Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said he was “reinventing” the bank, which is expected to post a loss this year. That would put it in the red for four of the past five years after a series of damaging setbacks. Founded in 1870, Deutsche Bank has long been a major source of finance and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets. Big cuts to its investment bank reverse a decades-long expansion that began with its purchase of Morgan Grenfell in London in 1989 and continued a decade later with a takeover of Bankers Trust in the United States. The investment bank generated about one-half of Deutsche Bank’s revenues but is also volatile. CEO Sewing, who flagged the restructuring in May after a failed merger attempt with Commerzbank, wants to focus on more stable sources of revenue. “We are creating a bank that will be more profitable, leaner, more innovative and more resilient,” Sewing wrote in a note to staff on Sunday. As part of the overhaul, Deutsche Bank will set up a so-called “bad bank” to wind down unwanted assets, with 74 billion euros ($83 billion) of risk-weighted assets. ‘PRETTY GLOOMY’ Deutsche Bank did not give details on the job cuts, but said they would be spread around the globe, including in Germany. In Sydney, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, where Deutsche Bank used to rank among the top 10 in league tables for equity capital market (ECM) deals, several bankers said entire teams in sales and trading were going. Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific head of ECM, Jason Cox, left, and ECM teams were disbanded in Japan, Australia and most of Asia, people with direct knowledge of matter said, adding that only a few syndicate bankers, including those working on current deals, will remain. Deutsche Bank had slipped in recent years in Asia, hitting 17th last year and 18th in 2019, Refinitiv data showed. So far this year, it ranks 8th regionally for merger-and-acquisition activity. “The new investment bank will be smaller but more resilient, with a focus on our financing, capital markets, advisory services and sales and trading businesses,” Asia-Pacific CEO Werner Steinmueller said in a staff memo. One laid-off equities trader in Hong Kong said the mood was “pretty gloomy” as people were called into meetings. “They give you this packet and you are out of the building,” he said. Several workers left offices holding envelopes with the bank’s logo. Three employees took a picture of themselves beside a Deutsche Bank sign outside, hugged and then hailed a taxi. “If you have a job for me, please let me know. But do not ask questions,” said one Deutsche employee. One senior banker, still with a job, questioned how well the slimmed-down franchise in Asia would compete. “Will clients stick with us, or is the game over?”"

The bank laid off staff from Sydney to London on Monday as it began 18,000 job cuts in a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) “reinvention” which it said would mean yet another annual loss. “When banks come out with a cost number there’s often some quarterly attrition on that number through the execution phase. Therefore the risk is a slippage on the targeted ... net costs saves,” Russell Quelch, financials analyst at Redburn, said. “There are already doubts around the starting point for revenues given the weakness in the first two quarters of 2019.” The pan-European banking sector .SX7P which fell 1% was further weighed down by shares of Swiss lender Julius Baer BAER.S after the company appointed Philipp Rickenbacher, as its new chief executive officer.

The German bank began telling staff of the layoffs in Sydney, then across the region, taking in its Hong Kong and Singapore trading hubs before bankers in Europe and the U.S. reached their offices to be told their fates. The following are comments by employees leaving the bank, as well as from those who have been told their jobs are safe: “I was terminated this morning. There was a very quick meeting and that was it,” said an IT worker leaving Deutsche Bank’s City of London office on Monday morning. “I got laid off, where else would I go?” said one equity sales staff member in London, who had headed to nearby pub. “The day started with a phone call and a meeting with HR. We were informed that our jobs have become redundant and handed over our letters and given approximately a month’s salary and have been asked to leave. Our systems have been taken and we can’t log in and have been asked to vacate the premises by 0730 GMT,” said a Bengaluru-based banker. “With these kind of cuts in the equities business, you can’t avoid an impact on the investment bank. All the clients here were already asking questions about the changes, and now they will ask questions about the ability to provide truly bespoke service. And it’s not like they don’t have any options in the market,” said a senior Hong Kong-based equity capital markets (ECM) banker, who added he was surprised by the scale of cuts to the bank’s ECM business in Asia. “There is hardly any work getting done today and folks are just mailing or calling friends or headhunters. Half of the floor is gone and others are just waiting to be called in. Some people are saying their byes even before being called in,” said an equities trader in Hong Kong who has spent two years at the bank. The trader said he and his colleagues had been escorted from their meetings with Human Resources (HR) to the elevators without being allowed to return to their desks. “We are still what we were on Friday but with a much, much smaller equities capability,” said one senior Sydney-based bank executive, who kept his job. “It’s good that the uncertainty has finally ended. I was preparing myself and my family since the Commerzbank talks failed. The equities market is not that great so I may not find a similar job, but I have to deal with it. Frankly, I was not expecting they will cut the entire equities piece,” said an equity sales banker in Hong Kong as two colleagues came to hug him and see him off from the main building lobby. The banker had been with Deutsche for six years. “The news is obviously depressing but at least there’s some clarity on the businesses we are still going to focus on. My access card is working fine. So I am safe for now. What happens tomorrow, who knows but for now, I hope this is it,” said a banker in Singapore as he tapped his card to gain access to the lift. “The mood inside is pretty gloomy. People are being called in individually into the conference rooms with a couple of rounds of chats with HR, who will give you this packet then and you are out of the building. Even those who are staying back don’t think it’s the turning point for the bank. Who wants to go into a bad bank just to wind down the businesses? So more people will leave when they get the opportunity. Personally, I think they (management) have taken a very shortsighted decision: Equities is a cyclical business and it’s not like DB was the only bank not making any money in this,” said one equities trader who had worked at Deutsche Bank for six years. “Our ECM business has to be scaled back but it’s not like everything will happen in one day. This is not like what StanChart did to its equities business. We are not going to be giving up our live deals. But the biggest question for us is where do we go from here if we don’t offer the whole suite of products? Will clients stick with us or is the game over?” said a Singapore banker who remains in his job. “If you have a job for me, please let me know. But do not ask questions,” said a banker in Hong Kong who confirmed he had been employed at Deutsche Bank, but declined to comment further. “(It is) very frustrating because they got rid of the whole of the equities business that supports us in corporate finance. But it’s part of the industry - equities businesses have been challenged everywhere. We need to stop and think now what our business model is without an equities business. Is it strategic advice? Or is it leveraged financing? It seems to me that’s the natural direction now,” said a senior Australian corporate finance banker."
-8.222811671087534," Deutsche Bank capital-boosting debt dips on restructuring fears LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank’s capital-boosting Additional Tier I (AT1) debt issues fell on Monday on worries over future challenges Germany’s biggest lender may face in a planned overhaul. Concerns centered on Deutsche Bank’s decision to lower minimum capital buffers, a pool of assets designed to absorb losses, after it launched one of the biggest overhauls of its investment bank since the 2008 financial crisis on Sunday. The debt had earlier risen after Deutsche Bank said it will pay coupons on its bank capital debt. “A substantial restructuring was needed to address the bank’s sluggish performance,” ING analyst Suvi Platerink Kosonen said, adding: “The measures involve substantial execution risks and lowering the capital buffers makes the bank more vulnerable to any headwinds”. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. dollar Additional Tier 1 perpetual bond, callable in November 2021, were down 0.70 cents on the dollar at 93.51, off an earlier high of 94.41. Two euro-denominated issues, both callable in May 2027, were also down, reversing early gains. “I guess (the early gain) was a knee-jerk reaction on the stock being up 5% plus, but as people digest the details, then it is difficult to get AT1 support,” said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions credit research at Alliance Bernstein. Deutsche Bank will now target a minimum common equity tier 1(CET1) ratio of 12.5% and a leverage ratio of 4.5% by 2020 and 5% by 2022. It had a CET1 ratio of 13.7% at the end of March. Meanwhile, the cost of insuring exposure to Deutsche Bank’s debt through 5-year credit defaults swaps (CDS) fell by 3 basis points (bps) from Friday’s close to 61 bps, data from IHS Markit showed.

-8.222811671087534," Deutsche shutters equity underwriting in Asia Pacific HONG KONG, July 8 (IFR) - Deutsche Bank is to pull out of equity underwriting in Asia Pacific as part of the German lender’s plan to axe 18,000 jobs globally. The cuts to the equity capital markets division started today and affected the entire ECM teams in Japan and Australia, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Jason Cox, Deutsche’s Asia Pacific head of equity capital markets, is leaving the bank. Some origination and syndicate bankers in Hong Kong and Singapore will be staying for a while to execute deals in the pipeline before leaving. Those deals include the US$9.8bn Hong Kong IPO of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC and the US$1bn-plus Hong Kong IPO of Logistics property developer ESR Cayman. The Chinese listings in the US, such as Wanda Sports Group, are expected to be handled by the US-based teams, said the people. One source said the decision to shut down the global equities business made ECM underwriting impossible, flagging the potential for further cuts in the future. Deutsche said on Sunday it will exit its equities sales and trading business globally but retain a “focused equity capital markets operation”, as part of what chief executive Christian Sewing has termed a “fundamental transformation” of the bank. So far this year, Deutsche Bank ranks 12th for equity and equity-linked underwriting in Asia Pacific, excluding Chinese A-shares and the Japanese and Australasian markets. It arranged a US$750m convertible bond for Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio and the US$687m IPO of Embassy Office Parks REIT, India’s first real estate investment trust. The bank also won a senior role in the ongoing Budweiser IPO, the world’s largest listing this year, as one of four joint global coordinators, and is is one of two sponsors on ESR’s float. “The ECM business has been improving a lot in Asia these past few years.

-8.222811671087534," After Deutsche Bank cuts, where will the growth be? LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - For Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing, shrinking the group’s investment bank will be the relatively easy - if expensive - part of his restructuring plan. Finding steady revenue streams to produce the 7.4 billion euros ($8.31 billion) the bank expects in charges from cutting down its trading arm will be more challenging. Germany’s biggest bank said on Sunday it planned to focus on corporate banking, foreign exchange, deal-making, asset management, and private banking. All these areas potentially could provide less volatile revenue streams than the bank’s equity and rates trading arms, but they are already fiercely competitive and undergoing sweeping technological changes. Deutsche Bank wants corporate banking to be the center of its business. This involves building on its strengths in transaction banking - such as trade finance and cash management. The bank is held up by rivals as a traditionally strong performer in these areas, but its standing has slipped recently with the lender dipping from 5th to 6th last year in the global league tables for transaction banking compiled by banking analytics firm Coalition. Transaction banking, one of the less glamorous areas of finance, is a growing focus at several of Deutsche’s rivals, as it requires less capital and is not as cyclical as investment banking. Goldman Sachs GS.N for example is looking to launch a cash management business next year while HSBC HSBA.L and Standard Chartered STAN.L are trying to build on their strong Asian franchises by beefing up their European operations. In investment banking Deutsche has said it wants to retain a focus on advising on M&A deals and on helping to list companies and issue bonds. The bank remains a major player in this space, but trails U.S. rivals, while some European competitors are gaining some market share. In Refinitiv's investment banking scorecard, which tracks how firms do on advising on M&A, equity and debt capital markets, loans and leveraged finance, Deutsche currently ranks 8th so far this year globally - steady compared with 2018. In Europe, it has slipped to 8th from 7th a year ago, with BNP Paribas BNPP.PA edging above it. In asset management, Deutsche Bank’s DWS arm is seen as another of its strong points, and one the bank leaned on to extract value last year when it listed 22.5% of the business. But with the sweeping rise of passive investments, asset managers need scale and technology to compete. Deutsche had held talks with rival UBS UBSG.S earlier this year about a merger of their asset management arms, but talks broke down due to a clash over who would ultimately control the business. In private banking, Deutsche has said it plans to hire 300 new relationship and investment managers by 2021 as part of a plan to bulk up in the sector. But the bank will be tracing a path already beaten by several of its rivals, and it will need to find a strong niche if it is to make much headway. Its wealth management arm had 213 billion euros under management at the end of the first quarter. BNP Paribas, which is just inside the top 10 wealth managers globally, had 361 billion euros at the end of 2018. A broader challenge for Deutsche is technology, with the lender trying to update legacy IT systems that are blamed in part for the bank’s failure to control costs while also keeping up with the wave of fintech innovation in the industry. Deutsche has established a board-level Technology, Data and Innovation Committee to tackle this, and in a memo to staff on Sunday Sewing said Deutsche Bank would invest 13 billion euros in technology by 2022. That should help, but it will be doing so amid a technology arms race in banking. Research from UBS earlier this year found that JPMorgan JPM.N has budgeted $11.4 billion for technology in 2019 alone."

Shares of the German lender touched their highest since early May after it announced a restructuring plan that will cost 7.4 billion euros ($8.3 billion) and see it undo years of work that had aimed to make its investment bank a major force on Wall Street. The move comes after Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing had flagged the restructuring in May, seeking to convince shareholders that he can turn around Germany’s biggest lender after shares hit a record low. This limited the slide in broader Europe, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.07% by 0707 GMT, as they followed Asian shares into the red. Defensive stocks and financials weighed on the benchmark as it extended last session’s decline after strong U.S. jobs data saw investors trimming bets of a 50 basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in July. Much of the global stocks rally since June has been spurred by expectations of an accommodative monetary policy by major central banks to tackle slowing growth as the damaging trade war between United States and China takes its toll."

The German bank launched the restructuring on Sunday in Europe, outlining a plan that will ultimately cost 7.4 billion euros ($8.31 billion) and see it dramatically scale back its investment bank - a major retreat after years of working to compete as a major force on Wall Street. As part of the overhaul, the bank will scrap its global equities business and also cut some of its fixed income operations - an area traditionally regarded as one of its strengths. While the bulk of the 18,000 job losses are widely expected to fall in Europe and the United States, on Monday the cuts also hit offices from Sydney to Hong Kong. Deutsche Bank gave no geographic breakdown for the job cuts when it announced the plan on Sunday. Bankers in Sydney seen leaving the lender’s offices on Monday confirmed they worked for Deutsche Bank and were being laid off, but declined to give their names as they were due to return later to sign redundancy packages. One person with knowledge of the bank’s operations in Australia said its four-strong equity capital markets team was being let go, but that most of its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) team would not be immediately affected. Deutsche had some 4,700 staff in Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, showed factsheets on its website. Its investment banking team for the Asia-Pacific region numbered about 300 people before the cuts, and 10% to 15% will be laid off - almost all in its equity capital markets division, according to a senior Asia banker with direct knowledge of the plans. In Hong Kong, a group of three upset-looking bank employees took a picture of themselves besides a large Deutsche Bank logo outside the lender’s office, hugging each other before hailing a waiting taxi. One Hong Kong-based equities trader who had been laid off said the mood was “pretty gloomy” as people were called individually to meetings. “(There are a) couple of rounds of chats with HR and then they give you this packet and you are out of the building,” the trader said. Several workers were seen leaving the offices holding large envelopes with the bank’s logo. “If you have a job for me please let me know. But do not ask questions,” said one who confirmed he was employed at Deutsche Bank, but declined to comment further. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on specific departures, saying the bank would be communicating directly with employees. “We understand these changes affect people’s lives profoundly and we will do whatever we can to be as responsible and sensitive as possible implementing these changes,” she said. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who now aims to focus on the bank’s more stable revenue streams, said on Sunday that it was the most fundamental transformation of the bank in decades. “This is a restart,” he said. “We are creating a bank that will be more profitable, leaner, more innovative and more resilient,” he wrote to staff.

-5.968169761273212," Deutsche Bank to cut 18,000 jobs in 7.4 billion euro overhaul FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is to ax vast swathes of its trading desks in one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis, in a restructuring that will see 18,000 jobs go and cost 7.4 billion euros. The plan represents a major retreat from investment banking by Deutsche Bank, which for years had tried to compete as a major force on Wall Street. As part of the overhaul, the bank will scrap its global equities business, scale back its investment bank and also cut some of its fixed income operations, an area traditionally regarded as one of its strengths. The bank will set up a new so-called “bad bank” to wind-down unwanted assets, with a value of 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets. The depth of the restructuring shows that Deutsche is coming to terms with its failure to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N. The cuts were foreshadowed on Friday, when the head of Deutsche’s investment bank Garth Ritchie agreed to step down. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who now aims to focus on the bank’s more stable revenue streams, said it was the most fundamental transformation of the bank in decades. “This is a restart,” he said. “We are creating a bank that will be more profitable, leaner, more innovative and more resilient,” he wrote to staff. Sewing will now represent the investment bank on the board in a shift that illustrates the divisions’s waning influence. The CEO had flagged an extensive restructuring in May when he promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank. This followed Deutsche's failure to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE. Some investors were cautious about the turnaround plan. Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon Asset Management, said a lot had to go right for the plan to be successful. “The margin for error is...low,” he said. Union Investment portfolio manager Alexandra Annecke said the steps were long overdue and noted that the bank’s aim to bring down its cost-to-income ratio to 70% was not ambitious compared with international competitors. Soon after becoming CEO last year, Sewing started to cut jobs and promised to bring staffing “well below” 90,000. There were media reports from Reuters and others that Deutsche Bank could cut as many as 20,000 jobs -- more than one in five of its 91,500 employees. In the event, the bank said it would reduce headcount to 74,000 by 2022. Deutsche bank gave no geographic breakdown for the job cuts. The equities business is focused largely in New York and London. A person with direct knowledge of the matter said job cuts would be distributed around the world, including in Germany. Stephan Szukalski, head of the DBV union, told Reuters that the measures were in the right direction, echoing the sentiment of the Verdi labor union. “This could be a real new beginning for Deutsche Bank,” said Szukalski, who also sits on the bank’s supervisory board. The board met on Sunday to agree the proposed changes, one of the biggest announcements of job cuts at a major investment bank since 2011 when HSBC said it would axe 30,000 jobs. Deutsche said it expects a 2.8 billion euro ($3.1 billion) net loss in the second quarter as a result of restructuring charges and loss for the full year. Deutsche will have been in the red for four out of the five last years. Its shares fell to a record low last month. Founded in 1870, Deutsche has long been a major source of finance and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets, a role which had the tacit backing of successive governments in Berlin. Big cuts to its investment bank could make it harder for the bank to fulfil this role and would mark a reversal of a decades-long expansion that began with its purchase of Morgan Grenfell in London in 1989 and continued a decade later by a takeover of Bankers Trust in the United States. The investment bank generates about half of Deutsche’s revenue but is also a volatile business. Revenue at the division was forecast to fall to 12.4 billion euros this year, according to a consensus of analysts ahead of Sunday’s announced changes. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down more than 30% from 2015. In the restructuring, Sewing let go two other members of the management board - head of regulation Sylvie Matherat and head of retail Frank Strauss - and brought in some newcomers. He also created a corporate bank to streamline services offered throughout the bank, something Sewing called a “core strength”."
-5.968169761273212," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank retreat depends on uber optimism LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Any cocksure child knows that owning up to mistakes is part of growing up. By that metric, Deutsche Bank is just beginning to mature. Boss Christian Sewing on Sunday effectively called time on the lender’s multi-decade attempt to create a global investment bank with a swingeing plan to shrink its trading unit and put 288 billion euros of assets into runoff. But the retreat depends on friendly markets and an absence of blunders. Germany’s biggest bank by assets is admitting what investors had long guessed: its target for a return on tangible equity of 4% in 2019 was a mirage and its profit-munching investment bank needs deeper restructuring. To effect the latter, Sewing plans to shut down equities trading entirely and downsize Deutsche’s rates and fixed income businesses. The slimmer bank would have total adjusted expenses of 17 billion euros by 2022 - down from 23.5 billion euros last year - and a 70% cost-to-income ratio. That implies revenue of more than 24 billion euros, or just 1 billion euros less than in 2018. Such relative self-assurance was breezily backed up with reference to the “high quality and low risk nature” of the assets Deutsche is shedding. That begs the question of why those assets are surplus to requirements. Regulators are easing the transition to what should be a less risky institution: Deutsche is lowering its minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 12.5%, 50 basis points lower than before. Even so, the plan depends on some rosy assumptions. Equities sales and trading brought in nearly 2 billion euros of revenue last year. Fixed income trading accounted for 5.3 billion euros. Deutsche believes resurgent corporate, advisory and asset management divisions will help partly make up for a projected 2.5 billion euros in lost income. But the fact that annual revenue in those businesses actually shrunk year-on-year in 2018 does not bode well. The bank is also projecting minimal charges on the assets it wants to exit. An economic downturn, or another round of regulatory fines, could similarly knock it off course. With a market capitalisation equivalent to just a quarter of the bank’s tangible book value, Sewing understandably wants beleaguered investors to look towards the long term. But until his bright assumptions are proven correct, Deutsche’s passage to maturity will remain a work in progress."

-10.46077210460771," Exit of Deutsche Bank's investment bank chief marks end of era FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The head of Deutsche Bank’s investment bank agreed to step down on Friday in a sign of the division’s waning influence as Germany’s largest lender prepares a multi-billion dollar restructuring aimed at reversing a decline in its fortunes. Chief Executive Christian Sewing will represent the investment bank on Deutsche Bank’s board following the departure of the division’s boss Garth Ritchie, who has been a deputy CEO with a board seat, the Frankfurt-based bank said in a statement. Ritchie, whose contract was extended last September for another four years, was Deutsche’s best paid board member in 2018, with earnings of 8.6 million euros. “As the bank enters a new phase, it is time for me to do the same,” Ritchie wrote in a short email to colleagues seen by Reuters. Ritchie, who joined the bank in 1996 and was based in London, is due to get a multi-million euro severance package, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The removal of a separate board-level representative for the investment bank signals Deutsche Bank’s determination to reduce its influence and the effects on the business of its fluctuating fortunes, which have long been a bone of contention in Germany. Deutsche Bank’s investment bank has been central to its strategy for years, leading it to maintain a large presence on Wall Street when other European rivals scaled back. A wider overhaul, one of several in recent years, signals that Deutsche Bank is coming to terms with its failure to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as JP Morgan JPM.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N. Ritchie’s departure and the change in board representation are just two elements of a sweeping, multi-billion dollar overhaul that Deutsche Bank is planning to unveil in the coming days, a month after its shares hit a record low. Sewing flagged an extensive revamp in May, promising shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank after Deutsche Bank failed to agree a merger with cross-town rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE. Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board is expected to meet on Sunday to discuss the restructuring, which could see as many as 20,000 job cuts - or more than one in five of its 91,500 employees - with New York and London bearing the brunt. The lender is still hammering out details on a variety of issues, with the exact makeup of a trimmer management board one unanswered question, people familiar with matter said. Among other measures the bank is examining is the creation of a separate “corporate bank” to streamline services now spread across the lender, two people familiar with the matter said. It is also planning to set up a “bad bank” to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets. Sewing wants to reduce the size of the bank’s nine-member management board and the bank is still haggling over this, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. The revamp is expected to cost the bank up to 5 billion euros. Founded in 1870, Deutsche has long been a default source of lending and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets, a role which had the tacit backing of successive governments in Berlin. Big cuts to its investment bank could make it harder for the lender to fulfil this role and would mark a reversal of a decades-long expansion that began with the purchase of Morgan Grenfell in London in 1989 and continued a decade later by taking over Bankers Trust in New York. The investment bank generates about half of Deutsche Bank’s revenue but is also considered its Achilles heel. Revenue at the division is forecast to fall to 12.4 billion euros this year, according to a consensus of analysts. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down more than 30% from 2015. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the plans for its corporate bank division, as well as on the other changes in the works but not yet announced. The bank has said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. “We will update all stakeholders if and when required,” the bank said. At present a single corporate customer may have accounts with Deutsche Bank’s private and commercial bank, the transaction bank and the investment bank. The changes would seek to reduce overlap and the new division would have a seat on the board, the people said, confirming news first reported by the Sueddeutsche newspaper. The new corporate bank would include the transaction bank, which has been a segment of the investment bank, they said. The transaction bank provides everyday banking services important for the finances of corporations, such as international payments. Sewing has talked up the unit over the past year as a source of stable revenue."

-8.450704225352105," German prosecutors intensify Deutsche Bank client investigation: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors are escalating a money laundering inquiry involving Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, including planned raids on wealthy former clients, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Frankfurt’s state prosecutors will in the coming months search the homes of people who it suspects of using a company formerly owned by Germany’s biggest bank for tax evasion and money laundering, the person said. The intensified scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, which has said it has no indication of any misconduct, comes at a delicate time as the Frankfurt-based bank seeks to revamp its struggling business and repair a reputation ravaged by a series of scandals. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the investigation but referred to earlier comments by a senior official in which he defended its record, saying that it has invested in fighting money laundering and that it is cooperating with investigators. Police searched the homes of eight people in Germany as part of the investigation in May, after a two-day search of Deutsche Bank’s headquarters by 170 police and investigators in November. That high-profile raid tainted it for months, hitting its share price as well shaking confidence in the bank among government officials and its customers. During the raid, police obtained the names of 900 clients suspected of using its Regula subsidiary to avoid taxes, the person said. Prosecutors said at the time that they suspected Deutsche Bank had helped clients shift criminal money, identifying more than 300 million euros ($339 million) that had flowed to a British Virgin Islands registered vehicle in 2016. The prosecutors also said they were investigating two members of Deutsche Bank staff. Deutsche Bank executive Karl von Rohr said in February that it had acted to ensure the “tax honesty” of clients, and had no indication of any misconduct by the bank or staff. Regula was highlighted in data leaks including the Panama Papers, which were uncovered by a consortium of journalists. The regional government in the German state of Hesse and German federal police bought this data, which includes almost 290,000 documents relating to 1,500 offshore firms, in 2017. It is now in the hands of Frankfurt public prosecutors. ‘FLAGRANT OFFENDER’ Although Deutsche Bank sold Regula in early 2018 to a Bermuda-based bank, the evolving investigation puts it under further pressure following years of scrutiny and billions of dollars in fines for schemes, including so-called mirror trades. Deutsche has agreed to pay more than $600 million in fines to the New York and British authorities for that scheme, one of its most recent scandals, that regulators said allowed Russian clients to covertly move money abroad. That prompted lawmakers in the United States to send the bank a questionnaire asking about its money laundering controls. “Deutsche Bank has been a flagrant offender of our money laundering laws,” U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen told Reuters. “They are in a league of their own. So we want to look at it for that reason.” Von Rohr said in a speech that Deutsche Bank had improved controls, tripling staff who fight money laundering and financial crime since 2015 and was maintaining close contact with regulators. U.S. lawmakers have also asked questions about the bank’s relationship with Donald Trump, but Deutsche’s response has been held up by a legal challenge by the U.S. president, in which he accused House leaders of harassment. In addition, the U.S. lawmakers are also seeking information about Deutsche Bank’s links to prominent Russians as well as its money laundering controls, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The German bank has also come under pressure in a separate money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank DANSKE.CO, prompting European lawmakers to call for it to reappear before the European Parliament over its money laundering controls. Ana Gomes, a Portuguese EU parliamentarian, and Sven Giegold, a German EU lawmaker, said they were disappointed by an earlier appearance in parliament by Deutsche Bank. “They did not answer in a way that would suggest they were reforming,” Gomes said.

The bulk of the job cuts will take place outside Germany, said a person with knowledge of the plans, as they are mostly targeting the investment bank, a unit that has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. The overhaul signals that Deutsche is coming to terms with its failure to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N. “Sewing really wants to move the needle,” said another person familiar with the plans. The price tag for restructuring raises the probability that the lender will report a loss for the full year, the person said, meaning Deutsche will have been in the red for four out of the five last years. But executives and investors hope the overhaul, however costly, will be radical enough to turn around the bank’s fortunes after its shares fell to a record low last month.

-5.270092226613959," Deutsche Bank held talks with Citi, BNP on shedding chunk of equities business: Wall Street Journal (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has held talks with Citigroup Inc C.N, BNP Paribas SA BNPP.PA and others over the possible sale of parts of its equities business, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Deutsche Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said in May that he planned to make cutbacks to the bank’s investment banking and trading operations to appease investors unhappy about its underperformance. Shares in the German lender hit a record low last month. Sources told Reuters last month that Deutsche plans to cut the size of its U.S. equities business, leaving only a skeleton operation to service corporate and high-net-worth clients. The business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals. Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and BNP Paribas declined to comment. Reuters reported in May that Deutsche’s prime brokerage services, which serves hedge funds, would be a key focus of the cutbacks. Deutsche is also planning to set up a separate unit, or “bad bank,” to house toxic assets worth up to 50 billion euros ($56 billion). Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board is expected to meet on July 7 to finalize its plans. The unit is expected to hold mainly long-dated derivatives, sources familiar with the matter say. Those assets have been a burden on the bank’s capital position since tougher rules were introduced after the 2007-09 financial crisis. Deutsche wants to wind down the assets or sell them. However, it may struggle to find other banks willing to take them on, analysts say, though they say private equity buyers could be interested in taking them at a deep discount. “I think it’s possible buyers could emerge but Deutsche would have to take a mighty big write-down,” said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors. The discussions could involve Deutsche employees moving to one or more other banks alongside client balances, systems and derivative positions, some held by Deutsche Bank to offset bets taken by its clients, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. No agreements have been reached in the talks involving multiple parties, the report said."

-5.104712041884813," Deutsche Bank board to meet July 7 to decide on job cuts: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE supervisory board will meet on July 7 to discuss a major restructuring that may result in as many as 20,000 job cuts, four people with knowledge of the matter said. CEO Christian Sewing flagged an extensive overhaul last month when he promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank to turn the lender around after it failed to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE. In addition to the job cuts, Germany’s flagship lender is considering trimming its management board, three of the people said. The investment bank would be represented on the board by Sewing rather than having a seat at the table, as is currently the case. Veteran Garth Ritchie has been heading the investment bank, but a plan under discussion is to promote bankers Stefan Hoops and Mark Fedorcik to lead the division as co-heads, two of the people said. They would report to Sewing. One of the people described the plans as fluid, with many aspects still not decided. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the changes. Ritchie, Hoops and Fedorcik declined through a spokesman to comment. The bank said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. “We will update all stakeholders if and when required,” the bank said. Ranked as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, Deutsche has been plagued by ratings downgrades, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals, with investment banking often the culprit even though it generates about half of Deutsche Bank’s revenue. After years of failing to keep pace with Wall Street’s big hitters such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank is being pushed to retreat from riskier investment banking and focus its effort on mainstream markets. Executives and investors hope the overhaul will be radical enough to turn around the bank’s fortunes after its shares fell to a record low this month. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Friday that Deutsche was considering cutting between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs. One of the people on Saturday said that the reduction was expected to be closer to 20,000. The bank, which had the equivalent of 91,463 employees at the end of the first quarter, has already announced plans to cut headcount to “well below” 90,000. Among other overhaul measures under discussion is the creation of a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets, as well as shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside Europe, sources have said. It also aims to dispose of up to a quarter of its riskiest assets in the next few years. Taken together, the measures are part of a significant restructuring of the investment bank, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis after decades of rapid expansion."
-1.8324607329842892," Deutsche Bank in wealth management hiring spree LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank plans to hire 300 more relationship and investment mangers for its wealth management business by 2021, as part of a plan to bulk up in areas the German lender hopes will bring steadier revenue streams. Deutsche Bank is in the middle of a major restructuring as it tries to shrink its investment bank that has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. The shake up is expected to lead to thousands of job cuts in areas like equities trading. Chief executive Christian Sewing wants instead to allocate more resources to businesses that have more stable revenue streams, with wealth management one of them. “This drive to grow our business is now materializing with a big investment push,” Fabrizio Campelli, global head of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management told Reuters in an interview. Under Campelli’s plan the number of relationship and investment managers will grow by 300 - around a third of the current numbers - globally. They will be spread across its America, Europe and Emerging Markets regions. “We need to increase significantly our client footprint, which means the net increase of client facing individuals needs to be material,” he said. Wealth management is attractive to banks as it requires less capital and its earnings tend to be less cyclical. But it is also highly competitive. Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse are already big players, with wealth management at the heart of their business models, while upstart fintech companies are also trying to make inroads. “The space is very crowded and the market is one that many banks have sought to make a mark on,” said Campelli, who has run the business at Deutsche since October 2015. “We looked at trends we believe Deutsche Bank wealth management can be particularly relevant in and within those areas we are making some very targeted investments”. Campelli said trends they are particularly focused on include the growth in entrepreneurial - as opposed to family - wealth, the increasing number of family offices, and the rise of millennial high net worth individuals, who tend to manage their wealth differently from previous generations. He declined to say how big the overall investment would be to fund this growth, beyond “several hundred million” euros. Deutsche’s wealth business had 213 billion euros ($242.35 billion) in assets under management (AUM) in the first quarter of the year, up by 14 billion euros from the end of 2018. It currently trails its major Swiss and U.S rivals in private banking league tables, tending to sit outside the top ten. Campelli, an Italian who has been at Deutsche since 2004, would not disclose the bank’s long term AUM target but said “if we can’t improve from just outside of the top 10 position, I will be very disappointed.” The business generated 427 million euros in revenue in the first quarter, around 17 percent of the 2.5 billion euro total brought in by the private and commercial banking division, where the wealth management business sits. The first wave of the hiring has started, with new recruits including Michael Rogers, who joined as the new head of the U.S. West Coast business from Merrill Lynch and Marco Pagliara moving from Goldman Sachs to be head of Northern and Eastern European wealth management. When asked if Deutsche’s wider problems at its investment bank were hindering its plans to attract talent, Campelli said: “We’re paying them market rate, there is no need to pay a premium.” He added that the negative news around Deutsche gives their plans to build-up a more stable business more credibility. “We need a business model which is stable and based on reliable macro trends and not so reliant on cyclical trends,” he added.

-0.9174311926605542," Deutsche lifted by Fed stress test pass in boost to Wall Street operation WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE shares rose by as much as 4.8% on Friday after Germany's biggest bank passed an annual health check by the U.S. Federal Reserve, in a boost to its beleaguered Wall Street operations. But the Federal Reserve placed conditions on the U.S. operations of Credit Suisse CSGN.SCS.N after identifying weaknesses in its capital planning, knocking shares in the Swiss bank as much as 1.1% The tests assess whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans, including using extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes beyond providing a cushion against losses. They are designed to avoid a repeat of the taxpayer bailouts of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Deutsche Bank, whose U.S. business has been plagued by litigation, underperformance and regulatory investigations, topped the German bluechip index .GDAX in Frankfurt after its U.S. shares were up as much as 6% in after-the-bell trading on Thursday following the Fed's news. The German bank maintained a large presence on Wall Street after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, while Credit Suisse made big cuts. But Deutsche’s efforts to compete with U.S. rivals have been hampered by litigation and regulatory investigations. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing, who is battling to turn the bank around, said the Fed’s decision was “excellent news” in a memo to staff on its website. “Achieving success here was one of the key goals we set a year ago. It is a huge step forward for our business in the U.S. and globally. A strong operating platform in the Americas is essential to our clients,” he said. The Fed approved the capital plans of the 16 others in this year's test, including the biggest U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Citigroup C.N. JPMorgan, following the test results, announced plans to increase its quarterly dividend to 90 cents per share from 80 cents, starting in the third quarter, and buy back up to $29.4 billion of shares over the next year. JPMorgan shares rose as much as 1.9% while Bank of America was up 1.8% and Citigroup advanced 1.5% after-the-bell. JPMorgan was asked to resubmit its proposal after the Fed assessed its initial plan would result in it falling below the minimum capital it is required to hold to cope with a downturn. Banks normally resubmit when they are pushing to return the maximum amount of capital possible to shareholders and overestimate what the Fed will allow them to do in their initial proposal, banking and regulatory sources say. The Fed’s stamp of approval gives Deutsche Bank a major boost as it works on a restructuring plan after it flunked the test in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Another failure would have further damaged confidence among clients and investors. The stress test outcome means that Deutsche is now free to make payments to its German parent without approval from the Fed, a restriction imposed after its failure last year. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, ordered Credit Suisse to address weaknesses in its capital adequacy process by October, and restricted its capital distributions to last year’s levels until the weaknesses are addressed. The Fed said it had identified “weaknesses in the assumptions used by the firm to project stressed trading losses that raise concerns about the firm’s capital adequacy and capital planning process.” It gave no further detail. Credit Suisse, in an emailed statement, acknowledged the concerns relayed by the Fed and said it expected to remediate the issues by the October deadline. In Zurich, a spokesman said the test would not affect Credit Suisse’s payout to shareholders. The Fed said in a statement that the nation’s largest banks all have strong capital levels and “virtually all” are meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning. Deutsche’s passing grade reflected the significant progress in addressing its weaknesses around capital planning, although some issues remain, a senior Fed official said. Deutsche’s Sewing told investors at the annual shareholders’ meeting last month that the bank planned to make “tough cutbacks” at its investment bank to appease investors unhappy with its underperformance. Those plans are likely to see the bank’s U.S. equities business shrunk to a skeleton operation, Reuters reported this month. All 18 banks cleared the first portion of the Fed’s annual stress test last week, showing they would easily have enough capital to keep lending during a severe economic downturn. The second test was more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans."

6.4606741573033695," Former Deutsche Bank executive denies helping Bittar rig Euribor LONDON (Reuters) - A former Deutsche Bank managing director, charged with manipulating global Euribor interest rates, on Tuesday denied helping convicted trader Christian Bittar and said any assistance his team gave his former colleague was inappropriate. Andreas Hauschild, who ran the bank’s Frankfurt team responsible for rate submissions, told Southwark Crown Court he was unaware of such conversations in 2005 and that it was inappropriate to request rates to suit trading positions. “This is not what you do ... it is not proper,” the 54-year-old German said on his first full day in the witness box. He said he first saw communications between Bittar, a former Deutsche Bank derivatives trader, and his team after prosecutors from the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) sent him documents about the case. “I was in Turkey with the family on holiday (when those conversations took place),” he said, as a court clerk showed the jury a photograph of the family holiday, which was developed in July 2005. Hauschild also denied trying to manipulate Euribor submissions by selling cash in the market, by asking colleagues to help set rates that would benefit his own trading positions or by helping Bittar, when his former London-based colleague begged him to help influence rates in 2006. He is charged with conspiracy to defraud over the alleged manipulation of Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate), a Brussels-based benchmark that helps determine rates on around $180 trillion of global financial contracts and loans. Prosecutors allege bankers rigged rates to benefit trading positions, deliberately ignoring rules that they should be set independently of commercial interests. Hauschild said he had little recollection of emails sent 14 years ago, but that he had tried to piece together what had been meant from trading records and other documents. Hauschild, who was in charge of money markets in continental Europe and worked at Deutsche Bank between 1988 and 2006, picked out examples where his trading book was at odds with rate requests in the team or with Deutsche Bank’s rate submissions. In the seventh rate-rigging trial brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office, Hauschild is accused of conspiring with others at Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Societe Generale and other banks between January 2005 and December 2009. Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average. The jury has heard that Bittar has already been convicted over the conspiracy alongside one-time Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef, ex-Barclays senior rate submitter Colin Bermingham and former Barclays derivatives trader Carlo Palombo."

Executives hope improvements the bank has made to its risk management and capital planning processes since failing last year’s test will enable it to achieve a conditional pass this year, the sources said. The sources said their optimism is based on conversations with Fed officials over several months. However, the Fed has yet to give a final decision and the bank’s fourth failure in five years is still possible, they said. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: “We cannot confirm any of the information as the results are not known to us. We respect the process, and we will respect the Federal Reserve’s decision, when made.” The Federal Reserve implemented annual tests of lenders after the 2008 financial crisis to check whether they have sufficient capital to weather a major economic downturn. Even if the bank passes the stress tests, executives expect the Fed to continue to bar it from making payments to its German parent without the Fed’s approval, the sources said. They also anticipate Deutsche will be told to continue improving the systems it uses to monitor its business and risks, the sources said. The tests this week and next come amid uncertainty over the bank’s U.S. operations. Deutsche plans cutbacks to appease investors unhappy about its stock market underperformance. It also faces investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice into possible money-laundering lapses. The bank has said it is cooperating with investigators. Failing the tests would further damage confidence among clients and investors at a time when Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is battling to turn around Germany’s biggest lender, whose shares hit a record low this month. Deutsche flunked the second part of the tests last year. The Fed cited “material weaknesses” in its data capabilities and capital planning process. The bank said in April it had “invested heavily to ensure that the bank meets regulators’ demands and has made significant progress.” Fed officials recognize the bank has made improvements to its processes but believe more work needs to be done to bring them up to the required standard, the sources said. This year’s tests are likely to be the last for Deutsche’s U.S. business under current Americas head, Tom Patrick, the sources said. Patrick is expected to leave in the coming months as the bank’s U.S. restructuring progresses, they said. Patrick declined to comment, bank officials said. Deutsche plans to dramatically reduce the size of its loss-making U.S. equities business as part of an overhaul of its investment bank. However, it plans to retain a substantial U.S. operation to service German corporate clients. A key task for Patrick’s successor, who will need to be approved by the Fed, will be to rebuild confidence among regulators and ensure it can pass future stress tests unconditionally, the sources said. The Fed is scheduled to announce on Friday the results of the first part of the tests, which measures banks’ capital levels against a severe recession. Deutsche is expected to pass that section comfortably, as it did last year, the sources said. The second part of the tests, which focuses on banks’ capital planning and risk management processes, is due to be announced June 27. It is this part that bank officials hope they will conditionally pass this year, the sources said. (The story refiles to fix typographical error in quote in paragraph 4)"
11.436541143654118," Deutsche Bank faces FBI investigation for possible money-laundering lapses: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining whether Deutsche Bank complied with laws meant to stop money laundering, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The inquiry, first reported in the New York Times, follows a report by that newspaper last month about bank employees in its U.S. compliance division who had flagged suspicious financial transactions to their superiors who then opted not to escalate them to government authorities. The transactions were notable because they were linked to companies controlled by U.S. President Donald Trump and his son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, according to the report. Trump rejected the report last month, saying he had little need for banks because he had so much cash on hand and denying that the money came from Russia. The resulting FBI investigation is viewed as routine following the report about the bank whistleblower, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to talk about an ongoing investigation. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment on the Times report, but said: “We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.” Kushner Companies said allegations about its relationship with Deutsche involving money laundering are “completely made up and totally false”. The FBI, the White House, and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours. The NYT reported a Trump Organization spokeswoman as saying she was unaware of Deutsche flagging any transactions. Deutsche Bank has struggled to bounce back after the 2008 financial crisis and has been plagued by failed regulatory stress tests, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals and most recently a failed merger. The lender, Germany’s largest, has been making progress working its way through a raft of litigation over past years, but it has recently made headlines about lapses in safeguards meant to identify money laundering. In 2017, regulators fined Deutsche Bank nearly $700 million for weak controls that allowed money laundering from Russia. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation is still ongoing. Shares in Deutsche, which hit a record low earlier this month, were 0.9% lower on Thursday, making the bank the biggest loser on the DAX index of blue-chip companies. The New York Times report, published on Wednesday, cited seven people it said were familiar with the inquiry. Earlier this month, a group of U.S. Senate Democrats urged the Federal Reserve to investigate Deutsche Bank’s relationship with Trump and Kushner. Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump’s real estate business. A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank."

The investigation includes a review of the German bank's handling of so-called suspicious activity reports that its employees prepared about possibly problematic transactions, including some linked to President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, the Times reported here. The investigation into Deutsche Bank is one element of several separate but overlapping government examinations into how illicit funds flow through the U.S. financial system, the Times reported, adding that several other banks are also being investigated. Earlier this month, a group of U.S. Senate Democrats urged the Federal Reserve to investigate Deutsche Bank’s relationship with Trump and Kushner. Reuters could not independently confirm the report. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined comment on the Times report, but said: “We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.” (Reporting by Ishita Chigilli Palli and Maria Ponnezhath in Bengaluru Editing by Bill Rigby)"
12.55230125523013," Deutsche Bank seeks to shed risky assets as part of overhaul: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is aiming to cut up to a quarter of its riskiest assets in the next few years, people familiar with the matter said, shedding more light on how the German lender is trying to overhaul its business and revive profitability. The plan provides more detail on a restructuring expected since Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing promised shareholders “tough cutbacks” to turn the bank around after it botched an attempted merger with rival Commerzbank. The bank’s shares, which have hit record lows in June, have perked up on expectations that a major overhaul is underway. Deutsche is expected to talk to top investors within days to elaborate on its plans, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The group will unveil the strategy in July, other people say. The bank has struggled to bounce back after the 2008 financial crisis and has been plagued by failed regulatory stress tests, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals and most recently a failed merger. Deutsche’s biggest business by revenues is its investment bank, which holds swathes of high-risk assets such as complex derivatives. Cutting back on risky assets would in theory allow Deutsche to hold less capital and use this money for other purposes to try to boost profit. Under the plan, Deutsche will reduce its so-called risk-weighted assets by between 20% and 25% over the next three-to-five years, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Risk weighting is where a bank assigns a risk of losses to an asset, such as a derivative or loan. That, in turn, determines how much capital it needs to cover such a loss. The bank held 347 billion euros ($388.61 billion) in such assets at the end of the first quarter, according to Deutsche’s quarterly results. A 25% reduction would bring assets to about 260 billion euros. Deutsche Bank declined to comment but said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. “We will update all stakeholders if and when required,” the bank said. Other changes include shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside of Europe. Deutsche is also planning to create a “bad bank” for non-core assets, which can be a way to reduce risky assets over time. In an internal bad bank, risk weighted assets remain on the bank’s balance sheet until they are wound down. One of the big open questions is how many jobs Deutsche will cut. The bank has already pledged to reduce headcount to under 90,000, from the current 91,463. Analysts and some investors would like to see a staff reduction of more than 10% for the overhaul to be credible. Deutsche management is also in flux. Pressure to step down has been building on Garth Ritchie, head of the investment bank, and Sylvie Matherat, chief regulatory officer, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The bank has declined to comment on the possible shake-up. The revamp will delay further some of the bank’s goals. Deutsche is widely expected to miss its key profitability target - a return on tangible equity of 4% - in 2019. Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse have already restructured by paring down their investment banks and are today on stronger footing, providing hope for Deutsche Bank, analysts say. But competition is heating up on Deutsche’s home turf. Standard Chartered earlier this year opened its new European Union headquarters in Frankfurt next door to Deutsche’s head office. The bank aims to take on Deutsche’s core clientele - big German corporations - by offering them services in far flung countries, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told reporters on Tuesday."
13.841807909604526," Deutsche Bank considers replacing CFO: report BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing is planning a major overhaul of top management, including replacing the finance chief, Bloomberg news agency reported on Tuesday.

20.08797653958943," Deutsche Bank plans to pare U.S. equities business to skeleton operation: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank plans to dramatically reduce the size of its U.S. equities business, leaving only a skeleton operation in place to service corporate and high-net-worth clients, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is battling to convince investors he can turn around Germany’s biggest lender, whose shares hit a record low this month. He told investors at the annual meeting last month that Deutsche was prepared to make “tough cutbacks” at its investment bank. Members of Deutsche’s supervisory board discussed those plans on a call last week and agreed that large-scale cuts were necessary in the bank’s U.S. equities and rates trading businesses, the sources said. A complete retreat from U.S. equities was discussed, but the preferred option among board members was to keep a presence in the market and continue developing the bank’s electronic trading capabilities, the sources said. It is not yet clear how many of the bank’s 9,275 U.S. staff will be affected and the sources said no final decisions have been made. The plans are expected to be unveiled when the bank reports first-half results next month. In an emailed statement, a Deutsche spokesperson said the bank “is working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability.” In March, Deutsche announced plans for a new platform enabling it to trade U.S. stocks directly with clients, instead of matching buyers and sellers for a fee. That platform is scheduled to go live in the third quarter. Automating more of the business will enable the bank to cut costs and improve profit margins, the sources said. Although some investors believe a complete retreat from the United States is necessary, both Sewing and Chairman Paul Achleitner believe the bank must retain a large U.S. footprint to service corporate and institutional clients, the sources said. The bank is keen to maintain substantial debt capital markets and credit trading business in the United States, having identified them as businesses with growth potential, the sources said. It will also retain a sizeable M&A advisory business. Sewing is looking to shift the German lender away from investment banking to focus on more stable forms of revenue, such as transaction banking. The U.S. equities business has been a drain on profitability for several years, prompting some shareholders to call for its closure. JP Morgan’s banking analysts estimate it loses between 200 million and 300 million euros ($337 million) each year. The bank had previously denied reports it planned a further U.S. restructuring, saying in a memo to staff in April that it was “firmly committed” to its U.S. franchise. However, the collapse of merger talks with German rival Commerzbank AG in May led senior management to develop a “Plan B” for turning around the business and U.S. cuts were high on the agenda, the sources said. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like Credit Suisse made big cuts. Encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations, the business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals."
20.08797653958943," Deutsche Bank to set up 50 billion euro bad bank in revamp FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is planning to overhaul its trading operations by creating a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets, a source close to the matter said on Monday. The overhaul, first reported by the Financial Times, will also include shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside of Europe. The bad bank would house or sell assets valued at up to 50 billion euros ($56 billion)- after adjusting for risk - and comprising mainly long-dated derivatives. The measures are part of a significant restructuring of the investment bank, a major source of revenue for Germany’s largest lender, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. It is trying to turn itself around, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests. Its attempt to create a German champion through a merger with Commerzbank failed in April. In May, Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing promised shareholders “tough cutbacks” at its underperforming investment bank. Shares in Deutsche, which have recently traded at record lows, were up 1.4% in late trading in Frankfurt, shedding some of their gains but still topping the list of German blue-chip companies. Deutsche said in an emailed statement in response to the FT report that it was “working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. We will update all stakeholders if and when required”. The restructuring costs will force the bank to officially walk away from a key profitability target, Germany’s Handelsblatt reported separately later on Monday. The bank had aimed for a 4% return on tangible equity, but most analysts have long believed the bank would miss the target. The bank declined to comment on the Handelsblatt report. The effort by Sewing to overhaul the bank marks a further shift by the German lender away from investment banking to focus on more stable forms of revenue, such as transaction banking. The bank is planning cuts at its U.S. equities business, including prime brokerage and equity derivatives, to win over shareholders unhappy about its performance, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in May. Deutsche created a similar division for non-core investments in 2012 with 128 billion euros in risk-weighted assets. Deutsche wound up the unit nearly four years later, in 2016. Sewing is expected to announce changes in July. The bank reports second-quarter earnings on July 24."
20.08797653958943," Breakingviews - Now is the time to buy Deutsche Bank LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Christian Sewing can’t catch a break. The Deutsche Bank boss has seen the German lender’s market value shrivel to just 13 billion euros. Now he is preparing to take the axe to its underperforming investment bank. Rock-bottom expectations give him scope to spring a positive surprise. At Deutsche’s annual general meeting last month, Sewing pledged “tough cutbacks” to reinvigorate profitability. The bank’s equities and fixed income trading businesses, particularly in the United States, are prime targets. Deutsche may earmark risk-weighted assets worth 50 billion euros – about a fifth of the investment bank’s total – to be wound down or sold, the Financial Times reported. The question is how much this would cost. A big restructuring charge would push the bank into the red again, dragging its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio below the bank’s 13% target and forcing Sewing to raise more capital. It may not come to that, though. When rival Credit Suisse restructured its investment bank between 2015 and 2018, estimated losses were about 4% of the assets it offloaded. A similar ratio at Deutsche Bank would mean 2 billion euros of charges. Even if it recognised those losses up front, it has enough capital. Moreover, offloading 50 billion euros of risk-weighted assets would eventually release almost 7 billion euros of capital, assuming equity is equally distributed across the business. It’s hard for outsiders to know what other horrors lurk in Deutsche’s 1.4 trillion euro balance sheet. Cuts will further dent morale at the investment bank, making it harder to retain staff. Wholesale lenders would take a dim view of Deutsche once again failing to meet its lowball target of a 4% return on tangible equity, pushing up its borrowing costs. An economic downturn would push up bad-debt charges. Ongoing investigations in the United States and Germany may lead to new fines. But shares valued at just 0.2 times Deutsche’s tangible equity attach no worth to the investment bank. The lender could make a 2.6 percent return on tangible equity by 2020 based on the expected results of its retail banking and asset management divisions, according to a Breakingviews calculation using a 30 percent tax rate. Assuming a 10 percent cost of equity, those two businesses alone support the bank’s current valuation. If Sewing can safely and successfully shrink the investment bank, then it’s time to buy Deutsche Bank shares."

16.124260355029584," Former Deutsche Bank co-CEO included in cum-ex probe: paper FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors are probing former Deutsche Bank co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain and 78 other current and former bank officials as part of an investigation into a dividend tax-stripping scheme, German daily Handelsblatt reported on Friday. Investigators suspect managers at Deutsche and other banks of helping to exploit a loophole which allowed two parties to claim ownership of the same shares, making it possible to claim dividend tax rebates running to billions of euros. The scheme, called “cum-ex”, involved several other global banks. The Cologne prosecutor’s office is also probing Garth Ritchie, the head of Deutsche Bank’s investment banking arm, as part of the investigation, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources. Ritchie, through a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to comment. Jain, through a personal spokesman also declined to comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on whether Jain, who was co-CEO from June 2012 to June 2015, was included as part of the probe. The scam, which for years operated in a legal gray area until prosecutors declared it to be fraudulent, is being investigated by several prosecutors’ offices including by officials in Cologne. The Cologne prosecutor could not be reached for comment. In a statement, Deutsche Bank confirmed that current and former managers were under investigation, but did not say who they were. Deutsche Bank said that the Cologne prosecutor had been investigating two former employees since 2017 in connection with cum-ex transactions on behalf of former clients. Deutsche Bank said the lender was not directly involved in the tax scheme. “Recently, the prosecutor has initiated investigations against further former and current employees and management board members,” it said in a statement. It said the change in approach by the Cologne prosecutor was linked to procedural issues related to the statute of limitations, and did not imply that the prosecutor had changed its view on the facts of the case. “This has also not changed the Bank’s assessment of the facts of the case. Deutsche Bank did not participate in an organized cum-ex market, neither as short seller nor as cum-ex purchaser,” Deutsche said. Deutsche Bank acted as a leverage provider to clients who were involved in the scam, Handelsblatt reported. Sueddeutsche Zeitung said that fraudulent tax claims related to the 2009 business year, running to more than a billion euros, would expire soon unless prosecutors press criminal charges. Reuters reported in January that investigators had found indications that senior managers had discussed the reputational risks related to the cum-ex scheme, which sparked Germany’s biggest post-war fraud probe."

Clifford-Toomey joins the risk management team, led by Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton, at a time when the bank is working to overhaul its risk management procedures to satisfy regulator demands. Regulators have held the San Francisco-based bank under a microscope since 2016 when whistleblowers revealed Wells Fargo had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The scandal led the bank to uncover issues in each of its primary business segments, and has resulted in billions of dollars in fines and penalties. The appointment is effective Sept. 3. Prior to Wells Fargo, Clifford-Toomey was chief operating officer of the Americas and head of Americas regulatory transformation at Deutsche Bank. She has also worked at Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Deutsche Bank has also had to overhaul its risk management processes in recent years to satisfy U.S. regulators after failing to prove that its business could withstand an economic downturn during the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests.

16.29629629629629," EU reviews Deutsche Bank, SocGen in screening of past money-laundering cases BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is reviewing past money-laundering cases at EU banks to assess what went wrong and decide possible tweaks to rules, an EU official said, citing Deutsche Bank and Societe General as among the screened lenders. The review is part of a broader plan to improve the European Union’s approach to combating money laundering after a string of the bloc’s banks across Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Cyprus were embroiled in scandals. Under the plan, the European Commission is assessing cases between 2012 and 2018 with the aim of producing a report this summer that identifies the factors that contributed to the banks’ failure in preventing financial crime. While it is normal for the EU to examine industrial practices before deciding possible rule changes, the assessment of money-laundering cases shows the scale of the problem and the questions facing regulators, given many of the cases erupted after a series of legislative reforms. Missions to EU states are under way, the official said, without clarifying whether reviews are conducted at the banks themselves or only with their national supervisors. The Commission declined to comment on this point. The review is meant “to better inform possible additional actions” by the EU in strengthening its anti-money laundering tools, according to the plan published last year. “We cannot at this stage disclose more on the scope or contents of the report,” a spokesman for the European Commission said, declining to comment on the criteria used to select the cases under scrutiny. The EU has no power to impose penalties on banks over failures to prevent money-laundering. An EU official told Reuters that the review includes cases of lenders that have collapsed after money-laundering allegations, like Latvia’s ABLV and Malta’s Pilatus. The official said it also includes banks that have been at the center of large scandals such as Danske Bank, Denmark’s biggest bank, which has admitted to having handled through its Estonian branch 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015. The official added major lenders Deutsche Bank and France’s Societe Generale were being reviewed, without elaborating on the specific cases involved. Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank had to pay a fine of $425 million in 2017 in the United States over a “mirror trading” scheme that moved $10 billion out of Russia between 2011 and 2015. Societe Generale agreed in November to pay $95 million to close a dispute in the U.S. over violations of anti-money laundering regulations. The settlement was part of a wider case in which the French bank agreed to pay $1.34 billion to end U.S. investigations over possible sanctions breaches. The plan to enhance the bloc’s defenses against money laundering was adopted in December by EU finance ministers. It lists non-legislative measures that need to be carried out by 2020, although the official said there “could be delays”. Under the plan, EU supervisors have to clarify existing rules for assessing whether bank managers are fit for their job and on revoking banking licenses for serious breaches of anti- money-laundering rules. National authorities are also requested to cooperate more closely. The EU has largely left supervision of anti-money laundering activities in the hands of national authorities, who have been heavily criticized by lawmakers for failing to cooperate against a crime that is mostly carried out across borders. France and Italy are among EU states pushing for the creation of an EU agency that would take over supervision powers currently held by national authorities, officials said. The idea is backed by the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the EU Parliament’s resolutions, but many states oppose it. National resistance to cede power on the matter is so strong that when the European Banking Authority in April recommended action against the Danish and Estonian supervisors for oversight failures in the Danske case, fellow regulators from other EU countries blocked the move.. In a meeting this week, EU governments’ representatives discussed that case and told the EBA to “improve its communication to avoid reputational risk for itself and for the EU banking system,” the EU official said."

-1.9276769382299206," Deutsche Bank plans cuts in U.S. equities, prime unit: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is planning cuts at its U.S. equities business, including prime brokerage and equity derivatives, to win over shareholders unhappy about its performance, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing told shareholders at the bank’s annual meeting on Thursday it was prepared to make “tough cutbacks” at its investment bank. Sewing is battling to convince them he can turn around Germany’s biggest lender, whose shares have reached a record low. The bulk of the anticipated U.S. cuts will come from its money-losing equities business, which includes cash equities trading. Other areas of the business, including U.S. rates trading, have been earmarked for further reductions, they said. It is unclear how many of the bank’s 9,275 U.S. employees will be affected and no final decisions have been made, the sources said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Sewing did not name which parts of the business will be cut or when the changes will happen when addressing shareholders on Thursday. However, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that job cut announcements are not imminent. The future of the bank’s U.S. trading and investment banking operations has been in question for months, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of those announced last year. The bank had previously denied reports it planned a further U.S. restructuring, saying in a memo to staff last month that it was “firmly committed” to its U.S. franchise. However, the collapse of merger talks with German rival Commerzbank AG last month led senior management to intensify discussions over a “Plan B” for turning around the business, the sources said. U.S. cuts were high on the agenda, the sources said. Last year, Deutsche Bank said it would reduce its global headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000. That incorporated a 25% cut in equities sales and trading jobs, including a significant number in New York. However, it has continued to lag competitors in performance. Shares in Deutsche Bank have fallen by 40% during Sewing’s 13-month tenure as CEO, in part reflecting concerns over the poor performance of its investment bank. The business last year eked out a slender 1% return on equity, an important profitability yardstick, trailing the 16% at JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank. Adding to scrutiny on the U.S. business is the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test, which regulatory sources anticipate will be announced by the end of June. Deutsche Bank flunked the test in 2015, 2016 and 2018. A repeat would cause a bigger dent in confidence among customers and business partners. European regulators have said they fear the bank could fail the U.S. test. Even if it passes, conditions could be placed restricting how the business can operate. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like Credit Suisse made big cuts. The business has brought in around half of Deutsche Bank’s overall investment banking revenue, which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading. However, encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations, the business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals."
-1.9276769382299206," Deutsche Bank CEO pledges tough investment bank cuts as shares hit low FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank’s chief executive promised shareholders “tough cutbacks” at its underperforming investment bank on Thursday as he battled to convince them he can turn around Germany’s biggest lender, whose shares hit a record low. Ranked as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, the bank has been plagued by failed regulatory tests, ratings downgrades, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals, with investment banking often the culprit. Although Deutsche Bank posted its first profit in four years in 2018, it faces tough questions over its scrapped merger talks with Commerzbank, and some top shareholders had called for chairman Paul Achleitner to quit. The majority of shareholders at Thursday’s AGM backed the executives, though by a lower margin than last year. One small but vocal investor added a vote to the agenda to oust Achleitner as chairman because the bank “remains trapped in an unbroken downward spiral”. Achleitner, who survived that vote by a wide margin, indicated that he would stay, telling shareholders: “Of course, I’ve made mistakes over the past seven years.” After years of failing to keep pace with Wall Street’s big hitters such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank is being pushed to retreat from riskier investment banking and focus its effort on mainstream markets. The investment bank generates about half of Deutsche Bank’s revenue but is also considered its Achilles heel, with European regulators fearful that it will fail the next round of stress tests in the United States. “We will accelerate transformation by rigorously focusing our bank on profitable and growing businesses which are particularly relevant to our clients,” Chief Executive Christian Sewing told investors. “We’re prepared to make tough cutbacks,” he said, without elaborating on where in investment banking the cuts would occur. Shares in Deutsche Bank, which have lost 38% since last year’s shareholder meeting, closed down 2.4% at 6.45 euros, slightly off their earlier life-time low. The German institution has long been a default source of lending and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets, a role which had the tacit backing of successive governments in Berlin. Big cuts to its investment bank would make it harder for Deutsche Bank to fulfill this role and would mark a reversal of a decades-long expansion that began with the purchase of Morgan Grenfell in London in 1989 and continued a decade later by taking over Bankers Trust in New York. Cuts to the investment bank are overdue, Klaus Nieding, vice president of shareholder lobby group DSW, said. Revenue at the division is forecast to fall to 12.5 billion euros this year, according to a consensus of analysts. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down 34% from 2015, based on Reuters calculations. “Without cuts in investment banking, it will be very difficult or even impossible to achieve (Deutsche Bank’s targets)”, Nieding told its management at the meeting. The forecast fall at Deutsche Bank contrasts with a projected 6% rise in JP Morgan’s investment banking revenue to $36 billion for the same period. It is also far worse than a 5% drop in investment banking revenue across the industry from 2015 to 2018, according to Coalition, which tracks banking industry performance. Sewing told some 4,000 shareholders that he would focus on investment bank divisions that benefit other segments, and those that are profitable on a stand-alone basis. Among the departments that Sewing cited as successful were origination and advisory; corporate finance; foreign exchange; global credit trading and U.S. commercial real estate. Announcements on job cuts are not imminent, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

-1.9276769382299206," Deutsche Bank investors meet amid questions on strategy, leadership FRANKFURT, May 23 (Reuters) - Investors in Deutsche Bank are gathering on Thursday for an annual meeting that is expected to be dominated by questions over the bank’s strategy and leadership just days after shares hit a record low. Major investors over the past week have called for Deutsche to scale back its sprawling global investment banking unit. Top shareholders have also said that the bank’s chairman, Paul Achleitner, should step down before his term ends in 2022. Deutsche Bank shares hit record lows on Monday and Tuesday. They are down 36% since last year’s shareholder meeting. In recent years, Deutsche Bank has been plagued by failed regulatory tests, ratings downgrades, big fines and management reshuffles. It posted its first profit in four years in 2018. The bank was already facing a potential rocky ride at this year’s gathering after two advisory groups to shareholders - Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis - urged them to issue a vote of no confidence in management. One small but vocal investor last month added to the meeting’s agenda a vote to oust Achleitner because the bank “remains trapped in an unbroken downward spiral”. The supervisory board issued a statement backing its chairman. In an interview published in a German newspaper ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the bank sought to fend off some of the expected criticism. The bank will remain present in the U.S., which is primarily part of the investment bank division, finance chief James von Moltke said in an interview with Boersen-Zeitung published Thursday. But Deutsche was regularly looking for alternatives to lift growth and cut costs at the investment division, he said. (Reporting by Tom Sims; editing by Gopakumar Warrier)"

Earlier this year, Zielke embarked on talks to tie up with Deutsche Bank.

Zielke, in response to questions from shareholders at the meeting, said that the bank was open to growing “inorganically”, which means through mergers and acquisitions. He said that he meets regularly with CEOs of competing banks. For example, he has met twice with ING CEO Ralph Hamers over the past year, but there were no concrete offers for merger talks, Zielke said.

-5.168595626716536," Some major Deutsche Bank investors want chairman to go early: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - At least three major investors in Deutsche Bank want Chairman Paul Achleitner to step down early amid discontent with the bank’s turnaround, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. Achleitner, whose term expires in 2022, is due to face investors at the bank’s annual general meeting on Thursday. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, both on behalf of the bank and Achleitner. The sources did not want to identify the three investors, and while they do not have the power to push through management change on their own, their calls are a sign of the pressures facing Germany’s biggest bank after years of failed turnarounds. In recent years, Deutsche Bank has been plagued by failed regulatory tests, ratings downgrades, big fines and management reshuffles. It posted its first profit in four years in 2018. Achleitner’s record of installing executives and overseeing the lender has been chequered, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Deutsche Bank shares hit record lows on Monday and Tuesday, but were trading 0.4% higher by mid-afternoon in Frankfurt. They are down 36% since investors last year’s shareholder meeting. The bank was already facing a potential rocky ride at this year’s gathering after two advisory groups to shareholders - Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis - urged them to issue a vote of no confidence in management. One small but vocal investor last month added to the meeting’s agenda a vote to oust Achleitner because the bank “remains trapped in an unbroken downward spiral”. In response, the supervisory board last month said it had full confidence in Achleitner. Last year, a similar effort to force out the chairman garnered just 9.05% of the vote. Achleitner, an Austrian financier who previously sat on the board of German insurer Allianz and headed Goldman Sachs in Germany, became Deutsche’s chairman in 2012. Achleitner’s supporters argue he took decisive action last year when he ousted John Cryan as chief executive officer and installed Christian Sewing in his place. Union Investment, a fund manager that holds shares in Deutsche Bank, will vote in favor of management on Thursday, a portfolio manager told Germany’s Handelsblatt. ISS said in its report earlier this month that Achleitner had failed to turn around the bank and its finances and reputation had arguably further deteriorated from a year ago. But the advisory firm recommended investors should vote to keep Achleitner without a clear alternative to succeed him."

-4.567571293980214," Deutsche Bank staff flagged Trump, Kushner transactions for watchdog: NYTimes WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank AG recommended in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving entities controlled by U.S. President Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial-crimes watchdog, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The newspaper, citing five current and former Deutsche Bank employees, said executives at the German bank, which has lent billions of dollars to the Trump and Kushner companies, rejected their employees’ advice and the reports were never filed with the government. Deutsche Bank denied the report but shares in Germany’s largest bank hit a new low on Monday, below a previous minimum set in December. Shares fell 2.8 percent at 6.65 euros. Trump rejected the report in a blast of early-morning tweets on Monday, saying he had little need for banks because he had so much cash on hand and denying that the money came from Russia. The compliance allegations are the latest in a wave of problems to beset the bank which faces investors at its annual meeting on Thursday. The Times reported that the transactions, some of which involved Trump’s now-defunct foundation, set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect illicit activity, according to the former bank employees. Compliance staff members who then reviewed the transactions prepared so-called suspicious activity reports that they believed should be sent to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, according to the newspaper. Deutsche Bank responded with a denial of the report. “At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious,” the bank said in a statement. “Furthermore, the suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false.” Deutsche is facing a series of headaches. Investors are calling on the bank to scale back its investment bank after talks to merge with a rival failed and amid a grim profit outlook. European regulators also fear Deutsche could fail U.S. stress tests. The Times reported the bank employees viewed the decision not to report the transactions as a result of a lax approach to money laundering laws. They said there was a pattern of bank executives rejecting reports to protect relationships with lucrative clients, according to the newspaper. One employee who reviewed some of the transactions said she was terminated last year after raising concerns about the bank’s practices, the Times reported. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization told Reuters “the story is absolute nonsense.” “We have no knowledge of any ‘flagged’ transactions with Deutsche Bank. In fact, we have no operating accounts with Deutsche Bank,” she said. The newspaper said a Kushner Cos spokeswoman called any allegations of relationships involving money laundering “made up and totally false.” Officials at Kushner Cos were not available to Reuters for independent comment. The Times said the nature of the transactions was not clear. At least some of them involved money flowing back and forth with overseas entities or individuals, which bank employees considered suspicious. The report surfaces at a time when congressional and New York state authorities are investigating the relationship between Trump, his family and Deutsche Bank, and demanding documents related to any suspicious activity. The president has sued in court in an attempt to block U.S. House of Representatives subpoenas for his financial records that were sent to Deutsche Bank, Capital One Financial Corp and the accounting firm Mazars LLP. Trump, a real estate developer and former reality television star, still owns the Trump Organization but has maintained that his sons are running the day-to-day operations while he is president."

-7.831457468865881," Investors renew calls for Deutsche Bank to trim investment bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank investors are renewing calls for it to scale back its investment bank division ahead of what promises to be a challenging annual shareholder meeting next week. The future of Deutsche Bank’s investment banking operations has returned to the fore after the collapse of merger talks with smaller rival Commerzbank. One major investor is trying to extract a pledge from the bank for cuts to the unit before committing to back management in a symbolic vote of confidence at the meeting, a person with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity. Another prominent investor, Union Investment, said changes in strategy were long overdue. “Without cuts in investment banking, we believe it will not be possible to achieve targets on returns,” said portfolio manager Alexandra Annecke, who is due to address the meeting. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The division generates about half of Deutsche Bank’s revenue but is also considered its Achilles heel, with European regulators fearful that it will fail the next round of stress tests in the United States. Last week, the risk of a rebuke from shareholders at the annual meeting grew after two influential investor advisory groups - Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis - urged them to issue a vote of no confidence in Deutsche Bank’s management. Deutsche Bank’s shares have dropped 34% since shareholders convened a year ago. On Thursday, the price was just cents above the record low of 6.68 euros set in December. The bank’s chairman, Paul Achleitner, and top executives are speaking to investors to quell concerns of large shareholders, a common practice in the run-up to the annual meeting on May 23, said another person familiar with the matter. But the bank is unlikely to announce any changes to its investment banking operations in the coming days, executives said. Revenue at the division is forecast to fall to 12.5 billion euros ($14.0 billion) this year, according to a consensus of analysts. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down 34% from 2015, based on Reuters calculations. That contrasts with a projected 6% rise in JP Morgan’s investment banking revenue to $36 billion for the same period. It far outpaces a 5% drop in investment banking revenue across the industry from 2015 to 2018, according to Coalition, which tracks banking industry performance. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank attributed the collapse of merger talks to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands, but concerns about the investment bank loomed large, people with knowledge of the matter said. The ratings agencies Moody’s and Fitch, which have both tagged Deutsche for a possible credit-rating downgrade, have cited troubles at the investment bank as key concerns. Citigroup analysts said in a report this week that Deutsche had only one option: a restructuring of its investment bank. This could mean exiting the United States, where it employs 9,000 people, and dropping out of the equities business, they said, adding that an exit would be costly and weigh on earnings. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing told analysts last month that it was “non-negotiable” that the bank remain “globally relevant”, including in the U.S. and Asia. Sewing announced plans to cut more 7,000 jobs soon after assuming office in a management reshuffle last year, including a 25% cut in equities sales and trading jobs.

-3.994993358876965," Deutsche Bank talks with UBS on asset management deal stall: sources FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Talks have stalled between Deutsche Bank and UBS on a tie up of their asset management businesses due to differences over who would control the combined entity, people familiar with the matter said. Such a tie-up still made strategic and financial sense and they did not rule out that talks may eventually be revived, three sources said, but both banks had wanted to drive the venture. Deutsche Bank, its asset management arm DWS, and UBS declined to comment. DWS shares were down 3% at 1447 GMT, rebounding slightly from sharper losses after the news of the stalled talks emerged. The idea of merging the businesses mushroomed in recent months as Deutsche Bank discussed a possible merger with smaller rival Commerzbank. A deal for Deutsche’s DWS unit could have been a way to finance that merger, but with the Commerzbank talks ending in failure, the urgency to do an asset management deal fizzled out. Any deal to merge DWS with a peer and give it additional scale could also be presented as a strategic revamp of Deutsche Bank after the failure of the Commerzbank talks. A combined UBS asset management unit and DWS would have just more than 1.4 trillion euros ($1.58 trillion) in assets under management and was considered a good fit as the two are roughly the same size. DWS chief executive Asoka Woehrmann has said he wants to actively participate in consolidation in asset management and early last year Deutsche Bank listed it as part of a broader overhaul to help Germany’s largest bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals. A structure under consideration was for UBS to hive off its asset management business and fold it into DWS, which is 79.5 percent owned by Deutsche Bank. A deal could have led to more than 1,000 job cuts, one banker said. Deutsche Bank had also approached Allianz and Amundi, the French asset manager mostly owned by Credit Agricole, over a possible deal for DWS, other people close to the matter said. As with the UBS talks, issues over who would be in driving seat of a merged entity led to the failure of the Allianz talks, two people close to the matter said. Allianz’s interest in medium-sized deals such as this one was limited, one added. Allianz declined to comment."
-0.9838533878516776," Investor advisor ISS urges no-confidence vote in Deutsche Bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank faces a possible public rebuke from shareholders after two influential investor advisory groups urged them to issue a vote of no confidence in the lender’s management. In a highly critical report, U.S. proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said it recommended investors do not ratify management’s work last year when asked to do so at an annual shareholder meeting on May 23. “At a certain point, shareholders should make their concerns heard,” it said, singling out lax money laundering controls and the group’s “precarious” low share price, which it said threatened “Deutsche Bank’s very existence”. “It is time for shareholders to hold the bank personally responsible,” ISS said, adding that “underlying patterns of leadership and the culture of risk” had not improved despite many promises to do so. Deutsche Bank’s management, under the watch of chairman Paul Achleitner, has faced renewed criticism amid dwindling profits and strategic uncertainty, underscored by the recent collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank. A second advisory group, Glass Lewis, has also urged investors not to endorse management’s work, citing a substantial loss of shareholder value and performance concerns. Deutsche Bank said the ISS recommendations did not reflect the current situation at the bank. “While we acknowledge that there is still work ahead of us, we have significantly improved our risk and control systems in the last three years and we will continue to do so”, it said. It is uncertain which way shareholders will vote but a vote of no confidence would deliver a powerful symbolic rebuke to management, although there are no legal repercussions. Following similar advice from advisors, shareholders in German drugmaker Bayer recently voted against approving the work of management after the costly takeover of seed maker Monsanto led to a slump in its share price. UBS shareholders also refused to endorse the performance of the Swiss bank’s leadership last week, following the bank’s French conviction for helping wealthy clients evade taxes. The ISS report paints a bleak picture of attempts to turn around the lender, which has been fined billions of dollars in numerous cases, including a penalty for artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia. “While Deutsche Bank has been promising to clean up its internal controls for many years, alone in 2018, a slew of new investigations were launched against the bank for failure to have appropriate anti-money laundering ... controls,” ISS said. It added that Deutsche Bank’s financial viability had further deteriorated, making it a potential takeover target.” Deutsche Bank’s share price has lost more than 70 percent and the lender has been through three chief executives since Achleitner became chairman in 2012. Last month, Deutsche and Commerzbank, Germany’s two largest lenders, announced that nearly six weeks of negotiations about a tie-up had ended in failure, raising questions about the future of the Frankfurt-based rivals."

-2.8224800873895277," Failure of Deutsche Bank-Commerzbank merger talks no surprise: watchdog FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The failure of merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank was “not a surprise”, a German official said on Tuesday. The statement by Raimund Roeseler, an executive with Germany’s financial markets watchdog, marked the regulator’s first public comments on the failed merger talks, which were discontinued last month after six weeks of negotiations. The banks attributed the failure to risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. The banks will still be under pressure to cut costs, Bafin president Felix Hufeld said. He dismissed the notion that hurdles stood in the way to cross-boarder banking mergers in Europe. The comments, made at an annual news conference, came as Bafin disclosed that it was looking into a possible erosion of bank lending standards in Germany and has also created a new department to deal with especially troubled banks. Bafin and the Bundesbank in April started a survey of nearly 100 financial institutions, according to Roeseler. “A possible erosion of lending standards in conjunction with reduced risk provisioning can lead to a threat to financial stability,” Roeseler said. “We are therefore taking a closer look at this.” The survey is still being conducted and Bafin said it would provide results when they were available. Bafin founded the new department - a so-called intensive care station - at the beginning of this year. Bafin decided to take this step while the economy was good “in order to be prepared when there really is a need for a downturn”, he said. Roeseler added that there were banks on the intensive care station but he would not provide further details except to say it was a single-digit figure."

The Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the results by July, and the ECB declined to comment. While Deutsche Bank had made significant improvements in recent years and eased relations with the Federal Reserve, systems it uses to monitor its business and risks, which determine how much capital it needs, remained weak.

The lawsuit filed late Monday opens a new front in Trump’s battle to stop the Democratic-led House of Representatives from probing the Republican president, his family, his businesses and his administration after Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his inquiry into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The lawsuit said urgent action was necessary because both banks signaled they would begin responding to the subpoenas unless a court intervened by May 6. Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump’s real estate empire. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, asked Capital One’s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump’s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests. In the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Trump, his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, and the Trump Organization accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose, hoping they would “stumble upon something” they could use as a political weapon against Trump. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the complaint said. Only the banks were named as defendants. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. “The president will do anything and everything that he can to obstruct justice ... to shut down an investigation,” Waters told reporters on Capitol Hill. She also said Trump has “cast a gauntlet and he has said that he is going to fight,” referring to her investigation of Deutsche Bank. “We will fight him,” Waters added. Deutsche Bank said it was “committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Capital One was not immediately available for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs were also not immediately available. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama. Michael Stern, who served as senior House counsel from 1996 to 2004, said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed because judges do not like second-guessing lawmakers’ motivations in investigations. Stern also said Trump’s decision to sue only Deutsche Bank and Capital One appears to have been strategic because the banks would not try to pick sides and were less likely to contest an injunction blocking a subpoena. Andy Wright, a former White House lawyer under Obama now at the law firm K&L Gates, said: “Courts have been really reluctant to assess whether or not Congress has a legitimate interest or not. They have been very deferential in the past.” Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January, including possible dealings with Russia, and said “we’re fighting all the subpoenas” issued by the House. That battle could herald a major showdown between the executive and legislative branches testing the separation of powers spelled out in the U.S. Constitution. The White House is also resisting other House subpoenas, including for Trump’s personal and business tax returns, and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators. Waters and Schiff in a joint statement called the lawsuit part of Trump’s “unprecedented stonewalling” of congressional oversight. In the complaint, the plaintiffs said House leaders ignored constitutional limits on Congress’ power to investigate, and any probe needed to further some “legitimate legislative purpose” and could not be an end in itself. They also said the subpoenas violated the plaintiffs’ privacy rights, and the refusal of House committees to even provide copies of the subpoenas to the plaintiffs made it impossible to know, or negotiate, their scope or breadth. Deutsche Bank stood almost alone in extending credit and managing money for Trump before he became president, as other banks avoided him because of his poor track record in paying back loans. The German lender has extended a substantial amount of capital to the Trump Organization in the past decade, according to documents and media reports. A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank. In March, the New York Times detailed other financial relationships, including more than $2 billion of property loans and private banking services."
-4.78104801295863," Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block House subpoenas (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and seven of his companies filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial Corp to block the banks from complying with federal subpoenas investigating his financial dealings. The federal lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court’s Southern District of New York, contended that demands for records by Democrat-controlled House committees have no legitimate or lawful purpose. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the lawsuit said. It also complains that the Democrats are hoping “they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President.” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, both Democrats, called the lawsuit “meritless” in a joint statement, the New York Times and other media reported. On April 15, two U.S. House of Representatives committees issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Both banks have been involved in Trump’s real estate empire. “The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern. The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the president and his associates, as thoroughly as possible,” Waters, said in a statement earlier. Schiff said previously in a statement the subpoenas issued included a “friendly subpoena to Deutsche Bank.” Trump recently has said that he intends to defy any efforts from the Democrats to dig into his affairs. Among other things, the Democrats have been looking into possible dealings Trump might have with Russia. The suit, which includes The Trump Organization Inc. and Trump’s three eldest children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, states that the court has the power to declare the subpoenas invalid. A representative of Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Attorneys and representatives for the two sides were not immediately available to Reuters late Monday."

-4.260657512860624," Deutsche Bank chair against strategy change at investment bank: FT BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner told the Financial Times that Germany’s largest lender did not need to fundamentally overhaul its investment bank after attempts to create a German champion with Commerzbank failed. Achleitner defended Deutsche Bank’s strategy after merger talks with Commerzbank failed due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. “Every executive has to constantly adjust to a changing market environment ... but in this regard, we are not talking about strategy, we are talking about execution,” Achleitner told the paper. The idea of merging with Commerzbank has now been abandoned “once and for all” Achleitner said, adding that Deutsche Bank is aware that Commerzbank could be taken over by a foreign lender. Deutsche Bank has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. It is trying to turn itself around, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests. Turnaround efforts will continue but no fundamental strategy shift is underway, Achleitner said. “In particular, in a business like the capital markets one, which is so volatile and so rapidly changing, there will be permanent adjustments,” said Achleitner, who was seen as a backer of the proposed merger with Commerzbank. He said that was his personal view. Earnings released on Friday showed net revenue at Deutsche’s sprawling global investment bank, which accounts for more than half the German bank’s overall revenue and which relies heavily on its bond trading earnings, fell 13 percent to 3.3 billion euros ($3.68 billion) in the first quarter. Even strong players such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have shown weaker revenues in bond trading, an area where Deutsche has been strong. On being asked whether Deutsche Bank would have needed 10 billion euros in extra capital to finance the Commerzbank merger, Achleitner told the Financial Times that this number was “excessive”. Deutsche Bank has considered a significant restructuring of its United States operations after the lender failed stress tests. The Federal Reserve this month said it would relax the capital and stress test requirements for the subsidiaries of foreign banks."

-4.260657512860624," Deutsche's investment bank shows quarterly weakness, lags U.S. rivals FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Revenue at Deutsche Bank’s bond trading division fell 19 percent in the first quarter, it said on Friday, underscoring weakness at its investment bank a day after announcing the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank. Net revenue at its sprawling global investment bank, which accounts for more than half the German bank’s overall revenue and which relies heavily on its bond trading earnings, fell 13 percent to 3.3 billion euros ($3.67 billion). The German flagship lender posted a net profit of 201 million euros, up 68 percent from a year ago but hardly making up for a net loss of 409 million euros in the fourth quarter as the bank battles stiff competition from U.S. powerhouses. Deutsche’s bond trading performance lagged its U.S. rivals, whose fixed income trading revenue was down on average 7 percent in the first quarter, which was tough for the broader industry. The bank had said on Thursday, when it announced that six weeks of talks with Commerzbank had failed, that it expected net profit for the first quarter of about 200 million euros, beating analysts’ expectations of 29 million. UBS analysts wrote that “headline numbers are a beat on lowered and low expectations,” underlining the fragility of efforts to turn Germany’s biggest bank around after posting losses three out of the past four years. The bank now expects revenue for the whole bank to be flat in 2019, scaling back previous expectations for a rise. The cost-to-income ratio at the investment bank was 102 percent, up from 95 percent on average last year at the division. That is higher than 84 percent at the retail bank in the first quarter and 76 percent at the asset management unit. A new leadership has tried to revive Deutsche’s fortunes, but the bank has faced hurdles that include allegations of money laundering, ratings downgrades and failed stress tests. Christian Sewing, the bank’s chief executive officer, said the bank was “well on track” to meet its 2019 cost targets. The bank said it was on track for a 2019 return on tangible equity of 4 percent, a key profitability target closely watched by analysts and the credit ratings agencies. “Our first-quarter results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and our continued progress in executing our plans in a very challenging market environment,” Sewing said. Deutsche is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. But the German lender has been plagued by losses and a scandal. A $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market crisis was a major blow that spooked clients and concerned regulators. The story refiles and adds dropped word in paragraph 4"
-1.498856989258534," Deutsche Bank focused on solo destiny after Commerzbank deal demise FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Within hours of the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank, Christian Sewing scrambled to convince investors and employees that Deutsche Bank can stand on its own two feet. The Deutsche Bank chief executive told staff, many of whom opposed a merger because of significant job losses, that while he had not been “skeptical” about the Commerzbank talks, he was cautious about the chances of success from the start. And another top Deutsche Bank executive said on Friday that it had been Commerzbank that initiated the talks, suggesting there was no desperation on their part for a deal. Commerzbank denied that version of events, ending the apparent truce between the normally highly competitive cross-town Frankfurt rivals over the past six weeks. German hopes of creating a national banking champion able to challenge global competitors were finally dashed on Thursday when Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank ended their talks due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. For Sewing, the failure to clinch a deal has left the 49-year-old chief executive of Germany’s largest bank, who took over just over a year ago, with his back to the wall. Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, which downgraded Deutsche Bank last year, said on Friday that Deutsche Bank “will remain under strain”, adding that it “seems to have acknowledged the need to adjust its strategy”. Under Sewing, a new leadership has tried to revive Deutsche Bank’s fortunes, but it has faced money laundering allegations and failed stress tests, as well as ratings downgrades. At the heart of the debate over its future is whether it should focus its business on Germany and draw a line under its costly global ambitions to take on Wall Street’s big guns. “MARKET PLAY” Without a deal, Deutsche Bank now finds itself back at the mercy of equity and debt markets, with UBS analysts warning that in a “stress scenario” it could again “be forced into a ‘debt-driven capital increase’ even with solid capital ratios”. “Deutsche remains a levered market play vulnerable to external events,” the UBS analysts said in a note. Sewing, along with many analysts, believes Deutsche Bank can go it alone in the short-term, but will be counting on a turnaround in market conditions to do so in the long-run given its dependence on volatile investment bank earnings. “To reach our return objective, we also need to see a revenue recovery in our more market-sensitive business,” Sewing said on Friday after reporting results. “These revenues are available to us in better market conditions given our leading positions in many of these businesses, but we need to capture them,” he added. Revenue at Deutsche Bank’s bond trading division fell 19 percent in the first quarter, it said on Friday, underscoring weakness at its investment bank. If those earnings do not improve, Berlin’s desire to keep its biggest bank out of foreign hands may start to wane. “Germany’s globally active companies need competitive financial institutions that can support them around the world,” German finance minister Olaf Scholz said on Thursday."

Commerzbank approached the larger Deutsche Bank about a potential merger, a senior Deutsche Bank executive said, an overture that kicked off six weeks of intensive and frantic but ultimately fruitless talks. It was the first indication of which bank had initiated talks between Germany’s top lenders. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity to journalists on a media call. However, a spokeswoman for Commerzbank denied that version of events. The talks “started jointly and they ended jointly,” the spokeswoman said."

He said he is holding onto his Commerzbank shares partly because he expects the bank to pursue an alternative deal with another European lender. The most likely suitors are Italy’s UniCredit as it has a large presence in Germany through HypoVereinsbank, and BNP Paribas due to the French bank’s strong investment banking position which could generate synergies, Theveneau said. Dutch bank ING, which sources say has also expressed interest in Commerzbank, is a less obvious candidate, he said, citing its less complementary geographical footprint. “We didn’t think Deutsche Bank was the right partner for Commerzbank,” he said. Theveneau added that the pace of mergers across the European banking sector should accelerate in order to improve lenders’ low profitability. “Banking is very late [on M&A],” he said. “It is high time for it to change.” Lyxor Asset Management owns 6.71 million shares, or 0.54 percent, in Commerzbank worth 50.8 million euro ($56.6 million) at current prices, according to Refinitiv Eikon data."
-3.751803435353978," German ambitions evaporate as Deutsche Bank merger talks with Commerzbank collapse FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German hopes of creating a national banking champion able to challenge global competitors were dashed on Thursday when Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank ended merger talks due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. Germany’s two largest banks announced that nearly six weeks of high-level negotiations about a tie-up had ended in failure, confirming an earlier Reuters report and immediately raising questions about the future of the Frankfurt-based rivals. The decision to ditch the talks followed a final early morning meeting between Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing and his Commerzbank counterpart Martin Zielke, two sources told Reuters. Both CEOs said a deal would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the risks and costs of a merger, which had been opposed by unions fearing 30,000 job losses, and raised concerns among investors and regulators. While the talks are over, investors doubt either bank can go it alone for long under their current strategies given their low levels of profitability. German government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, had pushed for a tie-up to create a national banking champion and end questions over the future of both banks, which have struggled to recover since the financial crisis. Deutsche Bank’s 2018 return on equity was just 0.4 percent, trailing far behind rival U.S., and increasingly other European, investment banks, while Zielke said this month that Commerzbank does not have the market share for costly investments, fuelling speculation of an alternative tie-up if talks fell through. Shares in Commerzbank were 2.1 percent lower at 1235 GMT. Deutsche Bank traded 0.3 percent lower, erasing earlier gains. Deutsche Bank will now face pressure to make more radical changes, such as cuts to its U.S. investment bank as advocated by regulators and some major investors. It is already looking at a deal for its asset management unit DWS. “Deutsche Bank will continue to review all alternatives,” Germany’s largest bank said. Employees of both banks immediately welcomed the news, although a senior Commerzbank manager acknowledged it opened the door to further uncertainty as foreign competitors circle. “It is clear that others will now come out of the woodwork with offers and ideas,” the manager told Reuters. Doing nothing is “not an option”, Zielke has told his staff, 82 percent of whom were against a merger in an internal survey. Both UniCredit and ING Groep have expressed interest in Commerzbank, which is Germany’s No. 2 lender and 15 percent owned by the government, sources have said. UniCredit and ING declined to comment after news that talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank had failed. Some major Deutsche Bank investors had questioned the deal’s logic and were unwilling to stump up any extra cash to get it done, while credit ratings agencies had warned of risks. The European Central Bank would have asked Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gave the go-ahead for a merger, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. . The German central bank, which helps oversee the banks, stressed their individual health, calling them sound and stable. “This was the case prior to discussions, during discussions and now – without qualification,” Bundesbank executive board member Joachim Wuermeling said. Deutsche Bank also published preliminary earnings in which it said it expects to post a first-quarter net profit of about 200 million euros ($223 million), beating analysts’ expectations of 29 million. “A merger would have been an enormously complicated and protracted undertaking. In the end, reason has won,” said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, a shareholder in both banks, adding they urgently need to address their strategies. Alexandra Annecke, portfolio manager at Union Investment, which also holds shares in Deutsche Bank, said it needs to focus on increasing profitability, especially at its investment bank. Deutsche Bank’s finance chief James von Moltke told CNBC that the U.S. investment bank is “a core part of our strategy”. Gerhard Schick, finance activist at Finanzwende and a former member of the German parliament, welcomed the end of talks but cautioned that Deutsche Bank remains “too great a risk”. “The bank is still far too large and would probably have to be rescued in an emergency,” he said, with reference to the likelihood of Deutsche Bank needing to turn to the state to keep it afloat if it ran into difficulty."

-3.751803435353978," Deutsche bonds drop as Commerz tie-up founders LONDON, April 25 (IFR) - Deutsche Bank’s bonds gapped wider after its board ruled out a potential tie-up with Commerzbank, but the longer-term impact on the bank’s strategic direction - and hence its spreads - divided opinion among credit investors. After nearly six weeks of talks, Deutsche Bank announced on Thursday that a merger would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the additional execution risks, restructuring costs and capital requirements associated with such a large-scale integration. Deutsche’s Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt initially fell over 1.5 points in cash price terms, according to Tradeweb data. German government officials had been pushing for a tie-up to create a national banking champion and mitigate the travails of both institutions since the financial crisis. The prospect of a merger met fierce opposition from the workforce, however. “I think it’s a massive setback for them, as it’s hard to see an alternative plan – I’m surprised spreads aren’t weaker in Deutsche Bank,” said Richard Thomson, an analyst at Janus Henderson. “[There are] no triggers for DB in the short term, but weak earnings, high costs, high leverage and high funding costs will remain the focus of many investors.” Deutsche said it would continue to review all alternatives to improve long-term profitability and shareholder returns, but it is trying investors’ patience: as BNP Paribas analysts point out, the deal’s collapse will force the bank to present its fifth turnaround plan since 2015. The market’s attention is now likely to refocus on the bank’s standalone credit quality - a performance negative for its senior paper after the strong performance this year, said Suvi Platerink Kosonen, a credit analyst at ING. “There is little confidence in their current strategy from the markets, and now that the merger talks have been ended, they are likely to be pressured to come up with a new strategic plan,” she told IFR. Deutsche priced a €750m 2.625% Feb 2026 senior non-preferred bond at swaps plus 230bp on February 5. That was trading close to its tights in the low 190s at Thursday’s open, before widening to 200bp over. “NOT THE ONLY WAY” Others were more optimistic, arguing that the bank is better positioned than many make out. “There was no desperation from their side. Capital is fine - I never understood why people were calling for a capital raise – the trouble is still on the earnings side,” said Michael Huenseler, managing director at Assenagon Asset Management. “The merger wasn’t the only way out, but the DB board needs to convince their investors that they can make it on their own and there is some potential left.” In contrast to its bonds, Deutsche’s shares traded up - by 3.6% by 10:05am. That seemed to reflect better-than-expected preliminary earnings in which it said it expects to post a first-quarter net profit of about €200m, beating analysts’ expectations of €29m. Its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to be approximately 13.7%. Still, whether Deutsche can bolster its revenues on a long-term basis remains to be seen, particularly since further cost cuts could further erode the franchise. “The reported revenue attritions of c. €1.5bn could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management. “That would have compounded the chronic difficulties of Deutsche to grow its revenue base.” The termination of talks will also avoid a lengthy paralysis of both institutions that an integration would likely have entailed. But it does mark a set-back for the consolidation of Germany’s highly fragmented banking sector, where profitability remains under intense pressure across the board. Commerzbank’s fate poses another question. Unlike Deutsche’s, its bonds performed following the news, if only slightly - its spreads rallied up to 5bp in the case of both senior and Tier 2. “Commerzbank has tightened on relief that DB isn’t likely to be its partner,” said Janus Henderson’s Thomson. Its merger with another European institution is seen as highly likely, however, with ING and UniCredit touted among the potential candidates. “This should be quite supportive of the spreads of the Commerzbank paper, as any of these combinations is likely to result in a stronger bank than the DB tie-up,” the BNP Paribas analysts said.

-5.210933200756307," Allianz, Amundi considering tie-ups with Deutsche Bank's DWS: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Allianz and Amundi are considering rival deals to tie up their asset management units with Deutsche Bank’s DWS, sources close to the matter said on Wednesday. Their interest comes as Germany’s biggest bank considers a possible merger with Commerzbank, with talks now in their sixth week, increasing speculation about a deal for DWS which could generate funds for Deutsche to finance the merger. Any deal to merge DWS with a peer and give it additional scale could also be presented as a strategic revamp of the troubled bank, in case Commerzbank talks fail. Deutsche Bank is due to update the public on its Commerzbank merger talks by Friday at the latest, as both banks weigh a complex tie-up that analysts say is fraught with risk. Allianz, which is Germany’s biggest insurer, and Amundi, the French asset manager mostly owned by Credit Agricole, are working with their advisers on a possible deal with DWS, which has a market capitalization of 6.4 billion euros, the sources told Reuters. Deutsche Bank is already in talks with Swiss bank UBS over DWS, four different people said, confirming a Financial Times report of “serious” merger talks, but added these may still end without a deal. A structure under consideration is for UBS to hive off its asset management business and fold it into DWS, which is 79.5 percent owned by Deutsche Bank, one of the sources said. “Deutsche Bank needs to consolidate DWS, it is dependent on the high and stable earnings contribution of its asset management operation, so any deal needs to be structured to reflect that,” the person said. A combined UBS asset management unit and DWS would have just over 1.4 trillion euros ($1.57 trillion) of assets under management and is considered a good fit because the two are roughly the same size. Such a tie-up would likely still give Deutsche control of the venture, another source familiar with DWS said. Allianz has lined up Barclays to advise on a potential transaction, which could be structured as a merger between Allianz Global Investors and DWS, the people said. JP Morgan has been seen in the lead to become Amundi’s adviser, they added. Shares in DWS traded up 1.6 percent to 32.60 euros, the highest levels since its initial public offering a year ago. Amundi, Allianz, DWS, UBS, Barclays and JPMorgan declined to comment. DWS’ chief executive Asoka Woehrmann has said he wants to actively participate in consolidation in the asset management industry, while in recent months, executives at both Allianz and Amundi have said that they were open to acquisitions. Early in 2018, Deutsche Bank listed DWS as part of a broader overhaul at the bank to help it move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals."

-10.230928657625434," Commerzbank staff give thumbs down to Deutsche deal: survey FRANKFURT (Reuters) - About 83 percent of Commerzbank employees who took part in a staff survey are against a merger with Deutsche Bank, according to preliminary results of the poll seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Germany’s two largest banks said in March they were in talks to merge, a tie-up that unions have said could result in the loss of 30,000 jobs. Opposition to the proposed deal is stronger at Commerzbank than Deutsche Bank, where a similar survey showed nearly 70 percent did not favor a tie-up. “Distance yourselves from the merger plans,” Commerzbank’s works council wrote in an open email to the bank’s management board with the results of the survey, taken during the fifth week of merger talks between the two banks. Commerzbank declined to comment. Employees’ opinions count in Germany because workers make up half of companies’ supervisory boards that usually are required to sign off on mergers. The strength of feeling among staff against the merger could also help labor to win concessions from management in exchange for their support. The survey results are preliminary because Commerzbank employees have until May 3 to give their opinions in the poll conducted by the bank’s headquarters staff works council. Of 11,000 employees sent the survey, 5,500 had responded as of Wednesday morning, with many away for the Easter holiday. Of those who responded, 82.5 percent said the two banks should not merge, 13.7 percent that they should, and 3.8 percent had no opinion. The potential merger with Deutsche Bank has prompted media speculation in Germany about boardroom rows at Commerzbank over the proposal. Last week, Commerzbank’s supervisory board chairman Stefan Schmittmann dismissed reports of board dissatisfaction with CEO Martin Zielke as irresponsible and unfounded. Zielke has already tried to win over employees. Days after the talks were announced, Zielke promised the bank’s employees a quick decision on whether to go forward with a merger, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The Commerzbank works council has since written to the board members to protest against the merger, saying the idea lacked support among workers, customers and society. Zielke has since met with staff to put the case for the deal."

Jan Bayer, Riebeck-Brauerei’s lawyer, said the justification to oust Achleitner was for his “dismal performance” and for pursuing a “value-destructive” merger with Commerzbank. Bayer said that he planned to file the motion for his client in the next week. Riebeck-Brauerei is an investment company which has a small shareholding in Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank, which is due to hold its annual general meeting on May 23, declined to comment. The disaffection with Achleitner comes as Germany’s largest bank has begun talks to merge with Commerzbank. If successful, the tie-up will bring together Germany’s two biggest banks to create one of Europe’s largest financial services groups. German government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the future of the two banks, which have struggled to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Last year, Riebeck-Brauerei filed a similar motion to oust Achleitner, prompting Deutsche to issue a statement supporting the chairman for his “comprehensive personal and professional skills and integrity”. At the annual meeting last year a small shareholder group led by Riebeck-Brauerei failed to oust Achleitner, garnering 9.05 percent of the vote. Bayer also said Riebeck-Brauerei would file other motions, including one to not ratify the actions of the management and supervisory boards over the past year. Also, the investor plans to file motions for votes of no confidence against several management board members related to the bank’s failure to prevent money laundering and to pass stress tests.

The contact underscores the attention Germany’s finance ministry has given to the country’s largest bank at a critical juncture that will determine whether the state becomes a shareholder in the group. In a letter answering a question from a German lawmaker, seen by Reuters, the government said Deutsche CEO Christian Sewing had met three times this year with Germany’s deputy finance minister, Joerg Kukies. Two of those meetings happened in January, while the third was on March 18, the day after Deutsche and Commerzbank publicly confirmed they were in talks about a possible merger. Fabio De Masi, the leftist lawmaker who made the information request, said the meetings showed finance minister Olaf Scholz, and his deputy, had been important in influencing talks, even though they have sought to distance themselves. “In reality, Scholz and Kukies hold the key,” he said, adding a merger would be a risk for taxpayers and cost thousands of jobs. “A banking champion is a dangerous idea.

-10.121426200122787," Qatar plan for further stake in Deutsche Bank has stalled: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A plan by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund to make a significant investment in Deutsche Bank has stalled, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) approached financial regulators months ago to seek approval to buy a big stake in Germany’s largest lender, the people said. Qatar’s royal family already holds a combined 6.1 percent stake in Deutsche Bank. But Qatari officials haven’t yet provided the necessary documentation, which could derail the QIA’s investment plans, they said. It was unclear whether the fund had lost interest or whether it was simply taking its time. The QIA initially expressed an interest taking a stake well before Deutsche Bank announced on March 17 that it was in talks to merge with German rival Commerzbank. The issue is sensitive because the European Central Bank (ECB) may ask Deutsche to raise fresh funds to approve any deal. QIA, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. Rumors of the investment have been reported by various media outlets for months. Because of the Qatari royal family’s existing stake in Deutsche Bank, an investment by QIA would trigger a standard background check by regulators on the shareholders to determine whether they were acting in concert to exert greater influence on the bank. The royal family’s stake is already among the largest of any shareholder. Other major shareholders include the U.S. investors BlackRock and Cerberus, and Chinese conglomerate HNA. The royal family has lost money on its initial investment but the small Gulf nation considers itself a long-term strategic investor in Deutsche Bank. Qatar is home to a financial center, which the family considers an important pillar of the economy. It also considers Germany an ally as it faces a blockade by its neighbors. Some major investors have been skeptical about a possible merger between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, questioning the logic and also the timing of a deal. Deutsche Bank has said little or no capital may be needed for a deal. But regulators have been worried about the tie-up amid doubts that a merger would strengthen Deutsche’s sprawling global investment bank. Deutsche has said it has already taken steps to shore up the investment bank, and a spokesman said on Friday there was “no basis” for the assumption that the ECB would ask it to raise fresh funds. German government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have pushed for the merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the banks’ future. A preliminary decision on whether the banks plan to go forward with a merger is expected within days."
-10.121426200122787," Several Deutsche Bank exchange-traded-notes to cease trading Thursday NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dozen of Deutsche Bank’s exchange-traded notes that provide exposure to oil, metals and other commodities are set to stop trading on Thursday, according to a recent filing by the bank. Exchange-traded notes, including the DB FI Enhanced Global High Yield ETN, the DB Crude Oil Long ETN and the Elements Dogs of the DOW Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return ETN, will be delisted at the close of trading on Thursday, according to an April 2 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ETNs are issued by a bank and are similar to exchange-traded funds in that they trade on stock exchanges and track benchmark indexes. But they differ from ETFs in that they are debt instruments with a set maturity date and expose investors to the issuer’s credit risk. The Deutsche Bank ETNs being delisted are relatively small, with assets under management ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to a few million dollars, with most set to mature in 2038. When ETNs stop trading publicly, they leave investors who hold them to find a buyer “over-the-counter,” where investors are not guaranteed anything close to what the notes are worth. After the delisting, the secondary market for these ETNs may experience a significant drop in liquidity, Deutsche Bank warned in a statement in March. Banks, under regulatory pressure to cut risk since the financial crisis, have been issuing fewer ETNs and delisting existing ones to focus on their core businesses. In December 2016, Credit Suisse Group AG shuttered its $1.1 billion VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN, making it the largest-ever note to be delisted from U.S. exchanges. (reut.rs/2uWnUCA)"

-2.167972352644625," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank open to U.S. revamp in merger talks - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said it was open to further restructuring of its U.S. investment bank after Commerzbank executives sought clarity on its plans during merger talks, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The future of the bank’s U.S. trading and investment banking presence had already been in question, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year. Speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks last month. Among the options floated by the bank during the talks were a further scaling back of its U.S. equities business, including prime brokerage services for hedge funds, and reductions at its corporate finance business, the sources said. Commerzbank wanted reassurances Deutsche Bank was prepared to make deeper cuts at its loss-making U.S. business as a condition of proceeding with the merger talks, the sources said. The two banks have been in discussions on the potential deal over the past three weeks and a decision on whether to intensify or terminate the discussions is expected as early as this weekend, the sources said. It is unclear how many of the bank’s 10,000 strong U.S. employees would be affected by any new cuts. Last year, the bank said it would reduce its global headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000. That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, including a significant number in New York. In a research note published on Friday, analysts at KBW said Deutsche Bank could cut up to 15 percent of its investment banking staff globally, equivalent to around 2,500 jobs, to achieve cost savings required to make the deal work. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment. David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management, said he thinks the majority of the cuts would be outside Germany. “If you want to reduce the pain for the staff in Germany, you have to cut more in New York and, maybe, London also. Deutsche Bank does not have a competitive advantage in investment banking in the United States,” he said. Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, Christian Sewing, said in a memo to staff last month the bank aimed to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business. Commerzbank’s chief executive, Martin Zielke, believes a strong and focused investment bank would be a good addition to the lender, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The German government, which has pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion, wants the combined business to retain an investment bank capable of supporting German companies doing business around the world, the sources said. A tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would give the combined bank a dominant position in its domestic market and improve its cost of funding. However, some analysts believe the deal fails to address Deutsche Bank’s biggest problem, its underperforming and capital-intensive U.S. investment bank. Commerzbank has limited investment banking operations so there are few opportunities to generate cost savings in that part of the bank, leaving Deutsche Bank still striving to turn around a business that has weighed on its earnings. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like Credit Suisse made big cuts. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. business has brought in around half of revenue for its overall investment banking unit, which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading. However, the business, encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations into past misconduct, has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals."
-2.167972352644625," Deutsche, Commerzbank favor merger over holding company structure: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank favor a straightforward merger over more complex ways to structure a deal, three people close to the matter said. In their base case scenario, a transaction would be organized as a share offer from Deutsche Bank for Commerzbank, they said. That structure is preferred to the creation of a new holding company, which is viewed as too difficult to execute. “The holding structure is dead,” one of the people said, referring to setting up a holding company that would buy Deutsche and Commerzbank in return for shares of the new bank. Sources said last year that Deutsche Bank was examining creating a holding company structure amid speculation at the time that it could merge with Commerzbank. Last month the two banks confirmed they were in talks about a merger. A preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward is expected within days. The people cautioned that no decision has yet been taken on a potential deal structure and there is still no certainty that a deal will be struck at all. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. Regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland tend to favor the bank holding company structure, in part because it can help with the winding down of a troubled bank. There has been a push since the financial crash to make banks easier to break up, lowering the risk that the problems of a troubled investment bank, for instance, could affect ordinary savers. About 90 percent of U.S. banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, operate as holding companies, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. But converting to a holding company structure can be costly. In Deutsche and Commerzbank’s case, defining the relative value of the two banks for a holding structure would be more complicated than simply negotiating a price for a simple takeover, the sources said. As part of a deal, Deutsche Bank will be asked by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds to plug capital holes resulting from asset revaluations and expected restructuring costs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this week. Issues around regulatory capital - and how to make use of the fact that Commerzbank trades well below book level, which can be used to boost such capital - are a talking point between the two banks. Other issues focus on synergies, job cuts as well as legal and tax issues, people familiar with the matter have said."

-2.167972352644625," ECB will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds for merger: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for a merger with a state-backed rival, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The official said that Deutsche would be required to have the buffer, which has yet to be calculated, to cope should it experience setbacks while integrating Commerzbank if a deal is agreed. The demand could complicate a bid to create Europe’s third-largest bank from Germany’s top two lenders, Deutsche and Commerzbank, who have struggled to recover since the financial crisis. Government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the banks’ future. While Deutsche has argued the case that little or no capital may be needed, regulators, worried about the group’s U.S. investment bank and the potential fallout of it failing a stress test there in September, are putting their foot down. The ECB and Commerzbank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank declined repeated requests for comment on Thursday. On Friday, a spokesman said that there was “no basis” for the assumption that the ECB would ask it to raise fresh funds. On the stress tests, the spokesman said Deutsche had invested heavily in data and model capabilities and would continue to do so. “We believe we have made significant progress,” he said. With much left to be negotiated in any deal, the size of a capital hole remains unclear but is expected to run into billions of euros. A merged entity could need up to 10 billion euros ($11.22 billion) of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie-up. Deutsche Bank’s exploratory merger talks with Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany’s finance ministry, which is worried about Deutsche’s future. A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group. Germany currently holds a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank after a bailout during the financial crisis. The banks announced on March 17 that they were in talks to merge and a preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward with a merger is expected within days. Deutsche Bank came under increased pressure on Thursday to move forward on a tie-up with Commerzbank after Italy’s UniCredit was named as a potential alternative bidder for the German lender. UniCredit could explore a merger with Commerzbank if talks with Deutsche fall through, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. A potential merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank has met stiff resistance from labor unions fearing jobs cuts, and from some major investors. Lawmakers are also warning Germany’s finance minister they will block any attempt to invest public money in a merged Deutsche and Commerzbank."
-2.167972352644625," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank’s Brunei hotel ban raises moral bar LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deutsche Bank’s latest strategy for boosting its appeal may be its most effective yet: the German lender headed by Christian Sewing has banned staff from Dorchester Collection hotels after its owner, the government of Brunei, implemented homophobic laws. Shareholders will welcome the fact that employees of a bank whose costs ate up 93 percent of revenue last year will no longer frequent a chain which charges nearly 400 pounds a night for a standard room in London. However, the decision raises the moral bar. Brunei’s state-owned investment agency owns the Dorchester Collection hotel group, which includes luxury venues such as The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Oscar-winning actor George Clooney called for a boycott after the government implemented Islamic laws which would impose the death penalty for homosexuality or adultery. Celebrities including singer Elton John have joined in. Shunning the sultanate is relatively painless for Deutsche, which has limited business in Brunei. Yet like many of its global peers the bank continues to operate in Saudi Arabia, which also has stringent anti-homosexuality laws. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon recently met government-linked clients in the desert kingdom. Banks and other big multinationals long argued that they had to accept the laws of countries where they do business. But pressure from customers and shareholders is forcing them to set out moral positions. Employers’ efforts to attract and retain a diverse workforce in the West is also increasingly hard to square with maintaining links with repressive regimes. Big companies generally muster two defences. The first is that if the government is moving in the right direction, a boycott would be counter-productive. This is how companies justified their presence in Saudi Arabia – which recently allowed women to drive – at least until the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last year. The second defence is that companies have an obligation to their shareholders to weigh the costs of boycotting certain countries against the reputational damage of working with them. Increased investor demand for companies to meet a range of social and environmental criteria means banks especially will face more awkward questions about business in illiberal countries. So while Deutsche’s Brunei boycott may be relatively cost-free, it will face bigger financial tests in the future."
-3.894418384100152," Deutsche Bank makes strides in US leveraged lending NEW YORK, April 4 (LPC) - Deutsche Bank was the biggest mover among the league tables for investment banks underwriting leveraged loans during the first quarter of the year, according to data from LPC, a unit of Refinitiv, despite turbulence in the debt and equity markets that slowed lending in December and into January. The German bank jumped to fourth place among investment banks for overall leveraged underwriting during the first quarter of 2019, taking a 4.6% share of the market. The bank came in eighth place overall for 2018 with a 4.5% market share. “Leveraged finance has long been a strength of Deutsche Bank’s. We have stayed active in the market throughout turbulent times and remain committed today,” said Sandeep Desai, co-head of leveraged debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank. The leap comes as Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have begun discussions over combining the two largest banks in Germany, as reported by Reuters. Deutsche Bank’s stock price has fallen from almost US$30 per share in 2015 to US$7.65 per share on Wednesday amid litigation and regulatory woes, as reported by Reuters. The bank’s leveraged finance business distanced itself from those concerns moving above Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Barclays in claiming the fourth spot. Bank of America Merrill Lynch came in first with a 13.1% market share, JP Morgan came in second with 9.8% and Wells Fargo was third with 9%. The top three banks during the first quarter were also the top three banks during the full year of 2018 in the same places. Leveraged loan volume hit a three-year low at US$152bn during the first quarter as volatility in both the equity and credit markets at the end of 2018 slowed business amid fears of a global economic slowdown. Secondary loan prices sank to 94.57 on LPC’s index of heavily traded loans, marking a multi-year low on December 28, 2018. This level has since risen to 97.5 as of Wednesday. The recovery allowed banks committed to underwriting during the volatility to capture additional market share. In 2017, Deutsche Bank’s CFO James von Moltke said the bank had decided to cut its leveraged finance activity due to its credit risk appetite. The CFO in February said the firm’s portfolio had performed well during 2018 and saw no provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter during the height of volatility. Leveraged finance currently makes up just 1% of the bank’s loan portfolio, according to comments from von Moltke at a conference call discussing the bank’s 2018 financial results, which showcases Deutsche’s sheer size. “Ultimately the business is an originate and distribute business, and so for us we focus on the underwriting quality of the origination in the business, but then on how it’s risk managed in terms of managing de-risking trajectories, which we’ve done frankly very well on,” von Moltke said during the bank’s February conference call. New money issuance was also noteworthy during the quarter as volume overall in leveraged finance was down across the board. The lower secondary prices caused repricing activity to vanish and reserved refinancing opportunities to the most qualified issuers. Bank of America led this sector in addition to the overall standings, followed by JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse and Barclays. This group of five also led new money deals for the entire year in 2018. Deutsche Bank was just 1bp behind Barclays though with 5.13% market share for new money versus 5.14%.

The Financial Times first reported UniCredit’s interest on Thursday. UniCredit, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank all declined to comment on the report. If the Italian lender were to act, it would likely see Commerzbank remaining listed but fused with UniCredit’s German bank, HypoVereinsbank, one of the people said. Shares in Commerzbank were up 3.2 percent by 0742 GMT, while Deutsche Bank stock was down 2.0 percent. Unicredit shares were down 1.2 percent. Any combination with UniCredit would be based in Germany while UniCredit would maintain its headquarters and listing in Milan. Reuters reported in 2017 that UniCredit had told Berlin it was interested in eventually merging with Commerzbank. The FT reported that one of the parties might decide to walk away from the talks, adding a significant announcement could be made as early as this weekend, citing people briefed on the discussions. Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would play a central role in any fusion, and lawmakers fear this puts it on the hook to shoulder losses if the bank runs into trouble. Berlin could therefore pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically or financially unpalatable."
-3.894418384100152," Deutsche Bahn to work with Deutsche Bank, Citi on Arriva sale: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German railway operator Deutsche Bahn has picked Deutsche Bank and Citi as advisors on its potential sale or flotation of British unit Arriva, people close to the matter said on Thursday. Deutsche Bahn said last week it was exploring the sale of Arriva - expected to be valued at more than 3 billion euros ($3.37 billion) - adding this would enable the group to lower its debt pile. Deutsche Bahn and the banks declined to comment. Deutsche Bahn has come under pressure to plug a funding gap and has said that a sale or listing could help it limit the rise in debt levels and give Arriva - which it bought in 2010 - financial leeway for growth. Deutsche Bahn’s net debt stood at 19.55 billion at the end of 2018 and the company had said that a complete or partial sale or a listing could take place until year-end. Arriva, which employs 53,000 across Europe, generated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 575 million euros in 2018 on sales of 5.44 billion. British peers Go-Ahead, Stagecoach and National Express trade at 3.5 to 7.5 times their respective core earnings. People familiar with the industry said that an outright sale is more likely than an initial public offering given the current state of capital markets and uncertainty tied to Britain’s departure from the European Union.[nL5N208701] “This is a play for private equity groups, for the long-dated funds with slightly lower return expectations or for infrastructure funds,” a person familiar with the matter said, adding that in a potential sale the company may be valued at more than 8 times its expected core earnings. Last year, U.S-based Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) bought Italy’s high-speed train operator Italo for 2 billion euros. Arriva has three units, a UK rail division, a European rail unit and bus operations in all of Europe, which will catch the attention of different sets of investors, the sources said. “The bus ops are clearly the most interesting parts,” one of the people said, adding that Deutsche Bahn is expected to shop it to British groups such as GoAhead, National Express and First Group as well as France’s SNCF unit Keolis or Germany’s Transdev, 34 percent owned by the Rethmann Group. The European rail operations are expected to attract interest from infrastructure investors, such as those who may bid for a stake in German rail group Netinera. Cube, the seller of a 49 percent stake in Netinera is planning to send out information packages on the asset before Easter, people close to the matter said. “Finding a buyer for Arriva’s UK rail operations may be the biggest challenge, as the interest of its British peers may be limited,” one of the people said, adding that infrastructure investors are seen as possible buyers."

-7.506789250370366," German lawmakers ready to block public cash for Deutsche-Commerzbank BERLIN (Reuters) - Lawmakers are warning Germany’s finance minister that they will block any attempt to invest public money into a merged Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, a deal which could require up to 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) of fresh capital. They intend to deliver this message at a closed-door meeting next week with Olaf Scholz, although it is unclear whether the Social Democrat finance minister still plans to attend. “The merged bank will probably need fresh capital. One thing that we will not stand for is that the state gives more money,” said Bettina Stark-Watzinger, who chairs the Bundestag’s finance committee, emphasizing a hurdle to any deal. Deutsche Bank’s exploratory merger talks with state-backed Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany’s finance ministry, which is worried about the future of the country’s biggest bank. A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group, which one German official said will need up to 10 billion euros of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie-up. While German parliamentarians cannot stop the merger itself, they are warning that the Bundestag can block any fresh money to fill a capital shortfall, a crucial pillar to any deal. “This goes contrary to one of the lessons of the financial crisis – that the taxpayer should not foot the bill for troubled banks,” Stark-Watzinger said. A spokesman for Scholz, who was the first to publicly reveal the merger talks but has since sought to distance himself from the process, insisting it is up to the banks to decide on their future, declined to comment, as did Deutsche Bank. “UNTHINKABLE” Lothar Binding, a leading Social Democrat on the committee, also said the government needed approval from the Bundestag if it wanted to back the merged group with fresh funds. This would not be triggered if Germany’s 15 percent Commerzbank stake automatically translates into a roughly 5 percent stake in the merged group, but approval is needed if the bank asks investors for fresh money, as expected. “As things stand, it is unthinkable that the Bundestag would agree,” said Binding. “Any synergies in this deal would come at an immensely high price: huge unemployment. 25,000 to 30,000 jobs could go. I’m against a merger.” Some conservatives are similarly opposed to the deal. “We need competition in the banking market, not mega mergers,” said Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. “How on earth can we sell a merger with this bank to our voters? I won’t support it under any circumstances.” Frustration has been growing in parliament because lawmakers believe Scholz is ignoring their concerns. Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would become a top shareholder in a merged group, playing a central role in any fusion. Lawmakers fear this puts it on the hook to shoulder losses if the bank later runs into trouble. Berlin could yet pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically unpalatable. “This merger is rubbish. It will cost not only jobs but hard cash as well,” said Lisa Paus, a Green party member of parliament, adding that she would reject any government participation in a capital hike. “It is a running joke in parliament: ‘Where is Scholz?’, she said, adding that his failure to explain the merits of a merger had infuriated many lawmakers. “He doesn’t speak to us.”"

-9.332216139490827," Commerzbank management pay cuts contrast with Deutsche Bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank’s chief executive was paid 32 percent less in 2018, contrasting with sharp rises for the top management at its potential merger partner Deutsche Bank. The disparity, revealed in Commerzbank’s annual report on Wednesday, underscores a divide in the compensation culture of the German banking rivals, which are in talks over a merger. The disclosure on pay came as the chairman of Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board said a decision on whether to move forward with a merger was just weeks away, while Commerzbank employees voiced opposition to a possible deal. Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke’s total compensation for the year was 1.97 million euros ($2.22 million), down from 2.88 million euros in 2017, compared with 7 million euros for Deutsche Bank’s chief Christian Sewing. And pay for Commerzbank’s management board dropped by 24 percent in 2018, while Deutsche Bank’s board received total pay, including bonuses, of 55.7 million euros, up from 29.8 million euros a year earlier. Commerzbank, 15 percent owned by the government after a bailout a decade ago, focuses on individual retail customers and financing small-and-medium sized corporate clients. Deutsche Bank in contrast operates a sprawling global investment bank. The drop in management pay at Commerzbank comes despite its net profit rising to 865 million euros from 128 million a year earlier, although it scaled back revenue targets. Commerzbank’s annual profit was more than twice the 341 million euros earned by Deutsche Bank. Commerzbank’s bonus pool for the broader workforce declined 41 percent to 134 million euros from 229 million a year earlier. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment. Separately, Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner said that the banks aim to announce more concrete steps on the merger by late April. Achleitner, speaking at a conference in Liechtenstein, said that a merger makes great sense from a macroeconomic perspective, but that the banks were still studying the operational value. “Our problem may not be too big to fail, but rather too small to scale,” Achleitner said. “Size matters.” The prospect of a merger is facing heightened opposition from Commerzbank employees. The bank’s workers’ council sent a letter to board members on Wednesday to protest the merger, saying the idea lacked support among workers, customers and society. “We are of the opinion that you will fall into an uncontrollable adventure without a solid plan, without a vision and without support,” the letter said."

-11.032116662420663," Deutsche Bank chief paid $8 million as top bosses gain first bonuses for four years FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank paid its management board members their first bonuses in four years in 2018, with Christian Sewing’s 7 million euro ($8 million) total package making him one of the best paid chief executives in European banking. Deutsche Bank’s politically sensitive pay disclosures, which were revealed in its annual report on Friday, come as it contemplates a merger with Commerzbank, which unions fear could lead to up to 30,000 job cuts. Sewing, who became CEO in April last year, led Deutsche Bank to its first profit in four years and is heading the talks with Commerzbank. He earned 2.9 million euros for 2017. His 2018 pay was higher than that of CEOs at several other major European investment banks, including HSBC’s John Flint and Barclays boss Jes Staley. However, the Deutsche Bank CEO received less than his Credit Suisse counterpart Tidjane Thiam, who received 12.65 million Swiss francs ($12.7 million). Deutsche Bank’s annual report also revealed that its management board received total pay, including bonuses, of 55.7 million euros in 2018, up from 29.8 million euros a year earlier. The overall bonus pool for 2018 was 1.9 billion euros, down 14 percent from 2.3 billion euros a year earlier, partly as a result of a reduction in headcount, Deutsche Bank said. Bonuses are a sensitive issue in Germany, where many politicians and public opinion are critical of high pay and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism. Fabio De Masi, a prominent leftist lawmaker in the German parliament, said that anyone who can pay 1.9 billion in bonuses does not need to cuts jobs. “The board doesn’t have all their wits about them,” De Masi said. Gerhard Schick, finance activist at Finanzwende and a former member of the German parliament, questioned Deutsche Bank’s bonuses if they were meant as incentives for good performance. “It adds to the negative overall picture of the bank, which is reeling from scandals and now apparently wants to plunge into a bad merger,” Schick said. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank has paid large fines for past misdeeds, including a $7.2 billion U.S. penalty in 2017, spooking clients. Last year it was ensnared in a money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank and its offices were raided over two days in November in relation to a separate inquiry. Litigation costs are expected to be “significantly higher” in 2019 than in 2018, Deutsche Bank said in the report. John Cryan, Sewing’s predecessor, received 8.7 million euros in severance pay and a 2.2 million euro payment to compensate him for what he could earn with a competitor. Last year’s management reshuffle, which involved Cryan and three other board members, was costly for Deutsche Bank, which paid a combined 25.8 million euros in severance and restraint on competition fees for the four executives, figures in the annual report and provided by the bank revealed. Garth Ritchie, head of Deutsche’s investment bank, was the highest paid board member with earnings of 8.6 million euros last year. Deutsche Bank pared down the investment bank last year, particularly in the United States, as part of efforts to cut costs. An executive with Blackrock, a major investor in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, said that a merger between the two lenders “will not work” if the “objective in this operation is to try yet again to create a large, U.S.-inspired investment bank operation”."

-11.032116662420663," German politicians split over bankrolling Deutsche Bank merger BERLIN (Reuters) - A political rift has emerged in Berlin over whether Germany should put its financial muscle behind a merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, politicians and officials said, complicating a bid to create Europe’s third-largest bank and fund it. Germany’s two top banks have struggled to recover since the financial crisis and government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, are pushing for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over their future. But a dispute is unfolding between the two political parties who govern Germany in coalition, a row that could reduce political momentum for a deal and derail any future agreement on whether or how Berlin should financially underpin a merged group. One senior German official said that Scholz, a Social Democrat, had “gone it alone” in pushing for the deal without first securing the backing of Christian Democrats (CDU) in the coalition. That official, who asked not to be named, said some Christian Democrats opposed Scholz’s drive because it could involve the state giving a guarantee on funding or contributing to a capital increase for a merged bank. That would mean Berlin, which already has a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank after a crisis-era bailout, would be on the hook again. Scholz was the first to publicly reveal the merger talks earlier this month but he has since sought to distance himself from the process, insisting it is up to the companies to decide. A spokesman said Scholz had “not voiced any position on the merger talks”, declining to comment on possible future government action. But his stance and the idea of merging the banks have prompted criticism. “The taxpayer cannot be made liable,” Eckhardt Rehberg, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats bloc, told Reuters. “I’m calling on finance minister Scholz to hold back.” Within the Social Democrat (SPD) party, attempting to reposition itself closer to regular working Germans as its support dwindles, some oppose a tie-up that trade unions fear will result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. “It is not clear for me how putting two sick banks together will result in a healthy one,” Cansel Kiziltepe, a Social Democrat lawmaker, told Scholz in a closed-door meeting this week, she said. Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would become a top shareholder in a merged group, playing a central role in any fusion. Berlin, which pushed the merger talks in the first place, could pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically unpalatable. Germany’s continued support is important because it could be called on to contribute to a capital increase for a combined bank. The bank may need more funds because a tie-up could legally trigger an adjustment in the value of Italian government bonds owned by Commerzbank, to reflect their depleted worth, a second German official has said. With Berlin as a shareholder, the merged bank would be seen as having an implicit government guarantee of its creditworthiness, cutting its cost of funding. However, in order for Germany to row in behind Deutsche Bank, there must be political agreement among the two parties, who are at loggerheads on a range of issues. Gains by the far-left and far-right in Germany have undermined its traditionally consensus-driven politics, with the SPD and CDU now trying to establish a clear distinction between each other. Regional elections in the coming months could heighten tensions in government further or even trigger a change of parties in charge, further complicating any future state support. “The finance minister can not give political presents to promote a merger,” Otto Fricke, a parliamentarian from the pro-business FDP party that could become a junior partner in a future coalition government, told Reuters. Merkel, who will have the final say in Berlin on whether the government should openly support a merger, has kept her cards close to the chest. Her chief of staff has hinted at one potential hurdle, describing the prospect of thousands of job cuts in a recent interview as difficult. Harald Christ, a director at the Wirtschaftsforum business lobby group, which has close links to the SPD, said he saw the chances of a merger at “50:50.”"
-11.032116662420663," Deutsche Bank CEO sees strong case for Commerzbank merger: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing believes there is a strong case for a merger with Commerzbank, a person with direct knowledge of his thinking said. Sewing’s view sets the stage for a potential showdown with labor unions who fear as many as 30,000 job cuts in Germany’s two biggest banks become one. He will also have to persuade some investors who are skeptical about the merits of a tie-up. The supervisory boards at both banks met separately on Thursday and discussed the proposed merger, but no decisions were taken by either. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. Sewing sees a merger bringing multiple benefits, including “clear” dominance in the combined bank’s German home market, scale, and shared technology costs, the person said before Thursday’s Deutsche Bank supervisory board meeting. He also believes that a combined entity would improve the cost of funding, with “the best funding ever”, the person said, adding that jobs will need to be cut with or without a merger. Deutsche Bank’s CEO has urged investors to be patient in recent months, preferring to focus on an internal restructuring before taking on a big project, other people with knowledge of his thinking have said. Sewing’s until now private view also contrasts with the more neutral tone set in a letter to employees on Sunday after both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank confirmed talks. Sewing said then that many factors could still prevent a merger. And Deutsche Bank would not have entered talks if the bank expected negotiations to fail, a second person with knowledge of Sewing’s thinking said. Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board debated the merger for three hours, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said after the meeting. Sewing informed the board about the possible merger and said the bank was at the beginning of doing due diligence, said the person. At Commerzbank’s supervisory board meeting, labor representatives voiced concerns about the merger, another person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The powerful Verdi labor union, which is on the supervisory boards of both banks, has voiced fierce objections to a merger, saying that as many as 30,000 jobs are at risk over the long term. Together, the banks employ 140,000 people worldwide. A Verdi spokeswoman said on Thursday that its position has not changed. At least three of Deutsche Bank’s top investors have voiced reservations about a merger, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Two of them were awaiting details from Sewing and his colleagues at Thursday’s meeting, two of the people said. Ratings agency Moody’s said this week that a successful tie-up may lift the banks’ profit, but earnings would remain below global competitors and a deal now would delay their overhauls. “We would view the impediments to execution on such a deal as very significant,” Moody’s said. Some German officials have pushed for a merger because they want a strong bank to compete with U.S. and Chinese players. However, euro zone banking watchdogs on Thursday said banks planning mergers should make sure they could be wound down in a crisis to avoid taxpayers having to foot the bill. “If a bank becomes too big, complex or interconnected... it needs to have additional capital,” the ECB’s top watchdog Andrea Enria said when asked in the European Parliament about a possible tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. Since the financial crisis a decade ago, European banks remain relatively weak compared with their U.S. counterparts, said John McFarlane, chairman of Barclays, and it will take a while for them to recover. “Even if you get consolidation in Europe, take Deutsche if that ever happens, it will still be less than 10 percent of JP Morgan’s market cap(italization) and still be smaller than Royal Bank of Scotland,” he said."
-11.032116662420663," RPT-German politicians split over bankrolling Deutsche Bank merger (Repeats without change) * Deutsche Bank in merger talks with state-backed rival * German coalition partners divided on supporting deal * State could be called on for funds or guarantee - official By John O’Donnell and Michael Nienaber BERLIN, March 21 (Reuters) - A political rift has emerged in Berlin over whether Germany should put its financial muscle behind a merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, politicians and officials said, complicating a bid to create Europe’s third-largest bank and fund it. Germany’s two top banks have struggled to recover since the financial crisis and government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, are pushing for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over their future. But a dispute is unfolding between the two political parties who govern Germany in coalition, a row that could reduce political momentum for a deal and derail any future agreement on whether or how Berlin should financially underpin a merged group. One senior German official said that Scholz, a Social Democrat, had “gone it alone” in pushing for the deal without first securing the backing of Christian Democrats (CDU) in the coalition. That official, who asked not to be named, said some Christian Democrats opposed Scholz’s drive because it could involve the state giving a guarantee on funding or contributing to a capital increase for a merged bank. That would mean Berlin, which already has a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank after a crisis-era bailout, would be on the hook again. Scholz was the first to publicly reveal the merger talks earlier this month but he has since sought to distance himself from the process, insisting it is up to the companies to decide. A spokesman said Scholz had “not voiced any position on the merger talks”, declining to comment on possible future government action. But his stance and the idea of merging the banks have prompted criticism. “The taxpayer cannot be made liable,” Eckhardt Rehberg, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats bloc, told Reuters. “I’m calling on finance minister Scholz to hold back.” Within the Social Democrat (SPD) party, attempting to reposition itself closer to regular working Germans as its support dwindles, some oppose a tie-up that trade unions fear will result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. “It is not clear for me how putting two sick banks together will result in a healthy one,” Cansel Kiziltepe, a Social Democrat lawmaker, told Scholz in a closed-door meeting this week, she said. Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would become a top shareholder in a merged group, playing a central role in any fusion. Berlin, which pushed the merger talks in the first place, could pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically unpalatable. Germany’s continued support is important because it could be called on to contribute to a capital increase for a combined bank. The bank may need more funds because a tie-up could legally trigger an adjustment in the value of Italian government bonds owned by Commerzbank, to reflect their depleted worth, a second German official has said. With Berlin as a shareholder, the merged bank would be seen as having an implicit government guarantee of its creditworthiness, cutting its cost of funding. However, in order for Germany to row in behind Deutsche Bank, there must be political agreement among the two parties, who are at loggerheads on a range of issues. Gains by the far-left and far-right in Germany have undermined its traditionally consensus-driven politics, with the SPD and CDU now trying to establish a clear distinction between each other. Regional elections in the coming months could heighten tensions in government further or even trigger a change of parties in charge, further complicating any future state support. “The finance minister can not give political presents to promote a merger,” Otto Fricke, a parliamentarian from the pro-business FDP party that could become a junior partner in a future coalition government, told Reuters. Merkel, who will have the final say in Berlin on whether the government should openly support a merger, has kept her cards close to the chest. Her chief of staff has hinted at one potential hurdle, describing the prospect of thousands of job cuts in a recent interview as difficult. Harald Christ, a director at the Wirtschaftsforum business lobby group, which has close links to the SPD, said he saw the chances of a merger at “50:50.” (Additional reporting by Balazs Koranyi and Tom Sims in Frankfurt, Holger Hanson and Andreas Rinke in Berlin; writing By John O’Donnell.

-16.923793512176978," Deutsche Bank merger talks heighten uncertainty for U.S. staff (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG’s merger talks with Commerzbank AG have put its 10,000 U.S. workers on edge, three employees told Reuters, with some concerned a deal could pressure Deutsche to further shrink or even dispose of its U.S. businesses. The future of the bank’s U.S. trading and investment banking presence had already been in question, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year, and speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks on Sunday. The German government, which has a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, is expected to retain a stake in the combined business if a deal materializes. Some employees fear that could pressure the bank to focus on its home market. Both banks have cautioned that the outcome of the talks remains uncertain, and the process could drag on for months. In the meantime key employees could decamp to rival Wall Street banks and hedge funds, further weakening a business that has underperformed for years. Several executives have left the bank’s U.S. operations in recent months. “We don’t know what’s going on. Everything is up in the air,” said one senior employee within the bank’s U.S. equity sales business, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Chief Executive Christian Sewing reiterated in a memo to staff on Sunday that Deutsche aimed to remain a “global bank with a strong capital markets business,” and a source familiar with the matter said the merger would not change the bank’s commitment to a strong U.S. presence. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Wednesday. German finance minister Olaf Scholz, reportedly a proponent of the merger, has previously stressed the need for Germany’s banking sector to support German companies who want to go abroad to export. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like Credit Suisse Group AG made big cuts to U.S. investment banking operations. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. business has brought in around half of revenue for its overall investment banking unit, which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading, even though it came with a relatively high cost of capital. However, encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations into past misconduct, the business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals. Deutsche had said last May that it would reduce its global headcount to well below 90,000 from 97,000. That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, a significant number of which were in New York, where it has lagged rivals. Cutting more jobs in the United States would not provoke the same political pushback that the two banks would face if they axe jobs in Germany, banking analysts say. Even if Deutsche Bank keeps its U.S. operations largely intact following a Commerzbank deal, some staff fear pay and bonuses would decline because the combined entity would face a backlash from German taxpayers if its remuneration was seen as excessive. Commerzbank, which is focused on personal and commercial lending, typically pays its staff less than Deutsche Bank. If the German government were to retain a stake in a combined entity, lawmakers would likely argue that it should keep a tight rein on pay. Traders at Deutsche Bank’s U.S. equities business have already felt a squeeze, with some receiving substantially smaller bonuses for 2018, the sources said. That has contributed to a decline in morale, which has been exacerbated by the departure of senior staff including Brad Kurtzman, co-head of equities trading in the Americas, who is leaving at the end of this month, the sources said. A recent focus on recruiting college graduates, held up by senior management as an affirmation of the bank’s long-term commitment to the trading division, has done little to quell concern, they added. One employee, who asked not to be named, said further defections are considered likely as staff look to pre-empt further cuts should the Commerzbank deal go through.

-16.923793512176978," Head down, eyes on the prize: Deutsche's realist CEO FRANKFURT, March 20 (Reuters) - Christian Sewing, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, doesn’t do grand visions. For much of his 30 year career as a banker, all but two of them at Deutsche, he has been heavily involved in risk control, auditing, and cost-cutting. As he holds merger talks with smaller rival Commerzbank – an assignment foisted on him by German government officials – opinion is split on whether this ‘head down’ attitude will serve Deutsche Bank well as its future course hangs in the balance. Since taking over as chief executive of Germany’s largest bank last year, Sewing, pronounced “Zay-ving”, has largely implemented the same strategy of simplification as his predecessor, John Cryan, albeit with an even greater focus on squeezing expenses. The zeal for parsimony, from cutting business travel to axing the office fruit bowl, has helped the bank regain some credibility by making its first net profit in four years. But some colleagues are frustrated at Sewing’s fixation on costs, which had, until recently, overshadowed discussions on strategy at Tuesday meetings of the bank’s management board, according to two people with direct knowledge of the gatherings. And some investors would prefer to see more radical measures to boost shareholder return, such as the closure of the U.S. investment bank, and greater investment in other divisions, such as transaction banking. “He’s a COO, not a CEO,” said one of the people familiar with the meetings, referring to the subordinate role of chief operating officer. “The bank doesn’t know what it wants to be.” The people spoke on condition of anonymity so they could talk freely about private meetings. Neither Deutsche Bank nor Sewing would comment on the record for this story, but Mark Hantho, chairman of global investment banking at Deutsche, said Sewing has been “an absolute breath of fresh air with a maniacal focus on execution”. Since returning the bank to profit earlier this year, Sewing has changed how he conducts the management board meetings. He has created a so-called growth council, comprised of the board and a handful of senior executives, which meets once a month to identify ways to allocate money and people to drive revenues, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. After a string of former investment banker chief executives who doubled down on risk in pursuit of profit, some investors say Sewing is the right man for Deutsche now. “In Deutsche Bank’s current situation, what is needed is not so much visions as hard realism,” said Klaus Nieding, vice president of shareholder lobby group DSW and a sceptic of a tie-up with Commerzbank. “I’m delighted that we won’t be running after any more visions, which has cost us a lot of money in the past.” Taking over Commerzbank would give Deutsche around a fifth of Germany’s retail banking market, boost the share of revenue it derives from less volatile commercial and retail lending, and lower its funding costs. But a tie-up would also take years to integrate, face stiff opposition from trade unions, which fear tens of thousands of job cuts, and does not address low returns from Deutsche’s investment bank. It is not clear if Sewing would lead a combined bank. A decision on whether to go ahead with a deal is expected within weeks, two sources familiar with the matter said. Deutsche Bank has struggled to recover since the financial crisis killed off the sort of excessive risk-taking that parachuted the former sleepy lender into the top ranks of Wall Street trading houses. With trading no longer as lucrative as it once was and stiff competition in its domestic banking market, Deutsche faces major structural problems. Despite Sewing’s efforts, Deutsche’s market capitalisation has fallen by over $8 billion since his appointment last April. The bank has also been implicated in a string of financial scandals in recent years and its dealings with U.S. President Donald Trump are being scrutinised by politicians and the New York Attorney General. Concerned about the health of Deutsche and smaller rival Commerzbank, in which the state holds a 15 percent stake after a crisis-era bailout, the government pushed for months for merger talks, according to officials familiar with the discussions. Berlin wants a national banking champion and was concerned that Commerzbank, which lends mainly to medium-sized companies that are the backbone of the German economy, would become a takeover target for a foreign bank. Sewing wanted to wait at least a year to continue his restructuring before taking on the task of merging two companies with combined assets of 1.8 trillion euros, according to two people with knowledge of his thinking. But he has warmed to a deal, according to two other people familiar with the matter. “You may recall that last September I said that, first and foremost, we intend to do our homework,” he wrote in a memo to employees on Sunday, confirming that talks were taking place. “At the same time, however, we have to assess opportunities as they arise.” Sewing was a 19 year-old apprentice at Deutsche Bank when it made its first serious foray into investment banking with the purchase of Morgan Grenfell, a British merchant bank, in 1989. He went on to work in risk management, auditing and retail banking, taking up roles in Germany, Britain, Canada and Asia during his career. In 2015, he was responsible for Deutsche’s private and commercial bank, and earned a reputation as a cost-cutter, axing thousands of jobs and hundreds of branches. Sewing was appointed CEO last year when tensions between Cryan and Chairman Paul Achleitner spilled into the open and the board was under pressure to end speculation about the top job. The promotion appeared to surprise even Sewing, who according to one person, sheepishly told senior managers in Frankfurt days after his promotion about his need for a “new blue suit”. Achleitner promised a “new execution dynamic” under Sewing but the chief executive has rankled some board members with what they see as short-sighted decisions to freeze spending or halt hiring to get costs down, according to one person familiar with the discussions. A decision taken last summer to curb hiring in the bank’s compliance division led to the resignation of Philippe Vollot, the head of the bank’s anti-money laundering unit, according to the person. That departure was particularly awkward for a bank that has had multiple money laundering lapses and was being closely scrutinised by regulators because of it. Vollot declined to comment. He is now the chief compliance officer for Danske Bank. Described by colleagues as unassuming, Sewing is nonetheless steely. When investor criticism of his decision to stick with the bank’s equities division became public last month, he had the bank issue a terse statement in response. “We have adjusted our footprint in our Corporate & Investment Bank and in the U.S. already in 2018,” the statement read. Asked about his management style, one confidant said: “He’s a tennis player. And quite a good one. He keeps hitting the ball back until he gets what he wants. That’s probably the best analogy to describe him.” (Additional reporting by Hans Seidenstuecker and John O’Donnell; Editing by Carmel Crimmins)"

-19.402313636959917," Deutsche Bank merger talks with Commerzbank raise job fears, lift shares BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank faced concerns from workers unions, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office and top shareholders on Monday after confirming merger talks. Combining Germany’s two largest banks could result in 30,000 job losses, a union warned, prompting Merkel’s chief of staff to say the government was scrutinizing the issue. The concerns underline the obstacles to combining the banks, which confirmed talks about a tie-up on Sunday following months of pressure from Berlin, which has pushed for a deal amid concerns about the health of Deutsche Bank, which has struggled to sustain profits since the 2008 financial crisis. Chancellery Chief Helge Braun told Bild newspaper that it would be “difficult” if thousands of jobs would be cut, warning that the government was “never passive when it comes to deals of such magnitude”. Together the two banks employ 140,000 people worldwide, 91,700 at Deutsche and 49,000 at Commerzbank and a merged bank would have one fifth of the German retail banking market. Despite the worries about jobs, the market reaction to news that the two banks were engaged in talks, which ended months of speculation, was positive. Shares in Deutsche Bank were up 5.0 percent at 1216 GMT while Commerzbank traded 6.7 percent higher. The supervisory boards of both banks are due meet on Thursday, with the merger likely to top the agenda. However, two top shareholders in Deutsche Bank expressed their disapproval, with one questioning not only the logic but also the timing of a deal. “There is no obvious reason why these two banks should be merged,” a person close to another shareholder said. And while international credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, which downgraded Deutsche Bank last year, said a well executed merger could reap efficiencies, it warned a deal would “entail significant uncertainties and risks”. In addition to regulatory and antitrust risks, an effort to merge would mean “several more years of significant internal restructuring,” while competitors move forward. The banks have “patchy track records in executing strategic programs,” S&P said. Berlin, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout, wants a national banking champion to support its export-led economy, best known for cars and machine tools. However, the jobs impact could be a major hurdle. A merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank could result in as many as 30,000 job cuts over the long term, a representative of German union Verdi, who is a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank, told n-tv broadcaster. Most of the 30,000 positions at risk are based in Germany, with 10,00 at threat in the short term, Verdi’s Jan Duscheck said in comments published by the TV station. “A possible merger would not result in a business model that is sustainable in the long term,” Duscheck said."
-22.218871481516274," Top Wall Street banks working on Deutsche-Commerzbank merger: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Citi are helping Germany’s two biggest lenders work on their potential $28 billion-plus merger, people close to the matter said on Monday. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank confirmed on Sunday they are in tie-up talks following months of pressure from Berlin, which has pushed for a deal amid concerns about the health of Deutsche Bank. Commerzbank is working with Goldman Sachs and Rothschild, as well as with law firm Hengeler Mueller, people close to the matter said on Monday. Deutsche Bank is working with Citi and also using its own in-house team of M&A advisers, according to Reuters Breakingviews. It is working with law firm Freshfields as well, people close to the matter told Reuters. The banks and advisers declined to comment, except for Hengeler, which confirmed the mandate. German Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Kukies and Deutsche chairman Paul Achleitner are former Goldman Sachs bankers. Investment bankers said several factors needed to be taken into account when assessing the best structure for any combination. In a straight takeover offer, Deutsche would likely have to offer a premium for Commerzbank’s shares. It would have to mark Commerzbank’s assets at market values, resulting in a significant capital hole. That could be plugged with a capital hike of around 5 billion euros, or through a sale of Deutsche’s asset manager DWS, bankers said. However, divesting DWS would mean giving up a steady stream of profits and go against Deutsche’s goal of shifting its business away from volatile investment banking earnings. “It’s a high-return low-capital business, it gives them a great return and they want to hold on to it,” one of the people said. Separately, a Deutsche-Commerzbank deal could also be set up with a new bank holding created, taking on both Deutsche and Commerzbank, or with a deal that sees Commerzbank merged with Deutsche’s Private & Commercial bank.

-22.218871481516274," Deutsche merger move takes European stocks rally to fourth day (Reuters) - European stocks rose for the fourth session in a row on Monday as a flurry of dealmaking, including merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, spurred gains in the financial services sector. Shares in the two German lenders rose between 4 percent and 7 percent, and boost banking stocks across the region, despite the likelihood of fierce opposition from local unions as a merger could threaten as many as 30,000 jobs over the long term. Europe’s banking sector rose more than 1 percent, with Italian lenders Banco BPM and UBI Banca gaining. That sent the pan-European STOXX 600 index’s up 0.27 percent to a fresh five-month high. “If this (deal) works out, people are going to be looking at ... if this could be an example of what needs to be done to create further stability and less reliance on the central bank,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. Also caught in the merger wave was German insurer Allianz, which Bloomberg reported was exploring combining its asset management business with DWS, mostly owned by Deutsche Bank. DWS shares jumped 9 percent to their highest since May. European payments companies Worldline, Ingenico and Wirecard rose after U.S. fintech group Fidelity National Information Services agreed to buy Worldpay for about $35 billion. That deal adds to a bumper few months for acquisitions in the fast-growing sector which analysts say may be far from over. London’s FTSE 100 rose the most among euro-peers with a near 1-percent gain at the start of a week in which parliament is expected to vote for a third time on Prime Minister’s Theresa May’s Brexit plan after ruling out a near-term no-deal exit. Mounting speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will sound decidedly dovish at its policy meeting this week was also aiding global stock markets. The European Central Bank changed its own direction on policy this month, pushing out the timing of its first post-crisis rate hike until 2020 at the earliest and offering banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the euro zone economy. Basic and resources sector jumped 1.7 percent, after Vale, the world’s top iron ore miner, announced further output cuts, raising worries about tightening supply of the steelmaking ingredient and triggering a rally in Chinese futures. [IRONORE/] However technology companies came under pressure as shares of Apple suppliers such as Infineon, AMS and STMicroelectronics fell, tracking their U.S. peers lower after Synaptics Inc said third-quarter earnings would come in at low end of forecast due to softness in China. Infineon posted its worst day in over two months and was among the biggest losers on Germany’s benchmark stock index, which fell 0.25 percent after three gaining sessions despite the surge in Deutsche Bank. Adidas dropped 2.4 percent, although volumes were low. Leoni was the day’s big loser, sinking almost 20 percent to a near nine-year low after the German automotive cable and wiring system specialist abandoned its 2019 profit target. The Italian bourse climbed almost a percent, closing at it highest in almost six months, after ratings agency Moody’s decided not to downgrade the country. A rare laggard among banks was Dutch lender ING Groep, whose shares fell 1 percent after Italy’s central bank identified “shortcomings” in its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes at its Italian unit."
-22.218871481516274," UPDATE 1-Top Wall Street banks working on Deutsche-Commerzbank merger - sources (Adds Deutsche Bank advisers, background) FRANKFURT, March 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Citi are helping Germany’s two biggest lenders work on their potential $28 billion-plus merger, people close to the matter said on Monday. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank confirmed on Sunday they are in tie-up talks following months of pressure from Berlin, which has pushed for a deal amid concerns about the health of Deutsche Bank. Commerzbank is working with Goldman Sachs and Rothschild, as well as with law firm Hengeler Mueller, people close to the matter said on Monday. Deutsche Bank is working with Citi and also using its own in-house team of M&A advisers, according to Reuters Breakingviews. It is working with law firm Freshfields as well, people close to the matter told Reuters. The banks and advisers declined to comment, except for Hengeler, which confirmed the mandate. German Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Kukies and Deutsche chairman Paul Achleitner are former Goldman Sachs bankers. Investment bankers said several factors needed to be taken into account when assessing the best structure for any combination. In a straight takeover offer, Deutsche would likely have to offer a premium for Commerzbank’s shares. It would have to mark Commerzbank’s assets at market values, resulting in a significant capital hole. That could be plugged with a capital hike of around 5 billion euros, or through a sale of Deutsche’s asset manager DWS , bankers said. However, divesting DWS would mean giving up a steady stream of profits and go against Deutsche’s goal of shifting its business away from volatile investment banking earnings. “It’s a high-return low-capital business, it gives them a great return and they want to hold on to it,” one of the people said. Separately, a Deutsche-Commerzbank deal could also be set up with a new bank holding created, taking on both Deutsche and Commerzbank, or with a deal that sees Commerzbank merged with Deutsche’s Private & Commercial bank. The latter could be organised in a way that Commerzbank’s shareholders retain a majority in the new retail and corporate bank, which would enable the lender to keep the tax benefit of being able to carry forward a large part of its losses.

-22.218871481516274," Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank go public on merger talks FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank confirmed on Sunday they were in talks about a merger, prompting labor union concerns about possible job losses and questions from analysts about the merits of a combination. Germany’s two largest banks issued short statements following separate meetings of their management boards, a person with knowledge of the matter said, indicating a quickening of pace in the merger process, although both also warned that a deal was far from certain. “In light of arising opportunities, the management board of Deutsche Bank has decided to review strategic options,” Deutsche said in its statement. Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, told employees that Deutsche still aimed “to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business... with a global network”. Sewing said many factors could still prevent a merger and a Deutsche spokesman said the talks were expected to last some time. Commerzbank described the outcome as open. However, formal disclosure of talks appeared to boost the chances of concluding a deal first floated in 2016 before the banks opted to focus on restructuring. The German government has pushed for a combination given concerns about the health of Deutsche, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. The government, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout, wants a national banking champion to support its export-led economy, best known for cars and machine tools. Berlin also wants to keep Commerzbank’s speciality - the funding of medium-sized companies, the backbone of the economy - in German hands. “SHAKY ZOMBIE BANK” A merged bank would likely be the third largest in Europe after HSBC and BNP Paribas, with roughly 1.8 trillion euros ($2.04 trillion) in assets, such as loans and investments, and a market value of about 25 billion euros. However, sceptics questioned the wisdom of a merger. “We do not see a national champion here, but a shaky zombie bank that could lead to another billion-euro grave for the German state. Why should we take this risk?” said Gerhard Schick, finance activist and ex-member of the German parliament. While the banks had not publicly commented on merger talks until Sunday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last Monday confirmed that there were negotiations. On Sunday, the ministry acknowledged the announcement and said it remained in regular contact with all parties. However, there were signs of political opposition. Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), urged the government to sell its 15 percent stake in Commerzbank before a deal. “There may not be an ownership by the federal government in a merged big bank indirectly through an old stake. We do not need a German State Bank AG,” he told Reuters. The supervisory boards of both banks are scheduled to hold long-planned meetings on Thursday, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The status of merger negotiations is expected to be discussed. A merged bank would have one fifth of the German retail banking market. Together the two banks currently employ 140,000 people worldwide - 91,700 in Deutsche and 49,000 in Commerzbank. Germany’s Verdi labor union on Sunday renewed its objections to a merger, saying that tens of thousands of jobs were at risk and that a tie-up added no value. Jan Duscheck, head of the union’s banking division and a member of Deutsche’s supervisory board, said the union would raise its concerns on both banks’ oversight bodies. Deutsche emerged unscathed from the financial crash but later lost its footing. German officials fear a recession or big fine could derail the bank’s fragile recovery. Other than Deutsche, Commerzbank is Germany’s only remaining big publicly-traded bank, after a series of mergers. Commerzbank has also struggled to rebound, and German officials say it is vulnerable to a foreign takeover. If an international rival snapped it up, that would increase competition for Deutsche on its home turf. Initial reaction among analysts to a deal was skeptical. There will only be limited benefits of adding Commerzbank’s clientele of retail and small and medium businesses to Deutsche, said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management. “It doesn’t change the fact that Germany is not getting a flagship bank that can compete on the world stage. It’s still a stunted bank with a lot of problems,” Hendler said. One of the biggest risks is how to fill what one German official has told Reuters will be a multi-billion-euro financial hole because a merger could trigger an adjustment to the valuation of some bank investments. Commerzbank, for example, has about 30.8 billion euros of debt securities such as Italian bonds that now have a value of 27.7 billion euros. A tie-up could crystallize this loss. Deutsche has such securities at market value in its accounts."

Deutsche is trying to turn itself around under new leadership, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests. On Monday, Scholz told reporters in Brussels there were exploratory talks between Deutsche and Commerzbank about a tie-up following such media reports and weeks of merger speculation. The two banks have declined to comment. Speaking to lawmakers during a closed-door meeting of the Bundestag lower house of parliament’s budget committee on Wednesday, Scholz said he was “closely watching” the reports about a possible merger, three participants told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Scholz also said the government was always open for talks with private sector companies, but said he could not confirm that any such talks were taking place or had taken place, the sources said. After the budget committee meeting, opposition lawmakers criticized Scholz for dodging their questions. “Once again unfortunately, Finance Minister Scholz stonewalled totally,” Sven-Christian Kindler from the Greens told Reuters. “But parliament has a right to know if the finance minister wants to create a big German bank with big risks.” Before the meeting, Scholz also drew criticism from senior members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc. “The finance minister must end the speculation with a clear statement,” Hans Michelbach, deputy leader of the conservative CSU party in Germany’s lower house of parliament, told Reuters. Michelbach called on Scholz to clarify the government’s role, saying there was no compelling need for such a tie-up. “The benefits of a merger are limited. At the same time, the risks are high,” he said. Instead of talking about a merger, both banks should focus on their current challenges and pursue their own growth opportunities separately, he added. Michelbach said the creation of a banking giant could also harm Germany’s competitiveness. Florian Toncar, senior opposition lawmaker from the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), accused the government of promoting the merger by giving a kind of state guarantee for the merged institution. “Those who do that have not learned anything from the financial crisis,” Toncar told Reuters. Those that want to strengthen Germany as a finance center should not interfere in corporate structures, but improve business conditions for all. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a senior conservative and Merkel confidant, last month presented a new industrial strategy where he called for the creation and protection of national champions, mentioning Deutsche Bank among other companies. Scholz and other senior officials have repeatedly stressed that the government wants a reliable national banking champion to support its export-led economy. Earlier on Wednesday, Finance Ministry official Christine Lambrecht told members of the Bundestag’s Finance Committee that the government was not pushing for a merger of the banks, according to parliamentary sources. Lambrecht rejected the accusation that Berlin was interfering in a private-sector matter, one participant at the Finance Committee meeting told Reuters. Lambrecht also said the government’s 15-percent-stake in Commerzbank alone was not enough to push through a merger, even if Berlin wanted such a scenario, the source added."
-22.859849258938038," Explainer: Why Germany wants a merger to underpin Deutsche Bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government has pressured Deutsche Bank into merger talks with state-backed Commerzbank amid concerns for the health of the country’s flagship bank, according to officials familiar with the matter. Deutsche, the largest bank in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, emerged unscathed from the financial crash but later lost its footing. In 2016, the International Monetary Fund called the bank the world’s biggest potential risk among peers to the financial system because of its links to other banks. German officials fear that a recession or big fine, for example, could derail the bank’s fragile recovery. Berlin wants a reliable national banking champion to support its export-led economy, known for cars and machine tools. Deutsche and other European banks have taken longer to recover from the financial crisis, losing ground to stronger rivals from the United States. Other than Deutsche, Commerzbank is Germany’s only remaining big bank, after a series of mergers. The government holds a 15 percent stake after bailing it out during the crisis, giving it an important voice. Commerzbank, like Deutsche, has struggled to rebound, and German officials say it is vulnerable to a foreign takeover. If an international rival snapped it up, that would increase competition for Deutsche on its home turf. Berlin also wants to keep Commerzbank’s specialty - the funding of medium-sized companies, the backbone of the economy - in German hands. The merged bank would have roughly 1.8 trillion euros in assets, such as loans and investments, and a market value of about 25 billion euros ($28 billion). It would have one fifth of the German retail banking market. Together, Deutsche and Commerzbank operate 2,500 branches in Germany and employ 140,000 people worldwide. A merger puts at least 10,000 jobs at risk, according to unions. Proponents of a merger include the German government and U.S. investor Cerberus, which is a shareholder in both banks. Opponents include some other shareholders in Deutsche Bank and labor unions. Deutsche’s chief executive officer Christian Sewing would prefer to have more time to stabilize the bank before taking on a merger, people familiar with the matter have said. In February, Deutsche’s management board gave Sewing the go-ahead for exploratory talks with Commerzbank, a person with knowledge of the matter said. There have been contacts among a small circle of executives. Talks could end without a deal, the person said. With the talks now out in the open, and Berlin still pushing for a deal, the companies are under pressure to figure out the mechanics of a fusion and decide whether or not it is workable. That decision is seen within weeks. One of the biggest risks is how to fill what one German official has told Reuters will be a multi-billion-euro financial hole because a merger could trigger an adjustment to the valuation of some bank investments. Commerzbank, for example, has about 30.8 billion euros of debt securities such as Italian bonds that now have a value of 27.7 billion euros - a drop of 3.1 billion euros. A tie-up could crystallize this loss. Deutsche has such securities at market value in its accounts. The deal would make the German government a shareholder in the country’s largest bank and executives would want to curb its influence. The two banks could also get bogged down with restructuring, such as integrating different technology systems, losing ground to rivals. OTHER THAN A MERGER, ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS FOR DEUTSCHE BANK? German officials have held exploratory talks about merging Deutsche and UBS but there was little interest in Switzerland, people familiar with the matter have said. These officials believe that sticking with Deutsche’s current course of cutting back costs and scaling back high-risk banking offers scant hope of a turnaround. The continued pressure from Berlin makes it harder for Deutsche to go it alone. Merging with a state-owned lender, in the officials’ view, offers a safe harbor. If talks do unravel, however, Deutsche could respond to pressure from some investors to make further cuts to the investment bank, especially in the United States. Deutsche has long been unpopular with ordinary Germans because it was seen by many as a symbol of capitalist excess. Its image has been tarnished by numerous lawsuits and billions of dollars in fines. These included alleged “conspiracy” to rig the price of financial market bets and sham trades between Moscow and London that moved money from Russia abroad. In its latest financial report, Deutsche has set aside 1.2 billion euros for litigation. That is a fraction of earlier years but nonetheless more than three times its 2018 profit. The bank has dealt with the bulk of legal action going back to the economic crash, and has improved its finances. Announcing the first profit since 2014 last year, CEO Sewing said the group was “on the right track”. But German officials were not convinced and continued to push for talks with Commerzbank. He has now bowed to that pressure."

The union also said in a statement to Reuters that Deutsche’s problem investment bank, would not be helped by a tie-up with Commerzbank. A merger would put at least 10,000 jobs at risk, it added. “We reject a merger,” said Jan Duscheck, head of Verdi’s banking division. It wouldn’t create a truly big bank in the European market, and the new entity would be “considerably more attractive for a hostile takeover, for example, by France,” he said. “The merger would not result in a ‘national champion’,” he added. The union’s reaction follows news over the weekend that Deutsche Bank’s chief executive Christian Sewing had agreed to hold tentative talks with rival Commerzbank. Berlin, which has been worried about Deutsche’s health, has pushed for a merger as Deutsche has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. On Monday, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz confirmed that the banks were exploring a possible merger after weeks of media speculation. Both banks declined to comment. Verdi is among Germany’s largest unions, representing 2 million workers across a range of industries. The union is calling for a 6 percent wage increase for 200,000 workers that it represents in state and publicly-listed banks. The union has two seats on Deutsche’s supervisory board and two seats on Commerzbank’s board. Duscheck sits on Deutsche’s board. Verdi had already flagged its opposition to a possible merger. Some major shareholders are also worried about a tie-up, doubting that such a combination would guarantee higher returns, people familiar with the matter said. Otto Fricke, a member of German parliament and the business-friendly FDP party, on Tuesday criticized Scholz for feeding merger speculation and increasing pressure on the two banks unnecessarily. Fricke, speaking to Reuters, said the decision should be left “to the companies as it should be in a social market economy.” Shares of both banks rose sharply on Monday but lost ground on Tuesday, with Deutsche down 2.6 percent and Commerzbank 2.5 percent by early afternoon."

-22.140324552145117," Germany confirms Deutsche-Commerzbank merger talks, some investors wary BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Monday confirmed that the country’s two largest publicly listed banks - Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank - were exploring a possible merger. “There are talks about the situation, how it is,” Scholz told reporters when asked about media reports of merger talks. Reuters and other news organizations, citing unnamed sources, reported at the weekend that Deutsche Bank’s chief executive Christian Sewing had agreed to hold tentative talks with rival Commerzbank. Berlin, which has been worried about Deutsche’s health, has pushed for a merger. Deutsche Bank has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. But two top shareholders in Deutsche Bank are skeptical about a merger, doubting that such a combination would guarantee higher returns, people familiar with the matter said. And a German banking union also said it would strongly oppose any merger that resulted in large job cuts. Those in favor of a merger say a tie-up would create a bank with an equity market value of more than 25.6 billion euros ($28.78 billion), based on Monday’s closing share prices, and a 20 percent share of the German retail banking market. But two of Deutsche’s top shareholders are not convinced. A merger would cost time and money, and it would in no way guarantee better returns, a person close to a top-10 Deutsche Bank shareholder said on Monday. “We’re still against such a merger and in principle don’t consider it a good idea,” the person said. Before a decision is made on any merger, Deutsche must present a comprehensive plan for the future of the combined entity, a person familiar with the thinking of another top-10 investor said on Sunday. “We continue to be skeptical that a merger would make sense,” this person said. Deutsche and Commerzbank declined to comment on Monday. The two banks will make a decision about whether to pursue a merger within weeks, a separate source has said. The views of the two major investors contrast with those of U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both banks. A person familiar with the matter said last month that Cerberus was open to a merger, increasing the chances of a tie-up. The prospect of a merger is also facing resistance from labor unions because of expectations it could lead to job cuts. The DBV union will use all its resources to combat any merger that would lead to large job losses, a spokesman said, confirming comments originally reported in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Shares in Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank rose sharply on Monday as German business warmed to the prospect of a deal. Deutsche Bank shares closed up 5 percent, while Commerzbank shares ended 7.2 percent higher, outperforming Germany’s blue-chip DAX index, which rose 0.75 percent. Berlin based BGA, the Federation of German wholesale, foreign trade and services, which represents large and mid-sized export businesses said a merger could make sense if it resulted in one German player surviving in the longer run. Tougher rules and low interest rates have made it more difficult to find banks willing to provide German companies with export finance. “It is getting harder for companies to find a partner who can provide funding,” BGA President Holger Bingmann said. “The business model of banks has come under pressure, and we would be glad if in the long run, to have at least one global player as a partner for our international business.”"

Deutsche Bank’s management board has agreed to hold talks with Commerzbank about the feasibility of a merger. The state owns a 15 percent stake of Commerzbank and is expected to be a shareholder in the new group.

They would be revalued at a market price which is typically lower than the one registered on the accounts. A second source, who is familiar with the talks, said they also expected a shortfall after the potential merger. Rating agency Moody’s has said that a takeover could result in a “downward valuation adjustment for parts of Commerzbank’s asset base”. A second German official said Deutsche’s future was in question because high costs left it with little profit. Asked about a merger between the two banks, a third official said one was urgently needed to reduce the number of branches in an overcrowded market. Both said a buoyant jobs market in Germany made it easier to make staff cuts without prompting large protests because those employees would be easily able to find other work. Spokespeople for both banks, the German finance ministry and the economy ministry declined to comment for this story. Deutsche Bank has said it is stable. Last month, as it announced a return to profit in 2018, its chief executive Christian Sewing said it was “on the right track” for growth and lower costs. The banks will make a decision about whether to pursue a merger within weeks, a fifth source said. “In 2016 ... Deutsche went to the brink,” said the first official. “They haven’t really got out of that hole...It’s legitimate to ask:... how dangerous is that with systematic relevance?” While having the government of Europe’s largest economy as a shareholder would give the group some weight, it would also be humbling for Deutsche Bank, once a symbol of German strength on Wall Street and London. Its share price has tumbled after a string of scandals and fines including a $7 billion plus penalty in 2016 for selling U.S. home loans that unravelled in the financial crash. A key measure of its default risk, a form of insurance known as credit default swaps, has risen. Deutsche’s significance was underscored by the International Monetary Fund in 2016 when it said the bank’s links to the world’s largest lenders made it a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Berlin has been examining options for Deutsche for many months. Senior German officials even participated in informal, exploratory discussions in recent months with Switzerland’s UBS about a merger with Deutsche, two more sources said. But there was little appetite in Switzerland for making UBS bigger or for merging with a weaker Deutsche, so German officials reverted to Commerzbank, those people said. A UBS spokesman declined to comment. The sources said it was not clear how any shortfall would be filled or even what size it would be. The first source said that capital shortfall would be in the order of billions of euros although he noted that some people said there would be no need for fresh capital. The new group could get financial support from a new fund that will be set up to support strategic industries in the face of competition from China. German officials have identified Deutsche Bank as a national “champion” and the fund is expected to provide state backing or guarantees that would help companies raise cash from pension funds or insurers. “I would get in private capital,” said a fourth German official. “An international bank is strategic.” It is not clear how big the fund will be. Officials also see the potential merger as a way to protect Commerzbank from being snapped up by a foreign rival, which could make Deutsche’s problems worse. Some experts are sceptical, however.

-18.87448175040846," Deutsche, Commerzbank tentatively talk about merger after months of speculation: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The management board of Deutsche Bank has agreed to hold talks with rival Commerzbank on the feasibility of a merger, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Saturday. First unofficial contacts took place within a very small group and the mandate from Deutsche’s board was given more than a week ago, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Talks were at a very early stage and could fall apart, the person added, confirming information reported earlier by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank and a spokeswoman for Commerzbank both declined to comment. Speculation about a possible merger between Germany’s two largest listed lenders has been rife for months, heightening under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has emphasized the importance of strong banks. Proponents of a merger say that a tie-up would give a combined entity -- which would have an equity market value of more than 24 billion euros ($27 billion) based on Friday’s closing share prices -- a 20 percent share of the German retail banking market. That would allow it to potentially charge higher prices in a country where banking services have been free or low cost. Welt am Sonntag reported that both banks were reacting to pressure from the government, which expects a decision on the merger in the coming weeks. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the report. The two lenders, which flirted with a merger in 2016 before focusing on restructuring, have struggled to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis. The government holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout and Deutsche Bank’s shares have fallen 73 percent over the past five years. Founded in 1870 to help companies with overseas trade, Deutsche is currently regarded as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, having expanded rapidly in the 1990s to become an investment banking giant. However, its market share has dwindled since the financial crisis and it has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests and money laundering scandals. Its chief executive, Christian Sewing, has said publicly in recent months he was focused on restoring profitability before taking on a complicated merger project. Sewing is expected to report back to the board before the bank takes further steps, the source said. Commerzbank’s chief, Martin Zielke, has been more open to the idea of a tie-up, a person with knowledge of his thinking said. Last month, he said speculation about a merger was “understandable”. A person familiar with the matter said in February that U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, was open to a merger, increasing the chances of a tie-up. However, some of Deutsche Bank’s other key shareholders are opposed, stressing the need for patience to allow the bank to regain its footing. Ratings agencies, which have cut Deutsche Bank’s credit ratings to the lowest among its major competitors, have warned that a merger would be risky and difficult to execute. Labor unions have also voiced opposition fearing large job losses. German officials have been worried about Deutsche since 2016 when the bank was negotiating a hefty fine with the U.S. Department of Justice for its role in the mortgage crisis. At the time, Deutsche and the government publicly played down speculation that it could need state support. Behind the scenes, however, tensions were running high. Over the past year, Deutsche has undergone an abrupt management change that installed Sewing as CEO. The bank has trimmed its international operations to focus more on retail banking and its home market. Negative headlines about the lender have, however, continued. In November, police searched the offices of all the members of Deutsche Bank’s board as part of an investigation into money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers. Deutsche said in January that it had received requests for information from regulators and law enforcement agencies that are investigating a money laundering scheme involving Danske Bank. In the U.S., Congress is also investigating money laundering allegations and the bank’s connections to the U.S. president, who owes the bank at least $130 million dollars. Deutsche Bank has more than 20 million personal and business customers and Commerzbank around 18 million."

Deutsche is regarded as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, but has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests, and money laundering scandals. Its chief executive, Christian Sewing, has said publicly in recent months he was focused on restoring profitability before taking on a complicated merger project. Commerzbank’s chief, Martin Zielke, has been more open to the idea of a tie-up, a person with knowledge of his thinking said. Last month, he said speculation about a merger was “understandable”. The two banks flirted with a merger in 2016 but talks fizzled out after both banks decided to focus on restructuring. Last month, a person familiar with the matter said that U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, was open to a merger, increasing chances of a tie-up. Deutsche Bank has more than 20 million personal and business customers, and Commerzbank around 18 million. Based on Friday’s closing prices, a combination of the two banks would have an equity market value of more than 24 billion euros ($27 billion)."

Deutsche Bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 13.55 percent at the end of 2018. “The increase is entirely attributable to the final step of the four-year phase-in of the capital conservation buffer and the G-SIB (global systemically important banks) buffer which became fully effective on 1 January 2019,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement. The capital requirements also determine restrictions on distributions in the form of dividends, variable remuneration and coupon payments to holders of additional tier 1 instruments."

-21.608180264557884," Investor Cerberus open to Deutsche Bank merger with Commerzbank: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. investor Cerberus, a major shareholder in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, is open to a merger between Germany’s two biggest lenders, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, raising the chances of a tie-up. Speculation of a merger has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. Both banks have been slow to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis. “Cerberus wouldn’t stand in the way of a merger,” said the person familiar with the thinking of the U.S. buyout firm. Cerberus holds 3 percent of Deutsche Bank shares and 5 percent of Commerzbank shares, and was previously opposed to a merger, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday. The buyout firm believes there is still room in Germany for two big banks but that it is an open question whether both can turn around their businesses on their own, the person said. Cerberus hasn’t yet decided on the need for a merger, the person added. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. Cerberus representatives in New York didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment outside of normal business hours. Based on Tuesday’s closing prices, a combination of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would have an equity market value of almost 25 billion euros ($28 billion). Deutsche Bank has more than 20 million personal and business customers, and Commerzbank around 18 million. Cerberus is among the largest shareholders in both banks after buying stakes in 2017. Since its purchase, shares in Deutsche Bank have fallen 51 percent, while those of Commerzbank have lost 39 percent of their value. Early afternoon in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank shares were flat, while Commerzbank was up 1.2 percent. Cerberus is the second-largest investor in Commerzbank after the German government, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent after a state bailout. Finance Minister Scholz’s team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and major shareholders, including Cerberus. A merger between the two banks has appeared more likely since last month when two people with the knowledge of the matter said time was running out for Deutsche Bank to turn itself around on its own. But some major shareholders see no need for a deal. “We do think there’s merit in patience,” a person familiar with the thinking of one top-10 Deutsche Bank shareholder said on Wednesday. “We are not in the camp of people that say both Commerzbank and Deutsche wouldn’t be able to survive on their own.” Both banks are in the process of restructuring, and executives at both lenders say privately they would prefer to remain independent to carry out those plans. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who took the helm last year in a sudden management shake-up, has repeatedly said in public that he is focused on the bank’s “homework” - returning the bank to profitability. He announced job cuts last year and moved to slim down the sprawling investment bank division. The bank posted a profit in 2018 for the first time in four years. Deutsche Bank’s biggest shortcoming is its weakness in its home market, which is different from a Barclays in Britain or a Bank of America in the United States, said Fitch analyst Christian Scarafia. But a merger with Commerzbank wouldn’t necessarily solve Deutsche Bank’s problems. “Any merger of that size would probably give rise to quite a bit of execution risk in the integration,” Scarafia said."

That marks a reduction from 7.64 percent of voting rights reported in the most recent filing in Germany. HNA, even with the reduced holding, would remain one of the largest shareholders in Germany’s largest lender. Spokesmen for HNA in Germany and Deutche Bank declined to comment. The SEC filing was published on Feb. 15 but the date of the reduction was Feb. 12. HNA initially bought into Deutsche Bank in early 2017, amassing a stake of close to 10 percent. But it has since trimmed its stake in installments. High debts at the conglomerate have fueled speculation about the future of its Deutsche stake as it reduces or exits some of its other holdings. The fund C-Quadrat manages the stake on behalf of HNA, which has voting rights in Deutsche through a mix of ordinary shares and financial instruments. HNA’s interests in the bank are represented through a member sitting on Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board. Other major shareholders include the royal family of Qatar, BlackRock, and Cerberus."

Deutsche Bank acted as a correspondent bank for Danske Bank in Estonia, meaning it helped transfer funds on behalf of the Danish lender from Estonia to places like New York. Bafin said on Friday it had ordered Deutsche Bank to review its group-wide risk management processes in the area of correspondent banking and to adjust them where necessary. In order to monitor the implementation of this measure, Bafin said in a statement it had widened the mandate of the special representative appointed in September 2018. Germany’s biggest bank said that there were no indications of misconduct on its part. It has received requests for information from regulators and law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, investigating Danske Bank. Denmark’s largest bank is under investigation over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($225 billion) from 2007 until 2015 from its Estonia branch. Deutsche Bank has scaled back its correspondent banking business by around 40 percent since 2016. In Russia it cut such activity by around 75 percent since 2016, while it has exited such business in Moldova, Estonia and Latvia. Board member Karl von Rohr said last week that it had so far not made any provisions for possible Danske-related legal costs.

-7.913671872903494," Deutsche CEO faces investor pressure on investment bank: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said it has done enough to get its investment bank back on track as Chief Executive Christian Sewing came under renewed pressure from top investors. “We completed our adjustments ahead of schedule and now have a good foundation for growth,” the bank said in an emailed statement on Thursday. One major investor wants Sewing, who is less than a year in office, to act more quickly to turn around its investment bank, a person familiar with its thinking told Reuters. A second top investor thinks that the U.S. investment banking business is still too big and contributes too little to Germany’s biggest lender, another person said. “We have adjusted our footprint in our Corporate & Investment Bank and in the U.S. already in 2018, including reducing our leverage exposure by more than 100 billion euros,” the bank said, after a Financial Times report on the demands. Sewing last year trimmed the investment bank, mainly affecting the equities division and the business that serves hedge funds in New York and London. However, the Financial Times reported that four of the bank’s 10 biggest shareholders want the lender to make further cuts at its investment division, particularly the United States. The FT report, citing unidentified sources, said at least four members of Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board shared the view. Neither of the people familiar with the thinking of the two major investors elaborated on the specific changes they want. Shareholders were split into three camps, the person familiar with the thinking of the second investor told Reuters. “There are those who are calling for a merger with Commerzbank, others who would prefer to split up the bank and another that wants a managed downsizing, which would include a shrinking of the U.S. investment bank,” the person said. Weak earnings among Germany’s largest banks have heightened speculation that the German government may engineer a merger of the country’s two biggest lenders. For Deutsche Bank, a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter and weakness at its investment bank overshadowed news earlier this month of its first annual profit in four years. Revenue at the investment bank dropped 5 percent in the fourth quarter."

-5.408649260936297," Democrat Schiff questions if Mueller probing Trump-Deutsche Bank link WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee said on Sunday he was concerned that Special Counsel Robert Mueller may not be investigating President Donald Trump’s ties to Deutsche Bank AG. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff announced last week a wide investigation into attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election as well as Trump’s financial dealings, including “credible reports of money laundering and financial compromise” related to Trump business interests. Deutsche Bank has lent the Trump Organization hundreds of millions of dollars for real estate ventures and is one of the few major lenders that has given large amounts of credit to Trump after a string of bankruptcies at his hotel and casino businesses during the 1990s. Schiff told NBC’s “Meet the Press” he was concerned about whether Mueller had been held back from investigating Trump’s finances. Schiff cited reports that Trump threatened to fire Mueller in 2017 after reports he was trying to get records from Deutsche Bank but backed down after his lawyers received the assurances from Mueller. “If the special counsel hasn’t subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, he can’t be doing much of a money-laundering investigation,” Schiff said. “So that’s what concerns me, that that red line has been enforced, whether by the deputy attorney general or by some other party at the Justice Department. But that leaves the country exposed,” Schiff said. The special counsel’s office declined comment and Deutsche Bank did not immediately return requests for comment on Schiff’s statements. Trump has denied any cooperation by his campaign with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. Last week, he dismissed Schiff as not having any authority to review his business dealings. The bank, one of the world’s largest financial institutions, was ensnared in a massive Russian money-laundering investigation and was fined heavily by both U.S. and U.K. regulators in 2017 for practices involving Russian accounts."
-3.9072037252064007," Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank merger talk 'speculation': German finance minister LONDON (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Friday he was in talks with banks about their future and called reports of a merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank “speculation”. Media reports have said Germany would want a merger of its two main banks to go through before European Parliament elections in May. Scholz said he couldn’t imagine what the elections have to do with the banking sector and was speculation that he could not understand. “The truth is we are discussing the situation of the financial industry in Germany, it’s the task of our government,” Scholz told a Bloomberg event in London. “We are discussing about clearing, we discuss about the development of the banking sector. We are debating whether the different banks, about their situation, for being able to do the necessary things when something needs to be done.” “Today is not a situation where it’s necessary to report anything,” Scholz said. There was “no debate” about a setting up a bad bank to hold souring loans of lenders. Deutsche is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. But Deutsche has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests, and money laundering scandals. Commerzbank is still partially held by government after a bailout. “There are two banks, they are doing anything to get enough profits. We are discussing with them about the situation of the banking industry in Germany,” Scholz said. A stable banking system is needed to underpin German companies who want to go abroad to export, he said. It was important to have both international and national banks operating in Germany to serve the economy. “It’s important to have a strong banking sector to do what national champions are doing and able to do.” WirtschaftsWoche magazine cited an unnamed source on Friday saying Berlin and Brussels would decide on a potential merger between before the next EU elections in May. WirtschaftsWoche said Germany and the EU needed to coordinate on the matter because a potential merger could entail action by the German state which could be seen as state aid. Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, but has so far not agreed a divorce settlement with the bloc to ensure a smooth and orderly departure. Scholz said nobody would have expected that it would still be unclear what sort of Brexit deal there will be just two months before Britain is due to leave the bloc. “In the end we have to find a solution,” Scholz said. Many of the banks that use London as their EU hub have opened or expanded units in Frankfurt, Paris and elsewhere to avoid disruption from any hard Brexit or limited access to the single market in future. “It’s obvious there will be a lot of business that moves to the EU,” Scholz said of the financial services sector, adding that Germany was prepared for a no-deal Brexit. “Looking at the financial sector, I am absolutely sure that we will be able to manage all the questions related to that,” Scholz said. “There will be a different landscape ... There will still be business in London and it’s necessary that we cooperate. We are a prepared for a hard Brexit.”"

A stable banking system is needed to underpin German companies who want to go abroad to export, he said. It was important to have both international and national banks operating in Germany to serve the economy. “It’s important to have a strong banking sector to do what national champions are doing and able to do.”"
-3.9072037252064007," Political decision on Deutsche-Commerzbank merger should be made by May: magazine BERLIN (Reuters) - Berlin and Brussels will decide on a potential merger between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank before the next European Union elections in May, WirtschaftsWoche magazine reported on Friday, citing an unnamed source. “If there will be no decision by then, the subject will be over,” the source told the German magazine, adding that after the European elections, politicians in Brussels and Berlin would be tied up with internal processes, hindering decision making. WirtschaftsWoche said Germany and the EU needed to coordinate on the matter because a potential merger could entail action by the German state which could be seen as state aid. In an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday, German Finance Minster Olaf Scholz reiterated that Germany needed a home-grown banking champion to accompany German companies on global markets. “We . . . need German banks that can develop the ability, competence and strength to accompany globally active German companies on global markets,” the paper quoted him as saying."

Ladhabhoy, a managing director, will be based at Barclays’ Menlo Park, California office and will start in the spring. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. He will report to Laurence Braham and Greg Dalvito, co-heads of Technology Banking. Brian Yick is the other co-head of the Internet group. Barclays is adding to its internet banking division, as this year is expected to be a record breaking one for Internet IPOs. Reuters has reported that ride sharing companies Uber and Lyft have filed confidentially for offerings, while Pinterest has also hired banks for an IPO. Barclays last year hired another banker from Deustche Bank, Ed Wehle to focus on technology services deals. It also brought on Mark Zanoli in January, formerly of UBS Group AG, as vice chairman of technology investment banking. Barclays has been active on numerous large deals in the technology space recently, including KLA-Tencor Corp’s $3.4 billion acquisition of Orbotech Ltd, II-VI Inc’s $3.2 purchase of Finisar Corp, and Cisco Systems Inc’s $2.35 billion buyout of Duo Security."
-6.459315325620368," UPDATE 1-U.S. Democrats renew call for Deutsche Bank Senate committee inquiry (Adds details, background) FRANKFURT, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. Senators renewed their calls on Thursday for the Senate banking committee to investigate allegations of money laundering involving Deutsche Bank. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Elizabeth Warren made the request in a letter to Mike Crapo, chairman of the banking committee, asking for a “thorough, detailed bipartisan Committee investigation into Deutsche Bank’s compliance history”. Deutsche Bank said that it wanted to underline that it was “cooperative in all official investigations”, without making further comment or giving any other details. Van Hollen told Reuters he was concerned about “a pattern and practice” in money laundering allegations involving the German bank, adding that “there is a lot of smoke circling around Deutsche Bank, so we think it is worth further inquiry”. Germany’s largest bank has faced renewed allegations involving money laundering in recent months, but has said it has found no evidence of wrongdoing. “We take these matters very seriously and will investigate all indications of possible misconduct,” Deutsche Bank’s Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said on Wednesday. Van Hollen and Warren, who has announced her candidacy for president, last year made a similar call on the Republican-controlled Senate committee. Two House committees have since begun a similar inquiry, while a European Parliament committee this week held a hearing on Deutsche Bank’s anti-money laundering practices. Van Hollen said he saw signs of bipartisan support for further investigation after a senior Republican member of the House financial services committee wrote to Deutsche Bank’s chief executive to address his concerns. Van Hollen said that he and Warren were also interested in Deutsche Bank’s connection to President Donald Trump, “but that is just one piece of a broader concern,” he said. The White House was not immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours, but Trump on Thursday said on Twitter: “The Dems and their committees are going ‘nuts’.” Deutsche Bank has loaned money to the U.S. President for his real estate empire and a 2018 financial disclosure form showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of the German bank. These are for properties including the Trump International Hotel in a former post office in Washington. In another inquiry, Deutsche Bank has said it acted as a correspondent bank in Estonia for Danske Bank, which is under investigation for suspicious payments totalling 200 billion euros from 2007 until 2015. And in November, German police searched the offices of all the members of Deutsche Bank’s board as part of a two-day raid and investigation into money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers. In 2017, regulators fined Deutsche Bank nearly $700 million for weak controls that allowed money laundering from Russia. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation is still ongoing.

Deutsche Bank’s global correspondent banking portfolio is now around 40 percent smaller than it was in 2016, Stephan Wilken, its head of anti-financial crime and anti-money laundering said. Wilken told a committee of the European Parliament that Deutsche Bank’s portfolio of correspondent banking customers it deems as high risk is around 60 percent smaller than it was in 2016. Danske Bank is under investigation over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) from 2007 until 2015 from its Estonia branch.

-6.590911980985611," Boosting profitability is biggest challenge for Deutsche Bank: S&P FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s left its ratings on Deutsche Bank unchanged on Monday but said that raising its profitability is the biggest hurdle for Germany’s largest lender. Deutsche Bank’s ratings have been under pressure from major agencies such as S&P as the bank restructures under new Chief Executive Christian Sewing who took charge last April. The bank’s earnings for the fourth quarter, announced on Friday, “confirm our view that management’s biggest challenge is to improve profitability and bolster the bank’s customer franchise”, S&P said in a statement. Deutsche posted a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter and showed weakness at its investment bank, overshadowing a first annual profit in four years. S&P, which rates Deutsche Bank’s long-term credit at BBB+ after cutting it last year from A-, said that the bank’s litigation and regulatory risks had lessened considerably. “But the ongoing drip of cases and adverse news flow continues to undermine management’s efforts to improve stability,” it said. Executives have said that negative headlines about police raids on the bank in November dented business. The bank has vowed to do everything it can to make sure global agencies don’t further cut ratings. “We do view it as a critical objective of ourselves to be on an improving trajectory,” Deutsche’s Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told fixed-income investors on a call on Monday. Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially crucial for a bank such as Deutsche, whose perceived health is important in winning business. Moody’s, another rating agency, said on Friday that Deutsche’s earnings were in line with expectations but that the bank’s ability to rebuild and stabilize revenue in the coming quarters “will be paramount to the long-term success of its restructuring plan” and remains a work in progress. For its part, Fitch said its negative outlook for Deutsche “reflects our view that it continues to face challenges in reaching its strategic targets in 2019, in particular with respect to improving its profitability.”"

-6.590911980985611," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank reprieve is only temporary LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deutsche Bank is not dying, judging by its 2018 results. But nor is the lender rising from the sick bed anytime soon. Its first net profit in four years is a welcome tonic for long-suffering shareholders. Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s planned cost cuts will, however, have to be supplemented by revenue growth if the bank is to meet a meagre 4 percent return on tangible equity target this year. That is less than half the objective of around 10 percent that former boss John Cryan had targeted by 2018. The abyss into which investors’ expectations have since plunged is clearly shown by the mere 1 percent drop seen in shares on Friday after Deutsche delivered less than one-tenth of that. Still, CEO Sewing deserves credit for hitting, rather than simply committing to, an underlying target cost base of 23 billion euros. A surprise additional 200 million euros in savings gave him enough confidence to pledge a cost base of 21.8 billion euros by the end of 2019 rather than the 22 billion euros originally envisaged. Significantly, annual expenses fell faster than revenue – by a single percentage point – a feat which eluded his predecessors. That helped pre-tax profit climb 8 percent from a year earlier to 1.3 billion euros and spared investors a fifth consecutive annual net loss. But Sewing can’t slice his way to greatness. Even if he hits his cost target, revenue will have to rise by around 2 percent from a year earlier if Deutsche is to meet its low-ball 4 percent ROTE 2019 aim, according to Breakingviews calculations which assume flat loan losses, a 35 percent tax rate and a tangible book value of 54 billion euros. But growing the top line may not be easy if investment banking revenue, which accounts for nearly two-fifths of Deutsche’s total, continues its steady decline. Trading revenue at the lender’s fixed-income franchise fell by 23 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the previous year, underperforming US peers. Optimists might argue that shares trading at a bombed-out 70 percent discount to tangible book value represent a buying opportunity. But Deutsche failed to grow revenue for the third consecutive year in 2018. Sewing may have stemmed the bleeding but that doesn’t mean Deutsche is leaving the recovery ward anytime soon."

Bloomberg, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter, said the timing and size of the investment was unclear. The investment would likely come through Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund, the report said. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

-7.909612572763297," Weak quarter mars Deutsche Bank's return to the black FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter and weakness at its investment bank overshadowed the first annual profit in four years for Deutsche Bank. Germany’s largest lender has been trying to turn itself around under a new leadership, but has faced a series of hurdles, including allegations of money laundering, ratings downgrades and failed stress tests. Deutsche has also become the subject of rampant merger speculation, and Friday’s earnings figures underscore that the company still has a long way ahead to post a sustainable profit. Time is running out for the bank to turn around on its own, making a merger with rival Commerzbank more likely, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Results were a mixed bag, with Deutsche posting a full-year profit of 341 million euros ($390 million), compared with a net loss of 735 million euros in 2017. “Our return to profitability shows that Deutsche Bank is on the right track,” said Chief Executive Christian Sewing, who took over last April and has embarked on plans to cut more than 7,000 jobs in an overhaul of the bank. “In 2019, we aim not only to save costs but also to make focused investments in growth,” he said. Sewing, in an interview with Reuters TV, said he was optimistic that profit would grow in 2019. But it was not all good news. On the downside, the fourth-quarter net loss of 409 million euros was greater than the 268 million euros expected on average by analysts, according to a consensus report on the bank’s website. The quarter was marked by continued weakness in its key trading business. Revenue at its cash-cow bond-trading division plunged 23 percent. For the investment bank as a whole, revenue dropped 5 percent in the fourth quarter. Executives said that negative headlines about police raids on the bank in November dented business. “The weakness in investment banking is striking,” said Alexandra Annecke, fund manager with Union Investment, which holds the bank’s stock. “It needs to finally be possible to stop the loss of market share,” she said. Analysts at Citigroup said they feared that Deutsche’s investment bank would continue to lose ground to competitors. A downgrade in market expectations for future earnings is possible, they added. The bank’s shares lost more than half their value in 2018, though they have recovered slightly over the past month. They opened slightly higher early in Frankfurt but were down 3.1 percent by 1200 GMT. Sewing, in a call with analysts when asked about merger speculation, said that the bank was focused on executing its plan and that he had a “lot of confidence”. He later told journalists the bank was fully focused on its “homework” of turning around the bank. Sewing also denied there was any pressure from the German government to merge. “I do not feel that. And there is no intervention either,” he was quoted as saying by German broadcaster n-tv. Speculation of a merger between the two has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. His team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche, Commerzbank and major shareholders. Deutsche is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. But the German lender has been plagued by losses and a scandal. A $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market crisis was a major blow that spooked clients and concerned regulators. The European Central Bank has set conditions for a possible merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Friday, citing banking supervision sources. Both banks would need achieve sustainable profitability to be allowed to merge, according to sources cited in the report. Shareholders may need to inject further capital, it said.

-6.756773166928816," Time is running out for Deutsche Bank to turn around on its own: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Time is running out for Deutsche Bank to turn around on its own, making a merger with rival Commerzbank more likely, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Bank executives, analysts, government officials and some investors thought until some months ago that both banks had more time to turn around independently, but that opinion has recently changed, one of the people said. A major investor is awaiting market reaction to both banks’ earnings over the next couple of weeks before deciding on the need for a merger, said a second person close to the investor. “Then we will decide whether we will change our view,” the person said. The investor wouldn’t oppose a merger if the government wanted one, the person said. Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, and the German finance ministry declined to comment. Speculation of a merger between the two has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. His team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche, Commerzbank and major shareholders. Deutsche is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. But Deutsche has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests, and money laundering scandals. A $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market scandal was a major blow that spooked clients. A merger between Deutsche and a European bank was also an option but less likely because it would be harder to sell to politicians, said the first person with knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who assumed the helm last year in a sudden management shake-up, has repeatedly said in public that he was focused on the bank’s “homework” - returning the bank to profitability. He announced job cuts last year and moved to slim down the sprawling investment bank division. Earlier on Thursday, a separate source at Deutsche said the bank was focused on achieving sustainable profitability, seeking to distance the lender from talk of a merger with Commerzbank. The suggestion that such a merger is the only option for Deutsche is “completely false”, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Shares in both lenders tumbled on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that Deutsche was expecting a government-brokered merger with Commerzbank by mid-year if efforts to restructure the lender fall short of targets. Deutsche shares closed 4 percent lower, while Commerzbank - still partially held by the government after a bailout - was 6.7 percent weaker. On Friday, Deutsche Bank will report its 2018 results and analysts expect it to deliver its first annual profit since 2014. CEO Sewing is also likely to face further questions about a possible merger. A Deutsche supervisory board member said last week that there was no desire among board members for a merger with Commerzbank. Commerzbank reports earnings on Feb. 14. The Verdi German labor union has said a merger of the no. 1 and no. 2 banks would lead to large job cuts. Gildas Surry, a portfolio manager with Axiom, which holds Deutsche Bank bonds, said that merging the two banks would be like mixing oil with vinegar, with questionable cost and revenue synergies. But those hurdles may not be enough to sway governments pressing for banking consolidation. “It is very difficult for politicians to forgo their national champions,” he said."

The pound fell sharply overnight amid fresh concerns about the possibility of a “no-deal” after lawmakers voted against an amendment aimed at preventing a chaotic departure from the bloc. Last week, it hit its highest since October. In a note to clients following last night’s voting, Deutsche Bank strategist Oliver Harvey said now’s the time to lock in profits from the recent run-up. It is more likely the clock runs down to the March 29 deadline, with lawmakers forced into approving Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal under the threat of a crash no-deal Brexit, he said. “As well as increasing the risk of a crash Brexit by accident, it should not be positive for economic confidence which (...) is already deteriorating due to political uncertainty,” he said. “We consequently take profit from our short EUR/GBP recommendation from two weeks ago and turn neutral on sterling.”"

Merger speculation has heated up under Germany’s finance minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken out in favor of strong banks in Germany and whose team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche, Commerzbank and major shareholders. “There is currently no one on Deutsche Bank’s Supervisory Board who would want to merge with Commerzbank in the short term,” Bsirske told journalists in Berlin late on Thursday. Bsirske’s comments are the most vocal yet from a member of the board that would eventually have to sign off on any merger. Verdi fears massive job cuts would result if the two banks were to go ahead with a deal, following intense speculation of a possible tie-up between the two. The banks and the Finance Ministry declined to comment. A merger may make sense in a few years’ time but for now both banks have to focus on putting their own houses in order, Bsirske said, pointing to improving the investment bank, reducing complexity and enhancing infrastructure. Asked about the possibility of a cross-border merger of Deutsche Bank with a foreign financial firm, Bsirske said it would be a good thing if they complemented one another. But given Deutsche Bank’s low share price, the German bank would enter into any partnership as a minority partner. “And that’s certainly not the way to go at the moment,” he said. “The CEO of Deutsche Bank, whom I think is a very good person for the role, has left no doubt about that. And this position is widely shared,” Bsirske said. Asked if Scholz were pushing for a merger, Bsirske said he was pretty sure that the finance minister was holding talks to get an assessment of the situation. “But I am also pretty sure that he is not trying to exert undue influence over business rationale and priorities that are currently being set in the banks. That would be completely counterproductive,” he said."

Democrats now in control of the House had been working out which House panels would take the lead in investigating Trump’s business ties to Germany’s largest lender, lawmakers and aides familiar with the plans told Reuters last week. “The bank has received an inquiry from the House financial services and intelligence committees,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement. The committee leaders said in a joint statement Thursday that they were in talks with the bank and expect its cooperation in its inquiries. “The House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees are engaged in productive discussions with Deutsche Bank, and look forward to continued cooperation,” said Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Financial Services Committee Chairman Maxine Waters. Deutsche Bank said it is working with the two committees to “determine the best and most appropriate way of assisting them in their official oversight functions.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Since U.S. voters on Nov. 6 shifted majority control of the House from the Republicans to the Democrats, Democratic lawmakers have been promising to investigate the first two years of Trump’s administration and possible conflicts of interest presented by his hotel, golf course and other ventures. A 2018 financial disclosure form showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of the German bank. They are for properties including the Trump International Hotel in a former post office in Washington. The Financial Services Committee has the broadest power to look into Trump’s relationship with Deutsche. When the Republicans still controlled the House, Waters tried in 2017 to request documents from the bank on its dealings with Trump and his businesses, as well as information about potential Russian money laundering through the bank. The bank told Congress that privacy laws prevented it from handing over such information without a formal subpoena and committee Republicans ignored Waters’ request.

The statement came in response to a Bloomberg report that said the U.S. Federal Reserve was investigating Deutsche Bank’s role in the Danske scandal. Deutsche Bank said in a statement that there were no probes. “But we received several requests for information from regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world,” it said. The bank also said it continued to provide information to and cooperate with the investigating agencies. “It is not surprising at all that the investigating authorities and banks themselves have an interest in the Danske case and the lessons to be learned from it,” Deutsche Bank said. The Fed’s probe is at an early stage, Bloomberg said, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The U.S. central bank is investigating whether Deutsche Bank in New York properly monitored the transfer of funds it performed on behalf of Danske from its Estonia branch, the report added. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve declined to comment. Deutsche Chief Executive Christian Sewing said last week that the bank was investigating the Danske case internally and that it had no indication of any misconduct on the bank’s part. Danske is under investigation for suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($227 billion) from 2007 until 2015. Deutsche Bank has said it acted as a correspondent bank for Dankse Bank in Estonia. A Deutsche Bank executive director has said the German bank played only a secondary role as a correspondent bank to Danske, limiting what it needed to know about the people behind the transactions. In 2017, the Fed was among regulators that fined Deutsche Bank nearly $700 million for weak controls that allowed money laundering from Russia. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the case is still ongoing. In November, police searched the offices of all the members of Deutsche Bank’s board as part of a two-day raid and investigation into money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers. Deutsche Bank has said it had no indication of misconduct in this case. In September, German regulator BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and appointed accounting firm KPMG as a third party to assess progress. Deutsche shares recouped earlier losses to trade up 0.1 percent late afternoon in Frankfurt, roughly in line with Germany's DAX index .GDAXI, which was up 0.2 percent. ($1 = 0.8807 euros)"

Sewing said the bank had done nothing wrong and was cooperating with prosecutors. Asked in an interview with Die Zeit on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos about a possible tie-up with domestic rival Commerzbank, Sewing said: “I have a real task ahead of me, (to) bring back profit to Deutsche Bank. “That’s my main task, anything else is beyond what I am thinking about.”"

-1.1299462953937154," Venezuela gold holdings in Bank of England soar on Deutsche deal: sources CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s gold holdings in the Bank of England have jumped after it closed out a gold swap deal with Deutsche Bank, according to two sources, as Britain remains reluctant to release gold held for the troubled OPEC nation. The government of Nicolas Maduro has since last year been seeking to repatriate about $550 million in gold from the Bank of England on fears it could be caught up in international sanctions on the country. Its holdings at the bank more than doubled in December to 31 tonnes, or around $1.3 billion, after Venezuela returned funds it had borrowed from Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE through a financing arrangement that uses gold as collateral, known as a swap, one of the sources said. Under the deal struck with Deutsche Bank in 2015, Venezuela put up 17 tonnes of gold in exchange for a loan, according to one of the sources who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. The country’s gold holdings fell to 134 tonnes in November compared with 150 tonnes at the start of 2018, according to central bank statistics. This is in part because Venezuela last year started carrying out gold barter operations with Turkey to import food following U.S. sanctions that have made international banks reluctant to handle Venezuelan transactions. The motivation for paying back the funds from the Deutsche swap was not immediately evident. But redeeming the swap would give Venezuela more gold for barter operations with Turkey. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Venezuela’s Central Bank did not reply to an email seeking comment. The Bank of England said in a statement that it does not comment on customer relationships. “In all its operations, the Bank observes the highest standards of risk management and abides by all relevant legislation, including applicable financial sanctions,” the statement added. The Bank of England is facing political pressure from Venezuela’s opposition and from members of British parliament to not assist Maduro, whose just-begun second term has been widely described as illegitimate. Losing the gold would be a significant blow to the country’s finances by undermining Venezuela’s ability to obtain hard currency crucial to importing items ranging from food and medicine to auto parts and consumer electronics. But refusing to hand over the gold, which belongs to Venezuela’s central bank, could cause alarm among countries that store their own bullion in the Bank of England’s coffers. Maduro’s government is struggling under hyperinflation now approaching 2 million percent annually, and a broad economic collapse has fueled an exodus of some three million people since 2015. Opposition critics, including exiled leader Julio Borges, have argued that the gold should not be repatriated because it could be used to finance corruption. Calixto Ortega, president of Venezuela’s central bank, met with Bank of England officials in December to discuss repatriating the gold but was unable to convince them, according to sources familiar with the situation. Venezuela for decades stored gold that makes up its central bank reserves in foreign bank vaults, which is common among developing nations. The country’s late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, citing the need for Venezuela to have physical control of central bank assets, in 2011 repatriated around 160 tonnes of gold from banks in the United States and Europe to the central bank in Caracas. Maduro says his government is victim of an “economic war” led by the opposition and fueled by Washington’s sanctions. His critics blame the country’s struggles on a state-led economic model, stringent exchange controls and nationalization of private companies."

-3.938747000809289," Trump-Deutsche Bank links in sights of U.S. House investigators WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats now in control of the U.S. House of Representatives are working out which House panels will take the lead in investigating President Donald Trump’s business ties to Deutsche Bank, lawmakers and aides familiar with the plans told Reuters. As the new Democratic House of Representatives majority launches a range of investigations into the Republican president and his businesses, the Intelligence Committee and Financial Services Committee are poised to dig into his ties with Deutsche DBKGn.DE, one of the world's largest financial institutions. Democratic lawmakers’ aides are discussing how to divide up the investigative work among committees and prevent overlap on requesting documents, aides said. Since U.S. voters on Nov. 6 shifted majority control of the House from the Republicans to the Democrats, the party has been promising to probe the first two years of Trump’s administration and possible conflicts of interest presented by his hotel, golf course and other ventures, as well as Trump family members. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. The White House in the past has referred questions about Trump businesses to the Trump Organization. Officials at the Trump Organization could not immediately be reached for comment. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: “Deutsche Bank takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations. Our recent record of cooperating with such investigations has been widely recognized by regulators. We intend to keep working in this spirit.” The Financial Services Committee, chaired by Democrat Maxine Waters, has the broadest power to look into Trump’s relationship with Deutsche. When the Republicans still controlled the House, Waters tried in 2017 to request documents from the bank on its dealings with Trump and his businesses, as well as information about potential Russian money laundering through the bank. But the bank told Congress that privacy laws prevented it from handing over such information without a formal subpoena. Committee Republicans ignored Waters’ request. As chairwoman, Waters can now issue subpoenas herself. In recent weeks, Waters has been publicly quiet about her plans. In a speech on Monday on committee priorities, she made no mention of the bank. A Waters spokesman declined to comment. Democratic aides outside the committee said Waters plans to move quietly on the Deutsche inquiry. She cannot begin formally issuing subpoenas until after the committee holds its first business meeting, expected by the end of January. Deutsche has extended millions of dollars in credit to the Trump Organization, making the bank one of few willing to lend extensively to Trump in the past decade. A 2017 financial disclosure form showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. House Intelligence Committee Democrats also want to investigate Trump and his Deutsche links, said three congressional officials familiar with committee discussions. A Judiciary Committee spokesman said it has been consulted."

If the deal fails to pass the UK lower house, Chief Executive Christian Sewing said that he expected Brexit would be postponed by at least three months. Brexit was one of several risks to the global economy cited by Sewing at a New Year’s reception in Berlin, according to a transcript of his prepared remarks. A disorderly Brexit would push Britain into recession for at least two years, Sewing said. It would also shave a half percentage point off economic output for the remainder of the European Union. “The distortions would be too great for trade, financing conditions and investor confidence,” Sewing said."

The letter, written by a deputy finance minister to a member of Germany’s parliament in response to questions and dated Jan. 10., listed 23 meetings between the finance ministry and Deutsche Bank executives in the period May to December 2018. Subjects discussed in the meetings included “strategic options of the institutes and evaluations by the leadership of the finance ministry”, the letter said. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung first reported on the letter and the meetings between finance ministry officials and Deutsche Bank executives. There has been longstanding and widespread speculation that Berlin may try to engineer a merger of Germany's two biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank CBKG.DE. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has helped feed that speculation by stressing the need for a strong German banking sector, a shift in tone from his predecessor. The letter also responded to a request to evaluate a possible merger between Commerzbank CBKG.DE, which is 15 percent owned by the government, and other lenders. “The government is open to economically viable options,” the letter said, noting that operational and strategic questions were a matter for executives. Joerg Kukies, a deputy, represented the ministry at many of the meetings, while Deutsche Bank’s Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing represented the bank at six meetings. The bank’s chairman Paul Achleitner sat in on another six meetings, the meeting list revealed. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry had no immediate comment. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.

Germany’s largest lender has pledged to keep costs at 23 billion euros ($26.50 billion) in 2018 and reduce them to 22 billion euros in 2019. Analysts on the whole believe the bank will meet these targets, according to a consensus forecast published on the bank’s website, after missing its goals in past years. “We have our costs under control,” Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told a New Year’s reception. “We cut costs sustainably to such a degree in 2018 that we can confidently say: We are convinced that the times are over when Deutsche Bank set targets that it then fails to meet,” von Moltke said. The past year has been a turbulent one, in part because of allegations of laundering money after a two-day raid in November that involved a police search of all board members’ offices. “It is obvious that the partially distorted discussions on these issues are damaging our business,” von Moltke said. “We want to resolve these allegations as quickly as possible, and we are cooperating fully with the authorities,” he said. “So far we have had no evidence of any misconduct on our part,” he said."

-4.645749133753057," M.M. Warburg sues Deutsche Bank over share trade tax FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Hamburg-based bank M.M. Warburg & Co said on Thursday it had filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE seeking 46 million euros ($53.04 million) that the bank was ordered to pay in capital gains tax. Warburg said the lawsuit was filed in December in a Frankfurt regional court. Warburg said Deutsche Bank had failed to withhold taxes of 46 million euros for a series of share trades that took place as part of Deutsche’s role as a custodian bank for the years 2010 and 2011. Hamburg tax authorities had told Warburg to repay those funds, and this prompted the legal action, the bank said. Warburg also denied any wrongdoing. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said the bank had not seen the court filing but also said that Warburg’s allegations as reported in the German media were “without merit” and that the bank “strongly rejected” the accusations. Warburg’s lawsuit relates to a share-trading scheme - known as “cum-ex” - that has become the subject of Germany’s biggest post-war fraud investigation. Authorities say the scheme cost taxpayers billions of euros. Public prosecutors in Cologne and elsewhere in Germany have said the players in the so-called cum-ex scheme misled the German government into thinking a stock had multiple owners on its dividend payday who were each owed a dividend and a dividend tax credit. The prosecutors have also said the scheme was illegal and misled the German government into paying tax refunds. Deutsche Bank has said it is fully cooperating with investigators regarding the scheme."

The June deadline was imposed when watchdog BaFin announced in September that it had ordered the lender to do more to prevent money laundering, without giving details. It said it had appointed a third party, KPMG, to assess progress. Handelsblatt first reported the requirement earlier on Wednesday. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The customers will be re-evaluated under the terms of a new money laundering directive. The bank will have another year or more to examine the status of less risky customers."

These are all simulation games,” he said in an interview published on Thursday. Asked specifically about whether UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, was running simulations about Germany’s biggest lender, Weber said: “Every company has to think things over, but it makes little sense to consider mergers at group level now. These paralyze companies for years. “UBS is much stronger today than before the financial crisis, but combining with another bank -- no matter which -- would be premature at this moment. We want to grow primarily organically and we surely have to be able to walk before we want to run.” Weber, a former Bundesbank chief who joined UBS in 2012, said he could imagine remaining in his post until 2022.

8.322651177203781," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank will be unlikely 2019 trading star LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Whisper it gently: Deutsche Bank shareholders might finally have something to cheer about. The German lender has in recent years seen seemingly irreversible declines in trading revenue that have outpaced cost-cuts. In 2019 its business mix, and the potential for currency volatility and rising European rates, should make it a relative winner. Ever since the financial crisis Europe’s investment banks have resembled a car crash in slow motion. The region’s lenders have seen their overall investment banking revenue decline by 27 percent since 2010, according to UBS, compared to an 18 percent decline globally. Deutsche has been even worse — at its bedrock fixed-income trading division, which in 2017 accounted for 17 percent of group net revenue, turnover has dropped by 28 percent over the last two financial years alone. Its shares trade at a pitiful, Greek bank-style valuation of just 0.3 times tangible book. Deutsche Bank executives have had to repeatedly deny reports that a defensive merger with Commerzbank is in the offing. Fixed-income traders tend to thrive when there is a trend. The last time this occurred in Europe was when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi introduced quantitative easing in 2015 and guided steadily lower interest rates. Consequently, asset managers increased buying and selling and companies purchased more hedging products. As the ECB prepares to scale down its asset purchases, the next trend is rising yields. Given that Deutsche has the biggest market share in European rates apart from JPMorgan, its top line should benefit disproportionately from heightened client demand. Political volatility could add some additional gloss in currencies. Continued geopolitical uncertainty in Europe — think Brexit and Italy — and elsewhere should lead to wider currency spreads and, all else being equal, greater profits. Chief Executive Christian Sewing has zero room for complacency. A boost in European trading income will be somewhat offset by falling U.S. revenue due to cutbacks in Deutsche’s U.S. rates and equities business. At the same time, Sewing must find another billion euros in cost savings, and firefight Deutsche getting dragged into questions over money-laundering controls. Analysts only forecast a 3 percent return on tangible equity for Deutsche in 2019. But the bank’s increasingly diverse shareholder register — which encompasses Qatari, Chinese and U.S. hedge fund investors — doesn’t need rising European rates to lead to a miraculous resurgence. Just a transition from terrible to merely bad. - This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2019. To see more of our predictions, click reut.rs/2R6H5pG"
8.932989014095883," Deutsche, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse charged by EU over alleged bond cartel BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, Credit Agricole CAGR.PA, Credit Suisse CSGN.S and another bank have been charged by European Union antitrust regulators for being in a bond trading cartel. In the latest blow to the reputation and public image of the banking sector in Europe, which has faced billions of euros in fines for rigging interest rate benchmarks, the European Commission on Thursday did not name the banks it had charged. However, the Commission said its investigation focused on the conduct of certain traders at the four banks and contact between them, largely through online chatrooms. If found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules the banks could face fines up to 10 percent of their global turnover, although Deutsche Bank said it had proactively cooperated with the investigation and did not expect a financial penalty. Whistleblowers are not sanctioned under EU rules. Deutsche Bank, whose shares were down 5.6 percent by 1455 GMT, has paid more than $3 billion to resolve investigations it manipulated benchmark interest rates including Libor which are used to price loans and contracts around the world. Credit Agricole, which received a 114.6 million euro EU fine in 2016 for being part of a Euribor cartel, confirmed it had received the EU charge sheet and its shares were trading 3.4 percent lower by 1500 GMT. Credit Suisse said it was cooperating with the EU antitrust enforcer and that the case related to trading by a single employee who had left the Swiss bank in early 2016. Its stock fell 3.5 percent. “The four banks exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated on prices concerning U.S. dollar denominated supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds, known as ‘SSA bonds’,” the Commission said in a statement. Regulators worldwide have penalized the financial industry billions of euros in recent years for rigging various financial benchmarks. In most cases, online chatrooms had helped regulators to uncover the manipulation. The latest case could expose the banks to investor litigation, Simon Hart, a partner at law firm RPC, said. “If there has been collusion ... then this opens up the real possibility of claims by investors in those markets who were adversely affected,” Hart said."

The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised rates for the fourth time this year and stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it views as strong. “We have revised our view on the Fed to now include a longer but slower pace of tightening,” the bank said. It now sees one rate hike in 2020, up from zero before and added that some rate cuts were likely in 2021 as economic growth slows. “Inflation has also been stickier than we expected. But we still expect wages and prices to grind higher as economic slack is expended and the labor market tightens further,” the note said. Deutsche Bank said it expected the U.S. dollar, the best-performing major currency this year, to depreciate against most major currencies in 2019, with the exception of the Chinese yuan. Deutsche forecast the Chinese currency to weaken five percent as policy and interest rates diverge further."

Al-Jaida did not want to name the company, but he confirmed that it was an institution in which Qatar was already involved, Handelsblatt reported.

Talk of a possible merger between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank CBKG.DE, the country's No. 2 bank, has heated up in the past few weeks as both lenders struggle to improve their performance a decade after the global financial crisis. Asked about the speculation, Scholz told Reuters he never spoke about specific companies, but added, “Perhaps I can add this: No one in the finance ministry is having sleepless nights because of Deutsche Bank - not me either.” Scholz said Germany needed strong and successful banks to work with the many German firms active around the world. He cited “many positive developments in the German banking landscape in recent months,” but did not elaborate. Officials at both banks have declined to comment on the merger speculation. They say they want to focus on getting their own houses in order before considering any tie-up. Scholz’s comments were his most direct to date about a possible merger. He told a banking congress last month that Germany needed a strong banking industry. Those comments were seen by some bankers as a sign that Berlin wanted to support the finance industry and could back a merger. Scholz’s ministry is looking at ways to increase the competitiveness of German banks, including a possible change to tax laws to make mergers less costly, people with knowledge of the matter said this week. The government owns a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank after bailing it out during the financial crisis. Shares in both banks have lost around half their value so far this year amid concerns about their profitability."

2.14206766089019," Shareholders skeptical of Deutsche Bank/Commerzbank tie-up FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shareholders and a major union expressed scepticism on Thursday about speculation of a merger between Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and Commerzbank CBKG.DE. Talk of a possible merger between Germany’s two largest banks has heated up in the past few weeks as both lenders are still struggling to revitalize their performance a decade on from the financial crisis. But Jan Duscheck, head of German union Verdi’s banking division, said he did not assume at the moment that a merger of the two banks would be seriously considered in the foreseeable future. “The task now is to sharpen the business models in both banks and implement their strategic plans,” he said. Talk of a merger is “complete nonsense”, said another person with knowledge of the thinking of a major shareholder, speaking on condition of anonymity. Klaus Nieding from shareholder lobby group DSW said: “What’s the point?” “Just because two lame people get together doesn’t make them marathon winners,” he said. Spokesmen for Deutsche and Commerzbank declined to comment on the merger speculation. Executives at both banks have said that they want to focus on getting their own houses in order before considering any tie-up between the two. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the country needs strong banks to promote exports. Some bankers privately regard Scholz’s comments as a shift in sentiment and that they hint at a willingness by the government to support the finance industry, including helping to engineer a merger. Staff at the finance ministry are looking at ways to increase competitiveness of German banks, people with knowledge of the matter said. This also involves looking at a possible change to tax laws to facilitate mergers by making them less costly, the people said. They also said there were no active measures taking place to force a merger. The government owns a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank after bailing it out during the financial crisis. Shares in both banks have lost almost half their value so far this year amid concerns about their profitability. Shares in both rose sharply on Wednesday after Bloomberg reported Germany was holding high-level talks to facilitate a possible merger. But by late Thursday in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank was down 0.3 percent, while Commerzbank was down 1.4 percent."
2.14206766089019," Top Democratic lawmakers seek probe into Deutsche Bank controls WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two top Democratic U.S. senators called on Thursday for the Senate to open an investigation into Germany's Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE over its compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering and bank secrecy laws. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen said in a statement that they had written to the chair of the Senate Banking Committee asking for the probe in light of investigations into the bank by European authorities that called into question its compliance controls. A spokeswoman for Mike Crapo, the Republican chair of the Senate Banking committee who has the power to approve a probe, declined to comment. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the bank takes its legal obligations seriously and is prepared to cooperate with any official investigations. Thursday’s request adds pressure to the bank, which is already facing police probes in Germany and likely is to face official congressional scrutiny in the United States when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in January. Police raided six Deutsche Bank offices in and around Frankfurt last month over money laundering allegations linked to the “Panama Papers.” Investigators are looking into the activities of two unnamed Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients set up offshore firms to launder money, the prosecutor’s office said at the time. Deutsche Bank said at the time of the raids that it would cooperate closely with the Frankfurt public prosecutor’s office, adding it believed it had already provided all the relevant information related to the “Panama Papers”. “Given the Committee’s jurisdiction over banking regulatory enforcement, Deutsche Bank’s history of regulatory problems, and the recent allegations of money laundering that resulted in the recent raid conducted by German law enforcement, we request that the Banking Committee undertake an investigation into Deutsche Bank and its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations,” Warren and Van Hollen wrote to Crapo. Specifically, the pair said they were particularly concerned about Deutsche Bank’s role in correspondent banking, worrying that its relationships with other foreign banks could aid in money laundering or evading U.S. sanctions. Beyond those concerns, Democrats have also targeted the bank for its business dealings with President Donald Trump. Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has attempted to subpoena documents from the bank detailing its accounts with Trump and his businesses, as well as information about potential Russian money laundering through the bank. Republicans in charge of the committee ignored those document demands, but Waters is set to take control of the committee in January and will have power to issue those subpoenas herself if she chooses."

The finance ministry said it did not want to get involved in any speculation. Deutsche Bank declined to comment but referred to recent comments by CEO Christian Sewing dismissing persistent merger speculation. Deutsche, facing negative headlines around two high-profile money laundering cases, has seen its share price fall to record lows. Shares in Commerzbank, which was bailed out after the global financial crisis a decade ago, have also headed lower. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Focus said that the finance ministry was examining scenarios including one in which the state takes a stake in Deutsche Bank and then leads a merger of the two banks through a share swap. A second option being examined was to tap investors and possibly the German state to finance a takeover of Commerzbank by Deutsche, Focus said, while a third would foresee creating a holding company as a vehicle for a merger. Sewing opposes a merger with Commerzbank, Focus said, while Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke is open to the idea. Commerzbank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

3.033712064882688," Deutsche Bank hit by new laundering report; shares slide again FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE defended its record in fighting money laundering on Thursday after the Financial Times reported it had processed 31 billion euros ($35 billion) more in questionable funds for Danske Bank DANSKE.CO than previously thought. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on the FT article. He said, however, that it was not Deutsche’s responsibility to vet Danske Bank’s customers and that business ties with the Danish bank had been cut in 2015. The sum came on top of $150 billion Deutsche cleared for Danske’s Estonian branch from 2007-15, meaning it handled four-fifths of the flows from the Danish bank’s clients in Russia and the former Soviet Union, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the matter. “We have continuously intensified our efforts over the past years against money laundering and tax evasion,” Deutsche’s Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke, said in a statement. The bank is also under investigation in a separate German case linked to the so-called Panama Papers, a trove of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that was leaked to the media in April 2016. Prosecutors raided Deutsche’s Frankfurt offices for two days last week as part of a probe into whether it may have helped customers set up companies in tax havens to skirt money-laundering safeguards. Von Moltke, speaking earlier to CNBC, said he was not aware of any wrongdoing on Deutsche’s part in the Panama Papers case and noted that a subsidiary under investigation was sold earlier this year. A whistleblower who revealed alleged money-laundering involving Danske Bank said last month that a major European bank had helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said he was referring to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche has said only that it processed payments for Danske but severed ties after identifying suspicious transactions. Deutsche’s shares slid by 4 percent on Thursday to a new historic low, dealing a fresh blow to Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s bid to stabilise the bank after three years of losses under previous management. Speaking on CNBC, von Moltke said the share price was a concern but reiterated that Deutsche would hit its targets and return to profit this year. Asked whether clients were withdrawing money, he said the reaction of customers was very limited. Deutsche shares have shed more than half their value this year, and now value the bank at 16.7 billion euros ($19 billion). Five-year credit default swaps, the cost of insurance on its debts, rose 16 percent on Thursday to 221.5 basis points. They now price in a 17.3 percent probability of default, according to Refinitiv data. Sewing, an insider appointed in April, has sought to make a clean break after previous leadership became a byword for spiralling compensation and risky investment banking deals. That legacy has hampered his attempt to return Deutsche to its roots as Germany's premier commercial bank. Sewing has repeatedly rebutted speculation that Deutsche will end up having to merge, possibly with fellow struggler Commerzbank CBKG.DE. Von Moltke said the lender had made it easier to spot potential money laundering by reducing the total number of correspondent banks it deals with by 40 percent since 2016 and tightening scrutiny of customers. “The current management has conducted itself with a real focus on our compliance and our control systems,” he said. “We’ve made enormous investments and these investments are showing themselves.” ($1 = 0.8787 euros)"

Speculation about a possible merger has continued despite the bank's dismissal in September of reports that it could consider tie-ups with Switzerland's UBS UBSG.S or German peer Commerzbank CBKG.DE. “I don’t have any indication of that,” Christian Sewing told Bild am Sonntag. “We are on track to make our first profit for three years. It is only a matter of time before this progress is reflected in the share price.” Sewing’s remarks followed the two-day raid as part of an investigation linked to the so-called Panama Papers leak of documents about offshore finance. Police searched the offices of all the bank’s board members, Sewing said. “But that is okay, I don’t have a problem with that. I want this matter to be cleared up as soon as possible,” he told the newspaper. Investigators are looking at the activities of unidentified Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients to set up offshore firms to launder money, the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office said. “It’s about two employees who, at the time, helped to work through everything surrounding the issue of the Panama Papers.

For us the case was concluded.” Asked whether he had made any mistakes, Sewing said: “I am at peace with myself and I am doing my job as well as I can. “Of course, I would never say that I’m not making mistakes.

Shares in Germany’s largest bank ended 2.9 percent lower, after hitting a record low earlier in the day, as a raid that began on Thursday at the bank’s towering Frankfurt headquarters extended into a second day. “We will of course continue to actively support the investigation and work constructively with the authorities,” Karl von Rohr, Deutsche’s co-deputy chief executive officer, said in a statement on Friday evening. Deutsche Bank shares have lost around half of their value this year, after the bank endured three years of losses and a series of financial and regulatory scandals. The company is now worth only around 17 billion euros ($19.3 billion). The raid comes as Deutsche Bank tries to repair its tattered reputation. Christian Sewing, appointed chief executive in April to help the bank rebuild, has trimmed the group’s U.S. operations and reshuffled its management board, but revenue has continued to slip. Investigators are looking into the activities of two unnamed Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients set up offshore firms to launder money, the prosecutor’s office has said. The inquiries focus on events from 2013 to this year. Gerhard Schick, a member of parliament for the opposition Green party, said it was “particularly irritating” that the bank’s current board members oversaw operations during the time in question. “This is not about legacy issues,” he said in a statement to Reuters. This week’s events raise the stakes of a regularly scheduled meeting of the bank’s supervisory board planned for Dec. 4. The prosecutor said on Thursday the investigation had been triggered after investigators reviewed information in the Panama Papers, consisting of millions of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca leaked to the media in April 2016. Around 170 police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors began the raid on Thursday, seizing written and electronic documents. Only one police car was visible outside the bank’s headquarters early on Friday. The head of the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office, Albrecht Schreiber, said on Friday evening that investigators had made “very rapid and very good progress”. Deutsche was cooperating fully, he said, adding that authorities’ queries were answered “without reservation”. Deutsche Bank’s controls that aim to prevent money laundering have caught the attention of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Schick, who is also chairman of Finanzwende, a grassroots financial watchdog initiative, pointed the finger at Germany’s financial market regulator, BaFin. BaFin said its critics had misunderstood the situation, and that supervisors and prosecutors played different roles. In January, BaFin president Felix Hufeld said the agency had found no evidence of substantial breaches of money laundering rules by the banks named in the Panama Papers. In September, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and “terrorist financing,” and appointed KPMG as third party to assess progress. On Thursday, as the raids were going on, the vice chairman of supervision for the U.S. Federal Reserve, Randal Quarles, met Deutsche Bank management for an unrelated and previously scheduled appointment at the bank’s headquarters, a spokesman for the Fed said.

The move comes at a time when the coffee sector is being reshaped by a raft of M&A deals. Several parties have already presented unsolicited bids for Evoca, Zocchi added, while a source familiar with the matter said five potential buyers had so far come forward. Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore said last month that the group could be valued at around 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion). Evoca, which is the market leader in Italy, has attracted interest from industrial groups and other private equity funds, the source said, adding both Italian and U.S.-based groups had approached Lone Star. The sale process could last two or three months, the source added, saying that Lone Star could ultimately decide to keep Evoca in its portfolio. The global coffee sector has recently been the subject of an acquisition spree with Coca-Cola KO.N acquiring coffee chain Costa for $5.1 billion in August and Nestle NESN.S agreeing a $7 billion licensing deal for Starbucks' SBUX.O retail business. With a growing number of customers around the world ready to pay a premium for quality coffee, the professional coffee machine sector is also being lifted by the swell. “The coffee machine makers are benefiting from the continuing growth of coffee consumption around the world,” Zocchi said on the sidelines of a presentation of new Gaggia machines. “Next year we are launching five new Gaggia machines as we plan to expand the brand in foreign markets, including the United States.” Gaggia, whose first machine was invented in 1938 to make espresso with the cream on top, now accounts for less than 10 percent of Evoca sales. Evoca posted sales of more than 400 million euros last year, with core earnings of around 95 million euros."

-6.572296110976763," Deutsche Bank Americas head expected to leave: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE head of the Americas, Tom Patrick, is likely to leave the bank, possibly by the end of the year, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The change comes as Germany’s largest lender restructures its U.S. business and struggles with regulators. A U.S.-based spokeswoman for Patrick declined to comment. Deutsche Bank has made a raft of senior management changes this year, including its chief executive officer, as the bank seeks to become profitable after three years of losses. Patrick was appointed under Deutsche’s previous chief executive John Cryan. Deutsche has since announced plans to streamline its U.S. operations, and it has failed a U.S. Fed stress test. Pressure is also growing on Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche’s Frankfurt-based chief regulatory officer, amid growing internal criticism, said two people with knowledge of the matter. No move was expected, however, at the bank’s next supervisory board meeting in early December, said one of the people. The supervisory board makes decisions on senior management changes. A spokeswoman for Matherat declined to comment. Last week, Matherat sought to distance Deutsche Bank from scandal-hit Danske Bank DANSKE.CO, Denmark's largest bank, which is facing allegations of money laundering through its Estonia branch. Matherat said the German lender played only a secondary role as a so-called correspondent bank for Danske, limiting what it needed to know about the people behind the transactions. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank was weighing a shakeup that could result in Matherat’s departure. Matherat had expressed unhappiness with what she described to some associates as constraints on improving financial-crime controls and mending Deutsche Bank’s relationships with regulators, The Journal said. Germany’s financial watchdog - BaFin - has asked Deutsche Bank to provide information on its dealings with Danske, a person close to the matter said last week. Christian Sewing became CEO in April with the mission of making the bank profitable again and improving its reputation after years of financial problems, as well as hefty fines for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis and a trading scheme that allowed money laundering from Russia. On balance, analysts expect Deutsche to post a net profit for 2018, its first since 2014, according to a consensus forecast report on the bank’s website. But revenue is expected to decline this year and next. Deutsche Bank’s shares were down 0.5 percent at midday in Frankfurt, marking a 46 percent decline so far this year. The personnel debate comes even as some outsiders grow more confident in the board under Sewing. “There was a tremendous degree of arrogance on Deutsche Bank’s management board, but that’s not the case now with Sewing and the others on the board,” said a senior banker in Frankfurt. “I fully back them and even like them all,” said the person, who competes with Deutsche Bank and is also a customer. “They should be given the time they need to turn the bank around.”"

After evaluating the data, the regulator - BaFin - will decide whether to launch a formal investigation into Deutsche Bank, the source said. BaFin declined to comment. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said: “We are neither aware of any investigation by BaFin nor have we received any formal requests for information.” On Monday, Deutsche Bank confirmed for the first time that it had acted as a correspondent bank for Danske Bank in Estonia. “Our role was to process payments for Danske Bank,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said on Monday. “We terminated the relationship in 2015 after identifying suspicious activity.” A spokesman for Danske Bank declined to comment on its relationship with Deutsche Bank. A whistleblower, who revealed alleged money laundering involving Danske Bank, had said on Monday that a major European bank helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments, or nearly two-thirds of the transactions under scrutiny. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said BaFin was trying to determine to what extent Deutsche, as correspondent bank, should have been aware of who was behind the transactions it was helping to process. A finance industry expert at a major consulting firm said that regulators increasingly expect correspondent banks to know the senders and receivers of the funds they help to transfer, especially in high risk regions. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank found in an internal investigation that it handled about $150 billion in potentially suspicious transactions for Danske Bank.

Danske Bank said last month it faced a U.S. criminal investigation into as much as 200 billion euro ($230 billion) of suspicious transactions at its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The scandal has rocked investor faith in Denmark’s biggest lender and forced its chief executive and chairman to quit. The Bloomberg report said that there were no signs that Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, Bank of America BAC.N and JPMorgan JPM.N, which were correspondent banks for Danske's Estonian branch, were themselves targets for the investigation. It said the examination of whether the three banks gave appropriate scrutiny to the Estonia transactions was part of the broader investigation of Danske led by the U.S. Justice Department and prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department are also investigating the Danske Bank transactions through the global banks, Bloomberg said. Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and JPMorgan declined to comment when asked about the Bloomberg report by Reuters.

-10.295622531656804," M&A not the only way, says Deutsche Bank chief FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Banks should consider joint ventures in certain areas and products, not only mergers and acquisitions, to be competitive globally, Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE CEO said on Friday. Consolidation in the European banking sector has long proved problematic in the face of political and regulatory hurdles, both before and after the 2008 financial crisis, which have prevented lenders from achieving the desired cost savings. Deutsche Bank’s Chief Executive Christian Sewing, however, told a banking conference that consolidation must come “in the long run” because Europe has too many banks and needs stronger institutions to compete with the United States and Asia. “We should also think about other ideas, like joint ventures, in certain areas, in certain products,” Sewing said. “You know we are always talking only about consolidation ... I think we need to think a bit more creatively than just consolidating.” Speculation that Germany’s largest banks could tie-up with rivals has gathered pace this year. But Sewing, at the helm of Deutsche Bank since April, has said that his bank needs to focus on becoming profitable on its own over the next 18 months before entertaining the idea of a merger or acquisition. After three years of losses, a failed stress test in the United States, several attempts to restructure, a leadership shake-up and a ratings downgrade, many investors have lost faith in Germany’s biggest bank, the shares of which have fallen by about 46 percent this year. “One thing is clear,” Sewing said, “I think we need a European answer to the Asian and U.S. platforms. And that means that banks and financial institutions need to work a lot more closely together.”"

-15.874522738501181," Deutsche edges up in EU stress tests, still among worst 10 banks in Europe FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE on Friday scored among the ten worst banks in the latest round of European stress tests, yet another sign of weakness at Germany's largest lender. Under the test’s toughest “adverse” scenario, Germany’s flagship lender’s core capital ratio was 8.1 percent for 2020, placing it in 40th place out of 48 lenders measured. In the 2016 test, the capital level of Deutsche Bank dropped to 7.8 percent, ranking it tenth from the bottom from a health check for 51 lenders. Some analysts had expected Germany’s biggest lender to fare badly after three years of losses. There was no formal pass/fail mark, but investors are checking how much core capital lenders hold against a threshold of 5.5 percent. The closely watched health check across the European Union conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) could force laggards to raise capital or ditch assets. “We will not change how we manage the bank after the stress tests”, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said, adding that the bank’s internal stress test methodologies differed from those used by the EBA test. “We do not expect any impact on our SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process) levels from the test,” he said, referring to the bank’s minimum capital levels as defined by the regulators. The test result mainly reflected the decrease in Deutsche’s earnings but did not show the bank’s lowered risk profile, because it failed to account for disposed assets and due to the way the test treats strategic liquidity reserves, von Moltke said. “Due to the design of the test the results do not fully reflect what management has done since the 2016 tests,” von Moltke said, adding that if backward-looking elements were taken out, Deutsche’s results would have been much more favorable. A person close to the matter said that adjusted for these factors Deutsche’s result would have been around 12 percent. Despite improvements to Deutsche Bank’s capital ratio, analysts had expected 2018 results to be roughly on par with the lender’s score in 2016, analysts said, after the EBA included a harsher adverse scenario. “The result reflects that certain measures to strengthen the capital buffers have been taken. I do not see immediate need for action – such as the sale of assets,” said Michael Huenseler, credit manager at Assenagon Asset Management. “The Deutsche Bank result is not shocking and some other banks have clearly fared worse.” British lenders Barclays BARC.L and Lloyds LLOY.L, and Italy's Banco BPM BAMI.MI fared worst in the European Union-wide stress test of banking resilience to simulated market shocks. After three years of losses at Deutsche Bank, a failed stress test in the U.S., several attempts to restructure, a leadership shake-up and a ratings downgrade, many investors have lost faith in Germany’s biggest bank, whose shares have fallen by 40 percent this year. In June, Deutsche’s U.S. subsidiary was the only bank to fail a different set of Federal Reserve stress tests due to “widespread and critical deficiencies” in the bank’s capital planning controls. It was an embarrassment for Deutsche, which regulators deem one of the most important banks in the global financial system. Last week, Deutsche warned that revenue was expected to drop in 2018 from a year before, though it expected to post a profit for the first time since 2014. At the time, CEO Christian Sewing pointed to the strength of the bank’s CET 1 ratio at 14 percent and that he was “managing our risk levels conservatively”. The credit ratings agency Moody’s, which grades Deutsche with a negative outlook in part because of its modest earnings potential, last week called Deutsche’s capitalization, asset quality and liquidity “sound”."

The move by New York-based Hudson Executive Capital LP, led by Douglas Braunstein, makes the hedge fund one of Deutsche Bank’s biggest investors and boosted its shares on Thursday. After three years of losses, a failed regulatory test, several attempts to restructure, a leadership shake-up and a ratings downgrade, many investors have lost faith in Germany’s flagship bank. Its shares have fallen 44 percent this year. Hudson “sees significant long-term value in Deutsche Bank,” it said in a statement. “Recent actions, including changes in management and headcount reductions, demonstrate the resolve of the new management team to deliver on promises made to investors,” it added. However, it cited “still significant room” for the bank to use its funds more efficiently to improve returns. “Unfortunately, historical missteps have clouded the issues for many investors today and has led to sentiment uniquely bearish to Deutsche Bank,” Hudson said. “We believe we can now shine light on this opportunity.” Sewing, who took the helm in a sudden management change in April, welcomed the investment. “Doug Braunstein and Hudson Executive come with deep backgrounds investing in financial services companies,” he said in a statement. “We appreciate Hudson Executive’s confidence in our ability to execute on our strategic objectives.” Braunstein said in an interview that Sewing’s promotion to CEO was the catalyst for his investment. Before, there was dysfunction and no clear strategy, he said. “People say in the company that he has made more decisions in three months than the company made in the previous three years,” Braunstein said of Sewing. He said he was not seeking a seat on the bank’s supervisory board. Instead, the most valuable role he can play is to encourage other institutional investors to invest in Deutsche, he said. “They have to get on the bandwagon.” Deutsche Bank's shares rose almost 3.5 percent in Frankfurt, outperforming Germany's DAX index .GDAXI of blue-chip stocks. In its statement, Hudson largely endorsed Deutsche Bank’s current strategy of job cuts in investment banking, as well as a focus on retail banking, transaction banking and asset management. Other major shareholders in Deutsche Bank include the royal family of Qatar, Chinese conglomerate HNA, BlackRock BLK.N, and U.S. buyout fund Cerberus. EnTrustPermal CEO Gregg Hymowitz confirmed that his $20.5 billion firm, which specializes in placing money alongside activist money managers, had provided a “significant portion” of the Hudson investment in Deutsche Bank. “(We) believe from this valuation, with Doug’s intense focus, new management’s ability to execute on the game plan and reinvigorated shareholder accountability, I think we can double our money,” Hymowitz said. EnTrustPermal previously had co-invested $650 million in Nestlé alongside U.S. activist firm Third Point LLC, run by Dan Loeb."

DWS shares, which had lost more than a fifth of their value since the company’s Frankfurt listing in March, rose to a more than one-month high of 25.85 euros and were up 1.9 percent at 25.195 euros by 1218 GMT. Moreau’s exit comes amid widespread change across the industry as asset managers battle higher regulatory and operational costs and investor pressure around fees. Woehrmann, who joined Deutsche Bank 30 years ago, most recently served as head of retail banking in Germany and will take on his new role with immediate effect, while giving up his seat on the DWS supervisory board. Moreau, named head of Deutsche’s asset managing arm three years ago, will remain with DWS, one of Europe’s largest listed asset managers, until the end of the year. DWS’s quarterly figures on Wednesday showed the firm continues to struggle with outflows of client money, seeing customers withdraw 2.7 billion euros in the third quarter. In July, DWS said it expects revenue to decrease this year and cut its 2018 target for attracting new money, citing market volatility caused by trade tensions and effects from the U.S. tax reform.

Although Deutsche Bank said that it was on track to make a profit this year, it posted a steep fall in third quarter profit as it restructures under new chief executive Christian Sewing. Its shares were down by 4.5 percent after the bank said it expected revenue this year will fall from 2017. “We have our costs under control and sufficient capital to grow. We are on track to be profitable in 2018, for the first time since 2014,” Sewing said. Net profit in the third quarter fell by 65 percent to 229 million euros ($263 million), down from 649 million euros a year ago but ahead of the 149 million euros forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. Revenue in the quarter was 6.175 billion euros, down 9 percent from 6.776 billion a year ago. “It is difficult to find anything positive in Deutsche Bank’s latest earnings, there was weakness right across all lines of business,” Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas, said. The quarter was marked by continued weakness in Deutsche Bank’s key trading business, amid lower volatility. Revenue at its bond trading division fell by 15 percent, while revenues from equities-trading were also down 15 percent. “We have not yet achieved a turnaround in terms of revenues,” Sewing wrote in a memo to staff after Deutsche Bank said it expects 2018 revenue to be slightly lower compared to 2017 due to the restructuring of its investment banking. Deutsche Bank’s finance chief, James von Moltke, said this was a result of a worse-than-expected third quarter. JPMorgan said in a research note that it was “concerned about DB’s inability to turn around” key areas such as fixed income and equity sales and trading and its transaction bank. Sewing took over in April and plans to cut more than 7,000 jobs. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,717, down by about 700 during the quarter. In contrast to Deutsche Bank, some big U.S. banks have posted sharp gains. Goldman Sachs GS.N reported a 20.5 percent increase in quarterly profit as growth in its equities trading and underwriting businesses made up for a fall in fixed income trading."
-11.399992370197989," Breakingviews - Barclays rehab a tough act for Deutsche to follow LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - In his A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens contrasted the trajectories of London and Paris amid the revolutionary upheaval of the eighteenth century. UK-based Barclays and Germany’s Deutsche Bank, both recently subject to radical internal transformation, provide a comparable study in the diverging fortunes of their modern-day investment banks. Deutsche remains trapped in an era employees could liken to France’s Reign of Terror, where management’s guillotine falls on anyone who looks like a cost centre. A cull of 700 employees meant underlying expenses fell by 1 percent year-on-year to 5.5 billion euros, putting Deutsche on track to hit its 23 billion euro annual cost target. Less happily for the lender’s boss, Christian Sewing, greater blood-letting has not yet healed either the top or bottom line: thanks to a 9 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, mostly due to a 15 percent slump on the trading floor, the bank only scraped a 1.6 percent annualised return on tangible equity. By contrast, Barclays boss Jes Staley can now stand on the barricades urging his rainmakers forward. The UK lender made an annualised 9.4 percent return, roughly in line with the bank’s cost of capital. That should provide an effective riposte for would-be revolutionnaire Edward Bramson, the activist Barclays stakeholder who has urged Staley to cut investment banking in favour of steadier, more bourgeois retail and commercial lending. Staley can’t yet declare final victory. Despite the investment bank growing significantly better than U.S. peers in both equities and fixed-income revenue – up 33 percent and 9 percent respectively – it still only eked out a 7 percent quarterly return, although that improves to a more respectable 9.6 percent on a nine-month basis. Barclays UK and its U.S. cards business both achieved roughly double that. Deutsche, by contrast, remains trapped between terrible fixed-income trading and insufferable German retail banking, neither of which makes an economic return. Revenue is forecast to remain subdued, as implied by analysts’ low-ball projection of a 3 percent return on tangible equity for next year. With Barclays’ tumult all but over and returns concurrently improving, shares valued at 65 percent of tangible book should rise. By contrast, the revolution at Deutsche, trading at just 40 percent of the net value of its assets, has a long and painful course to run."
-11.399992370197989," Deutsche Bank to hold more liquidity in securities rather than cash -CFO FRANKFURT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is planning to hold a larger portion of its 270 billion euros in liquidity buffers in securities rather than cash as it seeks to increase its profitability, its Chief Financial Officer said. “Of (our liquidity reserves) about 200 billion euros is in cash. So it doesn’t take very much in terms of incremental risk tolerance to move the needle pretty significantly,” James von Moltke said on an analyst call discussing third-quarter earnings. “We think we can generate 50 to 100 basis points of additional yield without taking really a significant risk or certainly well within our risk appetite,” he added. Parking cash at the German central bank costs Deutsche Bank 0.4 percent in interest, while investments in some safe-haven government bonds promise at least small returns. Since its 2016 crisis, Deutsche Bank has been managing its liquidity more conservatively than peers and ratings agencies would be comfortable with Deutsche’s new approach, von Moltke said.

-20.781521224447268," Ex-Deutsche Bank traders found guilty in U.S. of Libor scheme NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former Deutsche Bank AG traders were found guilty by a New York jury on Wednesday of engaging in a scheme to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate between 2005 and 2011. Matthew Connolly, who once led Deutsche Bank’s pool trading desk in New York, and Gavin Campbell Black, who worked on the bank’s London desk, were convicted of wire fraud and conspiracy following a trial in federal court in Manhattan. Connolly was convicted of three of the six counts against him but acquitted on the other three, while Black was convicted of both of the two counts against him. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon, who presided over the case, said she would not set a sentencing date until after she had considered motions by the defendants challenging the verdict. “This isn’t over,” said Connolly’s lawyer, Ken Breen. “We will pursue our post-trial challenges until we get to exoneration. Matt Connolly is innocent.” “While we are disappointed by today’s verdict, we will be making a number of post-trial motions and will continue to seek justice for Gavin Black,” said Seth Levine, Black’s lawyer. Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, underpins trillions of dollars of financial products and is based on what banks say they believe they would pay if they borrowed from other banks. Investigations into whether banks manipulated Libor have led to billions of dollars in global settlements with financial institutions and U.S. and UK cases against several people. Two former Rabobank traders were found guilty in federal court in Manhattan and sentenced to prison, but their convictions were thrown out by an appeals court last year. Connolly was the first U.S. citizen charged in connection with Libor rigging. He and Black were indicted in June 2016. U.S. prosecutors said that from 2005 to about 2011, they and others conspired to submit false estimates for some U.S. dollar Libor rates in order to manipulate the rate for their own gain. Traders used electronic messaging to swap requests for Libor rates that would benefit their own positions, rather than basing it on an objective assessment of interbank lending rates, prosecutors said. The indictment came after two other traders at Deutsche Bank, Michael Curtler of London and Timothy Parietti of New York, pleaded guilty to related charges in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Deutsche Bank agreed in April 2015 to pay $2.5 billion to resolve U.S. and UK investigations into Libor rigging."

-22.393471453426347," Citigroup, Deutsche Bank face Australian court in landmark cartel case SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian units of Citigroup and Deutsche Bank faced court in Sydney on Tuesday accused of criminal cartel conduct over a A$3 billion ($2.1 billion) stock issue, in a landmark case being watched around the world. Australian authorities filed criminal charges in June against the two subsidiaries as well as Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and six senior bankers over the sale of ANZ shares in 2015, and subsequent trading by the underwriters. Lawyers jammed into the courtroom in downtown Sydney for the first administrative hearing of the case, which could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. The government accuses the banks of forming a criminal cartel to either “directly or indirectly” restrict the supply of ANZ shares or maintain the price of ANZ shares, according to court documents. The banks have denied wrongdoing. JPMorgan, which underwrote the capital raising along with Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, has not been charged and has not commented on the case. Charges have also been brought against six executives - ANZ former treasurer Rick Moscati; Citi former Australia head Stephen Roberts; Citi’s current Australia head of capital markets, John McLean; Citi’s London-based head of foreign exchange trading, Itay Tuchman; Deutsche’s former Australia chief, Michael Ormaechea; and Deutsche’s former Australia capital markets head, Michael Richardson. If convicted, the companies could face penalties of up to A$10 million or triple the benefit of the conduct. The individuals charged could face 10 years in jail. The matter was adjourned until Feb. 5 and the prosecution ordered to file the full details of their case by Dec. 11. The allegations stem from an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country’s competition watchdog. ANZ, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup declined to comment on the case, but Citigroup referred Reuters to a previous statement in which it said it had “operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades”. “This is a highly technical area and if the ACCC believes there are matters to address, these should be clarified by law or regulation or consultation,” it added. All six bankers were excused from appearing personally and none were present. Lawyers on their behalf pressed the prosecution to file a statement of facts, which would disclose in detail exactly what the banks and bankers are accused of. Prosecutor Ruth Higgins said there was “no present obligation” to file the details while they were still being compiled. None of the executives charged in the case has commented publicly. The case comes as Australia’s financial sector comes under intense scrutiny from a separate public inquiry that has uncovered widespread misconduct."
-31.428569963063207," Deutsche Bank dismisses merger reports as 'fictions' FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has dismissed speculation that it might seek a merger as ""fictions"", after media reports suggested Germany's biggest lender might seek tie ups with Switzerland's UBS or German peer Commerzbank. Speculation about a possible merger has increased as Deutsche Bank battles to recover from three years of losses. German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday that Germany's biggest bank had studied the effects of a theoretical tie-up with UBS UBSG.S, citing unnamed sources. The Handelsblatt report, the latest in the German financial press on the issue, said the UBS scenario and a potential merger with Commerzbank CBKG.DE were discussed at Deutsche Bank's strategy meeting with the supervisory board this month. Handelsblatt quoted an unnamed source as saying managers at the Deutsche Bank strategy meeting stressed that any immediate merger was “completely unrealistic.” Deutsche Bank Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke on Wednesday said recent merger reports were “fictions of the press”, while UBS and Commerzbank declined to comment on Wednesday’s Handelsblatt report. “We are constantly amazed at what passes through the editorial filters and gets into the press,” von Moltke said, adding that Deutsche Bank had a lot of work to do on the merger of its retail units, which would take several years. Deutsche Bank’s shares were down 0.9 percent midday, while UBS was down 0.8 percent. Commerzbank was up 0.3 percent. Media reports on Deutsche Bank’s potential next steps have picked up since it changed its management and announced a strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank. On paper, a potential merger with UBS would fare better than a deal with Commerzbank as Deutsche Bank and the Swiss lender would complement each other well in the areas of investment banking and wealth management, the Handelsblatt report said. A merger with Commerzbank, in contrast, might lead to high restructuring costs due to a large overlap, the paper said. Handelsblatt quoted an unnamed source as saying managers at the Deutsche Bank strategy meeting stressed that any immediate merger was “completely unrealistic.” Asked at a conference on Wednesday about the potential for a tie-up with a competitor, Deutsche Bank’s chief executive Christian Sewing said he had “said everything there is to say about it and I am working on my homework”. The comment echoed statements earlier this week when he dampened speculation of a possible merger in the near term, saying the bank must focus on its homework for the next 18 months. However, the German government, which owns more than 15 percent of Commerzbank, has also stoked merger speculation. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the country needs strong banks to foster exports. Some bankers privately regard that as a shift in sentiment and hints at a willingness to back the financial industry, including helping engineer a merger. Under the merger scenario with UBS, Deutsche would be the junior partner, and the German government would have to accept that, Handelsblatt reported."

BaFin said on Monday this was the first time it had made such an appointment at a bank related to money laundering. European regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of banks’ dealings with their customers following a series of scandals. The head of Danske Bank DANSKE.CO resigned last week after Denmark's biggest bank said an investigation had shown that many of the 200 billion euros ($236 billion) of payments through its small Estonian branch were suspicious. Last year, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million here for allowing money laundering. Germany’s biggest bank said in a statement it agreed with BaFin that it needed to improve its processes to properly identify clients. “We have the strong commitment to operate within regulatory compliant practices for the identification of our clients,” Deutsche Bank said. Neither BaFin nor Deutsche Bank gave details of the new measures the bank would adopt. No new scandal or case triggered BaFin’s move, two people with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In August, Reuters reported that Deutsche Bank had uncovered further shortcomings in its ability to fully identify clients and the source of their wealth. BaFin said it had appointed KPMG as its special representative for a three year period to assess Deutsche Bank’s progress. The intervention is another blow to the bank’s reputation. Deutsche Bank has made management changes and announced a strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank as it battles to recover from three consecutive years of losses. In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay U.S. and British regulators $630 million in fines over artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia.

Hauschild was among 11 individuals who were charged in Britain in 2015 of rigging the Euribor interest benchmark with conspiracy to defraud. Euribor, the euro interbank offered rate, is the Brussels-based equivalent of London-based benchmark Libor. Designed to estimate the costs at which banks will lend to each other, rates such as Libor and Euribor are central cogs in the global financial system and a benchmark for interest rates on an estimated $450 trillion of financial contracts, from derivatives to student loans. Hauschild, a German native, previously escaped trial in Britain because Germany rejected an extradition request. He is now facing a new extradition request in Milan where a court hearing will take place toward the end of October, a judicial source said."

Whitman, a 23-year stalwart of Deutsche’s capital markets businesses, was appointed to the executive committee of the corporate and investment Bank as “capital czar” in June 2017 following a reorganisation in the division under former CEO John Cryan. Whitman was one of the first in a swathe of Merrill Lynch fixed income bankers who joined under Edson Mitchell. Whitman started in New York as head of debt capital markets for North America. His departure could be seen as a set-back for Deutsche’s long struggle to increase low returns on capital and an indication of the tension between maintaining the bank’s footprint in various businesses and its use of capital. It may also reflect Sewing’s push to have a more streamlined senior management structure. In May Sewing announced a retreat from US rates and global equities trading and a cut back on the number of business co-heads, including the removal of CIB co-head Marcus Schenck, leaving Garth Richie in sole charge. Whitman was given the task of improving the allocation of scarce capital across CIB, on the back of a short stint running the CIB’s relationship loan book - credit portfolio strategies group - from 2016. He had previous experience managing one of the bank’s functions during difficult times, when he guided group treasury from early 2007 for two years, raising US$100bn of long-term funding when the financial crisis took hold. He was then global co-head of equity capital markets for nearly three years before crossing back to fixed income as head of global risk syndicate.

-25.28236452163996," Deutsche Bank to move assets from London to Frankfurt after Brexit FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE said on Monday it would move assets from London to Frankfurt after Britain's planned exit from the European Union next year, in line with demands from British and EU regulators. Deutsche Bank said in a statement it would make Frankfurt rather than London the primary booking hub for its investment banking clients, as per an announcement made last year. “By definition this involves moving assets from London to Frankfurt, a process which is already underway with the full understanding of UK and EU regulators,” it said, declining to specify the volume of asset shifts. A source familiar with the matter said the European Central Bank, as Europe’s main financial supervisor, was putting pressure on banks to shift investment banking activities from London to the continent. The ECB thereby wants to prevent investment banks setting up empty shells on the continent while still supplying their services from London, the source added. Regulators are demanding that capital, risk management, governance structures are set up on the continent to support investment banking activities, the person said. With passporting for financial services off the table Deutsche Bank illustrates what to expect from Brexit, analysts from think-tank Eurointelligence said. While the least disruptive possibility would have been that only new business would move to the continent, a disruptive option is to actually shift existing portfolios. “This is not only a major cross-border financial flow in itself but also a huge logistical and legal undertaking for the banks involved, and their clients. Contracts need to be modified, one by one,” Eurointelligence said. The ECB declined to comment. According to a report by the Financial Times, Deutsche Bank could over time move about three quarters of its estimated 600 billion euros ($700 billion) in assets from London to Frankfurt. One option being considered is to shrink the London balance sheet so it ends up being smaller than its U.S. holding company, which has roughly $145 billion of assets, the paper said. According to a source close to the matter, Deutsche Bank is also considering transforming its UK arm into a smaller, less complex and ring-fenced subsidiary. Analysts at Eurointelligence said this was costly in terms of capital. “We presume this is because of netting effects between the London and Frankfurt books which would disappear if the London business becomes a separate firm,” they said.

Christian Bittar, 46, was sentenced to five years and four months in March after pleading guilty for plotting to rig global Euribor interest rates. “If he had not been convicted and imprisoned for the same matters, the FCA would have sought a financial penalty of 6.5 million pounds ($8.50 million),” said Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA. “As it is, we have prohibited him from performing any regulated function, reinforcing the message of the criminal court,” Steward said. Apart from Bittar, former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef was also sentenced to eight years for the same crime. The two men were charged with conspiring to manipulate the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), which helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide, between January 2005 and December 2009. “Between March 2005 and June 2009, Bittar made at least 81 requests to Deutsche Bank submitters for high or low EURIBOR submissions to benefit trading positions,” Steward said. Barclays was the first of 11 major banks and brokerages to be fined in 2012 in a global investigation into allegations of rate-rigging. Its $453 million penalty sparked a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond, an overhaul of rate-setting rules and the British criminal inquiry.

-22.80702098811197," Deutsche Bank's retreat to Germany gets tepid welcome at home FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - German manufacturer Voith has been a customer of Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE for more than a century. But as the maker of hydropower and paper plants expands abroad it said it has started to hire other international banks where it would have previously considered Germany's largest lender. That could be bad news for Deutsche, which was founded in 1870 to help companies with overseas trade. In April, it said it would refocus on German customers as part of a push to restore the edge it has lost in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis. The new strategy is getting a cool reception at home. Voith and other German companies such as auto parts maker Bosch have turned to rivals and Deutsche’s share of its home market has diminished. “German banks have lost ground compared to their international competitors,” said Voith group treasurer Michael Hannig. “We had to differentiate and allocate our business also across some international banks.” Reuters spoke to 10 executives of German companies that are current and former clients of Deutsche who said they did not feel valued by the bank. Interviews with more than 35 politicians, investors and public officials found that many of them are worried about the bank, which has a $1-trillion-plus balance sheet. The bank says clients are happy with its work and it has cut risky investments, simplified its structures and settled most large court cases. “We are getting very good feedback from our clients,” said Karl von Rohr, Deutsche’s co-deputy chief executive officer. “What is clear: you cannot be successful if you are not successful in your home market.” Nevertheless, it captured just under 10 percent of the market share of investment banking fees for mergers and takeovers involving German companies so far this year and in 2017, according to Dealogic. That is up from a 4 percent share among global competitors in 2016 but far below a 30 percent share in 2008, when the crisis unfolded. Deutsche posted a loss that year but Josef Ackermann, chief executive at the time, boasted of the bank’s strength as rivals turned to their governments for rescue packages. The bank’s trading in global stocks and bonds, the forte of its investment banking arm, rebounded and helped it to return to profit in 2009. But problems were accumulating. The European debt crisis followed the financial crisis and Deutsche was facing lawsuits for wrongdoing in several operations including interest-rate benchmark setting and mortgage-backed securities, a market that has been blamed for triggering the 2008 crisis. It has reported losses since 2015 and a $7.2 billion U.S. fine last year for its role in the mortgage market was a major blow that spooked clients. From a market value of 47.4 billion euros at the start of 2008, Deutsche is now worth just 20 billion euros. Christian Sewing was promoted to chief executive in April as the bank embraced its new strategy. With a background in risk management and retail banking, he is the first German to run the bank as sole CEO since 2002. He wrote to staff in a May memo outlining job cuts abroad that Deutsche’s roots in Germany were “deep and enduring”, a message he underscored when he visited German chancellor Angela Merkel after his appointment. Competition for ordinary savers is stiff because state-backed community savings banks are dominant. It is even considering a new structure to distance volatile investment banking from steadier, if more modest, retail business, Reuters reported on Wednesday. In Germany’s corporate world, the rivals are foreign banks. Deutsche says its foreign operations are still important. “For Germany our global presence is of vital importance. So we need both: a dominant role in the home market and a strong international network,” said von Rohr. Mann+Hummel makes filters for autos and industry. Christian Aue, group treasurer, said he dropped Deutsche from its lineup when it arranged 400 million euros of finance last year. He instead chose ING, BNP Paribas and Bank of China. Deutsche lost out after the pitching process to Macquarie when auto supplier Bosch asked the Australian bank to explore options for its packaging machinery unit, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank officials declined to comment on specific deals. In the years running up to 2007, Deutsche was also the biggest buyer of newly issued German government debt, according to the German Finance Agency. It is now in eighth place with France’s BNP Paribas in the top spot followed by German rival Commerzbank. Deutsche’s chief financial officer James von Moltke said the bank is “on a good path to rebuilding credibility”. “We are once again the full-service provider for our corporate clients in our German home market,” he said. Deutsche’s public image has suffered at home. A series on state broadcaster ZDF, “Bad Banks”, about a fictional lender ‘Deutsche Global Invest’ has not helped. The relationship with politicians has also cooled. Ackermann helped direct Merkel’s response to the 2008 crisis and she rewarded him by hosting the Swiss CEO’s birthday party. Sewing’s first meeting with Merkel just weeks into his tenure was humble, according to three people briefed. His message to her was that the bank is cutting costs and “rightsizing” its global investment bank. German officials have been worried about Deutsche since 2016. They knew a big fine for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis was coming. At the time, Deutsche and the government publicly played down speculation that it could need state support. Behind the scenes, however, tensions were running high. “We looked into the abyss at that time,” said a German official. “To bail out an institution like Deutsche Bank would not just concern one government. It would concern a number.” Officials no longer talk of a rescue but politicians across the spectrum are reluctant to even speak about Deutsche. “It isn’t positive for a politician,” said Bettina Stark-Watzinger, head of the Bundestag’s finance committee and a pro-business Free Democrat. Her constituency includes an affluent suburb of Germany’s financial center Frankfurt. Deutsche Bank's shareholders, which include money manager Blackrock BLK.N, buyout firm Cerberus and Qatar's royal family, are pinning their hopes on Sewing. He was born in 1970 in Buende, a town in the industrial heartland of northwestern Germany known for its cigars. Buende’s economy has been booming the past couple of years, the city’s mayor Wolfgang Koch said. He was surprised when Deutsche closed its local branch last year to save costs. Arnold Andre, one of the city’s last remaining cigar manufacturers, uses Commerzbank for its global operations, president Rainer Goehner said. There has been wide speculation in Germany about a tie-up with Commerzbank, which is partly owned by the state. Executives at both banks privately reject this idea. They have declined to comment publicly. Deutsche’s managers are nonetheless considering an overhaul to loosen the bond between its retail and investment banks that could make it easier to merge some or all of the group with rivals. The German official said any merger with Commerzbank CBKG.DE was ""unlikely soon"" although not impossible in the future. He said it would take up to 18 months of restoring profitability and restructuring for the bank to reach “safe ground”: “Deutsche is certainly not where I would say I can relax.”"
-19.661919203922896," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank weighs overhaul that could make deals easier - sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is considering an overhaul to loosen the bond between its retail and investment banks, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, a move that could make it easier to merge some or all of the group with rivals. The German lender is examining creating a holding company structure, a step that would give it more flexibility to strike merger deals, as it seeks to regain its footing following years of heavy losses and multi-billion-dollar penalties. The possibility is likely to be discussed at a meeting of management later this week in Hamburg, other people familiar with the matter said, as the bank’s new chief executive, Christian Sewing, sets a new course for the struggling lender. “I gravitate to the holding structure,” said one of the people with direct knowledge of the debate. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The structure, which would act as an umbrella over separate entities including its investment and retail banks, would see Deutsche following the example of U.S. rivals. No decision, however, has yet been made, and while such an arrangement would bring potential advantages for the group, a number of questions about how it would work in practice, such as its tax impact, remain unanswered. The debate to switch to the new structure comes at a time of upheaval for Deutsche. Sewing was propelled to the helm earlier this year to reverse three consecutive years of losses and a falling share price. He has been on a mission to slim down the bank’s international operations and promote steadier income streams in its home market of Germany. As Deutsche’s fortunes have declined, speculation of a possible merger has risen. Deutsche’s cross-town rival Commerzbank is mentioned as the most likely candidate. The German government, which owns a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, has recently voiced the need for a strong German banking industry to support companies in the nation’s export-led economy. That has stoked speculation it could engineer a merger. Executives at both banks have privately talked down the chances of a merger anytime soon, saying the banks would need to overhaul their operations and restore profitability first. While the holding structure could simplify potential mergers and acquisitions, giving flexibility in integrating a rival business, it has other benefits. One of the people said it could shore up confidence in the investment bank by possibly making it cheaper to obtain finance if the holding company were to relieve it of some of the financial burden. Regulators in the United States, UK and Switzerland also tend to favor the bank holding company structure, in part because it can help with the winding up of a troubled bank. There has been a push since the financial crash to make banks easier to break up, lowering the risk that the problems of a troubled investment bank, for instance, could spill over onto ordinary savers. About 90 percent of U.S. banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, operate as holding companies, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve."

The Fed, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said Deutsche, Barclays PLC BARC.L, Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S and UBS AG UBSG.S would now be required to submit those resolution plans by July 1, 2020. The banks previously were expected to submit plans by July 1, 2019. Additionally, the regulators said Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N would face a new submission deadline of Dec. 31, 2019. Prudential's latest plan submission had been due at the end of 2018. The regulators said the extension would allow them to provide additional feedback to banks and give them more time to prepare the new plans. The resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, require large banks to detail how they could be unwound in cases of bankruptcy without disrupting the broader financial system. If regulators do not find a plan credible, they could impose restrictions on a bank’s activities or even order it to divest. Typically, banks with over $50 billion in assets have been required to submit plans annually, although regulators have frequently granted extensions in the past. Banks have pushed to move away from the annual schedule, saying the lengthy submissions are onerous. The Treasury Department recommended regulators extend the evaluation cycle to two years in a June report, while encouraging regulators to limit the submissions to larger banks and providing more transparent feedback.

The Fed, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said Deutsche, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG would now be required to submit those resolution plans by July 1, 2020. The banks previously were expected to submit plans by July 1, 2019. Additionally, the regulators said Prudential Financial Inc would face a new submission deadline of Dec. 31, 2019. Prudential’s latest plan submission was due at the end of 2018. The regulators said the extension would allow them to provide additional feedback to banks and give them more time to prepare the new plans. (Reporting by Pete Schroeder Editing by Leslie Adler)"
-19.210976444460144," Deutsche Bank CEO stands by global ambitions FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has no plans to give up its global presence, its chief executive said on Wednesday, despite sizeable job cuts to try and revive profitability. Since taking the helm in April, Christian Sewing has announced plans to cut the lender’s global equities business, as well as U.S. bond trading and its business that serves hedge funds. Speaking at a banking conference in Frankfurt, Sewing said this should not be seen as a sign of retrenchment. “Our global ambitions will not be up for debate under my leadership,” he said, adding a raft of political crises around the world made it important that Deutsche Bank supported its customers in their global business. “I am quite convinced that this global position is just as important for our economy today as it was after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall.” In times of tension between Europe and the United States, Sewing said he believed it would be “too risky” to leave the role of financing and risk management up to a few non-European banks. Deutsche Bank is trying to bounce back from three consecutive years of losses and has had a run of negative headlines, including an abrupt management reshuffle, a downgrade by credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s and failing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stress test. Sewing said Germany’s largest lender did not have ambitions to return to its status as a world market leader, as it was prior to the global financial crisis. “It would be wrong to say we wanted to be number 1, 2 or 3. Of course we can’t,” he said. Instead the aim is to keep its top positions in certain businesses, such as payment transactions, euro and dollar clearing, and foreign exchange trading. For this reason, Deutsche Bank needs to remain active in investment banking, he said. Sewing’s main aim is to restore profitability at the bank and he said the company needed to make “clear progress” on this in the next 12-18 months. Sewing said he expected the pressure for banks to consolidate to increase as the sector faces the tougher regulation, digitalization and changes in customer behavior. “Europe doesn’t need as many banks as possible. It especially needs strong banks,” he said. He declined to comment on speculation that Deutsche Bank could merge with local rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE."

-15.839997643103331," Exclusive: Deutsche Bank reports show chinks in money laundering armor FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank has uncovered shortcomings in its ability to fully identify clients and the source of their wealth, internal documents seen by Reuters show, more than a year after it was fined nearly $700 million for allowing money laundering. In two confidential reviews, dated June 5 and July 9, Germany’s biggest lender detailed the results of tests on a sample of investment bank customer files in several countries, including Russia. Both reviews found gaps in Deutsche’s screening process, which aims to meet so-called “Know Your Customer” (KYC) requirements that are a cornerstone of global anti-money laundering controls. Regulators around the world require banks to vet customers so that criminals cannot mask their identity through complex company and ownership structures to launder money or sidestep international sanctions. The two recent reviews show how the bank is still grappling with procedures to ensure it knows who it is dealing with, in part because of staff turnover. In the 13-page June report, which was shared with the European Central Bank (ECB), Deutsche Bank found a pass rate of zero percent in countries such as Russia, Ireland, Spain, Italy and South Africa when it checked how client files had been processed. The pass rate measures the percentage of files that meet the bank’s own “Know Your Customer” standards. Deutsche Bank strives for 95 percent, according to the documents. Hui Chen, a former compliance expert with the U.S. justice department, said that this target was roughly in line with other global banks. The bank told Reuters that the reviews showed its processes were too complex, but said it was making improvements and that overall controls to prevent crimes such as money laundering were effective. “We still need to improve in terms of internal processes,” it said, when presented with the findings of the reviews. “What the documents show is that our internal processes are still too complicated,” it said. “So it is not about effectiveness, but about the efficiency of our processes.” Deutsche executives met with the ECB, the euro zone’s banking supervisor, in late July, to discuss its control procedures, according to one source with knowledge of the matter. The ECB and Germany’s regulator BaFin declined to comment. Banks have been fined billions of dollars for lax oversight, including the failure to identify customers. In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay U.S. and UK regulators $630 million in fines over artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia. The U.S. Federal Reserve fined the bank an additional $41 million for failing to ensure its systems would detect money laundering in May 2017. Deutsche Bank is under pressure after three consecutive years of losses, and it agreed to pay a $7.2 billion settlement with U.S. authorities last year over its sale of toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The bank has also undergone management changes and a recent strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank. In Russia, the June report outlined problems including a “lack of verification of client address and existence” and a “lack of verification to be able to make an assessment of the client’s source of funds”. It also identified a lack of investigation into whether a client was a “politically exposed person” (PEP). Rules to fight financial crime require banks to identify such people because they present a higher risk of bribery or corruption by virtue of their position. These political figures could also be the target of international sanctions. In their 2017 ruling against Deutsche Bank for ‘mirror’ trades, New York financial regulators criticized the lender for “widespread and well-known weaknesses in its KYC processes”, singling out its Russia operations for shoddy standards. The issue remains sensitive because an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the case is ongoing. In a written response to Reuters, Deutsche Bank said: “We are not struggling with procedures designed to help prevent criminals from money laundering and other criminal action. “Our procedures to identify potential anti-money laundering and KYC risks are very effective,” it said of group-wide controls. The bank has multiple layers of defense to spot crime, such as monitoring fund movements for suspicious transactions, a person close to the matter said. Christian Sewing, who became the bank’s chief executive in April after a management shake-up, has vowed to address weaknesses in the bank’s controls. In June, he said the weaknesses had “arisen over many years ... We’re not yet where we want to be, but we’re steadily getting there.” Deutsche plans to work with regulators on deadlines for improving its procedures, the person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The internal documents show the scale of the challenge and highlight practical difficulties that arise as a result of staff changes in the United States and Ireland. “This is a new team,” the June report said, referring to Spain. For the U.S., it wrote: “U.S. has experienced high attrition rates and teams are still maturing in terms of capability against a backdrop of backlogs.” Deutsche said it was “not constrained by headcount”, that it had increased the number of staff involved in KYC and that staff turnover was not above average. It has also made improvements. The July report showed the pass rate in Russia improving to 67 percent after it hired auditors to help with customer checks. But additional shortcomings emerged elsewhere. Reviews of the KYC procedures in the document resulted in lower pass rates in six of 14 locations highlighted, including in the Netherlands and the United States."
-23.846762566066285," Deutsche Bank shifts euro clearing as post-Brexit landscape emerges FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has moved the clearing of a ""large part"" of new euro-denominated derivatives trades from London to Frankfurt, as financial firms ramp up their Brexit preparations. The shift by Germany's largest bank, which was confirmed by a spokesman on Monday, is a boost to Deutsche Boerse's DB1Gn.DE efforts to gain ground from London in the euro clearing market. This ensures a deal completes even if one side of a trade goes bust, as Britain exits the European Union. London Stock Exchange's LSE.L LCH division has long dominated clearing of euro-denominated derivatives like interest rate swaps, which are used by companies to cover themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs. The worry for the City of London is that if chunks of clearing move elsewhere, other activities like trading and jobs could follow, eating away at Britain’s biggest economic sector. LSE declined to comment on Deutsche Bank’s largely symbolic move, first reported by the Financial Times, which was widely expected given that its base is in Frankfurt and it is moving other activities there due to Brexit. The Deutsche Bank spokesman said no jobs were being transferred and that the bank was effectively pushing a different button to route the clearing to Eurex, Deutsche Boerse’s clearing division, rather than LCH. International banks with European bases in London have been opening hubs in the EU to avoid Brexit disrupting business. Meanwhile trading firm Jane Street, one of the largest players in exchange-traded funds, said on Monday it had opened an office in Amsterdam, giving it a location from which to serve EU clients when Britian leaves the bloc. [L5N1UQ402] The Dutch capital, with high-speed digital infrastructure in the heart of Western Europe, has become a favourite destination for trading businesses looking for an alternative to London. And Credit Suisse CSGN.S is looking to shift about 50 jobs from London to Madrid as part of its efforts to continue doing business in the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019, a source close to the bank said on Monday. [L5N1UQ53P] The European Central Bank in Frankfurt, which declined to comment on Monday on Deutsche Bank’s move, told Reuters last week that being connected to local market infrastructure like clearing is a requirement for a euro zone licence. LCH has see strong growth, with interest rate clearing at SwapClear up 23 percent in the first half of 2018 at $575.8 trillion, though a large chunk is denominated in dollars. A spokeswoman for Eurex said that it now has a market share of 8.9 percent in notional outstanding euro clearing, up from virtually zero a year ago, though still tiny compared with 89.07 percent for LCH, according to calculations from Eurex. Consultants Clarus have said the growth in Eurex has mainly come from euro denominated forward rate agreements (FRAs) or shorter-term products, rather than the full-duration rate swaps that LCH clears. There are also no signs that Deutsche Bank or its peers are shifting existing euro positions from LCH to Eurex, a cumbersome process that would take time and customer permission, bankers say. Deutsche Boerse has set up a clearing business model similar to that of LCH by introducing a profit-sharing scheme last October to attract interest rate swap clearing. There are now 29 firms in the scheme with more to come. “Our focus for the next six months will be to increase buy side activity based on the good price quality provided by the banks participating in our partnership program,” Eurex said. The ECB has long wanted euro-denominated clearing relocated from London to the euro zone, arguing it should have some oversight, given that it would be called on to inject euros in the market if a clearing house got into trouble. The EU is in the process of approving a draft law that will mean direct EU oversight of LCH in London after Brexit if it wants to continue clearing euro transactions for customers in the bloc, otherwise clearing would have to relocate to the euro zone. Officials at the Bank of England, which regulates LCH, have argued that splitting euro clearing would fragment markets and bump up costs for users, a view disputed by Eurex. “Given the costs that such a balkanised clearing infrastructure would incur for European corporates, we consider enhanced regulatory oversight of existing arrangements to be the most likely outcome,” Berenberg analysts said last month. But industry officials say a shift in some volume could even help LCH by making forced relocation less pressing. Some LCH euro repo clearing has already moved from London to LCH’s Paris subsidiary, but this may not be enough to satisfy the ECB."

-17.89819547460458," Two ex-Deutsche Bank traders indicted over alleged spoof trading (Reuters) - Two former Deutsche Bank AG traders have been indicted on U.S. charges they placed fraudulent “spoof” orders for precious metals futures contracts. James Vorley, 38, of the UK, and Cedric Chanu, 39, of France and the United Arab Emirates, were both charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy by a federal grand jury in Chicago, U.S. prosecutors said on Wednesday. The defendants had been among eight individuals criminally charged by prosecutors in January over alleged deceptive trading practices on U.S. commodities markets. Deutsche Bank agreed that month to pay a $30 million fine to settle related civil charges by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Lawyers for Vorley did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Chanu could not immediately be identified. Deutsche Bank was not criminally charged. According to the indictment, Vorley worked for Deutsche Bank in London from 2007 to 2015, and Chanu worked for the bank in London and Singapore from 2008 to 2013. The indictment said Vorley, Chanu and former Deutsche Bank trader David Liew engaged in a multi-year conspiracy to defraud other traders through spoofing, the placing of orders to buy or sell futures contracts that they never intended to complete. Prosecutors said this created a false sense of supply and demand, and manipulated prices in their favor by inducing other traders to make trades they would otherwise not have made. The indictment described alleged electronic chats among the Deutsche Bank traders to further the conspiracy. In one, Vorley allegedly told Singapore-based Liew that their activity “was cladssic [sic] / jam it / woooooooooooo .... bif [sic] it up,” prompting Liew to reply: “tricks from the ... master.” Liew pleaded guilty in June 2017 to a related criminal conspiracy charge. He has been cooperating with prosecutors. The case is U.S. v Vorley et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 18-cr-00035."

-17.89819547460458," Deutsche Bank cites progress on overhaul despite profit slide FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE new boss hailed significant progress in his efforts to reshape the bank, having cut a quarter of the staff at its global equities business, as the lender posted a decline in quarterly profit. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who took the top job in April, had made the equities cull a pillar of his plan to restore profitability. It is part of a wider effort to cut more than 7,000 jobs by end of next year. The details of restructuring progress at Germany’s largest bank came on Wednesday as it announced a 14 percent drop in net profit in the second quarter from a year earlier. The quarter was marked by weakness in its key trading business. “The last three months have given me confidence,” Sewing wrote in a memo to employees. “We’ve made a start and we’re already seeing the first signs of change in our results.” The company had more than 95,000 staff at the end of the second quarter. Deutsche Bank is trying to bounce back from three consecutive years of losses and has had a run of negative headlines, including an abrupt management reshuffle, a downgrade by Standard & Poor’s and failing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stress test. The bank’s shares closed down 1.4 percent at 10.31 euros and are down 35 percent so far this year. Shortly after becoming chief executive officer, Sewing announced plans to cut its global equities business, as well as U.S. bond trading and its business that serves hedge funds. He said the moves would be swift. Analysts at JPMorgan in a note to investors praised Deutsche’s efforts under Sewing to cut costs but said the bank “needs to deliver” on material restructuring given a “limited track record of delivery in the past”. The ratings agency Fitch, which in June downgraded Deutsche’s outlook to negative, said it saw challenges ahead. “The bank will also have to prove its ability to compete with peers, most of which have fewer constraints as they have completed their own restructuring projects,” Fitch wrote. “RIGHT DIRECTION” Deutsche had last week flagged that the quarter’s net profit would be more than double analysts’ forecasts in a rare piece of good news for the bank. Net profit in the second quarter was 401 million euros ($468 million), down from 466 million euros last year. Revenues were flat at 6.6 billion euros, halting a steep decline from previous years. “We’re making important changes to our core businesses as promised, we’re headed in the right direction on costs, and our balance sheet quality is strong,” Sewing said on Wednesday. Deutsche Bank is still struggling to repair its reputation. Its DWS asset management unit saw clients pull 4.9 billion euros in assets in the second quarter. “The noise around the bank” had “some impact there”, said Nicolas Moreau, CEO of the unit. At the investment bank, revenue was partly helped by a one-time gain of 57 million euros from a disposal in the quarter. Revenue at its cash-cow bond-trading division dropped by 17 percent despite more volatile markets, though the bank said it plans to funnel more money into the division. By contrast, some big U.S. banks posted sharp increases in profit as volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes stirred a rise in trading volumes across Wall Street. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N reported a 44 percent rise in second-quarter profit on Tuesday, driven by strength in its investment banking and fixed income trading businesses. “Our hope is that over time we will begin to perform and close the gap against the peers,” said finance chief James von Moltke on a conference call. “But we are focused on running our own race.”"
-17.89819547460458," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank will struggle even to hurdle low bar LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deutsche Bank’s actual second-quarter numbers are a reminder that it has a semi-permanent residency in the doghouse. Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s surprise July 16 pre-release of the German bank’s numbers briefly gave the impression of a halt to its decay. The difficulty Deutsche Bank will face in hitting even its lowball 4 percent return on tangible equity by the end of next year is a reality check. Sewing’s pre-release was because quarter results were better than feared. But quarterly pre-tax profit still fell by 13 percent year-on-year. Deutsche Bank’s already risible annualised return on tangible equity slipped by half a percentage point to 2.7 percent year-on-year. Worryingly, the biggest drop occurred in the investment bank, where Deutsche Bank’s fixed income and equity trading revenue fell by 17 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with quarterly increases enjoyed by peers on Wall Street. The underperformance is unsurprising given Deutsche Bank has been firing traders. Nevertheless, it sits uneasily with Sewing’s aspiration to remain a top four global trading house by revenue. In response, Sewing is squeezing his only available lever: costs. The bank is on track to meet its annual 23 billion euros cost base goal, with another billion euros in savings earmarked for next year. Even then he needs the top-line to stabilise, according to a Breakingviews calculation. Suppose Sewing hits his 22 billion euros adjusted cost base goal by the end of 2019. To achieve a 4 percent return annual revenue needs to flatline at 26 billion euros, assuming roughly 700 million euros in projected loan losses, a 30 percent tax rate and a similar tangible book value as today. That looks like a big ask given annual revenue dropped by 21 percent between 2015-2017, even without the deeper cost cuts which Sewing wants. Thus far, shareholders are giving Sewing the benefit of the doubt. After shares rose by 13 percent in the past month, far outperforming the EURO STOXX Banks index, Deutsche Bank is valued at 0.4 times tangible book, implying the bank could hit its return target. Even with that discount, there remains room for disappointment."

He added that the bank would rebuild its pipeline in its fixed income and currencies (FIC) business. “We have capital available,” he said. The lender, which is in the midst of a sweeping overhaul, said that plans to cut 25 percent of its equities business was largely completed. Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke added that the bank expects market volatility - which usually drives revenues - to improve compared to last year, but still remain muted. The bank stressed, however, that despite cuts to the business units like its hedge fund focused prime finance operations, it saw revenues increase and market share stabilize in the quarter. “Going forward, I do not expect that those (balance sheet) cuts in prime equities will result in lower revenues,” Sewing said.

UniCredit is forging ahead in a turnaround under CEO Jean Pierre Mustier after raising 13 billion euros ($15 billion) from investors last year to clean up its balance sheet.

-8.0724976115495," Oil drop hits European stocks, Deutsche Bank offsets losses LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday, led lower by commodity stocks as an upbeat update from Deutsche Bank and expectations of a strong earnings season kept a lid on losses. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX fell 0.3 percent, with the energy sector the biggest drag as crude prices fell sharply as concerns about supply disruptions eased. Basic resources .SXPP and autos .SXAP were also lower as data from key commodity consumer China showed economic growth slowed in the second quarter amid growing worries over a trade war with Washington. On the plus side, second-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to grow 8.1 percent year-on-year, an improvement on the first quarter. “Earnings results will likely be strong,” wrote JP Morgan strategist Mislav Matejka in a note. “...The guidances are the unknown, but we note that trade headlines might be losing some of the shock value as many investors now expect further bad news on this front.” Results drove some of Europe’s biggest movers. Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE shares jumped 7.3 percent to a six-week high after the German lender reported preliminary second-quarter results above consensus with a better-than-expected capital buffer. Worries over the bank's solvency have cratered its shares, down 36 percent year-to-date. Its gains on Monday helped lift the banking sector index .SX7P 0.3 percent. In other earnings-driven moves, fish farmer Marine Harvest MHG.OL fell 1.1 percent after it reported lower second-quarter earnings and harvest volumes below its guidance. Drugmaker Indivior INDV.L surged 16.9 percent after a U.S. court blocked India's Dr. Reddy's Laboratories REDY.NS from selling generic versions of its bestselling opioid addiction treatment in the United States. Kone KNEBV.HE rose 1.3 percent after a report that the Finnish elevator firm and Germany's Thyssenkrupp had held merger talks. Thyssenkrupp TKAG.DE was down 0.1 percent.

-8.0724976115495," Breakingviews - Deutsche Bank surprise points to fragile stability LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Three cheers for Deutsche Bank! The embattled German lender on Monday produced a rare positive surprise: second-quarter results weren’t quite as atrocious as analysts had feared. The fact that boss Christian Sewing pushed through deeper cost cuts without revenue plummeting suggests Germany’s largest lender has reached a nadir. However, despite an 8 percent jump in Deutsche’s share price, investors shouldn’t get too excited: a slump in trading revenue augurs plenty more pain to come. The unexpected mid-morning announcement, nine days before Deutsche is due to report results, was required because quarterly net income of 400 millions euros is more than double the 159 million euros projected by analysts. That was the result of cost cutting which yielded 200 million euros more in savings than expected. Crucially, revenue held up. The top line of 6.6 billion euros is broadly the same as last year’s second quarter, and better than the 6.4 billion euros analysts had penciled in. Equally important, Deutsche’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.6 percent at the end of June was around 30 basis points higher than consensus. Success is relative, though. Even after Monday’s bounce, Deutsche shares trade at a bombed-out valuation of 0.4 times tangible book value. Even that valuation looks generous considering that annualised return on tangible equity in the second quarter was little more than 3 percent, according to Breakingviews calculations. The first half of the year is usually more lucrative for investment banks, so profitability may yet decline. Trading revenue, which accounts for around a quarter of the group total, declined 15 percent year-on-year in the second quarter. By contrast, JPMorgan reported a 13 percent increase in trading revenue over the same period. Sewing still has to push through the bulk of at least 800 million euros in annual savings. And earnings were flattered by a one-off 100 million euro gain from selling assets. Having seen shares decline by 39 percent before Monday, investors can rightly welcome a fragile stability. Recovery, however, remains some way off."
-8.0724976115495," Deutsche surprises market with earnings forecast upgrade FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE expects second-quarter net profits will be more than double analysts' forecasts in a rare piece of good news for Germany's largest bank which is cutting costs to try to revive profitability. The stronger performance partly reflects higher revenues and a bigger drop in costs than analysts had been forecasting. It is a positive sign for new chief executive Christian Sewing, who took over in April and has embarked on plans to cut more than 7,000 jobs in an overhaul of the bank. But analysts and investors said it was too early to judge whether Deutsche was on a sustainable path to recovery. The bank’s unexpected earnings preview on Monday said net profit would be around 400 million euros ($468 million) in the quarter, more than double a consensus forecast of 159 million euros but still below 466 million euros reported a year earlier. The bank also halted a steep decline in revenue, which it said was around 6.6 billion euros, ahead of expectations of 6.4 billion. That is flat compare with the same quarter in 2017, when revenue fell 10 percent from a year earlier. “Management believes that these results demonstrate the resilience of the franchise,” Deutsche Bank said ahead of its full earnings report due on July 25. Deutsche Bank shares were up 7.4 percent at 1100 GMT, paring back earlier gains but still well ahead of a largely flat DAX index .GDAXI. The bank's shares are down 35 percent this year. The bank, trying to bounce back from three consecutive years of losses, has had a run of negative headlines, including an abrupt management reshuffle, a downgrade by Standard & Poor’s and failing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stress test. “It’s a bit of a relief that things are not all that bad, but I’m not sure if it’s premature to call this a change in the downward trend,” said Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon in Munich. Deutsche’s preliminary report said its key sales and trading revenues were down 15 percent, while revenues at the investment bank benefited from about 100 million euros from an asset sale. Neil Wilson, chief analyst with brokerage Markets.Com, said the share price rise could be a selling opportunity for some. “It is perhaps a little churlish to be too negative, but it remains something of a habit that is hard to shake given the last few years,” Wilson wrote in a note to investors. The bank said it had made progress on plans to reduce staff, with headcount down about 1,700 people to just over 95,400. Costs are expected to come in at 5.8 billion euros, compared with estimates of 6.0 billion euros, Deutsche said."

-2.9668433401505885," German government, JPMorgan deny report on Deutsche Bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government dismissed a report that it had privately raised concerns about Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, while JPMorgan JPM.N denied it was interested in a stake in Germany's biggest lender. Shares in Deutsche had jumped by as much as 6 percent on Friday after WirtschaftsWoche (WiWo) magazine said JPMorgan and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) 601398.SS might invest in the bank. By 1055 GMT, its shares had retraced some of those gains but were still up 4.8 percent at 9.98 euros . The weekly publication had also said Chancellor Angela Merkel met Axel Weber, the former Bundesbank head who is now chairman of Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S, to sound out his views on Deutsche. “We were astonished to learn about the report about a supposed conversation between the chancellor and Mr Weber,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. “It is purely speculative and cannot be confirmed.” The government had full trust in the bank’s management, he added. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said: “We are denying the story, it is not true.” UBS and Deutsche Bank declined to comment and ICBC could not immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Germany’s flagship bank touched record lows below 9 euros in June on investor scepticism about the appointment of Christian Sewing as CEO and his strategy to refocus on its European core while slashing global investment banking. Some investors have said they doubt whether Sewing, 48, can return Deutsche to profitability after the bank racked up three years of losses under his predecessor, John Cryan. He has been hobbled by downgrades to Deutsche’s credit ratings, while the bank’s U.S. subsidiary has failed a Federal Reserve test of its ability to withstand a financial crisis. Despite Deutsche’s woes, its franchise was attracting interest as London’s standing as a financial center is threatened by Britain’s looming exit from the European Union, investment bankers told WirtschaftsWoche. Bulge-bracket banks are looking to strengthen their presence in Frankfurt, as the German financial capital and seat of the European Central Bank gains importance after Brexit. Deutsche’s shares have fallen by nearly two fifths this year, reducing its market capitalization to below 20 billion euros ($23.4 billion). That compares to JPMorgan’s $353 billion and ICBC’s $274 billion."

6.967987495745655," Deutsche Bank investors unshaken by U.S. stress test failure FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank investors took a largely long view on its failure in this year’s U.S. stress tests, with its shares recovering on Friday from a record low hit earlier this week. Goldman Sachs analysts said the U.S. Federal Reserve’s issues with Deutsche Bank were “long standing” and “not new”, while UBS said the failure was “not a total surprise.” The Fed last year classified Deutsche Bank’s U.S. unit as troubled and Deutsche Bank’s shares had been falling in anticipation of the stress test verdict on Thursday. Shares in the German bank, which are down 42 percent this year, were up 1.4 percent at 9.19 euros at 1401 GMT, above Wednesday’s record low of 8.76 euros. The test was the second stage in the Fed’s annual health check of banks. Deutsche Bank passed the first phase last week, but was the only lender to fail the second, in another blow to its fragile reputation as it struggles to revive profitability. The Fed, which regularly checks banks’ financial strength, cited “widespread and critical deficiencies” in Deutsche Bank’s capital planning controls. “It does seems like Deutsche Bank at the moment is the worst student in the class that can’t get anything right,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy Opimas. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said the bank was making “good progress” on improving. “We are completely committed to work with authorities to get that even better ... over the next year,” Sewing said in an interview on CNBC on Friday. The bank said on Thursday it had made significant investments to improve its capital planning capabilities, controls and infrastructure at its U.S. subsidiary. The European Central Bank, which oversees Deutsche Bank, and German financial market watchdog BaFin both declined to comment. Deutsche Bank will now need to obtain the Fed’s permission before making capital payouts to its German parent. But the overall impact will be limited, Marenzi said. The bank may need to invest just about $10 million in additional stress testing technology and external consultants. Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon, said the Fed’s assessment could spook clients in the United States just as the bank tries to regain its footing there after announcing deep cuts in its U.S. and Asian operations. “The U.S. plays a major role for their investment banking revenues and if the U.S. doesn’t deliver the results they are expecting, what else does compensate for this? That is really a concern,” Huenseler said. Analysts at UBS said that, while expected, the Fed’s results are “an unwelcome outcome as it adds to weak sentiment and we think various stakeholders such as clients/counterparts could raise concerns.” The Fed’s assessment follows months of turmoil at Deutsche, which abruptly reshuffled management in April after three consecutive years of losses. It then began plans to scale back its investment bank to refocus on Europe and its home market. It has flagged cuts to U.S. bond trading, equities and the business that serves hedge funds."
8.500468330373067," Deutsche Bank fails Fed stress test while three U.S. lenders stumble WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG's DBKGn.DE U.S. subsidiary failed on Thursday the second part of the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual stress tests due to ""widespread and critical deficiencies"" in the bank's capital planning controls. The Fed board’s unanimous objection to Deutsche Bank’s U.S. capital plan marks another blow for the German lender, sending its shares down 1 percent after hours. Its financial health globally has been under intense scrutiny after S&P cut its rating and questioned its plan to return to profitability. The Fed also placed conditions on three banks that passed the test. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N cannot increase their capital distributions and State Street Corp STT.N must improve its counterparty risk management and analysis, the Fed said. Deutsche Bank last week easily cleared the Fed’s easier first hurdle that measures its capital levels against a severe recession, the strictest ever run by the Fed. Thursday’s second test focuses on how the bank’s plan for that capital, such as dividend payouts and investments, stands up against the harsh scenarios. “Concerns include material weaknesses in the firm’s data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress,” the Fed said in a statement. While failing the U.S. stress test would not likely affect the bank’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders, it will require Deutsche Bank to make substantial investment in technology, operations, risk management and personnel, as well as changes to its governance. It also means the bank would not be able to make any distributions to its German parent without the Fed’s approval and could potentially result in the bank further paring back some of its U.S. operations. In a statement on Thursday, Deutsche Bank said it had made significant investments to improve its capital planning capabilities as well as controls and infrastructure at its U.S. subsidiary and would work with regulators to “continue to build on these efforts.” The newly created U.S. subsidiaries of six foreign lenders, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S, UBS Group AG UBSG.S, BNP Paribas SA BNPP.PA, Barclays Plc BARC.L and Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO, went through the test for the second time this year had their results publicly released for the first time. Deutsche Bank’s results cover DB USA Corp, a holding company with $133 billion in assets, according to Deutsche Bank’s March filings. This includes all of Deutsche Bank’s non-branch U.S. assets, including its mortgage lending and debt financing subsidiary, and its sizable Wall Street broker-dealer trading business. The test results follow months of turmoil for Germany’s largest lender, whose shares are down 43 percent this year in Frankfurt. The bank abruptly reshuffled management in April after three consecutive years of losses. It then announced it would scale back its global investment bank and refocus on Europe and its home market. It has flagged cuts to U.S. bond trading, equities and the business that serves hedge funds. But Thursday’s result will raise further questions among analysts and investors as to whether regulators should take a tougher line and even push the bank to more aggressively pare back its U.S. operations. David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management, said he was “astounded” that the results showed continued risk management and operational problems at the subsidiary of a major global bank. “It’s like a plane that isn’t safe to fly because the flight systems are malfunctioning,” he said. The focus will now shift to European authorities and how they plan to tackle Deutsche’s problems, he added. The Fed otherwise approved the capital plans for 34 lenders, allowing them to use the extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes. These included household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, as well as major regional lenders like Capital One Financial Corp COF.N, PNC Financial Services Group Inc PNC.N and U.S. Bancorp USB.N. The country’s top regulator said it conditionally approved the capital plans for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley whose capital levels had been adversely affected during the test by last year’s changes to the U.S. tax code. Those banks will maintain their capital distribution levels in-line with those paid in recent years to bolster their capital cushion, the Fed said. After the results were announced, Morgan Stanley said that it will distribute $6.8 billion, in line with last year’s payout. Goldman Sachs said it would return up to $6.3 billion, including $5 billion through share buybacks and $1.3 billion in dividends, which will rise to a quarterly rate of 85 cents per share from 80 cents."

13.77650216937279," Deutsche Bank woes a positive for major U.S. banks: investor Kass NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund investor Doug Kass said on Wednesday that he is adding to his already large bank exposure in Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co as Deutsche Bank AG’s problems “will benefit large U.S. money center banks.” Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, said he believes Deutsche Bank, whose shares fell to a year low overnight, is weighing on the banking sector as some investors are concerned about Deutsche Bank’s large derivative portfolio and its counterparty risk with U.S. money center banks. “I view the current underperformance in banks stocks as an important intermediate-term opportunity to acquire valuable long term investments,” Kass said. “Deutsche Bank’s woes are actually a positive for U.S. money center banks that are rapidly gaining share in fixed-income trading and retail and corporate lending,” he said. Kass characterizes Deutsche Bank as the “next Black Swan for the EU economy” as shares are down 40 percent year-to-date. “Deutsche Bank is the Sears Holdings of the global bank industry,” Kass said. Like Sears Holdings Co, Deutsche Bank has no current profits, is in a state of operating flux, is being forced to sell assets, has an extremely low equity capitalization and a large and leveraged balance sheet, Kass said. “Consider that Deutsche Bank’s equity cap is only about $23 billion, compared to $170 billion for Citigroup - even though both have a comparable amount of assets on their balance sheet at $1.75 trillion,” Kass notes. Deutsche Bank generates less than $50 billion in revenue compared with Citigroup’s $65 billion. By contrast, JPMorgan has $2.5 trillion in assets, $200 billion of equity and generates almost $100 billion of revenue, Kass said. “Reflecting operating losses and a toxic asset book of European loans and sovereign debt, Deutsche Bank trades at only one-third of overstated shareholders equity compared with Citigroup at 90 percent of shareholders equity and JPMorgan at 1.8 times capital,” he said. But most disconcerting, Kass said, Deutsche Bank has an “opaque derivatives book - probably at about $40 trillion with an estimated net exposure of approximately $100 billion.” “Deutsche Bank’s financial and operating woes as well as those of other equally challenged EU banks and concentration on cost savings instead of business building have and will continue to inure to the benefit of the large U.S. money center banks who stampede towards gains in corporate and retail market share as well as taking share in global fixed-income trading,” Kass said."
13.3149582871505," UPDATE 1-Fitch downgrades Deutsche Bank outlook amid strategy concerns * Bank has come under pressure from ratings agencies * Follows downgrade by S&P earlier this month * Fitch sees “substantial execution risk” (Updates with details, background, no comment from bank) FRANKFURT, June 21 (Reuters) - The credit ratings agency Fitch on Thursday revised its outlook for Deutsche Bank to negative from stable amid concern’s about the bank’s restructuring and strategy, the latest blow to the German lender’s reputation. Germany’s largest bank has come under pressure from ratings agencies following a management reshuffle, a refocused strategy and a spate of losses. The move “reflects the substantial execution risk Deutsche Bank faces in implementing its restructuring and Fitch’s view that failure to strengthen its business model would result in the bank’s downgrade,” the agency said. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially crucial for a bank such as Deutsche, whose perceived health is important in winning business. Deutsche, which like all financial institutions, is among big issuers of debt securities and highly reliant upon credit ratings. Lower ratings can result in higher funding costs, which could further hamper Deutsche’s attempt to return to profitability after three consecutive years of losses. Earlier this month, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Deutsche Bank.. Moody’s has also lowered its outlook for Deutsche. Thursday’s move by Fitch comes after it downgraded the bank in September. Fitch, which kept its ratings unchanged, praised measures by Deutsche to shift resources away from its sprawling investment bank to retail banking and asset management. “But the bank’s performance in 2018 will be negatively affected by additional restructuring expenses and by likely pressure on revenue, and the bank’s modest return target for 2019 highlights the challenges it faces,” Fitch said. The bank’s longer-term targets depend on cost savings at the investment bank and the integration of its Postbank unit, “which will be challenging,” it said.

1.604280305228339," Deutsche Bank sells $1 billion non-performing ship loan portfolio: sources FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has found a buyer for the bulk of its bad ship loans as it seeks to draw a line under sour investments in the sector and to start a fresh push in transport lending, people close to the matter said. Germany’s flagship lender has agreed to sell a non-performing ship loan portfolio with a notional value of $1 billion to investors Oak Hill Advisors and Varde, one of the sources said. Deutsche Bank and Oak Hill declined to comment, while Varde was not immediately available for comment. There was no word on the price tag for the bundle of loans. Finance sources said the portfolio was expected to include some performing loans from shipowners rather than just distressed debt. “Deutsche has made various efforts to try and reconfigure parts of its portfolio including sales over the past two years. But for various reasons it has not happened. This time round they have been more focused and decisive,” one of the sources said. Deutsche Bank has been looking to shrink its exposure to shipping and other maritime lending, such as port facilities, over the last couple of years. At the end of March, its exposure to the overall sector stood at 4.1 billion euros, of which 3.3 billion euros were for vessel financing. Exploiting German rules that gave tax credits to owners of container ships, German lenders had become some of the biggest backers of shipowners over the past 20 years. Two years ago they were estimated to be behind roughly a quarter of the world’s $400 billion of outstanding shipping loans, although German banks’ share has since decreased as they have cut their exposure amid heavy writedowns. The clean-up of its transport financing book is part of Deutsche Bank’s deep overhaul, which also includes plans to reduce headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000. Christian Sewing, who became CEO in an abrupt management reshuffle in April, has said while the bank was committed to its international presence, it now wants to scale back its global investment bank and refocus on Europe and its home market after three consecutive years of losses. After the sale of the sour shipping portfolio only a small volume of non-performing ship loans remains and Deutsche Bank is poised to start increasing its exposure to the sector again, one of the sources said. In a sign that other banks are also rekindling interest in a sector that is emerging from its worst slump on record, Germany’s HSH Nordbank [HSH.UL], once the world’s biggest ship financier, aims to buy shipping loans from other banks and make new investments in the industry. HSH Nordbank had needed two bailouts, partly due to its high-risk shipping book, and was privatized earlier this year with taxpayers nursing losses of more than 10 billion euros."

-1.4899222861286021," Deutsche Bank CEO says Europe must create conditions for banking consolidation FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Europe needs to create the conditions for banking consolidation before the continent can form true European banking champions, Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE chief said on Tuesday. Christian Sewing, the new CEO of Germany’s largest bank, said that the German and European markets were too fragmented, with disparate rules on insolvency, consumer protection, and mortgage securities. “We don’t have a single market,” Sewing told politicians in Berlin. “At the moment, we have 28 individual markets.” Sewing said that large banks are a “gigantic advantage” and needed to compete with financial institutions in the U.S. and China. But it doesn’t make economic sense to create European champions at the moment, he said. “Even if a lot has already happened in Europe, we are far from reaching our goal of building a common banking and financial market,” Sewing said in prepared remarks. Sewing’s remarks appear to pour cold water on the idea of big cross-border mergers anytime soon. Last week, Deutsche Bank downplayed the idea that a deal with cross-town rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE could materialize soon, after Bloomberg reported that top shareholders had been consulted about a potential tie-up. “We will need strong international banks in Germany and Europe,” Sewing said. “And therefore the conditions for more consolidation must be created.” “We call for a common European market and an end to the fragmentation of the banking system. Only then will we be able to stand up to non-European competition in the long run - at least in our home market of Europe.”"

Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board chairman, Paul Achleitner, had consulted top shareholders and German government officials about merging with Commerzbank, Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. “The Chairman of Deutsche Bank is asked constantly about this matter. His answer is always the same: ‘All the pro and contra arguments can be read in analyst reports and the media’,” a spokesman for the bank said in written comments. “He sees no reason to actively raise this issue.” Deutsche Bank, Germany’s flagship lender, is searching for new avenues of growth after it was forced to retreat from a strategy of trying to build a global investment bank. There are currently no formal discussions between Deutsche Bank and its cross-town rival, and any such move is not imminent, Bloomberg said, adding that stakeholders are being consulted about a possible deal down the road. A key obstacle is Deutsche Bank’s depressed share price, with investors telling Achleitner that they don’t want a merger with Commerzbank at the moment because it would be highly dilutive and potentially trigger a capital increase and hefty write-downs, Bloomberg said. Spokespeople for Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and the German Finance Ministry all declined to comment. The German state, which now owns a stake of 15.6 percent in Commerzbank, will play a key role in deliberations about a deal between Germany’s biggest lender and its cross-town rival. A decade ago, Germany took a 25 percent stake in Commerzbank as part of an 18.2 billion-euro ($21.5 billion) bailout during the financial crisis, with Germany seeking to whittle down its stake over time. Now Berlin politicians worry about incurring taxpayer losses on the stake, for which the German government paid an average of around 26 euros a share. Deutsche Bank shares closed at 9.61 euros on Thursday, while those of Commerzbank closed at 9.47 euros. Deutsche Bank’s investment banking arm will bear more than half of the group’s planned cost cuts, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday, as he admitted that the lender would continue to lag peers in the second quarter."

We simply need to gain positive momentum.” Deutsche Bank has said it plans to cut costs to 22 billion euros ($26 billion) by the end of 2019 and has announced plans to reduce headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000, with a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, which are mainly in New York and London and where it has been losing ground to U.S. rivals.. In a first step, group headcount is to fall to below 93,000 by year-end, von Moltke said, adding this would help increase Deutsche’s profitability. It is targeting a return on tangible equity of more than 4 percent next year and of around 10 percent by 2021. By comparison, large U.S. banks have recently posted returns of 10-12 percent. “While some of you have argued that our plans are not radical enough, we believe that our plan, if successfully executed, should generate the best possible return profile for our shareholders,” von Moltke said. Christian Sewing, a Deutsche Bank ‘lifer’ who was appointed CEO in April after the removal of predecessor John Cryan, reiterated at a different event in Berlin that the bank will withdraw from business areas where it is no longer relevant enough.

-3.3014833500630636," RPT-COLUMN-Deutsche's dwindling market cap belies still-huge global footprint: McGeever (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Deutsche Bank’s dramatic fall from grace over recent years is that it’s still Europe’s largest player in world financial markets. The question is whether Germany’s biggest bank, with its share price cratering and a derivatives book nudging $50 trillion, can continue to shrink that footprint gradually, smoothly and with minimal market disruption. The bank’s new chief executive Christian Sewing has embarked on a plan to scale back its global investment bank to focus more on Europe and its home market. The potential for upheaval is greater if it cuts and runs from markets where it is a major force, like FX, credit or structured financing. But it is difficult to envisage Deutsche completely abandoning markets it is so dominant in. The test for financial markets is whether a bank with such a large and tangled web of exposure can downsize without having a disruptive effect on liquidity, trading and pricing. Deutsche’s gross derivatives exposure last year was over $48 trillion, although net exposure was $20 billion, and investment banking and trading revenue was $14.2 billion. All this was supported by a market cap of only $23 billion. That’s a lot of derivatives exposure for market participants to potentially absorb. As it is spread across multiple players, it makes these links highly opaque, increases uncertainty, and raises suspicion among market participants over who is most exposed. “If other banks and fund managers are not currently aware of their Deutsche Bank exposure I would be extremely surprised,” said Helen Thomas, an independent financial analyst and former banker. “Their risk is not counterparty exposure but market exposure, where Deutsche’s decline sets in chain an unwind of positions across the board.” The International Monetary Fund said two years ago that Deutsche, thanks to its links with other lenders, posed a greater risk to global financial stability than any other bank. Deutsche’s share price sank to a record low close of 9.1570 euros on May 31, valuing the bank at just 19 billion euros ($22 bln). That means it is the 83rd biggest bank in the world by market capitalisation, according to Reuters data. Yet it is still the sixth largest investment bank in the world, according to banking industry data provider Coalition. It is the joint second largest player in global credit markets with JP Morgan, the third biggest in G10 foreign exchange, and joint third in securitisation with Citi. The German bank is scaling back investment banking activities in the United States and elsewhere, and has already exited some markets altogether. Hundreds more trading jobs in New York and London are being cut. Other big banks and, increasingly, asset management firms are ready to move in. Analysts say there is enough capacity in the system to fill these gaps, as has already happened when Deutsche cut back in areas like commodities. There has been no noticeable market disruption there. Deutsche’s decline has been startling. Its share price is down 40 percent this year and down 90 pct from its pre-crisis peak in 2007 when then CEO Josef Ackermann was almost as famous in Germany as Angela Merkel. In 2009, Deutsche was the biggest FX bank in the world, handling 21 pct of the global currency market’s $4 trillion average daily volume, according to Euromoney. Last year, it was in fifth place, seeing 5.7 pct of the $5 trillion-a-day market. In 2011, Deutsche was the world’s joint second biggest bank with Goldman Sachs, behind JP Morgan, according to Coalition. Revenue from investment banking and market trading was 18.5 bln euros, and in bond trading, Deutsche was the stand alone second biggest bank in the world. Its market cap was $36 bln. But the contrast in Deutsche’s fortunes compared with JP Morgan could not starker. When world stock markets hit their crisis nadir in early 2009, Deutsche’s market cap was just over $13 bln and JP Morgan’s was around 4.5 times larger at $60 bln. Today, JP Morgan’s market cap is $369 billion, around 17 times larger than Deutsche. In that time Deutsche’s market share has mostly shrunk, it has paid out billions of dollars in fines around the world for a range of trading and banking scandals, and is on its fourth CEO in six years. Speculation that it will be taken over, merged with a domestic or euro zone rival, or even nationalised has been pretty much constant too. Investors don’t see much light at the end of the tunnel. Nearly $1 billion of Deutsche stock is currently out on loan - a key indicator of short interest and the highest of any global bank in dollar terms, according to data provider FIS Astec Analytics."

Ian Dorrington and Manfred Affenzeller will serve as the new co-heads of U.S. leveraged finance and report to Sean Murphy, who is co-head of global leveraged debt capital markets. The story was first reported by Business Insider. Affenzeller joined Deutsche Bank in 2005 while Dorrington joined in 2011. Both have worked on the leveraged debt capital markets team. The duo will replace Chris Blum and Scott Sartorius, who served in those positions over the past year. Deutsche Bank has experienced some turnover as the firm has seen its financial numbers weaken. S&P cut the bank’s long-term rating to BBB+ from A- on June 1 due to a “deeper restructuring” than the agency expected. The bank announced in May plans to cut 10,000 jobs globally.

The company came in eighth place in the leveraged finance league table, according to LPC data, during the first quarter of 2018 with 68 deals completed and a market share of 5.22%. The company was in the same position for full year 2017, when it underwrote 336 deals and had a market share of 5.52%, according to LPC.

3.989125237771292," Deutsche manager tells Euribor trial seeking preferential rates was ""fine"" LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - A Deutsche Bank manager, accused of conspiring to rig benchmark Euribor interest rates, told a London criminal trial on Tuesday that he saw nothing wrong with traders seeking preferential rates 13 years ago. Achim Kraemer, a 53-year-old German, told Southwark Crown Court that his job did not involve oversight of the bank’s daily routine of picking Euribor (euro interbank offered rate) estimates, which are used to help calculate a global reference rate for financial contracts worldwide. However, he told the jury he had been aware that traders had asked submitters for rates that would help their trading books at the time. The Serious Fraud Office prosecutor alleges bankers deliberately disregarded rules that Euribor should not be set with an eye on commercial gain, that they dishonestly plotted for rates to be false or misleading and risked prejudicing the economic interest of others. But Kraemer, the former head of money markets and derivatives in Frankfurt - who has become global head of liquidity and transfer pricing after a 22-year career at the German bank - said he never consciously tolerated improper or dishonest behaviour. His lawyer, Duncan Penny, asked him what he thought about traders asking rate submitters for preferential rates. “I thought it was fine,” Kraemer said. He added that rate submitters were responsible for deciding whether to take such requests into consideration. “It wasn’t part of my job...,” he said. “I didn’t pay much attention to it.” Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) cousin, is an average interest rate calculated after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing from each other over differing borrowing periods to an administrator. Kraemer, senior British submitter Colin Bermingham, Sisse Bohart, a Dane who reported to Bermingham, Italian-born former trader Carlo Palombo and former senior French trader Philippe Moryoussef deny conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor between 2005 and 2009. The group, aged between 39 and 61, is the first to be charged in relation to Brussels-based Euribor, a benchmark for rates on trillions of financial contracts and loans worldwide. Kraemer said he had only once met former Barclays trader and co-defendant Moryoussef, who is being tried in absentia, on a rare appearance by the Frenchman at a trade association meeting to improve trading standards. “He ... never seemed interested in doing work with the industry group,” Kraemer said. “I was starting to get annoyed with it (his absence), to be honest.” Helmut Konrad, a retired banker who helped set up Euribor in 1999, told the court on Monday that it was “okay” for banks to submit a rate from a number of options that were equally good, even if one rate would be more profitable for the bank. But asked under cross-examination whether Euribor would become a less true and reliable benchmark if three or four banks joined forces to try and influence rates, he said: “Yes, I guess if there are many banks I suppose it will have an effect.”"

Germany’s largest bank saw its shares slump to near record lows last week after a credit rating downgrade, reports the U.S. regulator viewed it as “troubled” last year and upcoming results of U.S. stress tests. Supportive comments by European Central Bank sources on Friday have helped Deutsche shares rise 6 percent off recent lows, while the yield on its 1.75 billion-euro CoCo bond, the most junior debt category, DE107205454= has slipped 200 basis points from last Thursday's 15-month high of 9.24 percent. But the bank is still in the sights of short sellers, who borrow stock in order to sell it, with the aim of buying it back at a cheaper price and pocketing the profit. Nearly $1 billion of Deutsche stock is currently out on loan - a key indicator of short interest and the highest of any global bank in dollar terms, according to data provider FIS Astec Analytics. Deutsche is also the most borrowed stock on Germany's blue-chip DAX .GDAX index, according to Markit, another data provider. Around 5 percent of Deutsche stock is currently out on loan, its highest level in more than a year. Funds with short positions in Deutsche include Marshall Wace and AQR Capital Management, according to regulatory filings. Both firms declined to comment on the rationale behind the position. Several bankers and brokers doing business with Deutsche told Reuters they were monitoring key stress indicators, especially short interest on Deutsche, but were not overly concerned. “Don’t get me wrong, the Deutsche situation is worrying – I’m watching the shorting interest closely - but nothing where we need to take action yet,” said a senior investment banker at a rival lender that does business with Deutsche. Meanwhile, options markets show traders continue to hedge against further share price falls on Deutsche. The open interest put/call ratio – a gauge of how many options are in existence that give the right to sell a stock as opposed to buy it – was 1.28 on Tuesday. The ratio can be volatile, but on a one-month average the ratio stands at 2.23, exceeding a peak during May 2014 and approaching levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. “Anything above 1 is indicative of bearish sentiment - people are buying more puts than calls - so the numbers at the moment suggest increased bearishness in the short term,” said Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at options trading platform IG Group. An option allowing investors to speculate on Deutsche's share price falling as low as 6 euros by December DBKGn060eX8.EX - more than a third below current levels - surged in value last week. Contracts speculating on the bank's share price falling through 8 and 9 euros in the next two months DBKGn080eS8.EXDBKGn090eR8.EX have been among the most traded options over the last week. However, short interest may be elevated because of the bank’s annual dividend - often so-called arbitrage investors short a stock during dividend payments. Such positions are not necessarily a bet against the company. The high level of “fear” in the options market could also be an indication sentiment has become too negative, and may present an opportunity to buy the shares, Beauchamp said. Two investment bankers who run bond sales for European borrowers pointed out Deutsche still manages a lot of business across Europe. Both bankers frequently work on bond deals alongside Deutsche. Deutsche ranked fourth in a league table of investment banks in terms of euro-denominated bond volumes underwritten in the first quarter of 2018, Thomson Reuters data shows. “If you look at the league tables, I would suggest that Deutsche’s demise has been greatly exaggerated,” one banker said. “They are still in a position where they can turn it around.”"
3.989125237771292," Australia charges former local heads of Citi, Deutsche, ANZ in cartel case SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities have charged the former local bosses of Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG with “criminal cartel offences” over a $2.3 billion stock issue, one of the country’s biggest cases of alleged white-collar crime. The tally of names disclosed on Tuesday showed the ambition of newly empowered antitrust regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which revealed on Friday it planned to seek charges against the investment banks over a 2015 share-raising for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), plus ANZ itself. The regulator said charges over the share placement have been laid against Citi’s former Australia head Stephen Roberts, its current local head of capital markets John McLean and its London-based head of foreign exchange trading Itay Tuchman, along with Deutsche’s former local chief Michael Ormaechea and former local capital markets head Michael Richardson. It said charges were also laid against ANZ, its treasurer Rick Moscati, as well as the two investment banks. “These serious charges are the result of an ACCC investigation that has been running for more than two years,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. He declined to comment further since the matter was before the court. ANZ, Citi and Deutsche have previously said they would defend the charges. After the names of the people being charged were released, Deutsche said it continued to believe it and its staff had acted responsibly, in the interests of clients and legally. “Both Michael Ormaechea and Michael Richardson are highly regarded and have our full support,” a spokeswoman said in an email. Citi, which has said the regulator appeared to have criminalized standard practices in capital raisings without warning, and ANZ were not immediately available for comment. The charges come at difficult time for Australia’s financial sector which is facing a year-long public misconduct inquiry that has brought embarrassing headlines on an almost daily basis. Earlier this week, the country’s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), paid a record A$700 million ($535 million) to settle a civil lawsuit in which it was accused of more than 50,000 breaches of anti-money laundering protocols. The charges against ANZ and its investment banks, which can carry hefty fines and 10-year prison terms, could lead to changes in the way institutional capital raisings are handled, and do further damage to the reputation of Australian lenders. The placement was made when Australian banks were under pressure to meet new capital requirements, which prompted ANZ and CBA to raise a combined A$8 billion in a single week. The regulators disclosed the names of the people charged after the close of share trading on Tuesday. ANZ shares closed down 0.3 percent, in line with the broader market, but are down 7 percent since the inquiry started in February. The ACCC has been building a team of investigators since cartel conduct was criminalized in 2009, and was further empowered last year with new laws governing competition. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which brought the charges on behalf of the ACCC, said further details would not be made public until after the first court appearance in Sydney on July 3."

1.992751319504214," Deutsche Bank faces another challenge with Fed stress test WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE will face another challenge this month when the Federal Reserve publishes the results of a ""stress test"" on the bulk of its U.S. operations for the first time. Germany’s largest lender is already facing challenges with U.S. bank regulators and in financial markets, with its stock price falling to historic lows on Thursday. Standard & Poor’s downgraded its credit rating to BBB+ from A- on Friday. The downgrade came after reports earlier in the week that the Fed designated one of Deutsche Bank’s U.S. businesses as “troubled” last year, something a person with knowledge of the matter confirmed to Reuters on Friday. The Fed’s stress test results, expected to be released sometime this month, will be the next big public barometer of Deutsche Bank’s financial strength. It could be difficult for a bank with a subsidiary on the “troubled” list to pass the scenarios, according to a person familiar with the tests who was not authorized to speak publicly. That is because the capital, liquidity and risk management failures that would land a bank on the list are similar to those that lead banks to flunk the stress test, the person said. The Fed has been examining how the biggest U.S. banks would handle a range of adverse economic and market scenarios since 2009, requiring many to shore up their capital buffers and risk management controls. But this is the first year it will publicly release results of six foreign lenders, including Deutsche Bank, after requiring them to create consolidated U.S. holding companies with ring-fenced capital. The Fed tested those new entities last year in a trial run, the results of which are confidential. Additionally, many of the foreign holding companies are relatively new and have had little time to get systems and processes in place to handle the tests, the person familiar with the tests said. On Friday, Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said the bank had been working to “strengthen our internal control environment and infrastructure and to address concerns that have been identified both internally and by our regulators.” This year’s scenarios are the toughest to date because the Fed raises the bar when the broader economic environment improves, with more extreme assumptions around unemployment rates for 2018. Reuters reported in April that the new tax code could also exacerbate the capital hit in the tests. In previous years, the Fed has publicly stress-tested Deutsche Bank Trust Corp, a subsidiary that includes its U.S. transaction bank and wealth management business. That unit passed last year but failed in 2016 due to ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine its capital planning process,"" the Fed, the bank's primary U.S. regulator, said. (reut.rs/296L4yH) This year’s results will cover DB USA Corp, the holding company of around $133 billion in assets, according to Deutsche Bank’s March filings. This includes all of Deutsche Bank’s non-branch U.S. assets, including its mortgage lending and debt financing subsidiary, and its sizable Wall Street broker-dealer trading business. That business is due to shrink as the bank slashes 7,000 jobs from its global workforce, particularly in trading, which has been a drag on its profits in recent years. Deutsche Bank, like many of its foreign peers, has been building up its U.S. holding company’s internal capital buffer. Its common equity tier 1 capital has hovered at around 16 percent over the past six months - a strong ratio relative to peers, according to public data. This year’s foreign bank holding company test involves both a quantitative and a qualitative assessment, giving the Fed broad powers to flunk a bank for control or risk management failures, even if it proves to be well-capitalized. Failing the test on a qualitative basis is not uncommon for banks taking the test for the first or second time, and it was the basis for the Fed flunking Deutsche Bank’s Trust subsidiary in 2016. While failing the U.S. stress test would not affect Deutshe Bank’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders, the Fed does have the power to force repeat offenders to restructure their businesses and remove board members."

1.992751319504214," Deutsche Bank gets ECB, key investor support as S&P questions strategy FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank, the ECB and its biggest investor sought to reassure shareholders and staff of its financial strength on Friday after S&P cut its rating and questioned its plan to return to profitability. Shares in Deutsche Bank closed at an all-time low on Thursday as past misadventures in high-risk investment banking haunted new Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s attempt to refocus on its more staid corporate banking roots. A source familiar with the thinking of the European Central Bank (ECB), which regulates Deutsche Bank, and its top shareholder HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] of China, separately said they backed management’s strategy of retrenchment. This followed a report on Thursday that the U.S. regulator viewed the lender as “troubled” last year, and on Friday a Standard & Poor’s credit rating downgrade to BBB+ from A-. Deutsche Bank shares were up 3.7 percent at 1235 GMT, although the cost of insuring against default . Meanwhile in Australia, federal prosecutors were preparing criminal cartel charges against Deutsche, as well as the country’s third-largest bank and Citigroup, over a $2.3 billion share issue. All deny wrongdoing. Sewing, a Deutsche Bank ‘lifer’ appointed in April after the removal of former CEO John Cryan, said in a letter to staff: “At group level, our financial strength is beyond doubt”. But the newsflow was “not good”, Sewing added as S&P questioned his ability to get Deutsche Bank back to profit after three years of losses by scaling back its global investment bank and refocusing on Europe and Germany. “We see significant execution risks in the delivery of the updated strategy amid a continued unhelpful market backdrop, and we think that, relative to peers, Deutsche Bank will remain a negative outlier for some time,” S&P said Credit ratings are crucial for banks, whose perceived health is important in winning business, and Deutsche Bank is a big issuer of debt whose cost is highly reliant on them. S&P had rated Deutsche Bank’s long-term credit at A-, on negative credit watch. That was one or two notches below most European competitors, with Switzerland’s UBS rated A+ with a stable outlook. Sewing also addressed U.S. regulatory concerns following the Wall Street Journal report that said the Federal Reserve had designated Deutsche Bank’s operations as in a “troubled condition”. The WSJ report had sent Deutsche Bank’s shares down 7 percent to their lowest closing level, valuing it at $22 billion. Although Deutsche Bank’s senior debt has held up well, its junior and hybrid debt instruments that would be vulnerable if the bank got into serious financial trouble have underperformed. Deutsche Bank’s 1.75 billion euro contingent convertible (CoCo) bond with a 6 percent coupon saw its cash price hit a 15-month low of 89.735 cent on the euro on Thursday, translating to a yield of 9.24 percent. It has since recovered to a cash price of 93.167 and a yield of 8.1 percent; still nearly double this year’s low in January. Sewing said Deutsche Bank’s credit and market risk levels had rarely been so low, speculation it was exposed to political uncertainty in Italy was unfounded, and funding plans for this year were well advanced. Deutsche Bank was also well positioned to react to excessive moves in debt markets, Sewing said, adding that a series of enforcement actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve were principally related to weaknesses in internal controls and infrastructure. “We have made progress in remediating them over the past year,” he wrote. “We’re not yet where we want to be, but we are steadily getting there.” And a source familiar with the ECB’s thinking made it clear that Deutsche Bank had made “good progress” in its efforts to address regulatory concerns. “The bank now has a tighter management team, good capital and liquidity, and supervisors are reassured by the plans they see,” the source said in a rare comment on an individual bank. Chinese investor HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL], which controls an 8 percent stake in Deutsche Bank, said it supported its management and strategy. “HNA remains committed to Deutsche Bank’s long-term success and looks forward to continuing to work with the management team in support of that goal,” a spokesman for HNA said.

1.624551106408564," Deutsche Bank's U.S. ops deemed ""troubled"" by Fed a year ago: WSJ FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The United States Federal Reserve last year designated Deutsche Bank AG's DBKGn.DE U.S. operations to be in ""troubled condition"", The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The Fed’s assessment has not previously been made public, it said, sending shares in the German lender down 7.2 percent to 9.16 euros, their lowest level in more than a year and a half. The “troubled condition” status is one of the lowest designations employed by the Fed, The WSJ said. The report comes a month after Deutsche Bank's new Chief Executive Christian Sewing announced plans to cut back bond and equities trading, where it has been unable to compete with U.S. powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs GS.N and JP Morgan JPM.N. Deutsche Bank’s attempts to break into the U.S. markets, which are seen as an essential plank for delivering a global investment banking platform, proved to be costly as it ended up paying out billions of dollars to settle regulatory breaches, prompting speculation at one point of a bailout by Berlin. The WSJ said that the Fed downgrade of Deutsche Bank’s U.S. operations caused the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to put Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas on its list of “Problem Banks”. The U.S. Federal Reserve declined to comment on the report. The FDIC was not immediately available for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the WSJ report and on its relations with the Fed, but said it was working to remedy weaknesses in its U.S. business identified by regulators, which it said did not affects its ability to serve clients. The three U.S. subsidiaries mentioned by the WSJ report - DB USA Corp, Deutsche Bank Trust Corporation, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas - account for less than 10 percent of the overall balance sheet of Deutsche Bank Group, it said in a statement. Despite potential weaknesses in parts of its U.S. operations, the parent Deutsche Bank AG remains well capitalised and has adequate liquidity reserves, it said. “There are no concerns with regard to the financial stability of Deutsche Bank AG,” it said. Thomas Hallett, banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said while Deutsche Bank has in the meantime started to cut costs and shift capital away from the United States, the news indicated the pressure the group was under from U.S. regulators. “The bank has failed to sufficiently restructure the business to operate in a low interest rate and regulatory constrained environment,” he said. Deutsche Bank said the recently announced strategic shift was not the result of the regulatory actions but part of a programme to increase the profitability of the firm. “We are fully committed to our Corporate & Investment Bank, Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses in the U.S.,” it added."

-1.296446503677733," Deutsche Bank looking to sell stake in Dubai-based Abraaj: sources DUBAI (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is looking to sell its small stake in Dubai-based Abraaj, the embattled private equity firm involved in a row over alleged misuse of investor money, two sources familiar with the matter said. The potential sale, which the German bank has been considering for some time, has become more urgent since Abraaj, the Middle East and Africa’s biggest private equity fund, has been locked in a dispute with investors, said the sources. Deutsche, which is undergoing a restructuring and said last week it plans to cut at least 7,000 jobs worldwide, has an 8.8 percent stake in Abraaj Holdings, according to the bank’s latest annual report. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the planned stake sale. An Abraaj spokeswoman said Abraaj Holdings could not comment on a matter related to its shareholders. Deutsche considers its share in Abraaj as a non-core asset. One of the sources said the bank asked for a valuation of its shareholding about two years ago, but the valuation was not as strong as hoped. As part of a global scaling back of its equities business, Germany’s largest lender has cut eight positions within its equities research team in Dubai as it moves to close the unit, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. The restructuring process added more urgency to the plan to get rid of its stake in Abraaj, the sources said. “There was never an active pitching process before, maybe they are regretting it now. Any sale now will be at a big discount,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is private. According to Abraaj’s 2014-15 annual review - the latest available on its website - Deutsche Bank had a representative on Abraaj’s board. A source close to the matter said that was no longer the case. A valuation of Deutsche’s stake is difficult because Abraaj has not disclosed the quantum of its debt, bankers say. One way to look at it, amid no visibility of future fund raising, is that Abraaj Holdings’ investment management unit is valued at as much as $500 million, one of the bankers said. Abraaj is facing an investigation by four investors, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank’s lending arm - the International Finance Corporation - over the alleged misuse of some of their money in a $1 billion healthcare fund. Following the row the firm, which has denied any wrongdoing, has been considering selling some or all of its investment business unit. The cash from the sale of the investment business unit, and from a sale of Abraaj’s stake in Pakistani utility K-Electric, would ease cashflow pressures that have seen the company violating certain conditions related to a portion of its debt, sources told Reuters earlier this month. Since the investor dispute erupted earlier this year, Abraaj, which at one point was managing $13.6 billion, has undertaken a review of its corporate structure. That has included cutting around 15 percent of jobs, shaking up its management, suspending new investments, and freeing up large investors from millions of dollars in capital commitments. In the latest sign of changes, Bisher Barazi, the chief financial officer of Abraaj’s private equity unit, and Matthew McGuire, the chief operating officer, have resigned from the firm, a source close to the matter said. Neither could immediately be reached for comment."

Its Moscow operation was also caught up in allegations over sham trades which resulted in the German bank paying $630 million in fines to financial regulators in January 2017. Borislav Ivanov was appointed Deutsche Bank’s Chief Country Officer for Russia in June last year, taking over from Annett Viehweg who left the bank after overseeing the Moscow operation’s restructuring. “We now have 1,250 people working in Russia, of which more than 200 are bankers and over 1,000 employees in TechCentre,” said Ivanov, referring to a Moscow-based subsidiary of the bank that provides IT services to the bank globally. “There are no plans to materially cut this number,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum last week. “Russia is a priority for us. And here in Russia, we have already concluded most of the planned transformation, and (we) focus on growth in our key business of commercial banking now.” Last week, Deutsche Bank’s new CEO, Christian Sewing, said the bank was cutting more than 7,000 jobs globally to cut costs and restore profitability."
3.1858451376195656," Deutsche Bank cuts eight equities research positions in Dubai: sources DUBAI (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has cut eight positions within its equities research team in Dubai as it moves to close the unit as part of a global scaling back of equities business, sources familiar with the matter said. The research analysts covered dozens of companies from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Turkey. The move could be a blow to Deutsche’s advisory business in the Middle East, where initial public offerings (IPO) are expected to accelerate led by Saudi Arabia, which is planning the $100 billion IPO of oil giant Saudi Aramco. Fund managers use research reports from analysts at investment banks ahead of an IPO, making it an essential part of the deal process. “The main reason you do equities research is to win business on the ECM (equities capital markets) and DCM (debt capital markets) side, so without the research it can become more difficult to win business,” one of the sources said. A Dubai-based spokesman for the bank declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak publicly about the matter. Deutsche pledged last week to cut at least 7,000 jobs under a restructuring. It said that in cash equities it would concentrate on electronic solutions and its most significant clients globally as part of the restructuring. The scale-back comes after Deutsche had expanded its emerging market research team in Dubai in 2016. Pascal Moura, the Dubai-based head of equity research, who made the announcement then, is one of the staff who has left the bank, the sources said."

-5.47718024482905," Deutsche Bank job cuts being felt from Britain to Australia FRANKFURT/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The impact of Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE pledge this week to cut at least 7,000 jobs is already being felt from London to Sydney. Germany’s biggest bank is cutting a team of 10 investment bankers in the British capital focused on deals in emerging markets, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The team, led by 18-year Deutsche veteran Philipp von Danwitz, learned of the cuts this week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In Australia, Deutsche DBKGn.DE this week laid off a handful of corporate finance specialists, including head of metals and mining Richard Gannon and head of infrastructure and utilities Andrew Martin, according to a second person. Deutsche declined to comment. Six hundred bankers have already been let go since Christian Sewing took over last month as Deutsche’s chief executive officer and announced a plan to scale back its global investment bank, refocusing on Europe and its home market after three consecutive years of losses. On Thursday, he said he would reduce global staff by more than 7,000, including 25 percent of the global equities business, which has a heavy presence in London and New York. Deutsche’s top investment banker, Garth Ritchie, told staff on Thursday that global head of equities Peter Selman would “provide more detail on the equities plan in the next few days,” according to a memo read to Reuters. The job cuts are hitting morale. “We will know in the next week what staff will be impacted. People are on tenterhooks,” one Deutsche bank employee in Australia said. “I honestly think everyone sitting there thinks every job is being looked at,” the banker said. “I don’t think any particular business is safer than others. People just want to know what the outcome is, to be able to get on with business, particularly for those working with clients.” Sewing tried to reassure staff in a separate memo seen by Reuters, saying that the cuts would “create headroom for investments in other areas” and that employees should have the “courage and the confidence to emerge stronger from this difficult period”. Deutsche is expected to shed more than 100 people in Asia, a third person with knowledge of the matter said. The cuts would involve mainly equities and fixed-income businesses, and in the first phase the bulk of the cuts is expected to cover roles that are not client facing. The latest restructuring comes at a very bad time for Deutsche in Asia, the person said. There was some expectation that they would be able to get some big clients in the equities business as part of Chinese stocks’ inclusion in the MSCI index, the person said. “There would definitely be some doubt in the mind of the new clients as to how focused Deutsche will be on the business, and therefore the bank’s ability to work with them for a longer period,” said the source. Some of Deutsche's equities business rivals in Asia including UBS UBSG.S, JPMorgan JPM.N, and Credit Suisse CSGN.S are aggressively pitching to the German bank's existing clients by talking about the restructuring, vying to take market share away from it in the region, three people familiar with the matter said. Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan declined to comment. Credit Suisse had no comment and UBS was not immediately available."
-6.030856434589883," Deutsche Bank axes at least 7,000 jobs in trading retreat FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is slashing more than 7,000 jobs to cut costs and restore profitability, while keeping its international reach as its new CEO seeks to reassure investors and clients. Germany’s biggest bank said global headcount would fall to well below 90,000 from 97,000, with a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, which are mainly in New York and London and where it has been losing ground to U.S. rivals. Deutsche Bank did not give a specific number, but a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters ahead of the lender’s annual general meeting on Thursday that it was aiming to axe 10,000 positions. Christian Sewing, who became CEO in an abrupt management reshuffle last month, said the bank was committed to its international presence, fleshing out his plan to scale back its global investment bank and refocus on Europe and its home market after three consecutive years of losses. Last month the bank flagged cuts to U.S. bond trading, equities, and its business serving hedge funds. “We remain committed to our Corporate & Investment Bank and our international presence – we are unwavering in that,” Sewing said, while acknowledging a “challenging” revenue environment. Deutsche Bank has already dismissed 600 investment bankers over the past seven weeks and will cut spending by 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) by the end of 2019 in its investment bank. “This reduction is already fully underway, and so far, due to the considered way we’ve handled this, we have not seen any meaningful revenue attrition,” Sewing said. Deutsche Bank has long been a default source of lending and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets, a role which has had the tacit backing of successive governments in Berlin. Sewing said that Deutsche Bank’s position as a competitor to the Wall Street banking heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, whose clout has grown in recent years, remained an important focus. “We are Europe’s alternative in the international financing and capital markets business. However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well,” he said. Another big European bank, BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, effectively ruled out any tie-up with the German lender as the French bank's chief executive told its shareholders that it was not considering big deals. “In the foreseeable future, the group has no intention to carry out large-sized operations, because it is not possible,” Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said, when asked by an investor at its AGM if BNP was “analysing” Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank has been losing ground to rivals in investment banking in all regions, Thomson Reuters data shows. Its ranking for investment banking fees fell to 10th from 8th in the Americas between 2010 and 2017,to 15th from 6th in Asia-Pacific and to 3rd from 2nd in Europe. Coalition data shows that in global equities, Deutsche has also lost market share in the cash, derivatives and prime services businesses over the same period. Overall in global equities it ranked between 7th and 9th in 2017 against a ranking of between 4th and 7th in 2010. The reductions will reduce the investment bank’s leverage exposure by 100 billion euros, or 10 percent, but KBW analysts said the moves were disappointing and its shares closed 4.8 percent lower, marking a nearly 35 percent decline this year. “We view this as confirmation of our view that drastic but necessary restructuring is impossible at this stage,” KBW wrote. “We remain concerned with their ability to generate free cash flow to support business growth post restructuring,” it said, adding that to achieve its target for a return on tangible equity of 10 percent, Deutsche would need 6 billion euros of profit, something the broker viewed as highly unlikely. The cuts are merely a first step and further details are needed, Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which holds Deutsche Bank shares, said. “We would have liked to see concrete announcements at today’s shareholder meeting,” he told Reuters. “We need clarity on how the decisions will affect the bottom line.” Deutsche Bank shareholders, who were fed with Frankfurter sausages and pretzels at the AGM, called on it to speed up the recovery process after months of internal turmoil. “It is high-time to ... end the years-long and still-popular ‘Deutsche Bank bashing’ and get to work finally getting our bank back on its feet after six long years of restructuring,” Klaus Nieding of shareholder lobby group DSW said. Chairman Paul Achleitner last month abruptly replaced CEO John Cryan with Sewing amid investor complaints the bank was falling behind in executing a turnaround plan. Achleitner defended his decision, adding that U.S. banker John Thain would head a new strategy committee on the supervisory board of the bank, which is also under pressure from credit ratings agencies. Achleitner survived a motion to remove him from the supervisory board, with only 9 percent of shareholders voting for the measure. In a separate vote, Achleitner received support from 84.4 percent of shareholders for his actions in 2017, below the rates of well above 90 percent that shareholders typically give executives and board members at AGMs. ($1 = 0.8543 euros)"

The STOXX 600 index fell 0.5 percent to an 8-day low, reversing earlier gains as global equities came under pressure after U.S. President Donald Trump cancelled a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Continued uncertainty over the make-up of the Italian government also weighed. Italy’s FTSE MIB index fell 0.7 percent to a fresh 7-week low after coalition parties called for the naming of a eurosceptic economy minister. German carmakers Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen dropped 1.7 to 2.8 percent after the United States began a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs. Germany’s benchmark DAX index fell 0.9 percent and Europe’s autos sector was the worst-performing, losing 1.8 percent. Deutsche Bank touched its lowest level since September 2016, ending 4.8 percent down after saying it would cut thousands of staff in a revamp of its investment bank. Analysts at KBW Research said in a note they found Deutsche Bank’s finalised business review “disappointing”, adding: “With the revenue loss from front office staff headcount reductions and expectations already at management target levels, we believe this is priced in and therefore leaves execution risk.” Deutsche Bank’s shares are down more than 31 percent so far this year. Aryzta was a standout faller among individual stocks. Its shares slumped 27 percent after the Swiss food company cut its full-year earnings outlook once more. Industrial distribution firm Electrocomponents jumped 16 percent after reporting double-digit growth in annual revenue and profit, while food ingredients firm Tate & Lyle rose 7 percent after posting higher annual profits."

-6.030856434589883," Deutsche to cull equities platform LONDON, May 24 (IFR) - Deutsche Bank is to cut a quarter of its equities sales and trading jobs as part of its wider plan to trim 7,000 positions across the bank to 90,000, with the main casualties in non-electronic roles and less lucrative parts of prime finance. The bank said 600 roles had already gone across the corporate and investment bank since chief executive Christian Sewing was appointed to succeed John Cryan in early April. Sewing had already said he wanted to reduce unprofitable areas, such as US rates trading. A key driver of the latest cuts is to reduce the CIB’s leverage exposure from the reported €1.05trn at the end of March. Deutsche wants this to drop by €100bn by the end of next year, with €50bn coming from removing services for some prime finance clients and reducing the book by 25%. UBS analyst Daniele Brupbacher estimated as many as 2,000 equities jobs could go. “This ... could yield more than €1bn of cost savings,” he said . Other analysts suggested the number would be lower. Deutsche declined to comment. Sewing told shareholders at the bank’s annual general meeting on Thursday that the reductions would help meet his target of capping costs at €23bn this year and €22bn next year. Deutsche also said it will aim for a 10% post-tax return on equity from 2021. The job cuts across the group will only incur a €800m one-off charge, he said, as not replacing leavers and imposing hiring freezes will reduce severance costs. He reiterated his resolve to make Deutsche a “trustworthy” bank again, for clients and shareholders. “If we publish targets we must meet them,” he said, cautioning that the cuts this year will hit trading in the CIB. “In the second quarter the revenue environment remains challenging. The restructuring will impact our results this year.” Supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner acknowledged the bank had not been as disciplined previously in meeting targets in this area. “Well formulated plans and promised measures had not been executed with sufficient discipline or rigour,” he said. “An alarming symptom was cost development – and the most striking element was in the size of our workforce. “You rightly expect management to achieve goals set but if they are at risk then the supervisory board has to take quick and decisive action,” he told shareholders, explaining why Sewing’s predecessor John Cryan had so swiftly gone in April. He said an internal candidate had always been preferred but two external ones had also been shortlisted but not Bill Winters nor Jean Pierre Mustier, chief executives of Standard Chartered and UniCredit, respectively. He said he was also investigating leaks surrounding the appointment. As well as reducing global equities and US rates severely, Sewing said the number of senior managers was being cut. On his appointment, the management board had been refined to remove co-heads of its major businesses, CIB and private banking. He said the bank was now looking to reduce the two layers below the top rank. “We’re in the process of significantly slimming down the two layers below the management board. Smaller committees, less hierarchy and more individual responsibility – that’s our motto.” Sewing is also targeting IT costs and promised to update investors on more details on costs and returns on equity. Soon after his appointment, Sewing said he wanted to ensure that the more volatile investment banking activities, beyond transaction banking, accounted for only a third of overall revenues. Within that he wanted to refine where Deutsche stands out. “We have to focus on what we really do well and where we realistically stand a chance of occupying a top position in businesses where we operate,” said Sewing. “We need to reduce the volatility of our earnings; it won’t do us any harm to be a bit more boring.” He intimated that equities capital markets would remain a core part of Deutsche’s operations alongside its larger debt underwriting arm. “We are committed to capital markets business,” he said. “We are staying international, acting in more than 60 countries. We want to offer a network to accompany German companies abroad. And we have to offer them more than loans,” he said, specifying its leading positions in global transaction banking and FX. “This is not financial acrobatics and has nothing to do with gambling.” Sewing said the bank wanted to retain its significant competitive advantage in other areas such as credit trading. It will also work to maintain its positions in corporate advisory and financing in selected sectors, such as high-yield bonds and commercial real estate. “We will focus on what we do well and scale back in some areas,” he said. “Where we decide to stay we will expand and capture market share. We want to remain Europe’s leading CIB with a global network.” He dismissed criticism from some investors before the AGM that the plan was not radical enough. “I take proposals like this seriously. I am all for being radical but first and foremost I am responsible.” (Reporting by Christopher Spink)"

Responding to a question from a BNP Paribas shareholder at its annual general meeting in Paris, Bonnafe said that the bank was always watching its competitors to learn “good” practices and ideas, but dismissed the idea of a big tie-up. Europe’s big banks put consolidation on the back burner following the financial crash and ensuing debt crisis, focusing largely on getting their own houses in order. France’s biggest bank now dwarfs Deutsche Bank in terms of market capitalization, at 77 billion euros ($90 billion) compared with the German bank’s 23 billion euro valuation. “In the foreseeable future, the group has no intention to carry out large-sized operations, because it is not possible,” Bonnafe said, when asked if BNP was “analyzing” Deutsche Bank. “We cannot transform, modernize and accelerate our business while engaging into operations such as major acquisitions,” he told investors. Sources close to Britain's Barclays Plc BARC.L on Wednesday said it is not actively exploring a potential merger with rivals after a Financial Times report that it could combine with Standard Chartered STAN.L.

Accendo announced the deal in late 2016, but was forced to put it on hold after a main InvestaBank shareholder was arrested in the United States on charges of laundering more than $100 million. Mexico’s banking regulator last year cleared the bank of wrongdoing in connection with the U.S. charges, allowing the acquisition to continue, although it slapped the bank with $1.3 million in fines for lesser violations. “We hope that it will be, at the latest, in June that the process of acquiring Deutsche Bank concludes,” said Gustavo Vergara, who took over Accendo as chief executive in mid-2017. The entity recently raised its capital from about 378 million pesos ($19.12 million) to 1.11 billion pesos after incorporating new partners, paving the way to purchase the Deutsche assets. Vergara declined to state the value of the deal. The InvestaBank shareholder accused of money laundering, Carlos Djemal, later pleaded guilty to wire fraud while the laundering charges were dropped. InvestaBank was created in 2014 when Investa acquired the local operations of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), and changed its name to Accendo in mid-May. The bank currently has 0.03 percent of the total revenue in the Mexican banking system. (Writing by Daina Beth Solomon, editing by G Crosse)"

The German bank’s supervisory board met on Wednesday evening to talk about job cuts and other details of a broad restructuring plan ahead of the company’s annual general meeting on Thursday. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the job cuts on Wednesday, adding that they were likely to extend into 2019.

Bloomberg News reported the bank was planning to withdraw from a number of equities markets across the globe. The Bloomberg report, which cited unidentified people, said that Deutsche would sharply scale back its presence in the United States, and had started cutting activities in Central Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Chairman Paul Achleitner and newly appointed chief executive Christian Sewing are expected to provide further details of the loss-making bank’s refocused strategy at the gathering of up to 4,500 shareholders in Frankfurt on Thursday. Deutsche Bank has said it will scale back its sprawling global investment bank and lean more heavily on retail banking and asset management, following months of turmoil which have also led to calls for Achleitner’s departure, following his ousting of former CEO John Cryan in April. “Achleitner will need to demonstrate more effective leadership at the top of the supervisory board,” Hans-Christoph Hirt, head of shareholder adviser Hermes EOS at Hermes Investment Management, said in a statement on Tuesday. Shares in Deutsche Bank, which declined to comment, have fallen nearly 32 percent this year and Hirt said the 61-year-old banker, who has been chairman since 2012, “bears ultimate responsibility” and that plans should be made to replace him. Germany’s biggest lender is also under pressure from credit ratings agencies, with Standard & Poor’s expected to say by the end of the month whether it will cut Deutsche Bank’s rating after putting it on “credit watch” in April. A small but vocal shareholder faction led by Riebeck-Brauerei will vote to oust Achleitner, after successfully having the item added to the official AGM agenda. Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board said in a statement that it “has never had, and still does not have, any doubts concerning Dr. Achleitner’s comprehensive personal and professional skills and integrity”. Achleitner will not be the only top figure under pressure, with Sewing also firmly in the spotlight. Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW told Reuters that he will urge Sewing “to step on the gas from the very beginning. He has no more time and must deliver quickly”. “The capital markets won’t just stand back and watch if Deutsche Bank needs additional years for restructuring after more than five years of restructuring already. The bank can’t afford this any more,” Nieding added. Deutsche Bank has so far provided few details of plans to scale back investment banking in the U.S. and Asia. It is expected to cut around 1,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce in the United States, a person familiar with the matter said. Some shareholders say that high level changes, including Cryan’s exit, could be a smokescreen for bigger problems. Hirt at Hermes said they “could simply mask an underlying problem, namely, the lack of an implementable strategy that creates value for shareholders and other stakeholders.”"

-14.905255806112994," German court backs jail term for Deutsche banker's role in carbon tax fraud KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s federal supreme court on Tuesday sentenced a former Deutsche Bank employee to three years in prison for his role in a carbon emission permit trading scheme designed to curb global warming but used to fraudulently collect tens of millions of euros of sales tax. The ruling by the Federal Court of Justice affirmed the 2016 lower-court conviction of Helmut Hohnholz, formerly a regional sales manager with Deutsche’s global markets division. The court also backed the judgments against three other former Deutsche bankers, who two years ago received suspended jail sentences. The case of one former employee of Deutsche’s tax accounting division was referred back to lower court as his active role in the crime could not be fully proven. The case stems from an investigation into so-called carousel trades in the European Union’s carbon market in 2009 and 2010, in which some buyers imported emissions permits into one EU country without paying value-added tax (VAT). The buyers sold the permits designed to put a price on pollution to each other, adding VAT to the price and generating tax refunds when no tax had been paid. European police agency Europol has estimated the cost to taxpayers at more than 5 billion euros ($6 billion) since 2008. Hohnholz had been accused of ignoring all question marks over the scheme. According to the judge presiding the 2016 trial, he had coordinated the trading of carbon emissions in Germany for Deutsche and was “the culprit, not the helper” in collecting 145 million euros of taxes. The scheme had been run purely to trick tax authorities out of a total of 220 million euros and had revealed a “failure of all security mechanisms” at Deutsche Bank, the judge had said at the time. The trial followed a years-long probe that involved trawling millions of emails and thousands of recorded telephone conversations. Of the seven former Deutsche Bank employees originally on trial in Frankfurt, two had accepted the court ruling, while five had appealed it. The prosecutors had also appealed the ruling, criticizing that four of the defendants had not been sentenced as culprits, but only as accessories to the tax fraud. Deutsche Bank had repaid the tax, changed its internal processes and parted with the staff involved. It declined to comment on Tuesday. Germany’s flagship lender is in the throes of a major restructuring, hamstrung by having to pay out billions of euros of fines to end a slew of legal rows."

-14.928328533995044," Deutsche Bank has no plans to pull out of Asian countries - CEO FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has no plans to pull out of Asian countries as it restructures its global business, Chief Executive Christian Sewing told staff and clients on his first visit to the region in his new role. After taking the helm at Germany’s flagship lender last month, Sewing announced plans to cut back its U.S. investment banking activities where it has been unable to break the grip of the U.S. powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The bank’s business in Asia, however, remains key to the lender’s global success, Sewing told a company town hall meeting in Singapore on Monday, according to a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank. “We can only be relevant to our clients if we continue to be strong in Asia,” he also told a client meeting. Of Deutsche Bank’s top 100 clients globally, 88 are doing business with it on matters related to Asia, he added. After announcing plans to cut back in U.S. investment banking, Sewing vowed to invest in German retail banking and asset management in Europe. With respect to Asia, he had said Deutsche Bank would reduce its commitment to sectors with limited cross-border activity, but on Monday he stressed that the bank will continue its business of helping foreign clients in the region - which is in the bank’s roots, given its history of financing German businesses’ global expansion. “Our first steps outside of Germany nearly 150 years ago were in fact in this region, in China and Japan. We knew then, as we know now, how fundamental Asia is to our global business,” Sewing said. Deutsche Bank is present in 15 Asian countries including Japan, China, Singapore and India. It employs about 19,000 staff in Asia. The bank is planning cuts of more than 100 jobs in its Asian investment banking operations, according to a source familiar with the matter. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on potential job cuts in the region. By contrast, Deutsche Bank is expected to cut around 1,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce in the United States, the largest global market for investment banking fees, a different person familiar with the matter said last month. Deutsche Bank has traditionally been stronger in Asia than in the United States, ranking fifth globally in 2017 investment banking revenues in Asia, compared to eighth position in the United States and second place in Europe, according data from research firm Coalition.

-14.928328533995044," Credit raters put pressure on Deutsche Bank over new strategy FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE new chief executive Christian Sewing needs to come up with a convincing strategy swiftly to stave off the threat of costly credit downgrades, the leading rating agencies told Reuters. Standard & Poor’s is expected to say by the end of the month whether it will cut the rating of Germany’s largest lender after putting it on “credit watch” in April. Chances of a downgrade are “at least 50 percent”, Giles Edwards, S&P’s lead ratings analyst on Deutsche Bank, said in an interview with Reuters. S&P, like its counterparts Moody’s and Fitch, is awaiting details on Deutsche’s future strategy after the bank announced the outline of a revamp last month. “We want to see that it’s not going to take a lot longer than previously thought to deliver, that it’s not going to be more expensive, and that it is credible,” S&P’s Edwards told Reuters. “Banks need their clients to be confident.” Edwards and the other analysts interviewed for this article are the lead or primary analysts at their agencies for Deutsche Bank. Final decisions on ratings are made by committees of which they are a part. S&P rates Deutsche Bank's long-term credit at A-, on negative credit watch. That is one or two notches below most major European competitors. By comparison, S&P rates Switzerland's UBS UBSG.S at A+ with a stable outlook. Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially crucial for a bank such as Deutsche, whose perceived health is important in winning business. Sewing, who has been with Deutsche for almost three decades, announced in late April that the bank would pare back the U.S. and Asia operations of its sprawling investment bank and refocus on Germany and Europe. He also said that Deutsche would invest in retail banking in its home market and in asset management. The bank holds its annual general meeting on May 24 and is expected to provide more details on strategy by then. The bank’s credit ratings have come under pressure in the weeks since it announced the promotion of retail banking specialist Sewing following a board meeting on the evening of Sunday April 8. Three of four major ratings agencies have warned of a dimmer outlook for the bank, with DRBS being the latest last week. A lot is riding on the ratings calls for Deutsche, which like all financial institutions, is among big issuers of debt securities and highly reliant upon credit ratings. Lower ratings can result in higher funding costs, which could further hamper Deutsche’s attempt to return to profitability after three consecutive years of losses. The bank said earlier this year that it had fallen behind in its original 2018 cost cutting targets as revenue dwindles. Deutsche has also been struggling to win back clients after speculation of a government bailout in 2016, and any vote of less confidence from ratings agencies could send anxious customers scurrying, analysts say. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on its ratings but Dixit Joshi, the bank’s group treasurer, told fixed-income analysts this month that Deutsche was disappointed by the agencies’ stance. “We don’t think our ratings accurately reflect the strength of our balance sheet and our low risk levels, but we will continue to work with the agencies to allay their concerns,” Joshi said. Those concerns were heightened after the ousting of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan last month and the departure of several other senior executives. Moody’s changed its outlook to negative on some of its ratings the day after Sewing announced changes at the investment bank amid “rising execution challenges at Deutsche Bank.” Peter Nerby, lead analyst for Moody’s on Deutsche Bank, told Reuters in an interview that the agency normally resolves changes in outlook in 12 to 18 months. Nerby is studying the timing and path toward his definition of an “idealized future state” for the bank, which he defines as 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in annual profit and 30 billion euros in revenue. Last year, the bank posted a loss of 735 million euros and generated 26 billion euros in revenue. “If we conclude that goal is not achievable in any reasonable time frame, then the rating may be too high,” Nerby said. Fitch is the only major agency to refrain so far from any formal change in rating or outlook, though it downgraded Deutsche Bank last September. Christian Scarafia, Fitch’s primary analyst on Deutsche, said in an interview that the September downgrade “spoke to what we’ve then seen developing in the fourth quarter last year and first quarter of this year.” Last month, he warned that the bank’s turnaround “has been slow and insufficient” and that “quick results will be crucial”. The weak start to 2018 “puts pressure on to implement the turnaround,” Scarafia said. “The sensitivities remain very clear.” ($1 = 0.8391 euros)"

Germany’s largest lender, under new Chief Executive Christian Sewing, called time last week on its strategy of being a global investment bank, a move expected to lead to a cut of around 10 percent of its U.S. workforce. An internal memo from Mark Fedorcik, co-head of corporate and investment banking in the Americas, said while the bank was committed to the other economic areas covered by its U.S. investment bank, including financial services and healthcare, it wanted to focus on sectors in which it had the greatest strength. “We have decided to rationalize our U.S. oil and gas investment banking coverage footprint which will include closing our Houston office,” the memo said. The move would likely affect around 50 people employed in covering oil and gas, according to a source familiar with the matter. Deutsche Bank would continue to service U.S. oil and gas clients seeking debt capital markets and corporate banking treasury products.

Here we want to grow and gain market share. Especially in Europe, we are the first choice for many investment bankers.” The credit ratings agency Moody’s on Friday changed its outlook to “negative” on some of its Deutsche Bank ratings. The ouster of CEO John Cryan, his replacement with Christian Sewing, and changes in focus at the lender “highlight the strategic turmoil,” Moody’s said. “It is not clear how management will create an investment bank more focused on European clients that can compete effectively against more diversified global peers, while also earning acceptable returns,” the agency said. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the change in Moody’s rating outlook. The bank’s shares fell 3.4 percent on Friday. Credit Suisse analysts said they had cut their estimates for Deutsche Bank’s revenue in 2020 by 20 percent.

-14.017844359040676," Deutsche Bank calls time on Wall Street in retreat to Europe FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank moved to end its nightmare on Wall Street on Thursday as its new chief executive Christian Sewing called time on three expensive decades struggling to become a global investment bank with a retreat to Europe. Sewing said Deutsche would cut back bond and equities trading, where it has been unable to break the grip of the U.S. powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, and would invest in German retail banking and asset management in Europe. Deutsche Bank’s attempts to break into the U.S. markets, which are seen as an essential plank for delivering a global investment banking platform, proved to be costly as it ended up paying out billions of dollars to settle regulatory breaches, prompting speculation at one point of a bailout by Berlin. Other European banks have also tried and failed over the years, often hiring bankers at great cost or buying smaller Wall Street players in the hope of gaining critical mass. Deutsche Bank’s cull has already begun, one source said, with around 300 U.S. based investment bankers fired on Wednesday and another 100 due to leave Germany’s largest bank by Friday. These job cuts were “painful but regrettably unavoidable to ensure our bank’s competitiveness in the long run”, Sewing, who has a background in retail banking, auditing and risk, said. “Deutsche Bank is deeply rooted in Europe – here we want to provide our clients access to global financing and treasury solutions,” he added, just weeks after becoming its CEO. Sewing broke the restructuring news as Deutsche Bank reported a 79 percent fall in its first quarter net profit. The moves are the initial product of a review known as Project Colombo, which is likely to lead to further cuts, bankers said. Investment banking now accounts for 54 percent of Deutsche Bank’s revenues, which fell across all divisions in the first quarter of the year, underlining the enormity of the challenge. The bulk of the cuts will focus on the U.S. and Asia and involve scaling back business with hedge funds. Restructuring costs for 2018 were likely to hit 800 million euros, from an earlier 500 million euro target, as a result, Sewing added. Shares in the bank were down by 2.8 percent at 1355 GMT as analysts and investors dissected the figures and sought answers to strategic questions left unanswered by the announcement. “There are a lot of open questions,” said Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon, which owns Deutsche Bank shares and is a critic of the bank. These included how the new focus on retail will lift Deutsche Bank’s revenue and profit, Huenseler added. Germany’s fragmented banking sector is dominated by cooperative lenders and municipally owned savings banks, while wealth management in the region is dominated by traditional private banks like UBS and Credit Suisse, whose base in Switzerland gives them a competitive advantage. Sewing said the first quarter results showed the need for “immediate action”, adding that shareholder returns were “not acceptable”. Earnings fell far short of analysts’ expectations, with net income of 120 million euros below the forecast of 379 million, according to a Reuters poll. The figure was also below the 575 million euros posted in the first quarter of last year. Hendrik Leber, a fund manager with Acatis, which owns Deutsche Bank shares, said the measures announced on Thursday were “small and moderate” and predicted the bank would make “much more considerable” cuts in three months time. Although the cuts were expected to have a negative impact on 2018 revenues, they would improve returns in the medium term, Deutsche Bank said, adding it would scale back U.S. rates sales and trading and expected to reduce its global equities platform. Overall, the bank expects revenues in its bond trading activities to be flat this year and lower in its equities trading and in advisory business, after a steep slide in all three in the first quarter. By contrast, Goldman Sachs GS.N said this month that is so confident in its recent business boom, especially in trading, that it will pause share buybacks and instead use capital to facilitate trades, loans and deals for customers. All major Wall Street banks have reported bumper first-quarter earnings thanks to a surge in stock trading activity, while Deutsche Bank conceded market share losses. Deutsche Bank was founded during the Industrial Revolution to finance Germany companies abroad, but it aggressively changed course 30 years ago, buying British merchant bank Morgan Grenfell and then Banker’s Trust in New York. “That was the cardinal sin,” Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said, adding that the powerful investment bank took on a life of its own and faced little supervision from Frankfurt."

-14.017844359040676," Breakingviews - Diminished Deutsche Bank resembles cut-price BNP LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - After Deutsche Bank accidentally transferred 28 billion euros to a counterparty a few weeks ago, some joked that the payment was a deferred bonus for former CEO Anshu Jain. Four years after his departure, the German lender is still grappling with the global investment banking business that he championed. New boss Christian Sewing’s plan to scale back equities trading, and make cuts in the United States and Asia, finally lays that vision to rest. Any lingering illusion that Deutsche can be a global competitor was blown away by first quarter results. Even excluding currency movements and numerous one-off charges, revenue from trading fixed income and currencies was down 12 percent, while equities revenue was broadly flat. That was despite the return of market volatility which Deutsche had previously reassured shareholders would revive those businesses. Yet while Sewing’s belated recognition of Deutsche’s diminished status is welcome, the future remains daunting. The 47-year-old wants to boost the bank’s “sustainable” - or less volatile – revenue sources such as German retail lending, asset management, and providing cash management and treasury services to European companies. The plan is that those businesses should bring in 65 percent of group revenue by 2021, up from roughly 63 percent last year. Continental rivals like BNP Paribas, whose investment banking division brings in just 27 percent of revenue, are the model. The problem is that Deutsche is beginning yet another restructuring from a much lower base of profitability than its Gallic rival, which earned an underlying 11 percent return on tangible equity last year. Deutsche, which reported a negative return last year, has few of BNP’s strengths. Germany is Europe’s least profitable retail banking market. Though an end to the European Central Bank’s negative interest rates would help, the 25 billion euro lender needs a sustained revenue boost to have any hope generating an acceptable return on equity. A decade since Deutsche’s restructuring began, the real transformation is only just beginning."

Kuhnke replaces Kim Hammonds, who stepped down last week, having come under pressure after critical comments she made about the bank became public. Unlike Hammonds, Kuhnke will not be a member of the management board, but he will regularly attend its meetings, Deutsche Bank said. In a statement, Deutsche’s chief executive officer Christian Sewing said that Kuhnke would simplify the bank’s technology and cut costs. “He is able to systematically make complex processes and structures more efficient,” Sewing said. Deutsche has shaken up its top managers in the past few weeks after investors became frustrated with the bank, which has had three years of losses. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan was ousted, replaced by his deputy Sewing, and a top investment banker, Marcus Schenck, also left the bank. Kuhnke joined Deutsche in 1986 and has worked in Tokyo, London, New York and Germany. Since January 2016, he was divisional control officer, chief administrative officer and also head of operations of Deutsche’s private and commercial bank."

-14.38100140803386," ECB asks Deutsche Bank to simulate costs of winding down trading: CFO FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has asked Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE to estimate the costs of winding down the trading operations of its investment bank, the first such simulation by one of Europe's biggest banks, Deutsche's finance chief said on Monday. But Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said the ECB’s request was not an unusual exercise and that it was totally unrelated to Deutsche’s internal review of its global investment bank. “We think we are first in the queue here because we are the largest capital markets bank in the ECB’s supervision,” von Moltke said in an interview with Reuters. The timing of the simulation is sensitive because Deutsche Bank’s investment banking division has been losing market share and key staff, contributing to three consecutive years of losses at Germany’s largest lender. Last week, Deutsche ousted its chief executive John Cryan and Marcus Schenck, one of the heads of the investment bank, also left. The management upheaval has added to speculation that Deutsche Bank might slim down its sprawling investment banking operation. An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment on individual banks. “There are in general various exercises such as recovery plans which the supervisor asks banks to provide,” she said. “In any case, the ECB does not intervene in any business model decision of banks.” Deutsche Bank, by talking publicly about normally private supervisory exercises, wants to avoid the impression that regulators are worried about the investment bank. The bank has stabilized since late 2016, when speculation mounted that it would need a government bailout in the wake of huge fines from U.S. authorities. Global regulators are working on unified procedures for such exercises like the one that Deutsche is conducting. Regulators are primarily focused on big global banks that trade risky securities like derivatives. The regulators have categorized some banks as “sytemically important” because of their size. They have identified Deutsche Bank as the most systemically important bank in the euro zone. Regulators in Britain have already conducted a similar simulation with Deutsche’s London-based arm. The exercise can shed light on whether a sudden halt of trading activities would require government guarantees or support from taxpayers, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in its Monday edition. The German paper was the first to report the news of the simulation. “This (the exercise) doesn’t have any connection to any sort of state aid,” von Moltke said. Deutsche Bank began the task in late January and expects to conclude it in the third quarter."

-14.38100140803386," ECB asks Deutsche Bank to gauge investment banking exit costs: source FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has been asked by European Central Bank supervisors to calculate the potential costs of winding down its investment banking operations, a source told Reuters on Sunday. Germany’s biggest lender has been calculating the financial effects of a potential move to quit investment banking for some time, and the move is not related to the switch in Deutsche Bank’s top management position last Sunday when retail banking expert Christian Sewing was appointed to replace chief executive John Cryan. The point of the exercise is to estimate how the value of Deutsche Bank’s capital market and derivatives business would develop if the bank was to exit abruptly from new business, the source said on condition he not be named because the matter is confidential. Deutsche Bank said it “routinely” calculates the consequences of an orderly winding-down of positions in trading books for regulators. The ECB declined comment. Germany’s daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung was first to report on Deutsche Bank’s explorations induced by the ECB, saying other lenders are to face similar requests at a later stage. Deutsche Bank is already in the middle of a global review of the investment bank, known internally as Project Colombo, to determine the way forward as revenues shrink and clients and staff leave."
