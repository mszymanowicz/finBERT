Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost asked the Court of Common Pleas for Franklin County in a motion for preliminary injunction to block the multi-year surcharge the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved on Dec. 30, arguing that it flows from the same enterprise that led to the adoption of House Bill 6 (HB6), the state law authorizing the bailout.

13.882813426833865," Ohio AG files to block FirstEnergy $102 million payout (Reuters) - Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said on Thursday he filed here an injunction seeking to prevent power utility FirstEnergy Corp. from collecting $102 million in profits via a provision in the state's nuclear subsidy law, House Bill 6(HB6 here). A mechanism within HB6 “that only applied to FirstEnergy... allowed the company to match its record-high income level from 2018 every year going forward regardless of how much electricity it sold anytime in the next decade,” the AG’s office said in a statement. The injunction was filed with the Franklin County Common Pleas Court, the statement said, adding that the $102 million would be in “addition to the $150 million nuclear bailout also in HB6 that Yost stopped last month.” “We are reviewing the filing, and have no further comment at this time,” a FirstEnergy spokeswoman said. Last year, Ohio politicians proposed new legislation that could remove or reduce the nuclear subsidies in HB6, in an effort to undo damage done by an alleged bribery scandal."
23.016463308064395," Ohio likely to require nuclear reactor audit before renewing bailout: analysts NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ohio’s legislature will likely require the owner of two nuclear power reactors to prove they need financial assistance to remain in service following a bribery scandal related to passage of the state’s 2019 nuclear bailout, analysts said on Friday. FirstEnergy Corp lobbied state officials to provide more than $1 billion to fund the continued operation of its Davis-Besse and Perry reactors. The Ohio reactors are now owned by Energy Harbor, which emerged from the bankruptcy of FirstEnergy’s FirstEnergy Solutions unit in February. The reactors likely still need financial help to keep operating. FirstEnergy was not alone in seeking state funding for its reactors. Nuclear plants in Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut also received subsidies in recent years. In Ohio, however, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Larry Householder, Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, in July, alleging bribery related to the passage of the state’s nuclear subsidy law, known as House Bill 6 (HB6). In an effort to undue damage done by the scandal, Ohio politicians have proposed new legislation that could remove or reduce the nuclear subsidies in HB6. “Ultimately, the subsidies may be reduced following the audit but we are skeptical they’ll go to zero when all is said and done,” said Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets. FirstEnergy shares fell over 3% on Friday to their lowest since September. The company said Thursday its decision to fire CEO Chuck Jones in October was related to a payment of approximately $4 million to an entity associated with a person who subsequently became a utility regulator. Earlier this week, the FBI raided a home owned by Sam Randazzo, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Randazzo resigned on Friday, according to the state governor’s office. Officials at the PUCO had no comment. Energy Harbor was not immediately available for comment. In regards to violations of company policy, FirstEnergy said its “Board will continue to take decisive action to address this matter.” Separately, the company said it believes it is in the “best interest” of Ohio and the nation to maintain clean and reliable nuclear power."

14.500962442140397," FirstEnergy CEO defends company's actions in Ohio nuclear bailout bill WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of FirstEnergy on Friday defended his company’s support of an Ohio bill passed last year to bail out two nuclear power plants, legislation at the center of a federal bribery investigation. “I believe that FirstEnergy acted properly in this matter and we intend to cooperate fully with the investigation to, among other things, ensure our company and our role in supporting (the bill) is understood as accurately as possible,” Charles Jones, the chief executive told a quarterly earnings call. A U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio said on Tuesday that a company, without identifying it, gave $60 million to Generation Now, a political nonprofit operated by Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four other men tied to state politics. Those funds were used for lobbying that secured passage of the $1.5 billion bill last year, the federal prosecutor said. FirstEnergy shares dropped 35% this week after analysts linked the utility holding company to allegations of bribery in the scandal following the arrest of Householder by the FBI. Householder and four others were accused of taking $60 million to pass the bill that provided taxpayer money to bail out the state’s two nuclear power plants, which were owned by a unit of FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy had said that without some form of subsidy it would have to shut the reactors. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, reversed course on Thursday and called on the state’s legislature to repeal and replace the bill, which also slashed renewable power standards."

23.592457087870294," Ohio House speaker, 4 others charged in $60 million nuclear bailout bribery case (Reuters) - Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, a Republican, and four other men tied to state politics were arrested on Tuesday in a $60 million federal bribery case stemming from a bill passed last year to bail out the state’s nuclear power plants, a U.S. prosecutor said. Shares of FirstEnergy Corp FE.N fell 17% after U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio David DeVillers revealed what he called the largest bribery and money-laundering scheme in state history. He said the five men were charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering. While DeVillers did not identify the company involved, Akron-based FirstEnergy operates the state’s two nuclear plants. The company, he said, gave $60 million to Generation Now, a political nonprofit operated by the five men, funds used for lobbying that secured passage of a controversial $1.5 billion bill that bailed out the plants, he said. “These allegations were bribery pure and simple,” DeVillers said. FirstEnergy said in a release it had received subpoenas in connection with the investigation, was reviewing details and intends to fully cooperate with the probe. Republican Ohio Governor Mike DeWine called for Householder to resign immediately. In recent years, FirstEnergy was among several companies that have lobbied state and federal officials to get subsidies to keep reactors in service. Aging nuclear plants have suffered from higher security costs and competition from power plants that burn cheaper natural gas. FirstEnergy in early 2018 asked the U.S. Department of Energy to intervene in markets by using emergency powers to direct grid operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear plants. U.S. President Donald Trump directed then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry to use an independent office of the department’s authority in a way that would help plants like those operated by FirstEnergy. Federal energy regulators rejected those overtures, instead taking up a study of how to make the electrical grid more resilient. The companies claimed the plants were needed to support state clean energy programs and without those reactors several states would have had a hard time meeting their clean energy goals. This month, Exelon Corp's EXC.O unit ComEd agreed to pay $200 million to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice probe over lobbying practices in Illinois. Former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges and longtime Householder adviser Jeff Longstreth along with lobbyists Juan Cespedes and Neil Clark were also charged on Tuesday. Householder’s office was not available for comment."
