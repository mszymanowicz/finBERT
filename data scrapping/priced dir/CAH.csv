27.91724898677651," Cardinal Health warns ongoing opioid-related lawsuits to hit business (Reuters) - Drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc warned on Tuesday that its business could be hurt as it defends itself against several opioid-related lawsuits. Several pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, including Cardinal, have been named as defendants in about 2,500 lawsuits for the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. These lawsuits have been filed in various federal, state, and other courts by a variety of plaintiffs. Cardinal said in a filing it expects to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors have been in part blamed for the U.S. opioid crisis, accused of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks. AmerisourceBergen Corp and McKesson Corp are also facing similar lawsuits. Cardinal said it was vigorously defending itself in all opioid-related matters, but is unable to predict their outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses. (bit.ly/2KVe5ME) Cardinal said that ongoing negative publicity could hurt the its reputation or results of operations. Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Tuesday, drugmakers Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc agreed to pay $15 million to avoid going to trial in October in a landmark opioid-related case by two Ohio counties. Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported that McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen had proposed paying a $10 billion settlement for claims that they played a part in the U.S. opioid epidemic."

The National Association of Attorneys General, negotiating on behalf of more than 35 states, countered with a demand for $45 billion to cover costs, according to the Bloomberg report. “We regularly engage with the state attorneys general, but the company has made no settlement offers,” McKesson said in a statement.

5.887388428341219," UPDATE 1-Drug distributor Cardinal's profit beats on pharma unit strength (Adds details on quarter, background on Cordis unit) Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc beat analyst estimates for adjusted fourth-quarter profit on Monday, supported by higher sales in its pharmaceutical and medical devices businesses. The company has been plagued with issues at its Cordis medical device unit, which it bought for $1.9 billion in 2015 from Johnson & Johnson. The company had missed quarterly profit expectations in May due to inventory and cost issues at the unit. Cardinal reported a fourth-quarter loss compared to a year-ago profit, as it took an asset-impairment charge of $1.35 billion primarily related to the unit’s performance. The company also issued forecast for fiscal year 2019 and said it expects adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $4.90 to $5.15 per share. Net loss attributable to the company was $1.17 billion, or $3.76 per share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30, compared to a profit of $274 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.01 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of 93 cents, as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7.2 percent to $35.35 billion.

-0.03961130569128588," Cardinal Health misses profit on Cordis woes, shares fall (Reuters) - Cardinal Health Inc's CAH.N quarterly profit missed analysts' expectations as inventory and cost issues hurt its Cordis medical device unit, and the U.S. drug distributor said it saw prices of generic drugs fall more than expected. The company's shares fell 18.8 percent to touch a more than 4-and-a-half year low of $52.93, and Cardinal's commentary on generic drug prices dragged down rivals McKesson Corp MCK.N and AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N. “We recognize that today’s results did not meet your expectations or ours,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Kaufmann said on a conference call. The company highlighted ongoing operational difficulties regarding inventory at its Cordis business, which it bought for $1.9 billion in 2015 from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to expand its medical device offerings and ""build an ex-U.S. infrastructure"". “Granted, building of infrastructure has been more expensive than we thought, it hasn’t gone as well as we thought,” Kaufmann said. The company said it took a large inventory write-off in the third quarter, as it struggled to sell its medical devices before their expiration dates. The Cordis business includes catheters and stents and other equipment used in cardiology and endovascular procedures. Cardinal Health said on the conference call it expects Cordis will be on “a path to profitable growth” by the end of 2019. Cardinal also said that a fall in generic drug prices moderated sequentially and year-over-year, but not to the extent it had previously estimated. Analysts have noted that even though stubbornly low, generic drug prices continue to pose a headwind to drug distributors, the rate at which the prices of generic drugs are falling seems to be stabilizing. Contributions from the company's Red Oak joint venture with CVS Health Corp CVS.N were not enough to counter the low prices, Cardinal said. Segment profit at the company’s pharmaceutical division, which distributes generic drugs, fell 3 percent to $596 million. However, sales climbed 5 percent to $29.7 billion, surpassing consensus estimates. Excluding items, Cardinal earned $1.39 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.51 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company cut its fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.85-$4.95 per share from $5.25-$5.50 per share, reflecting a negative tax rate and Cordis’s performance. Net earnings attributable to the company fell 33 percent to $255 million, or $0.81 per share, in the quarter. Revenue rose 5.7 percent to $33.63 billion."
