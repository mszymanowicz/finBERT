-2.1624451897339623," Omnicom cutting jobs as coronavirus hits ad spending by clients (Reuters) - Advertising firm Omnicom Group Inc OMC.N said on Tuesday it was cutting jobs and furloughing employees as the coronavirus lockdowns dent ad spending by clients. The advertising giant said it had over $2.6 billion in cash and $2.9 billion in credit facility to tide over the virus crisis. Shares of Omnicom were up 3.3% in morning trading. The company, which counts McDonald’s, Johnson & Johnson and Volkswagen as clients, said that stay-at-home orders and store closures led to the decline and added it expects the trend to continue for the year. Omnicom, struggling with ad budget cuts, has segued into making information campaigns related to coronavirus and worked with governments to run virus awareness initiatives. The company, which did not disclose the number of job cuts, said a fall in revenue could hurt its operations and financial position, and the effects could be material. “While we expect the pandemic to affect substantially all of our clients, certain industry sectors have been affected more immediately and more significantly than others,” the company said in a statement. Omnicom said that the postponement of the Olympics in addition to other major sporting events dragged on revenue while its healthcare segment posted a rise in revenue in the quarter. The company is also looking to review some of its non core agencies that are not performing well to bridge the fall in revenue. The health crisis has compounded the woes of Omnicom and its peers, which already face stiff competition from tech giants like Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and Facebook Inc FB.O as clients shift more ad dollars online. U.S. rival Interpublic Group IPG.N said last week it had cut salaries, implemented hiring freeze, deferred merit increases and furloughed employees - all to avoid job cuts as much as possible. European rivals WPP WPP.L and Publicis PUBP.PA have taken similar actions to conserve cash. Satellite radio company SiriusXM Holdings Inc SIRI.O also flagged concerns that the outbreak could hit ad sales in its Pandora and SiriusXM businesses as advertisers pull back on spending. Omnicom’s first-quarter revenue fell nearly 2% to $3.41 billion, but edged past analysts’ average estimate of $3.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Omnicom and other traditional advertisers have been losing ground to internet companies Facebook FB.O, Alphabet's Google GOOGL.O and digital marketing specialists that track and target individual clients via their smartphones. Additionally, a slowing global economy and trade tensions are also expected to crimp ad spending around the world. “In terms of international growth...the uncertainties that exist because of geopolitical decisions will have some impact on what goes on with our clients in spending,” Omnicom Chief Executive Officer John Wren said in a post-earnings call. For full year, the company continues to expect organic sales growth of 2% to 3%. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said the forecast “may have disappointed some that were expecting a bit more optimism.” The company’s total revenue fell 3.6% in the second quarter, weighed by a stronger dollar. However, organic revenue - a widely watched measure that excludes fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and mergers - rose 2.8%.

1.2392162799450068," Omnicom beats on profit after digital shift, shares surge (Reuters) - U.S. advertising company Omnicom Group Inc OMC.N topped Wall Street expectations for profit in the third quarter as it cut jobs and shifted focus toward digital marketing to better compete with Google and Facebook. Revenue at the owner of the BBDO and OMD advertising agencies rose 6.9 percent in the euro zone and almost 14 percent in Asia/Pacific while inching higher in the United States, where the firm’s share of ad spending has been falling. The company said it had cut a total of 8,400 positions in the reported quarter as it sold 19 businesses in its push toward high-growth digital advertising, pushing adjusted earnings per share 3 cents past analysts’ consensus forecast. Shares in the company gained 6 percent. “Underlying business performance in terms of reported organic revenue growth was relatively better than we expected and probably drove the slight EPS beat,” said Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research Group analyst. The world's ""Big Four"" traditional advertising agencies have struggled over the past five years as the direct targeting models of Google GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O swallow more advertising spend. In July, Omnicom acquired Credera, a management and IT consulting firm and also rolled out its people-based precision marketing and insights platform, Omni. It said it would fill 500 positions with “fresh talents” suitable to its current needs. Such moves come at a time when consulting firms like Accenture ACN.N and IBM IBM.N have also effectively shrunk business for traditional ad agencies by using data more effectively to target customers. Overall, Omnicom reported a 2.9 percent rise in organic revenue - a closely-watched measure in the ad industry that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and income from acquisitions. Analysts on average had expected revenue growth of 2.5 percent, according to research firm FactSet. Organic revenue in the United States, which accounts for more than half of the company’s sales, grew 0.6 percent. That was the first time the company had broken out the U.S. data in three quarters, and other North American revenue was still 5.4 percent lower. “I’m cautiously optimistic that our growth in the U.S. will continue to improve,” Chief Executive Officer John Wren said in a post-earnings call. Net income available for common shares rose to $298.9 million, or $1.32 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $263.3 million, or $1.13 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Omnicom earned $1.24 per share, edging past analysts’ expectation of $1.21, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell marginally to $3.71 billion, but beat analysts’ average estimate of $3.70 billion. (This version of the story corrects company name in paragraph seven to “Credera” from “Cudera”)."

8.01264887424559," Omnicom growth falls short as U.S. base shrinks (Reuters) - Omnicom Group Inc OMC.N fell short of expectations for revenue growth in the second quarter as U.S. clients put their marketing dollars elsewhere, sending shares of the New York firm and rival global advertising agencies lower. Madison Avenue-based Omnicom reported a 2 percent rise in organic revenue - a closely watched measure that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and mergers. Analysts, on average, had expected a 2.3 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. Shares in the company fell almost 8 percent after opening, while those in rivals Publicis PUBP.PA, IPG IPG.N and London-based WPP PLC WPP.L dipped by 3-4 percent on their respective stock markets. The ""Big Four"" traditional ad companies have been facing competition from consulting firms such as Accenture ACN.N, IBM IBM.N and Deloitte, which have built big marketing businesses in recent years through acquisitions. There has also been a shift in media consumption patterns as consumers move from traditional to digital media. Omnicom again showed signs of offsetting an almost 1 percent drop in organic revenue in North America with gains in Europe, where the measure grew 11.2 percent compared to a year earlier. In 2017, North America contributed nearly 57 percent to Omnicom’s revenue, while Europe contributed 27 percent. “We expect the continued underperformance of North America to be a bugbear for investors,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall wrote in a client note. “OMC will struggle to shrug off a domestic organic miss even if the growth is made up elsewhere.” Chief Executive Officer John Wren told a call with analysts he expected the weakness in North America to subside “partially” in the second half of 2018 while adding a strong dollar would hurt revenue by 1 percent in the third and fourth quarters. “(In North America) we faced declines from several advertising and media client losses that occurred in the prior periods and reductions in scope,” Wren said. “In addition, certain clients continued to change the way they are purchasing media in the programmatic business, although this trend is slowing.” Omnicom last week rolled out its data driven marketing and insights platform - Omni, aiming to battle the rise of internet giants Google GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O, which have transformed the sector by using data to better target advertising. The company, whose clients include Apple AAPL.O, McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Adidas ADSGn.DE, said net income attributable to the company rose to $364.2 million, or $1.60 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $328.6 million, or $1.40 per share. Excluding one-time items, Omnicom earned $1.60 per share, edging past analysts’ expectations of $1.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit was helped by growth in Europe and lower U.S. taxes. Revenue rose 1.8 percent to $3.86 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $3.89 billion."

Shares of Omnicom, home to agencies such as BBDO Worldwide, TBWA Worldwide and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, rose 2.6 percent to $75.99 in midday trading. Counted among the world's ""Big Four"" traditional ad companies, Omnicom competes with the world's biggest advertising company WPP WPP.L, Publicis PUBP.PA and Interpublic IPG.N. Omnicom’s organic revenue rose 9.7 percent in European markets at a time when its London-based rival WPP is on the back foot after the exit of founder Martin Sorrell following allegations of misconduct. The weaker dollar - which fell 10 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY and 14 percent against the euro EUR= last year - helped Omnicom rake in higher overseas revenue, adding 4.2 percent to overall growth. Global ad agencies are adjusting to a new reality where internet giants Google GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O have transformed the sector by using targeted ads. The companies are also struggling with a tightening of purse strings by erstwhile big advertisers and the loss of market share to firms including Accenture ACN.N and IBM IBM.N, which have built big marketing businesses in recent years through acquisitions. Omnicom’s ad and media revenue in North America, its largest market, declined mainly due to account losses last year. “This performance continues to lag solid US/global GDP growth despite the potential for tax reform to lift advertising budgets,” Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a client note. Omnicom reported a 2.4 percent rise in total organic revenue - a keenly watched measure that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and mergers. Analysts on average had expected an 1.5 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. In comparison with the big gain in Europe overall, organic revenue rose just 3.1 percent in the United Kingdom and fell 0.1 percent in North America. Omnicom, said total revenue rose 1.2 percent to $3.63 billion in the first quarter. The company, whose clients include Apple AAPL.O, McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Adidas ADSGn.DE, said net income attributable to the company rose to $264.1 million, or $1.14 per share, from $241.8 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.
