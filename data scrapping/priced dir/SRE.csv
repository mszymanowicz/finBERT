-0.9383460899101218," Sempra says Total takes stake in major Mexican LNG project MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - French oil major Total has acquired a 16.6% stake in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in northern Mexico undertaken by U.S. firm Sempra Energy and its local unit Infraestructura Energetica Nova (IEnova), Sempra said on Wednesday. The $2 billion Energia Costa Azul (ECA) LNG facility by the port of Ensenada is one of the biggest energy infrastructure projects under development in Mexico. After months of delay, Sempra recently obtained an export permit from the government for the facility. Under the terms of the agreement, Total will take its equity stake in phase 1 of ECA LNG. Sempra LNG and IEnova will each hold 41.7% ownership, Sempra said in a statement. ECA LNG phase 1 is being built at an existing IEnova regasification facility. Total’s equity acquisition does not include an equity interest in the regasification plant. Earlier this year, Total signed a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for around 1.7 million tonnes of LNG a year from the export facility, Sempra said."

Corrects second paragraph to say Sempra owns 70.2%, not 66.43%, of IEnova.) (Reuters) - Sempra Energy said on Wednesday it would buy the remaining stake in Infraestructura Energética Nova SAB de CV, in a deal valuing the Mexican unit at $5.81 billion, as it eyes new investments in renewables and energy storage amid growing global demand for cleaner fuels. The company currently owns 70.2% of IEnova, according to latest company filings and its all-share offer for the rest implies a 15.2% premium to the stock’s closing price on the Mexican exchange. The deal comes shortly after the Mexican government unveiled a second package of 29 infrastructure investments worth some 228 billion pesos ($11.36 billion), aimed at lifting the nation’s ailing economy. The package included Costa Azul, a $2 billion LNG export plant being built by a Sempra unit in the country’s Baja California area. The proposed plant is one of the biggest privately funded energy projects in Mexico and is the only LNG export project to reach a final investment decision this year. Oil and gas companies around the world have pushed back decisions on new LNG terminals this year after the coronavirus pandemic hammered energy demand and prices, ending a long run of rising LNG investments as Asian countries tried to meet their rising energy demand and diversify fuel sources. Sempra shares will trade on the Mexican stock exchange following the deal, and the company will combine IEnova with its North American liquefied natural gas export infrastructure unit Sempra LNG, it said. The company said the new unit, Sempra Infrastructure Partners, would focus on the development and construction of North American LNG export and natural gas infrastructure alongside renewable energy generation. Sempra will also sell a non-controlling interest in the new unit to fund growth, it said. All transactions are expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2021."

Last year saw a record level of approvals for new LNG export plants, but investment in new energy infrastructure dried up in 2020 after oil and gas prices collapsed due to coronavirus demand destruction. Sempra’s announcement on Tuesday about going forward with Costa Azul made it the only LNG export project in the world to get a final investment decision (FID) in 2020. At the start of 2020, a dozen or so North American developers said they planned to make FIDs by the end of this year. But all were delayed until 2021 or later. On its website, Venture Global said it plans to build Plaquemines in mid 2021 and put it into operation in 2024. Venture Global had no comment on when it updated the Plaquemines website. In September, the website said the company planned a FID in late 2020 with commercial service starting in 2023-2024. Plaquemines is designed to produce up to 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG. Analysts estimated the plant will cost about $8.5 billion. In addition to Plaquemines, Venture Global is building the 10-MTPA Calcasieu Pass LNG export plant in Louisiana, which is expected to cost about $4.5 billion and enter service in the autumn of 2022. It is also developing the 20-MTPA Delta LNG export plant in Louisiana. The company said it hopes to start construction in the second half of 2021 with the first phase entering service in the second half of 2024 and the second phase in the second half of 2025."

On Friday, Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the government would give the project an export permit as long as the company helped to offset an oversupply of gas in the area. Sempra had been waiting for the 20-year export permit all year. It was in part held up by the novel coronavirus. ECA Liquefaction is a joint venture between Sempra’s Sempra LNG and Sempra’s Mexico subsidiary, Infraestructura Energética Nova SAB de CV (IEnova). ECA Liquefaction will build the plant at the existing Costa Azul LNG import plant at an estimated capital cost of around $2 billion. It is expected to produce first LNG in late 2024. The export plant, which will have a nameplate capacity to produce about 3.25 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, already has 20-year agreements with units of Mitsui & Co Ltd and Total SE for the purchase of about 2.5 MTPA from the project’s first phase. Costa Azul’s Pacific Coast location gives it an advantage over competing U.S. Gulf Coast export plants because it is closer to growing Asian markets. U.S. plants usually ship LNG to Asia through the Panama Canal. Investment demand for LNG ran high for several years due to heavy consumption from mostly Asian countries to meet rising energy demand and diversify fuel sources away from dirty coal and oil. This year, however, oil and gas companies around the world pushed back decisions on new LNG terminals after the coronavirus caused global energy demand and prices to collapse.

-6.714363900118167," Mexico president offers Sempra LNG export permit on condition MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S.-based Sempra Energy will be granted an export permit for a liquefied natural gas facility in northwest Mexico if the company helps address excess supply in the area, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday. San Diego-based Sempra had previously signaled its Mexican unit, IEnova, was close to obtaining the permit for the LNG plant at its existing regasification terminal near Ensenada, in Baja California. Lopez Obrador told reporters at a news conference he was inclined to approve the permit. But he also complained of excess natural gas in the northern Pacific coastal region, given that state-owned power company Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) does not use the fuel there to generate electricity. CFE plants in the area burn highly-contaminating fuel oil instead. Lopez Obrador said supply contracts inked by the previous government obliged CFE to buy natural gas that was not needed. “If we stop buying all that gas that is not used and that we have to pay for, and if (Sempra) helps us export that gas via that plant in Ensenada, then we’d give the permit,” said Lopez Obrador. Sempra and IEnova did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The president’s comments appeared to walk back the government’s interest in requiring IEnova to build a second LNG export facility before approving the Ensenada plant, which was reported by Reuters in August. Lopez Obrador said a second plant would be costly and time-consuming. The LNG export permit would be the first of its kind in Mexico and feature an initial LNG export capacity of some 3 million tonnes per annum. It would also likely represent a lucrative means of selling LNG to Asian markets, where natural gas prices are considerably higher then in the Americas."

10.835196138641125," Sempra sees Cameron LNG export plant in Louisiana fully back in 6 weeks Sept 18 (Reuters) - Sempra Energy said it expects the Cameron liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Louisiana to return to full service in six weeks after lingering power outages from Hurricane Laura have kept it shut since late August. “We expect (Cameron) to be in full operation in six weeks,” Sempra Energy CEO Jeffrey Martin said at the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2020 Natural Gas Summit on Thursday. Sempra is one of Cameron LNG’s partners along with units of Mitsui & Co, Mitsubishi Corp, Total SA and Nippon Yusen KK (NYK Line). Officials at Cameron LNG have not said when the plant would return to service but the company has been working with the local power company, Entergy Corp, to restore partial power so Cameron can start the process of returning. Entergy said on its website this week that it expects to restore power in the Hackberry area, near where Cameron is located, by Sept. 20. Even though Cameron has remained shut since Aug. 27, the amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants has jumped to an average of 5.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in September. That was the most in a month since May and was up for a second month in a row for the first time since hitting a record 8.7 bcfd in February as rising global gas prices prompted buyers to reverse some cargo cancellations. Prior to that, U.S. exports fell every month from March to July as coronavirus-related demand destruction caused prices in Europe and Asia to collapse and buyers to cancel cargoes. Over the past month, other U.S. export plants have stepped up to supply more of the super-cooled fuel, including Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass in Louisiana, which has sent out several cargoes since returning from its Hurricane Laura shutdown."

4.894211899325699," Exclusive: Mexico tacks on request to Sempra unit's LNG export permit, say sources MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s government wants the local unit of Sempra Energy to build another export facility to help sell off excess natural gas in return for granting the energy infrastructure company a historic export permit, according to three people familiar with the matter. San Diego-based Sempra has signaled that its Mexican unit IEnova is close to obtaining the export permit for the gas liquefaction facility at its regasification terminal Energia Costa Azul (ECA), near the northwestern port of Ensenada. However, the government this month asked IEnova to commit to another facility in the port of Topolobampo in the Gulf of California to help Mexico unload excess gas capacity before issuing the export permit, two of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions, which could still lead to a prompt authorization of the permit. Reuters was not immediately able to establish details of the proposed plant. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permit would be the first of its kind for a private company in Mexico. One of Sempra’s top pending projects, ECA could be a lucrative outlet for U.S. natural gas in Asia, with an initial export capacity of some 3 million tonnes per annum of LNG. Sempra’s Chief Executive Jeffrey Martin was among the business leaders to attend a July meeting between Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump in Washington. During the meeting, Sempra tweeted about the $1.9 billion it is investing in ECA, and brought the approval process to the presidents’ attention, stirring hopes it would soon be resolved, according to several people familiar with the matter. On Aug. 5, Martin told a conference call he was optimistic Sempra would get the export permit from the Mexican energy ministry during the third quarter. IEnova referred questions on this article to Sempra, which owns a controlling 66.4% stake in the Mexican firm. A Sempra spokeswoman said the company looked forward to seeing ECA progress and was still working with the Mexican government to obtain the export permit. “Across all of the Sempra businesses, we constructively engage with our stakeholders to see how we can meet the needs of the communities in which we operate, and ... we are continuing to do that with respect to our LNG projects,” she said. Neither the Mexican energy ministry nor the president’s office responded to requests for comment. IEnova had previously discussed with the government the possibility of installing such a plant in Topolobampo, according to two of the sources. But having to commit before getting the export permit was not part of its plan, they said. The request may fuel concerns about ease of doing business under Lopez Obrador, who has strengthened state influence over energy policy and argues that corruption in past governments skewed the energy market in favor of private interests. Still, he inherited dozens of privately-funded infrastructure projects from his predecessor, including a U.S.-connected gas pipeline due to terminate in Topolobampo. Lopez Obrador recently brought up the ECA in public, without mentioning the government is linking approval of the export permit to another gas export plant in Topolobampo, where IEnova is already building a liquid fuels terminal. The final stretch of the Topolobampo pipeline is incomplete due to resistance from a local indigenous community. However, Lopez Obrador said on Aug. 10 it was important to complete it since Mexico had signed agreements under the last administration to import U.S. gas. Topolobampo “is where we can put a plant to handle gas and sell the (excess) gas to Asia,” he told a news briefing. The government was therefore exploring whether a deal could be reached with IEnova to ship that gas to Asia, he said."

The company said its third and final Train, or production unit, launched commercial operations under the first phase of the project following the start of commercial operations on Train 1 in August 2019 and Train 2 in February this year. The 12 million-tonne-per-annum (mtpa) export facility has so far shipped nearly 100 LNG cargoes totalling more than 6 million tonnes, the company said, adding that the facility is expected to generate nearly $12 billion of after-debt service cash flows for Sempra Energy during the 20-year contract period. Cameron is owned by affiliates of Sempra LNG, Total, Mitsui, and Japan LNG Investment LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corp and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK). Sempra indirectly owns 50.2% of Cameron LNG. In addition, Sempra LNG, which is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, said it has along with its partners signed memorandums of understanding for the full capacity of the second phase of the Cameron LNG plant. “The successful development and ultimate construction of Cameron LNG Phase 2 and Sempra Energy’s other LNG export projects currently under development are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance that any of these projects will be completed,” the company added. Sempra LNG is currently developing additional LNG export facilities on the Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast of North America through Cameron LNG expansion, Port Arthur LNG in Texas and Energia Costa Azul LNG in Mexico.

The company, which made the announcement in its second quarter earnings statement, has said it planned to make a final investment decision (FID) in 2020 to build the plant. Oil and gas companies around the world have pushed back decisions on building new LNG terminals as global demand for energy has collapsed due to the new coronavirus. Investment demand in LNG had been running high for several years due to heavier consumption from mostly Asian countries diversifying their generation mix away from coal.

In mid-2019, a dozen North American developers, including Sempra, said they planned to make FIDs by the end of the year. But none of those projects are under construction. All of those FIDs were delayed until 2020 or later. At the start of 2020, another dozen developers - some from 2019 - said they planned to make FIDs by the end of this year. Currently, however, that total is down to four, and analysts said they expect only Costa Azul to actually go forward this year.

Bahri issued an expression of interest (EOI) last year to charter the vessels from 2025 in Saudi Aramco’s first foray into LNG as part of the state oil giant’s plan to become a major global player in the gas market. In May last year, Aramco signed a 20-year agreement to buy LNG from Sempra Energy’s planned Port Arthur export terminal and also agreed to buy a 25% equity stake in the first phase of the multi-billion dollar project. However, Sempra said this month it was delaying its decision about whether to proceed with the project until 2021 following the slump in global demand for energy because of the coronavirus pandemic. “The shipping requirement was meant for Port Arthur, so given the delay and also the current market, it makes sense to put the shipping on hold,” one of the sources said. Aramco declined to comment. The Saudi state-owned company has been developing its own gas resources as well as eyeing assets in the United States, Russia, Australia and Africa, the company’s chief executive officer and the Saudi energy minister have said. The slump in LNG prices to record lows since the coronavirus struck may make financing more difficult and Aramco might be more cautious about its gas investments in the future, one industry source said.

Sempra has been seeking to bolster its finances and increase its appeal to investors after a wave of wildfires in California exposed it and other utilities to more legal liabilities. It also came under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp and investment firm Bluescape Group to scale back its global operations. Sempra’s deal with State Grid Corporation of China could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning it was still possible that negotiations may falter at the last minute and asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sempra declined to comment, while State Grid Corporation of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China, whose booming economy over the past two decades has driven up demand for South America’s raw materials, has been investing more in Chile as it seeks to secure resources. Chile, among Latin America’s most open economies and the world’s top copper exporter, has sought to remain neutral amid the growing trade tensions between China and the United States, promoting instead the need for open markets. Sempra said in January it would wind down its South American businesses. Last month, it announced it would sell its Peruvian businesses to a unit of China Yangtze Power Co for $3.6 billion, as it focuses on its core U.S. and Mexican markets. Elliott has now exited its investment in Sempra, according to its latest quarterly regulatory filing. Sempra’s Chilean businesses include Chilquinta Energía SA, the third-largest distributor of electricity in the country, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta. State Grid Corporation of China beat out a number of other bidders. Italian utility Enel ENEI.MI had said in June it had made a bid for both the Chilean and Peruvian businesses. Based in San Diego, Sempra owns power utilities that collectively have the largest U.S. customer base. It has about 40 million customers, and is active in California, Texas and Mexico. It also participates in the export market for liquefied natural gas, with Saudi Aramco as one of its clients."
2.3264614957195358," UPDATE 1-U.S. Supreme Court rejects dispute over 2007 California wildfire payouts (Adds background to case, paragraphs 4-10) WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co to recover $379 million from customers related to damages it was forced to pay out in litigation after the deadly 2007 California wildfires that burned hundreds of homes. After state courts turned away the utility’s challenge to a decision by California regulators to prohibit it from raising utility rates to compensate for the payouts because it had improperly maintained its equipment, the Supreme Court opted not to hear San Diego Gas & Electric’s appeal. The utility had accused state regulators of violating the U.S. Constitution’s bar on the government taking property without compensation. The court’s action came on the first day of its new term. The case was being closely watched for its parallels to the catastrophic wildfires that swept through California in 2017 and 2018 that pushed into bankruptcy PG&E Corp, the owner of California’s biggest power utility. After the 2007 fires, state investigators blamed San Diego Gas & Electric for three of the fires - the so-called Witch, Guejito and Rice wildfires - that killed two people, damaged homes and caused widespread evacuations. The company, which supplies power to the San Diego area, paid out $2.4 billion to settle damages claims, recovering only part of that sum from insurance payments and other settlements. The California Public Utilities Commission in 2017 rejected the company’s request to raise rates on consumers to recover $379 million, calling the management of its facilities “unreasonable” and “imprudent.” Under California law and state court rulings, publicly and privately owned utilities must pay for property damage if their equipment caused the fire, regardless of whether or not they acted negligently. They also must get approval to raise rates, a request denied by the commission. In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the company said that imposing liability and then forbidding cost recovery from customers violated the Constitution. A group of PG&E investors filed a brief with the court supporting San Diego Gas & Electric’s appeal. The state commission asked the justices to reject the case, in part because California legislators continue to work in potential changes in allocating wildfire liability. For instance, the state in July created a $21 billion fund to help utilities cover liabilities arising from future wildfires caused by their equipment.

5.059692878300403," Shares in Mexico's IEnova rise almost 7% after pipeline deal MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Shares in Mexican infrastructure company IEnova, a unit of U.S. company Sempra Energy, rose by nearly 7% on Tuesday after it reached a deal over a natural gas pipeline after a dispute with Mexico’s government that could extend two of its contracts for 10 years. Shares in IEnova jumped 6.9% after news of the deal negotiated between the state-run power utility Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and various companies over several natural gas pipeline deals signed under the last government. IEnova’s stock later pared part of the gains. “This agreement establishes a new tariff structure and considers a 10-year extension for both contracts,” IEnova said, referring to the marine pipeline that runs between Texas and the port of Tuxpan, which it developed with Canada’s TC Energy, and the Guaymas El Oro pipeline in northern Mexico. “CFE has committed to provide support to resume operations in the Guaymas El Oro pipeline, as well as the commitment for the immediate start of commercial operations of the Sur de Texas Tuxpan marine pipeline,” said IEnova. The CFE deal reworks the terms of pipeline contracts signed between the previous administration and will eventually save the government $4.5 billion as what Mexico pays the firms to transport natural gas is reduced. The $2.5 billion Sur de Texas pipeline was completed in June and is part of the biggest gas pipeline between Mexico and the United States and will increase Mexico’s capacity to import cheap U.S. gas by about 40% percent. The 480-mile (770-kilometer) pipeline, which mostly runs underwater in the Gulf of Mexico, is the Mexican half of a project designed to deliver 2.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd)."
3.358710036653146," U.S. approves commercial service for Sempra Louisiana Cameron LNG export plant (Reuters) - U.S. energy regulators on Friday approved Sempra Energy’s request to commence commercial service of the first liquefaction train at its $10 billion Cameron liquefied natural gas export (LNG) terminal in Louisiana. The plant exported its first cargo in May, making it the fourth big LNG export terminal operating in the United States. In total, the facility has exported four cargoes, according to data firm Refinitiv. Natural gas use is growing fast around the world as countries wean their industrial and power sectors off coal as they seek cleaner forms of energy. Gas emits about half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned. There are three liquefaction trains at Cameron. The first started producing LNG in mid May. Sempra has said it expects Cameron 2 and 3 will enter service in the first and second quarters of 2020. Cameron is designed to produce about 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, or roughly 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. When the United States sent out its first LNG cargo from Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass export terminal in Louisiana in February 2016, the country was not exporting any of the fuel. Since then, the United States became the world’s fourth biggest LNG exporter in 2018, behind Qatar, Australia and Malaysia, and is on track to overtake Malaysia and become the third biggest in 2019. By the mid 2020s, analysts expect the United States will become the biggest LNG exporter in the world. Just looking at terminals under construction, U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to jump to 7.2 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 9.9 bcfd in 2020 from 6.3 bcfd now. Cameron is owned by affiliates of Sempra, Total SA, Mitsui & Co Ltd, and Japan LNG Investment LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corp and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK). Sempra indirectly owns 50.2% of Cameron. McDermott International Inc and Chiyoda Corp are the lead contractors at Cameron. Sempra has a long-term goal of exporting 45 MTPA of North American LNG and is developing a second two-train phase at Cameron, the Port Arthur LNG export terminal in Texas and plans to add export facilities in two phases at its existing Costa Azul LNG import terminal in Baja California in Mexico."
8.395430414218534," SoCalGas moves up return of California natgas pipe by one week to July 21 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas) moved up the estimated return of a natural gas pipeline to July 21 from July 29, according to a maintenance report. Previously, SoCalGas, a unit of Sempra Energy, said it delayed the return of Line 235-2 to July 29 after finding some “non-hazardous” pipeline leaks in remote areas of the desert. Line 235-2 shut after it ruptured on Oct. 1, 2017. After that rupture, SoCalGas took the adjacent Line 4000 out of service for inspection and maintenance. The utility has since returned Line 4000 to service but kept it and another pipe, Line 3000, at reduced pressure until Line 235-2 returns. Once 235-2 returns, SoCalGas said it will upgrade Lines 3000 and 4000. Gas supplies have been tight in Southern California for years because of pipeline limitations and reduced availability of the utility’s biggest storage field at Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles, following a leak at the storage facility between October 2015 and February 2016. SoCalGas has said the reductions or outages on Lines 235-2, 3000 and 4000 reduced pipeline system capacity by about 0.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. Once SoCalGas starts returning the pipelines to service this summer, the utility has said its overall pipeline capacity should rise to 2.705 bcfd from around 2.355 bcfd now. SoCalGas has projected the increase in pipeline capacity plus storage withdrawals of around 0.68 bcfd would enable it to meet expected peak demand of 3.368 bcfd this summer without pulling gas out of Aliso. After the Aliso leak, the state mandated the storage cavern be used only to maintain system reliability after all other storage facilities and pipelines have been exhausted. SoCalGas has said Lines 235-2 and 3000 are largely 1957 vintage pipelines, while Line 4000 is largely a 1960 vintage pipe. Line 3000 extends about 125 miles (201 km) west from South Needles on the California-Nevada border to the Newberry Springs compressor station about 20 miles east of Barstow in the south central part of the state. Line 235 extends about 46 miles west from the Newberry compressor to Victorville, which is about 80 miles northeast of Los Angeles. After all of the pipes are back, SoCalGas has said its pipeline capacity would rise to around 3.085 bcfd."

The CPUC said it has also opened an investigation against Sempra Energy to determine if it prioritizes safety in its organizational culture and governance. The state regulator said a consultant will evaluate Sempra Energy’s culture, governance, policies, practices and accountability metrics to ensure that its California-regulated subsidiaries operate their systems in a safe manner. SoCalGas is reviewing CPUC’s order, a company spokesman said. “We look forward to supporting the commission’s review and welcome its recommendations.” A probe report in mid-May - commissioned by state regulatory agencies CPUC and Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, and conducted by a third party consultant Blade Energy - found that groundwater corroded a 7-inch well casing and made it to rupture, causing the leak. According to the report, the company had failed to investigate and analyze dozens of leaks since the 1970s, the consequences of such corrosion were not understood, leading to the 2015 incident. In 2015, the faulty well spewed more than 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere until it was sealed 111 days later in February 2016."

5.076992437196184," Saudi Aramco inks 20-year deal with Sempra for LNG supply DUBAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco signed a 20-year agreement to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a forthcoming export terminal in Texas that U.S.-based Sempra Energy is developing, the two companies said on Wednesday. The Saudi state oil giant plans to become a major global gas player, and this deal will provide it with access to some of the world’s cheapest and most abundant natural gas via the U.S. shale boom. Aramco has been developing its own gas resources and eyeing gas assets in the United States, Russia, Australia and Africa. Demand for supercooled LNG hit a record in 2018 at 42.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), according to the International Gas Union, and growth is expected to keep rising as countries wean themselves off dirtier coal. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. The sale-and-purchase agreement is for 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, equivalent to about 0.7 bcfd of natural gas. This is Saudi Arabia’s first known nonbinding agreement to buy LNG, and the largest such LNG deal since 2013, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Aramco will also buy a 25% equity stake in the first phase of the multibillion-dollar project, to be constructed in Port Arthur, Texas, about 90 miles (145 km) from Houston, the companies said. “Port Arthur LNG could be one of the largest LNG export projects in North America, with potential expansion capabilities of up to eight liquefaction trains or approximately 45 MTPA of capacity,” the companies said. Global LNG demand is expected to grow by about 5 percent a year through the mid-2020s, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections. Since February 2016, when the United States started exporting the fuel from the Lower 48 states, it has become the world’s fourth biggest LNG exporter. Aramco said it plans to boost its gas production to 23 billion standard cubic feet (scf) a day from about 14 billion scf now. “Saudi Aramco has clearly been looking at both an LNG investment and long-term LNG purchase for some time. The market expectation was for Aramco to make a big move,” said Gary Regan, a consultant with consultancy Gas Strategies. “The Sempra deal would certainly be a bold move and one that shows long-term ambition.” Sempra shares were up 2% at $134.23 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon. Aramco’s trading arm sold its first LNG cargo on the spot market in late March to an Indian buyer, according to sources familiar with the matter. A senior Middle Eastern-based trader said Saudi’s LNG trading arm has yet to get off the ground despite the sale of an LNG cargo last month. The trader said Aramco has hired an LNG originator in Singapore to develop the business but is still looking for LNG traders. “They are making lots of noise about LNG, but (it) seems more politically driven. So far no concrete action; no clear strategy,” the trader said. The proposed first phase of the Port Arthur project will include two liquefaction trains, up to three LNG storage tanks and associated facilities, which should enable the export of about 11 MTPA of LNG. Sempra said it plans to make a final investment decision to build the first phase of Port Arthur in the first quarter of 2020."

11.581331069593507," U.S. FERC approves two new LNG export terminals in Texas and Louisiana (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Thursday approved construction of two proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, Tellurian Inc’s Driftwood in Louisiana and Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur in Texas. Demand for LNG around the world has exploded, rising by 9.8%to a record high for a fifth consecutive year in 2018, as countries, like China and India, seek cleaner alternatives to burning coal to meet their growing energy needs, according to data from the International Gas Union (IGU). Driftwood and Port Arthur are just two of dozens of LNG export terminals under development in the United States, Canada and Mexico. With so many plants under development, analysts have said that most will likely not be built over the next decade. Tellurian said it planned to make a final investment decision on its $30 billion Driftwood project, which includes pipelines and production fields in addition to the liquefaction plant, in 2019 with first LNG production expected in 2023. Sempra has said it planned to make a final investment decision on Port Arthur around the first quarter of 2020. Driftwood is designed to produce 27.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG or about 4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. The first phase of the project will likely comprise 16.6 MTPA, Tellurian has said. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Port Arthur is designed to produce 13.5 MTPA of LNG or about 1.8 bcfd of gas. “Today’s orders show FERC is making a lot of headway on processing LNG applications in a more efficient manner, and I’m proud of the work that we are doing,” FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee said in a statement. Over the past year, some officials in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have urged FERC to speed up its process of reviewing pending LNG export applications to boost gas exports as part of the president’s energy dominance strategy. “LNG exports can help increase the availability of inexpensive, clean-burning fuel to our global allies who are looking for an efficient, affordable, environmentally friendly source of generation,” Chatterjee said. The United States, a net importer of LNG before Cheniere Energy Inc shipped its first cargo from Sabine Pass in Louisiana in February 2016, became the third-biggest exporter of the supercooled fuel by capacity in 2018, behind Australia and Qatar. Looking at only the plants currently under construction, U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 8.5 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.0 bcfd in 2020, from 5.2 bcfd now."
10.420166020701881," Sempra wants to become one of North America's biggest LNG exporters (Reuters) - Sempra Energy is working aggressively to become one of the biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters in North America, the California energy company’s Chief Executive Jeff Martin told Reuters on Wednesday. Sempra is developing five projects - Cameron phases 1 and 2 in Louisiana, Port Arthur in Texas and Costa Azul phases 1 and 2 in Baja California in Mexico - totaling about 45 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), or roughly 6 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes. If Sempra builds all 45 MTPA of capacity, it could become the second biggest North American LNG exporter behind current market leader Cheniere Energy Inc, which is expanding its two operating LNG export terminals in the United States. “We are going to move aggressively to unlock these five projects over the next three to five years,” Martin said, noting demand for the super-cooled fuel was expected to rocket higher as consumers transition from dirty coal to cleaner natural gas. The first 12-MTPA phase at the $10 billion Cameron project is already under construction. Martin said Sempra expects to complete the first liquefaction train at Cameron in the second quarter, Train 2 in the fourth quarter and Train 3 in the first quarter of 2020. The company noted the trains will start producing LNG before they are commercially complete. Martin said Sempra and its partners at Cameron - Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui & Co Ltd and Total SA - are working on a study for the 8-MTPA phase 2 expansion of the facility. At the 12-MTPA Port Arthur, Martin said Sempra has a “big marketing effort to see if we can get sufficient contracts to reach a final investment decision by the first quarter of 2020” that will enable to project to get financing to go to construction. Sempra already has a contract to sell 2 MTPA of LNG from Port Arthur to Polish oil and gas company Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGNiG). In Mexico, Sempra wants to build an export terminal in two phases at its Costa Azul LNG import facility. “Costa Azul is a complete game changer,” Martin said, noting it is the only facility on the West Coast of North America that will enable customers to ship Permian shale gas from West Texas across northern Mexico and reach markets in Asia in 12 days. “That is half the transit time it takes to send LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Martin said. Most of the dozens of other proposed LNG projects are located along the U.S. Gulf Coast."
10.230958646042," Sempra Texas Port Arthur LNG export plant passes environmental test (Reuters) - Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Texas took a step toward receiving federal approval for construction on Thursday after the U.S. energy regulator issued a final environmental report. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) report, known as an environmental impact statement, concluded the project “would result in some adverse environmental impacts, but these impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.” FERC said in a release its commissioners will consider recommendations by the staff when they decide on the project. Port Arthur includes two liquefaction trains, three LNG storage tanks, the 38.9-mile (62.6-km) Texas Connector pipeline and the 131.3-mile Louisiana Connector pipeline. Sempra is developing Port Arthur to produce about 13.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, equal to about 1.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Port Arthur is among dozens of LNG export terminals under development in the United States, Canada and Mexico that are seeking customers so they can get built over the next several years to meet growing global demand for the fuel. The United States started exporting the super-cooled gas from the Lower 48 states in February 2016 and is expected to become the world’s third biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019, behind Australia and Qatar. Looking at the plants under construction, U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 8.9 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.3 bcfd in 2020, from around 5.1 bcfd now. Sempra, which aims to export 45 million tonnes per year of North American LNG, said in December that Polish Oil & Gas Co (PGNiG) entered into a 20-year agreement to buy 2 MTPA of LNG from Port Arthur. Sempra also said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Gas Corp for potential participation in Port Arthur and has selected Bechtel to build the project. In Louisiana, Sempra has partnered with units of Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui & Co Ltd and Total SA to build three liquefaction trains at the Cameron LNG export facility, which are each expected to enter service in 2019. Sempra is also looking to add an LNG export terminal at its Costa Azul LNG import facility in Baja California in Mexico."
12.195943911508355," U.S. utility Sempra plans sale of South American operations (Reuters) - Sempra Energy plans to sell its South American operations as it increases investments at its dominant North American business, the U.S. utility said on Monday. Sempra will sell its fully-owned Chilean subsidiary Chilquinta Energia, the country’s third biggest electric utility, and an 83.6 percent stake in Luz del Sur, Peru’s biggest electric company. Its ownership in two other energy services companies based in Chile and Peru would also be sold, Sempra said, without providing any financial details of the sales. “We have set a clear strategic goal of becoming North America’s premier energy infrastructure company,” Sempra Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Martin said in a statement. “This planned sale allows us more focused capital investment in the U.S. and Mexico to support additional growth opportunities,” he added. Sempra had come under pressure last year from activist investors Elliott Management and Bluescape Resources, which had pushed for sweeping changes at the company, including the sale of international business lines and the addition of new directors to the board. In September the utility reached an agreement with the investors and promised to add two board members and review its liquefied natural gas business. Funds affiliated with Elliott and Bluescape owned a combined 4.9 percent stake in Sempra valued at $1.6 billion, the company said at the time. Neither Elliott nor Bluescape immediately responded to requests for comment on Monday. San Diego-headquartered Sempra said it expects the sales to be completed by the end of the year."

20.113015109716407," SoCalGas urges consumers to conserve natgas during cold snap Jan 2 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas) urged consumers to reduce their natural gas use through Wednesday to avoid straining its system as cold weather blankets parts of its service area: * In addition to asking homes and businesses to cut back on gas use, SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy, also issued a system-wide voluntary curtailment notice to electric generators for Wednesday. * During periods of cold weather, local demand for gas for home heating, hot water and cooking can increase rapidly, the utility said in a release. * Gas supplies are expected to remain tight in Southern California this winter due to limitations on several SoCalGas pipelines and reduced availability of the utility’s biggest storage field at Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles, following a massive leak between October 2015 and February 2016. * While high temperatures in Los Angeles are expected to reach the low 60s Fahrenheit (17-18 Celsius) on Wednesday, overnight lows in some inland cities in Southern California, like Riverside, will drop into the 30s, according to weather forecaster AccuWeather. The normal high in Los Angeles is 68 degrees at this time of year. * Consumer gas demand is expected to reach about 3.8 billion cubic feet (bcf) on Wednesday. One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. * State agencies forecast SoCalGas’ pipelines and storage facilities could send out up to 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this winter before the utility would have to tap Aliso Canyon, according to a report in October. * After the leak, the state mandated that Aliso Canyon is only to be used as an asset of last resort to maintain system reliability after all other resources (other storage facilities and pipelines) have been exhausted. * SoCalGas can get about 2.7-3.3 bcfd from its pipes and the rest from storage, depending on how many pipeline outages and reductions the utility is able to fix, according to the state’s most recent Aliso Canyon 715 report in July. * If needed, Aliso Canyon can deliver around 1.0 bcfd. But like all storage facilities, the amount of gas it can deliver would decline rapidly as pressure in the cavern decreases when the utility pulls fuel out. * State agencies have warned SoCalGas would not be able to meet its 1-in-10-year peak cold day forecast demand of 4.965 bcf without Aliso Canyon."

1.2332536804981757," Three companies agree to buy LNG from Sempra's Costa Azul in Mexico (Reuters) - California energy company Sempra Energy said on Wednesday it signed three non-binding agreements to sell all of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) to be produced at its proposed Costa Azul LNG export terminal in Baja California in Mexico. Sempra said it will now work to negotiate final 20-year LNG sales agreements with units of the three companies - Total SA of France and Mitsui & Co and Tokyo Gas Co Ltd of Japan - and has targeted making a final investment decision to build the first phase of the export terminal in late 2019. That would potentially allow the project to make its first LNG deliveries in 2023. Costa Azul is one of dozens of LNG export projects under development in North America that are seeking to supply the world’s growing demand for natural gas. If built, Costa Azul will have an advantage over most U.S. projects because it will be much closer to Asian markets, like China, where demand for gas is growing fastest as power generators and other industries in the region seek to burn less coal for environmental reasons. The first phase of Costa Azul is designed to be a single-train liquefaction facility capable of producing about 2.4 million tonnes per year (MTPA) of LNG, equal to about 0.32 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. The facility will be located at Sempra’s existing LNG import terminal, which can process about 1 bcfd of gas. The import facility has been operating since 2008. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Sempra said the three companies seeking to buy the LNG from Costa Azul each will potentially buy about 0.8 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). In June, Sempra selected TechnipFMC and Kiewit as the engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) contractor for the Costa Azul export project. In addition to the first and second phases of Costa Azul, Sempra is also developing the Port Arthur LNG export terminal in Texas and two phases of the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. The $10 billion first phase of the Cameron project, which includes three liquefaction trains, is under construction and expected to enter service in 2019. Total and Mitsui are joint-venture partners in that first phase."
4.8876299122632325," France's Total and Sempra Energy sign north America LNG deal PARIS (Reuters) - French energy group Total and Sempra Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding on the north American liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, which could see Total acquire a further stake in the sector. The deal could see Total take a contract for approximately up to 9 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG offtake across Sempra Energy’s LNG export development projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast of North America, specifically the Cameron LNG Phase 2 and Energia Costa Azul (ECA) LNG projects. Total, the second-largest player in the global LNG market, said the relationship with Sempra Energy, will boost its goal to build a diverse portfolio of LNG supply options. Total, which is already a partner of Cameron LNG joint venture with a 16.6 percent stake, also may acquire an equity interest in the Energia Costa Azul LNG project. “We are pleased to collaborate with Sempra Energy and the other Cameron LNG co-owners to extend the Cameron LNG project and to further enhance its competitiveness,” said Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne in a statement. The $10 billion phase 1 of the Cameron LNG joint-venture liquefaction-export project, which includes three liquefaction trains with approximately 14 Mtpa of export capacity, is under construction in Louisiana. All three trains are expected to be producing LNG in 2019, added Total. The second phase will add two additional liquefaction trains and up to two LNG storage tanks with approximately 9 Mtpa of capacity, the company also said."

-1.0951029785065252," Sempra Energy CEO 'very optimistic' about talks with Elliott Management NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sempra Energy's SRE.N Chief Executive Jeffrey Martin told investors on Monday the company was in a ""constructive dialogue"" with activist investor Elliott Management, which has been pushing for sweeping changes at the utility. Speaking on a conference call after the San Diego-based firm released its second-quarter earnings, Martin said three of Sempra’s directors visited Elliott’s offices in New York to meet with the hedge fund and Bluescape Resources Co, a private investment fund founded by former utility executive John Wilder. In response to an analyst’s question about how the talks with Elliott were going, Martin said he was “actually quite optimistic with the tone of the conversations ... All the right people are engaged and I remain very optimistic about it.” A source close to the talks said the discussions about a potential settlement were moving slower than Elliott wanted, however. Elliott declined to comment. Utilities based in California are already under pressure from the impact of devastating wildfires that have hit the state in the last two summers, with talk of possible legislation that could impose significant liabilities on them for damage caused by the blazes. Fellow utility PG&E Corp PCG.N has hired restructuring advisers and is considering putting one of its units in bankruptcy, Reuters reported. Sempra has insisted since Elliott and Bluescape revealed their position in the company that while it was open to engagement, it believed its current strategy was best for creating long-term shareholder value and it remained focused on executing it. Martin repeated that sentiment on Monday. Elliott and Bluescape, which have joined forces to influence other U.S. utilities in the last two years, disclosed a position in Sempra on June 11 and called for new directors and for the company to pursue a strategic review. In a 50-page presentation, the investors called for selling international business lines and to split its existing business into two companies through a tax-free spinoff - one focused on utilities and the other on natural gas infrastructure. Since then, Sempra has said it planned to sell some of its natural gas storage assets and its U.S. wind and solar power portfolio, although this decision was part of its annual review and not related to the activists. A spokeswoman for Sempra said on Monday “we will continue to welcome shareholder input as we evaluate our portfolio and, at the appropriate time and under conducive market conditions, pursue additional opportunities to create long-term value for all shareholders.”"

-1.8701401198770475," Woodside CEO says may exit Sempra Port Arthur LNG export project in Texas WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Woodside Petroleum Ltd said on Tuesday that Australia’s biggest independent oil and natural gas company will soon decide whether to continue to invest in Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Texas. Peter Coleman, who was speaking at the World Gas Conference in Washington, said the project’s ability to provide Woodside with an adequate return is “very challenged.” “We’ve got to make some decisions pretty soon about our continued pursuit (of Port Arthur) with Sempra,” said Coleman, noting that Woodside has been paying part of the project’s development costs. “What we’ve been doing is just paying our way (with Port Arthur), and whether that is going to give us an adequate return, I would say today that is very challenged,” Coleman said. In February 2016, Sempra and Woodside agreed to share the cost of developing Port Arthur, which could result in Woodside buying half the project once the parties made a final investment decision to build the facility. Officials at California-based Sempra, which announced on Tuesday that Polish Oil & Gas Co (PGNiG) agreed to buy LNG from Port Arthur, were not immediately available for comment. The Port Arthur project, which Sempra has said could cost $8 billion-$9 billion, includes two liquefaction trains capable of producing about 11 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, up to three storage tanks and facilities to load LNG onto ships. Global LNG imports rose 9.9 percent to 289.8 million tonnes in 2017, according data from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Exporters. The Port Arthur facility has been in the news a lot recently as Sempra moves closer to a final investment decision. That decision could come in 2019 with first LNG production in 2023, according to the project schedule on the Port Arthur website. On Tuesday, Sempra and PGNiG signed a 20-year contract at the World Gas Conference in Washington for the sale and purchase of two MTPA of LNG from Port Arthur starting in 2023. Last week, Sempra said it selected Bechtel as the engineering, procurement and commissioning (EPC) contractor for Port Arthur. Last year, Sempra signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) as a potential purchaser of LNG from and equity participant in Port Arthur. As consumers shift from coal to cleaner burning gas for power generation and other uses, global LNG demand is expected to grow about 4 percent per year through 2035, according to data from Woodside. China’s LNG demand alone is expected to grow at 7 percent per year through 2025, according to a report from energy consultant Wood Mackenzie, which projected world LNG demand would start to exceed supply in 2022 or 2023. To meet that demand growth, Port Arthur is one of more than two dozen U.S. LNG projects searching for buyers so they can make a final investment decision. In Canada, meanwhile, Woodside is working with Chevron to develop the Kitimat LNG project in British Columbia with a capacity of 10 MTPA. Coleman did not say when the company would make a final investment decision on Kitimat, noting Woodside and Chevron were working on getting the plant costs down. Woodside expects to produce between 85-90 million barrels of oil equivalents (MMboe) in 2018, most of which will come from its Australian LNG projects, up from 84.4 MMboe in 2017, according to a forecast in its 2017 full year results. LNG represents about 69-71 MMboe of the company’s 2018 production guidance."

Elliott Management and Bluescape Resources Co disclosed a combined stake of 4.9 percent in Sempra Energy and called the company highly undervalued, saying it could be worth an additional $11 billion to $16 billion or a share price of $139 to $158. Sempra’s shares were up 15.3 percent at $116.94 on Monday afternoon, off an earlier high at $119.72. In a letter and a nearly 50-page presentation, the investors recommended that six new directors be added to Sempra Energy’s board and said its conglomerate structure was made up of businesses that had “no compelling strategic or financial rationale.” They presented a plan for the company to pursue asset sales of its international business lines and split its existing business into two companies through a tax-free spinoff - one focused on utilities and the other on natural gas infrastructure. Sempra said in a statement it is reviewing the investors’ letter and presentation. “Sempra energy is committed to an open dialogue with all shareholders and considers investor perspectives in the context of the company’s existing strategy and opportunities to deliver long-term shareholder value,” the company said. It was not the first time Elliott has partnered with Bluescape, a private investment fund founded by former utility executive John Wilder. They recently collaborated on two investments in the utility industry: NRG Energy Inc NRG.N and FirstEnergy Corp FE.N. New York-based Elliott Management, founded by Paul Singer, has $35 billion under management. Energy is one of its focus areas for investing. Last August, San Diego, California-based Sempra, with backing from Elliott, bought power transmission company Oncor for $9.45 billion. Shares of California utilities have struggled in recent months as the state weighs a response to last year’s wildfires, the largest in California’s history, including whether to put the future burden of paying for wildfire damage onto power companies. That could potentially cost California's main utilities, including Sempra unit San Diego Gas & Electric, billions of dollars each per year. Earlier this month, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, said a dozen of the wind-driven blazes that swept Northern California’s wine country last fall were sparked by power lines owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co PCG.N."
