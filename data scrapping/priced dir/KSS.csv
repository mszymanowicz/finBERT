48.79377161741208," CORRECTED-Sephora to open stores at 850 Kohl's locations by 2023 (Dec. 1) (Corrects to remove reference to Planet Fitness in paragraph 8) Dec 1 (Reuters) - French cosmetics retailer Sephora will open its shops at about 850 Kohl’s Corp stores by 2023, as the U.S. department store operator doubles down on its beauty category. Shares of Kohl’s were trading up 14% in early trading. Beauty products have been among the most sought-after items during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside athleisure apparel and home improvement items, as people largely staying at home spend more on premium skincare items. The first 200 Sephora stores at Kohl’s locations would open in fall 2021 with Sephora becoming the exclusive beauty partner on the U.S. chain’s website, the companies said. Sephora is owned by Louis Vuitton owner LVMH and has 500 stores in the Americas. Last month, Ulta Beauty Inc said it had signed a long-term deal to have its stores next to Target Corp’s own beauty section. Kohl’s last month had said it had its sight set on at least tripling its sales of beauty products, after seeing growth of nearly 40% over the past five years. Kohl’s has also collaborated with Amazon.com Inc and WW International Inc, offering services from the companies in its stores in a bid to boost store traffic. J.C. Penney Co Inc, Sephora’s longtime partner, said its partnership with the beauty brand will continue until the end of its current agreement, which the Wall Street Journal has said is scheduled to wind down in 2023.

70.42494701727085," Kohl's posts bigger-than-expected decline in same-store sales (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp KSS.N posted a bigger-than-expected decline in quarterly same-store sales on Tuesday, as lower traffic at department stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic hammered demand for footwear and apparel. The mid-priced chain’s shares, which have nearly halved in value this year, fell about 3% before the bell. U.S. department stores, struggling to boost sales even before the pandemic, have had to offer heavy discounts and invest in their e-commerce business to keep pace with online-centric, off-price and deeper-pocketed big-box retailers. Same-store sales at Kohl’s decreased 13.3% in the third quarter, even as Kohl’s said digital sales growth remained strong. Analysts on average had expected an 11.39% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales fell about 13% to $3.78 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31. Kohl’s reported a net loss of $12 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a profit of $123 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Kohl’s earned 1 cent per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of a loss of 43 cents, as it cut selling, general, and administrative expenses. Kohl’s also said it plans to reinstate its quarterly dividend in the first half of 2021 after a COVID-19-led pause."

Crevoiserat, a former executive at Abercrombie & Fitch Co ANF.N and Kohl's Corp KSS.N, is the first woman to lead the company since it went public in 2000 under the Coach Inc guise.

The company said the job cuts would likely save it about $65 million in annual expenses, and were part of its broader plan to reduce costs by more than $100 million. (bit.ly/33w8Fkz) The layoffs at Kohl’s come at a time of high unemployment in the United States.

43.328338329507886," Kohl's signals slow start to second half on weak back-to-school sales, shares drop (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp KSS.N signaled a slow start to the current quarter on Tuesday, as the department store chain discounts heavily and grapples with weak demand as fewer schools reopen due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending its shares down nearly 16%. Kohl’s executives also said they would take a conservative approach to the second half of 2020, as the company prepares for further markdowns and discounts ahead of the all-important holiday season. “Back-to-school season has been impacted by the crisis as families navigate how their kids will return to school this year,” Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said on the earnings call. Retail giant Walmart Inc WMT.N also said back-to-school season has been ""choppy"", as more school districts rolled back their reopening plans. U.S. department stores, which had been struggling to boost sales even before the pandemic, have had to sell products at lower prices and invest in their online businesses to keep pace with online-centric, off-price, and deeper-pocketed big-box retailers. The Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based company’s online sales increased 58% in the quarter, as it introduced curbside pick-up option, but the jump hurt its margins due to higher-than-expected shipping charges. Walmart also posted its biggest-ever growth in online sales as shoppers cashed-in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries online. Kohl’s net sales declined 23% to $3.21 billion but beat estimates of $3.09 billion, helped by strong demand for kitchen electrics, toys, cookware and bedding. Excluding items, the company lost 25 cents per share in the second quarter ended Aug. 1, smaller than estimates of an 83 cent loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Shares of the company, which have more than halved in value this year, rose over 3% before the bell. Kohl’s, like several peers, has seen its online sales increase following the lockdowns, helped by its introduction of curbside pick-up option, partnership with Snapchat and promotion of educational toys and virtual learning tools on its website. Wall Street also expects Kohl’s to outperform its peers, as only about 5% of the company’s stores are located in malls, which have seen traffic plummet much more due to the pandemic compared to strip-malls, where most of the chain’s stores are located. Kohl’s net income narrowed to $47 million, or 30 cents per share, from $241 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier.

-7.354255744987524," Major U.S. retailers Walmart, Kroger will require customers to wear masks (Reuters) - Walmart Inc, Kroger Co and Kohls Corp will require shoppers to wear face coverings starting next week, the retailers said on Wednesday, imposing a widely-accepted protective measure as coronavirus cases jump across the United States. Using face masks is the top recommendation from health experts and government officials looking to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in 136,000 deaths across the country. Walmart said about 65% of its over 5,000 U.S. stores, including its wholesale Sam’s Club outlets, were in areas where there was already some form of government mandate on face coverings. Its new policy will now apply to all stores from Monday. Kroger will require the use of face masks in all its locations from July 22, while department store chain Kohls, whose majority store base already insists on face coverings, will make it a requirement across stores starting July 20. Best Buy Co Inc and Starbucks Corp have already imposed the use of face masks at their U.S. outlets. Trade group National Retail Federation (NRF) on Wednesday pushed for retailers to adopt a nationwide policy that requires customers to wear masks. While many retailers have recommended masks for months, they were hesitant to make it a requirement, for fear of antagonizing shoppers, with numerous videos posted online on confrontations between customers and employees. “Shopping in a store is a privilege, not a right. If a customer refuses to adhere to store policies, they are putting employees and other customers at undue risk,” the NRF said. Walmart said employees stationed at the entrance of its own and Sam’s Club stores will remind customers of its new policy."
8.12356294639412," Kohl's exits Jennifer Lopez, other women's brands as losses mount (Reuters) - (This May 19 story corrects paragraph 5 to say excluding items, Kohl’s lost $3.22 per share and not $3.20 after company adjusts the number while preparing its quarterly filing. The error also occurred in previous versions of the story) Kohl's Corp KSS.N said the coronavirus crisis would have a material impact on results this year as it removed eight brands including Jennifer Lopez, Juicy Couture and Popsugar from its stores and warned demand for women's apparel would remain weak. Shares in the department store chain, which shut stores across the United States due to lockdowns to halt the pandemic, fell about 8% after it reported a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss. The mid-priced chain reported a 24% surge in online sales in the quarter and more than 60% in April and said it had now reopened nearly half its U.S. stores as lockdowns eased. For the quarter ended May 2, however, net sales fell about 44% to $2.16 billion and the company reported a net loss of $541 million. Excluding items, it lost $3.22 per share, far worse than forecasts of a $1.80 loss, according to Refinitiv data. “Our financial performance, like many other retailers, will be materially impacted by COVID-19 in 2020,” Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass told a post-earnings call. The results follow bankruptcy filings by peers J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney JCP.N on the back of huge losses racked up in the two months since U.S. states began issuing stay-at-home orders. Kohl’s had been struggling in women’s apparel even before the pandemic as consumers shifted to online shopping and fast-fashion brands. “Exiting them (the 8 brands) will create focus and clarity on the brands that will continue,” Gass said. “We’re still highly committed to the women’s business. In the short term, we’re facing some challenges here.” Kohl’s, which has partnered with Jennifer Lopez for about a decade and began selling Juicy Couture in stores in 2014, will also cease selling Dana Buchman, Mudd, Candie’s, Rock And Republic and Elle."

More than half of U.S. states are easing curbs on business activity in an effort to restart their economies, but health experts have warned lifting restrictions too quickly could spark a new wave of infections. That threat means customers’ shopping experience will be greatly changed, with Kohl’s saying it would keep fitting rooms closed, reduce operating hours and encourage shoppers to maintain distance with one another.

29.569559885807557," Macy's, Kohl's, Gap turn to mass furloughs as virus crisis deepens (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers Macy's Inc M.N, Kohl's Corp KSS.N and Gap Inc GPS.N said on Monday they would furlough tens of thousands of employees, as they prepare to keep stores shut for longer to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Kohl’s also said it would suspend its share repurchase program, evaluate its dividend plan and draw down $1 billion from an existing credit line, joining a growing list of companies seeking to shore up their cash reserves to weather the financial hit from the health crisis. Macy’s and Gap have suspended their dividends and have also tapped into their credit facilities. Gap said the furloughs will affect its store employees in the United States and Canada. The company had about 129,000 employees at the end of last year. The action will impact a majority of its about 130,000 employees, Macy’s said, while all workers at store and store distribution centers, as well as some corporate office associates will be affected, according to Kohl’s. Shares of Kohl’s, which had about 122,000 employees in 2019, closed down nearly 9%. Macy’s stock ended nearly 3% lower. “Given these extraordinary circumstances, we are taking difficult and decisive actions to strengthen our financial liquidity,” Kohl’s Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said in a statement. Gass said she will not take a salary. Widespread lockdowns to arrest the spread of the outbreak in the United States have hammered sales for brick-and-mortar retailers as most stores remain closed, despite their online business staying up and running. President Donald Trump on Sunday extended his stay-at-home guidelines until the end of April, dropping a hotly criticized plan to get the economy up and running by mid-April after a top medical adviser said more than 100,000 Americans could die from the outbreak. The pandemic, which has killed about 34,000 people across the globe, has compounded sales pressure for retailers already facing stiff competition and a shift to online shopping. Kohl’s said furloughed employees would continue to get health benefits. Macy’s specified that employees enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage, at least through May. Macy’s said it would maintain the “absolute minimum” workforce needed to maintain basic operations across its Macy’s, Bloomingdales and Bluemercury brands. The retailer added there would be fewer furloughs in its digital business, supporting distribution centers and call centers, while Kohl’s said it would start buy online and pick up-at-store services later this week."

-36.55293047430072," Kohl's beats holiday-quarter profit estimates as Amazon partnership pays off (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp KSS.N beat tempered expectations for holiday-quarter profit on Tuesday as its partnership with Amazon.com brought in more shoppers, and said it would exit some women's brands to revive the struggling business. The retailer was one of the department store chains to log lower sales for the holiday period, raising questions about the prospects of brick-and-mortar businesses in the face of fierce competition from online retailers. To attract younger shoppers, Kohl's expanded its partnership with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O to accept returns of products ordered online at all of its more than 1,000 stores. “It’s clear ... that Amazon is bringing in a newer and younger customer and bringing it into the stores,” Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass told analysts. The company has also tied up with fitness center operator Planet Fitness Inc PLNT.N to open workout centers near some of its stores. Kohl’s shares rose as much as 4% to $40.05 on Tuesday. Still, analysts believe the company needs to improve its merchandise in the women's apparel category, where it lost out to newer styles from Target TGT.N and other European brands during the all-important holiday season. Gass said Kohl’s would exit eight down-trending women’s brands over the year, while introducing new brands to boost sales and hiring a new leadership team to manage the business. For the fourth quarter, Kohl’s reported flat comparable sales, citing slowness in the women’s apparel category. It still managed to beat the average estimate of a 0.11% fall. “They’re getting the traffic now ... now the hyper focus on women’s is obviously needed,” said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners. “The problem with women’s (category) is that... if the product doesn’t resonate, it takes something extraordinary to get her back.” The company forecast 2020 earnings largely below Wall Street estimates as it offers heavy discounts to bring in shoppers. It expects earnings between $4.20 per share and $4.60 per share for fiscal 2020. Analysts were expecting a profit $4.59 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income fell 2.6% to $265 million from a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.99 per share, beating the estimate by 11 cents.

-55.26006192306685," Weak holiday sales at Kohl's, J.C. Penney spell more trouble for stores (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp KSS.N and J.C. Penney Co Inc JCP.N reported lower holiday season sales on Thursday, a sign that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to compete with record-breaking online shopping between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. Kohl’s said it now expects full-year earnings to come in at the bottom end of an already lowered forecast, blaming weak demand for women’s apparel during the crucial shopping season. The Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based department store operator’s shares fell 9% as it posted a 0.2% drop in comparable sales in November and December. In a bid to drive traffic to its stores, Kohl's formed a partnership with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in 2017, allowing customers to buy products such as Echo dot speakers and returns online purchases at all of its stores. Smaller rival J.C. Penney posted a 7.5% drop for the nine-week period ended Jan. 4, sending shares down nearly 8% in morning trading. Plano, Texas-based Penney is losing business to larger rivals such as Amazon, Walmart Inc WMT.N and Target Corp TGT.N as well as discount retailers like TJX Cos Inc's TJX.N Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains. “E-commerce is definitely compromising the competitiveness of the physical assets of retailers,” CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said. “Amazon, Target and Walmart are really big names in this space and have squeezed out a lot of the little guys.” Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau has shifted Penney’s strategic priorities to refocus on the retailer’s once-thriving, higher-margin apparel business and chose to stop selling major appliances and limit its furniture offerings. The moves have contributed to near-term financial pain. Data from Mastercard in December showed U.S. e-commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%. Macy's Inc M.N, however, surprised investors on Wednesday with a smaller-than-feared drop in holiday season sales after trimming its own full-year forecast just two months ago. In November, Kohl’s also cut its annual profit forecast by at least 40 cents per share to $4.75 to $4.95, blaming weakness in its women’s apparel. Victoria's Secret owner L Brands LB.N on Thursday lowered its profit forecast for the fourth quarter after reporting a 3% drop in comparable store sales for the holiday period, but its shares rose slightly."

-5.1176965444066385," Kohl's, Home Depot forecasts quell pre-holiday cheer (Reuters) - Retail heavyweights Kohl’s Corp and Home Depot Inc sent a shiver through Wall Street on Tuesday, lodging weak results and annual forecasts that cast more doubt on the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. Major chains have launched a raft of early promotions ahead of the Thanksgiving and Christmas period, which is six days shorter this year than last, worried about the impact of cut-throat competition and the shift to disruptive online players. The ongoing U.S.-China trade war has also raised the cost of imported goods for many sellers as they fight to keep prices competitive, putting pressure on margins. The No.1 U.S. home improvement chain HD.N cut forecasts for full-year sales and same-store sales, while department store operator Kohl's KSS.N cut annual adjusted profit forecast range by at least 40 cents and blamed weakness at its women's apparel business for missing quarterly profit estimates. After the market close, smaller apparel retailer Urban outfitters URBN.O reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, due to deeper price cuts for its women's apparels under its namesake brand, sending shares down 12%. Home Depot shares closed down 5% and Kohl’s nearly 20%, dragging down sector peers and weighing on Wall Street. “There’s intense competition and it’s extremely dynamic. Consumers are looking to put more money into savings than before,” said Camilla Yanushevsky analyst at CFRA Research. A clearer picture on the state of the retail sector for the holidays will emerge by the end of the week after big names Macy's M.N, Nordstrom JWN.N, Gap Inc GPS.N report. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation, 79% of Americans are worried that tariffs will make their holiday shopping more expensive and Home Depot on Tuesday echoed similar sentiment. The industry trade body has forecast U.S. holiday sales this year would rise about 4%. “We fully expect (the environment is) going to maintain within the holiday period because it always brings a new level of promotions,” Kohl’s Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said. While the U.S. economy continues to expand, doubts about the risk of recession have dogged financial markets all year and a Commerce Department retail report last week suggested consumer spending was slowing faster than economists had expected. The report also pointed to more weakness in some sectors than others, and results from retailers so far have told a similar story. Food sales rose 0.5% in October and one of the country's biggest grocer, Walmart WMT.N, last week said consumer spending was healthy as it raised its earnings forecast. Graphic: Retail sales are up but not across the board, The Kohl’s numbers, however, chimed with a 1% drop in clothing and apparel sales nationally. Sales of appliances and garden equipment, in which Home Depot specializes, were both down around half a percent in the Commerce Department numbers, although the chain said its garden equipment and appliances sales rose. “Consumers are thinking a bit more carefully about what they buy. That means the holiday quarter won’t be perhaps as robust as retailers hope it will be,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Another hint of the direction of travel was results from off-price retailer TJX Cos Inc TJX.N, which turned in a strong quarter of growth in customer traffic and sales as shoppers were drawn by the promise of its hefty discounts on upscale but off-season products. “In a soft economic environment, people are looking for bargains in retail,” Yanushevsky said."

-5.1176965444066385," UPDATE 2-Kohl's slashes profit forecast after dismal quarter (Adds analyst quote, peer share movement, background) Nov 19 (Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp cut its annual profit forecast on Tuesday after the department store operator fell short of quarterly comparable sales and earnings estimates, offering no sign that a much-hyped partnership with Amazon was bearing fruit. Shares of the company fell more than 12% before the bell, also dragging down peers Macy’s and Nordstrom Inc by about 5%, as Kohl’s also reported declines in revenue and profit, as well as just 0.4% comparable store sales growth. Kohl’s has been spending hard on a series of initiatives to restore growth, expanding a partnership with Amazon.com where customers can return products bought through the online retailer at Kohl’s more than 1,000 U.S. stores. It hopes that the program, launched nationally in July, along with a push into millennial-focused designs and introduction of perks for shoppers will boost sluggish store traffic. Comparable sales growth for the third quarter, however, was down from 2.5% a year earlier and only half of the 0.76% growth forecast by analysts. The company, which holds a call with analysts before the opening bell, cut its full-year profit forecast to between $4.75 and $4.95 per share from a previous range of $5.15 to $5.45, but gave no reason in its statement for the revision. Analysts have warned that promotions run alongside the Amazon deal could pressure the chain’s margins, which fell to 36.3% in the third quarter, worse than estimates of 36.63%, while selling and administrative expenses rose 3.2%. “They have a lot of pricing pressure and their internet (online business) doesn’t make a lot of economic sense,” said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of consultancy Storch Advisors. “Their average unit price is so low, they have to sell a lot of units per order or they don’t make any money on the internet.” Kohl’s has already forecast a steeper decline in full-year profit margin. “We enter the holiday period with momentum and are strategically increasing our investments,” Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said in the statement. “Investing in the short-term will support our strategies to drive profitable growth over the long-term.” Kohl’s shares are down nearly 12% this year through Monday’s close, but that is roughly half of the S&P 500 department stores index’s 25% fall. The results accompanied a sharp cut in forecasts by another major U.S. retailer, Home Depot Inc, earlier in the day and followed a Commerce Department retail report last week that suggested consumer spending was slowing faster than economists had expected. On an adjusted basis, Kohl’s earned 74 cents per share in the third quarter, 12 cents lower than expectations.

6.594496886446441," Kohl's cuts 2019 margin forecast on tariffs, first half promotions cost   (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp KSS.N forecast a steeper decline in full-year profit margin despite better-than-expected quarterly earnings, because of the cost of more aggressive promotions in the first half and potential hit from new tariffs on imports from China. Shares in the department store chain were down 4.4% at $46.08, at 1455 GMT on Tuesday, reversing course after initial gains fueled by an earnings beat and expectations Kohl’s new partnerships and an expanded Amazon returns program would bear fruit later this year. In an escalating trade war, Washington’s proposed tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, which would include apparel and footwear, have made retailers nervous, with some warning of possible price increases for U.S. shoppers. Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass told analysts the retailer was working with its vendors to soften any tariff blow and that its margin forecasts already accounted for any additional levies. Kohl’s said it now expected gross margins to be down 35 basis points to 45 basis points from a previous forecast of a 20-30 basis point drop, reflecting the company’s worse-than-expected first-half sales and possible tariffs. It said margins fell 72 basis points to 38.8% in the second quarter, blaming higher shipping costs and increased promotions to maintain market share for the drop. For the whole first half of the year, margins were down 41 basis points. The company still maintained its adjusted profit forecast of a $5.15-$5.45 per share range, saying the Amazon returns should increase traffic and make “a positive contribution to operating income in 2019.” Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.55 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ forecast of $1.53. Kohl’s has been investing in several new partnerships to woo more shoppers. Last month, it expanded a returns program it launched with Amazon in 2017, through which items bought on the e-commerce website could be returned at Kohl’s stores, generating additional sales for the retailer. Kohl’s also stocks Amazon’s Echo Dot speakers and Kindle e-readers at its stores. The retailer also announced last week it would sell a selection of emerging brands online and in more than 50 stores, with Facebook helping it to identify trendy brands and will launch a Nine West footwear line next month. “We are confident that our upcoming brand launches, program expansions, and increased traffic from the Amazon returns program will incrementally contribute to our performance.” Gass said. In the quarter, sales at stores open for at least a year fell to 2.9%, more than a 2.5% drop expected on average by analysts, according IBES data from Refinitiv. However, analysts said Kohl's was in a stronger position than its rivals Macy's M.N and J.C. Penney JCP.N with fewer fashion missteps and better inventory management. The company said that its comparable sales turned positive during the last six weeks of the second quarter with 1% growth. “Kohl’s does not share the desperation of other department stores and has several things working in its favor,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail Net sales dipped to $4.17 billion from $4.31 billion a year earlier, slightly missing expectations of $4.20 billion."

Net income fell to $241 million, or $1.51 per share, in the second-quarter ended Aug. 3 from $292 million, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 2.90%.

-13.481219276824435," Kohl's chops profit forecast after dismal first quarter, shares slump (Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp cut its full-year profit forecast and reported lower-than-expected quarterly results as the department store chain sold fewer full-price spring apparel and saw weak demand for home goods, sending its shares down as much as 14%. Company executives, during a post-earning call on Tuesday, called out higher tariff and logistics costs as well as aggressive promotions as reasons for the cut in outlook, which has pushed Kohl’s 2019 earnings well below analysts’ estimates. “Based on the soft start to the year, the adjustments we are making to be more competitive and higher cost due to tariff, we are planning the year more conservatively,” Chief Executive Michelle Gass said. In the first quarter, Kohl’s suffered from a prolonged winter that led to higher sales of discounted warm clothes over its new spring collection. Also, sales at its home category slipped due to lack of new products and increased competition. “Our Home category was below our expectations, a reversal of last year’s Q1 trend when Home led the company,” Gass said on a post-earnings call. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 3.4%, below the average analyst estimate of a 0.15% dip, according IBES data from Refinitiv. The drop in sales was the first in seven quarters. Excluding certain items, the company earned 61 cents per share in the quarter, missing analysts’ expectation of 68 cents. For an interactive graphic, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2M8OHXQ “There is no doubt that this (results) represents, at the very least, a serious diversion on Kohl’s road to recovery,” GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said. Kohl’s said the softness in the first quarter would affect the second quarter too, but expects some recovery in sales in the second half of the year as the retailer expands its partnerships and makes its advertising more targeted. The company has a partnership with Amazon.com that allows customers nationwide to buy and return products such as Echo dot speakers and Kindle e-readers at its stores. “We expect (the nationwide roll out of Amazon returns in July) to be a significant traffic driver to our stores,” Gass said. The company, however, expects fiscal 2019 adjusted profit between $5.15 and $5.45 per share, below its prior outlook of $5.80 and $6.15. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Besanko said the latest round of tariffs would hurt the company’s home and houseware categories and added that Kohl’s was “working hard to mitigate the impact of tariffs”. Donald Trump’s administration, earlier this month, raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%. The U.S. consumer companies have also been pressured by the possibility of escalating levies, which would include apparel and footwear. Shares of the company were down nearly 11% at $56.08."

A deal would help Kohl’s expand its customer base, which focuses on women’s, men’s and children’s clothing, and boost its presence in the home goods category, which has traditionally accounted for a small part of its business. Kohl’s recently started conversations with At Home Group to explore a deal, the sources said. At Home Group has been exploring a sale for the last three months, and is already in advanced deal negotiations with private equity firms, including Hellman & Friedman LLC, the sources added. There is no certainty that an offer from Kohl’s will materialize as a result of the preliminary discussions, and At Home Group may revert to trying to sell itself to a buyout firm, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Kohl’s and At Home Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. Shares of At Home Group rose as much as 16 percent on the news to $23.84, giving the company a market value of more than $1.5 billion. At Home Group operates 188 stores in 38 states, selling everything from furniture, mirrors, rugs, art and housewares to tabletop, patio and seasonal décor. Private equity firms AEA Investors LP and Starr Investment Holdings LLC floated the company in the stock market in 2016. They own 16.6 percent and 9.9 percent of At Home Group, respectively. Reuters reported in April that the company was exploring a sale. Kohl’s has been investing in several new partnerships to bring in more shoppers. It signed a deal with Amazon.com Inc to display its Echo dot speakers and Kindle e-readers in its stores, while it partnered with millennial-focused Popsugar to launch a new line of clothes.

Kohl’s also sells Amazon devices such as the Fire tablet and the Echo voice-enabled speaker in dedicated areas in more than 200 stores.

8.521278828300476," Target posts strong holiday sales, maintains outlook (Reuters) - Target Corp TGT.N said on Thursday comparable sales grew 5.7 percent during November and December, helped by higher customer visits and strong online sales during the holiday season. Still, its shares fell over 1 percent in premarket trading, hurt by a disappointing performance at rival Kohl's Corp KSS.N, analysts said. Kohl's shares were down 5.4 percent in premarket trading after reporting anemic comparable sales growth of 1.2 percent during the final two months of 2018, from 6.9 percent a year earlier. Target expects same-store sales growth of about 5 percent for the fourth quarter through January, while comparable sales had grown 3.4 percent in the November-December period last year. All of the retailer’s core categories grew during the holiday season, with toys, baby and seasonal gift items being the strongest. Target reaffirmed its full-year earnings and sales forecast, putting it on track for the strongest full-year comparable sales growth since 2005. “Target’s sales performance... is an early indicator that the consumer was willing and able to spend this holiday,” said Moody’s retail analyst Charlie O’Shea. The robust sales numbers indicate consumer confidence has largely not been impacted by rising market volatility due to concerns over slowing global growth and a political deadlock in Washington. Target said store pickup and drive-up surged more than 60 percent from a year ago, and accounted for a quarter of the company’s digital sales in the holiday period. The retailer also expects 2018 to be the fifth consecutive year in which its online sales grew more than 25 percent.

Several retailers, including TJX Cos Inc TJX.N earlier in the day, have warned that a shortage of truck drivers, new driver regulations and higher fuel prices would make moving freight costlier this year. Traditional retailers are also being forced to match holiday promotions offered by online rivals that are starting much earlier every year and with increased frequency. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Besanko said on a post-earnings call that there is going to be higher cost of shipping as Kohl’s invests more in its online business. “We also know that in the fourth quarter, there is just generally more promotion that happens. And so we’ll take effect of that in our gross margin outlook,” Besanko added. Kohl’s raised the lower end of its adjusted full-year earnings forecast to $5.35-$5.55 per share from its earlier forecast of $5.15-$5.55. But the midpoint of the range was below the analyst average estimate of $5.51, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. While the upcoming holiday season is widely expected to help rekindle sales after years of declines due to competition from online rivals, weak outlooks from Kohl's and other big department store chains such as Macy's M.N and Nordstrom Inc JWN.N indicate that the growth is still some time away. “Overall, the market backdrop has been quite volatile lately,” Oppenheimer & Co analysts said in a note. “Investors seem concerned ...and have been willing to lighten positions in retail - especially on any results less than stellar,” they added.

Kohl’s raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to a range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share, the mid point of which was still below the average analyst estimate of $5.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While research firm Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins attributed the drop in shares to the company’s disappointing forecast, some others pointed to profit taking. Kohl’s shares have risen more than 45 percent this year and have doubled in value in the past 12 months. “Investors who have benefited from Kohl’s recent run may be taking some profits,” said Josh Blechman, director of Capital Markets at asset management firm Exponential ETFs said. Kohl’s has beaten same-store sales and revenue estimates for the fifth straight quarter, highlighting its efforts to turn around its business by sprucing up stores, cutting back on discounts and bolstering its online operations. In the latest quarter, the company benefited from higher sales of men's and women's apparel, especially in the active wear category with strong performance of brands such as Nike NKE.N and Under Armour UAA.N, Kohl's said. “The rebound in Kohl’s women’s business marks an important inflection point after multiple years of disappointing results,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. After years of stagnant growth, many U.S. department store chains, including Macy's M.N and Nordstrom JWN.N, are turning a corner as they mount a challenge to Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O dominance by investing heavily in their online businesses and streamlining their operations. “People still want to write retail apocalypse but it’s not happening,” said Bob Phibbs, chief executive officer of New York-based consultancy Retail Doctor.

Kohl’s saw higher sales in the first quarter thanks to Mother’s Day and other discounts grouped under its Friends & Family promotional event, but said it expects headwinds to growth in the third and fourth quarters. The company raised its annual earnings forecast, while maintaining expectations for same-store sales. Kohl’s now expects adjusted earnings of between $5.05 and $5.50 per share for the 2019 fiscal year, compared with an earlier forecast of $4.95 to $5.45. The increase in the earnings forecast was not as high as it could have been, given Kohl’s strong performance in the first quarter, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “It looks like they’re looking for the stores not to perform like they did this quarter going forward,” she said. U.S. department store chains, which have generally struggled in recent years as fewer shoppers visit malls, have reported a mixed set of results for the quarter. Like Kohl's, Macy's M.N raised its annual profit forecast but warned that the timing of promotions — shifting promotional events from the second quarter to the first — would be a ""slight negative"" on same-store sales in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Nordstrom Inc JWN.N and J.C. Penney JCP.N reported lower-than-expected comparable sales for the first quarter.
