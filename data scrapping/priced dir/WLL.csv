3861.4035087719303," Shale producer Whiting Petroleum emerges from bankruptcy (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas company Whiting Petroleum Corp said on Tuesday it had emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and completed its financial restructuring, shrinking its funded debt by about $3 billion. Whiting had become the first publicly traded shale producer to file for bankruptcy in April after the historic crash in crude prices in the previous month. The company said its capital structure includes a new $750 million reserve-based revolving credit facility maturing in April 2024. Shares of the company’s new common stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “WLL” on Wednesday. Whiting also appointed James Henderson as its new chief financial officer, replacing Correne Loeffler, weeks after it said chief executive officer Bradley Holly will be replaced once the company emerges from bankruptcy. Both Holly and Loeffler received multi-million dollar payouts from the company just days before it filed for bankruptcy.

1944.0860215053765," Whiting Petroleum CEO to resign after it emerges from bankruptcy (Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp WLL.N said on Friday Chief Executive Officer Bradley Holly would resign after the company emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, even though it had paid him $6.4 million in bonus just before it went bankrupt. The U.S. shale producer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April, becoming the first publicly traded casualty of the crude oil price crash. (bit.ly/33ZNGZf) Whiting said Lynn Peterson, a 40-year veteran of the oil and gas industry, would replace Holly. Peterson last served as the chief executive officer of SRC Energy Inc, before it merged with PDC Energy Inc PDCE.O in January. Holly was appointed to the top job at Whiting in late 2017, after serving as the head of Anadarko Petroleum Corp’s U.S. exploration and production business. He took over as chairman of Whiting’s board in May 2018. Whiting said on Wednesday it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 on Sept. 1 and will then have a new independent board of directors. Kevin McCarthy, vice chairman of private equity firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, is expected to serve as chairman of the restructured Whiting."
218.9189189189189," U.S. shale company Whiting becomes first major bankruptcy of oil-price crash (Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the U.S. shale producer said on Wednesday, the first publicly traded casualty of crashing crude oil prices that are expected to bite into record U.S. output. Whiting was once the largest oil producer in North Dakota, now the second-biggest oil-producing state in the country. It has agreed with creditors to cut its debt by about $2.2 billion through an exchange of some of its notes for 97% of new equity. Existing shareholders will own 3% of the reorganized company. Notably, Whiting said in a regulatory filing that on March 26, in response to the circumstances affecting the oil industry, it revised its compensation program to pay out more than $13 million bonuses to several executives, including $6.4 million to CEO Brad Holly. Numerous shale oil and gas producers, faced with burdensome debt loads, have cut spending aggressively as oil prices have plunged by about two-thirds this year with the coronavirus pandemic slamming fuel demand and Russia and Saudi Arabia flooding markets with extra crude. A U.S. drilling boom over the last three years lifted national oil production to a record of roughly 13 million barrels per day, but investors have grown frustrated with poor returns. Callon Petroleum and other companies have hired advisors to restructure debt. Shares of Whiting fell 32 cents, or 47%, to 36 cents each on Tuesday. The company’s market valuation has shrunk to $32 million from as much as $15 billion at its peak in 2011, when investors were discovering the burgeoning shale sector. As of Dec. 31, Whiting had $2.8 billion in debt and more than $585 million in cash on its balance sheet. Whiting is among the most shorted oil and gas stocks, with more than 60% of its outstanding shares borrowed for short selling, according to FIS Astec Analytics data. Analysts believe the energy sector is primed for more defaults in coming months. Whiting’s bankruptcy brings the trailing 12-month high-yield energy default rate to more than 11%, and the year-end figure could ultimately surpass the 19.7% level set in January 2017, according to Fitch Ratings. Energy producers Chesapeake Energy Corp and Chaparral Energy Inc as well as natural gas producer Gulfport Energy Corp are working with debt restructuring advisers or investment banks to shore up cash reserves. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Neal Dingmann said filing for bankruptcy “was more of a temporary solution than a long-term sustainable plan.” “We believe this financial demise was due to a combination of difficult macro conditions combined with sub-par operations for several quarters,” Dingmann said. The company was also hampered by debt after purchasing rival Kodiak Oil & gas in mid-2014, just before shale’s 2015-2016 crash, for $6 billion, which included $2.2 billion in debt. Whiting was expected to produce about 42 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2020. It said it would continue to operate without material disruption to vendors, partners or employees.

-49.707602339181285," Whiting Petroleum plunges to record low on weak production forecast (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Whiting Petroleum Corp WLL.N forecast a wider-than-expected fall in quarterly production on Thursday as its drilling operations were hit by severe bad weather, sending its shares tumbling 42% to a record low. Shares of the company have lost nearly 75% of their value this year amid weak oil prices and rising investor concerns over the company’s ability to meet its debt maturities. In a conference call to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results, analysts pushed Whiting executives to offer clarity on the company’s plans to refinance its debt that matures in 2021. But the executives side-stepped the questions, saying they had hired advisers to explore all alternatives and that they would not elaborate further. “Given the current commodity price and the current state of the capital markets, we felt it was best to retain advisers,” Chief Financial Officer Correne Loeffler said. “We’ve seen that the A&D (assets and divestiture) market has been extremely challenged. We will continue to look at alternatives as they come available.” The company also flagged pump failures due to bad weather on multiple high-value wells and forecast production of 108,000 to 110,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter, below analysts’ estimates of 121,570 boepd. For the fourth quarter, Whiting posted a net loss of $147.5 million, compared with a profit of $204 million last year as costs jumped 87%, while natural gas prices dropped. “Given the company’s leverage and the current situation in the oil markets, it would have taken a heroic release for Whiting to outperform today,” J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients. Denver-based Whiting forecast 2020 capital spending of $585 million to $620 million, well below $778 million it spent in 2019. Last week, other shale players Concho Resources CXO.N and Devon Energy DVN.N cut their spending plans for the year and hiked dividends, bowing to investor demand for returns. Whiting’s realized price for natural gas averaged about 84.4% lower last year. Quarterly production of 11.31 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe) was marginally ahead of estimates of 11.23 mboe and revenue of $380.6 million also beat estimates of $371.4 million. Excluding items, it recorded a loss of 22 cents per share, smaller than analysts’ expectations of a loss of 41 cents."

A deal would increase Whiting’s acreage in the second-largest U.S. shale field by output and spread its overhead costs over greater production, according to one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the talks are not yet public. It was not clear what terms the companies were discussing, although one of the people familiar with the matter described it as an all-stock deal. There is no guarantee they will strike a deal. Shares in both companies rose in late trading on Monday after Reuters reported on the talks. Weak oil and gas prices and poor shareholder returns have soured investors on U.S. shale, leaving many producers' shares lower on the year. The S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF XOP.N is off 21% this year compared with an 18% gain in the S&P 500 index. Investors also have punished producers that acquire rivals. Parsley Energy Inc PE.N on Monday lost about 11% of its market value after agreeing to pay $1.64 billion in stock for Jagged Peak Energy Inc JAG.N. Abraxas CEO Bob Watson said in an email that the company does not comment on market rumors. A Whiting spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Investors have called for change at Abraxas, an exploration and production company operating in the Rocky Mountains, the Permian Basin of West Texas, and in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin. Abraxas on Monday said it had engaged investment bank Petrie Partners for a thorough review of its business and strategic plans after concluding a sale of south Texas assets. The latest review would include “potential alternative transactions that might further enhance shareholder value.” This summer, Whiting announced a restructuring designed to generate $50 million in annual cost savings and to focus on unconventional assets. In late trading, Abraxas shares gained 19% to 45 cents apiece, giving the company a market value of about $75 million. Whiting added 1.2% to $7.34. Whiting shares are off about 68% year to date."

-64.14027149321268," Whiting Petroleum posts surprise quarterly loss, cuts 33% workforce (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Whiting Petroleum WLL.N on Wednesday reported a surprise quarterly loss, announced a 33% job cut and asset sales as a lack of natural gas infrastructure hits prices. Construction of new oil and gas pipelines in the United States has failed to keep pace with output, which has more than doubled over the past three years in the country that is now the world’s largest oil producer. Since gas cannot be stored in tanks or transported by truck or train, any excess has to either burned or re-injected into the ground, burning a hole in producers’ pocket. In the second quarter, average realized prices for oil fell about 2%, while it dropped 64% for natural gas. Whiting, which expects the infrastructure constraints to continue through the year, said it had cut about 254 positions and expects to save about $50 million in costs annually. The company said it will take a one-time charge of about $8 million in the third quarter from the restructuring. The job cuts come as investors press producers to cut spending and pull back on drilling in favor of share buybacks and dividends. Whiting also cut its full-year production forecast to between 45 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and 46.5 million boe, from its prior forecast of 46.7 million boe to 47.7 million boe, as the company agreed to sell $53 million of non-operated properties, producing 703 boe per day. Production in the reported quarter rose only about 1% to 127,870 boepd, with oil production being hit by about 3,000 barrels per day from the infrastructure constraints. Whiting’s shares fell 15% after it posted a loss of 28 cents per share, compared to analysts’ estimates for a profit of 30 cents. Fellow shale producer Concho Resources CXO.N, also hit by lower crude and natural gas prices, reported profit below analysts' estimates for the third straight quarter on Wednesday. Concho, which operates in the Delaware and Midland basins, said total production rose 43.5% to 328,681 boepd, while prices fell 12.9% per barrel of oil equivalent. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 69 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimates of 75 cents, and sending shares down 8.4% in extended trading. Concho also said it will enter a joint venture with Solaris Water Midstream LLC, where Solaris will manage Concho’s produced water gathering, transportation, disposal and recycling for about 1.6 million acres located primarily in Eddy County, New Mexico."
-0.31228313671061714," Whiting Petroleum sues oil marketer alleging sweetheart deal by ex-employee HOUSTON (Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp WLL.N this month filed a counterclaim to a lawsuit by a Texas oil marketer that it claimed gave a former executive ""favors, cash and trips"" to win a sweetheart crude resale agreement. Jamex Marketing LLC sued the second-largest oil producer in the Bakken shale field of North Dakota in 2018, claiming Whiting ordered Shell Trading US RDSa.AS to quit buying crude from Jamex. Jamex said it had an 2017 agreement to sell Shell 15,000 barrels per day of Whiting’s Bakken crude that it valued at more than $49 million. In its counterclaim in a Dallas, Texas, county court, Whiting alleged Jamex provided “lavish entertainment and other gifts” and cash to a marketing vice president that it later dismissed. That executive convinced Shell to pay Jamex a broker fee for oil that Whiting had already agreed to supply Shell. Whiting said the vice president, Bruce Taton, did not alert his bosses to the arrangement with Jamex and was dismissed in September 2017. Whiting’s lawsuit filed on Jan. 4 said it was tipped off by an anonymous shareholder who alleged Taton “colluded with (Jamex Chief Executive James) Ballengee to steer millions of Whiting dollars to companies Mr. Ballengee controlled.” The arrangement with Jamex “resulted in a loss of revenue and increase in cost to Whiting,” the suit claimed. Taton declined to comment when reached by phone on Wednesday. Whiting said it does not comment on pending litigation, and Whiting’s lawyer, Barry Barnett, declined to comment. Shell declined an immediate comment. Jamex sued Whiting in April over the loss of its 2017 contract with Shell. The agreement would have provided the shipper $7 million a year over seven years in revenue, according to Joel Reese, Jamex’s lawyer. “We contend the communications to Shell were improper and that we’re entitled to the benefits of the contract that Whiting stole,” Reese said in an interview. Whiting’s suit said it has not recouped payments Shell made to Jamex, and seeks damages and a jury trial. The case is Jamex Marketing LLC v Whiting Petroleum v James Ballengee, Dallas County Court, Texas, No. DC-18-04574"
-16.524938110117287," Whiting Petroleum's profit beats on production jumps HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Whiting Petroleum posted profit on Tuesday that easily topped analysts’ third quarter forecasts, as higher domestic oil prices and production growth boosted results. Whiting’s third quarter production averaged 128,680 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 13 percent from a year ago. The Denver-based company forecast its production to increase 5 percent sequentially in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Bradley Holly said in a statement. Its shares rose more than 3 percent to $36.50 in after hours trading on Tuesday. Oil prices have jumped about 44 percent in the past year, prompting a surge in activity as producers are able to fetch a higher price for their crude. In the Bakken shale, where Whiting is one of the top producers, output is achieving new records and anticipated to hit 1.35 million barrels per day in November, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Whiting reported adjusted net income of $84.7 million, or 92 cents per share, topping analysts’ consensus for 58 cents per share, according to Refinitiv estimates. Last year, the company reported a $50 million loss for the third quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $566.7 million, beating analysts’ forecasts of $521.3 million, and up from $324.2 million a year ago. Although oil prices have climbed significantly in the last year, Whiting had hedged some of its production to lock in prices. It took a $7.88 per barrel hit to realized prices during the quarter as a result of its crude oil hedges that cost it $62.4 million. Other producers, including Pioneer Natural Resources and EOG Resources have warned of similar earnings hits this quarter after crude rose above hedged prices.
