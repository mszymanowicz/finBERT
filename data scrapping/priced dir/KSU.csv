19.13842513701576," UPDATE 1-Kansas City Southern revenue misses estimates as COVID-19 hits shipments (Compares with estimates, adds 2020 operating ratio forecast, shares) Oct 16 (Reuters) - U.S. railroad operator Kansas City Southern’s quarterly revenue missed Wall Street estimates on Friday, as shipment volumes fell due to a pandemic-induced fall in service demand. The company, which withdrew its full-year earnings forecast in April on coronavirus concerns, said it now expects 2020 adjusted operating ratio to be at the lower end of the 60% to 61% range. The company’s operating ratio was 63.2% in 2019. Kansas City Southern last month rejected a $20 billion takeover offer from an investor group, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The deal was for $208 a share, which the railroad said undervalued the firm. Kansas City Southern said total carload volumes were down 4% from a year earlier, mainly due to lower frac sand and crude oil shipments. Net income rose to $190.2 million, or $2.01 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept.30, from $180.6 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell about 12% to $659.6 million, below estimates of $662.7 million, according to Refinitiv data. Excluding items, the company earned $1.96 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.90 per share. Shares fell about 1% to $182.50 in premarket trade.

KSU is recovering from what it has called a “horrible” drop in revenues driven by lower cargo volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It responded by slashing operating expenses and briefly halting share buybacks. Details of the bid from the private equity firms could not be learned. KSU is pushing for a higher offer, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. Kansas City Southern, which has a market capital over $17 billion, was not immediately available for comment. Blackstone and GIP declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer on Wednesday. KSU shares ended trading in New York up 5.1% at $193.78. KSU is the smallest among so-called Class I railways in the United States that account for a significant share of freight traffic. It operates in the central and south central United States and Mexico, and owns a 50% stake in the Panama Canal Railway Company. While the private equity bid could spur takeover interest in KSU among its larger peers, regulators would heavily scrutinze such a combination. The buyout firms, on the other hand, do not face any antitrust hurdles. In the second quarter, KSU posted a better than expected profit, helped by a 27% decline in operating expenses, even as its revenue fell 23%. Were Blackstone and GIP to succeed in their bid for KSU, it would be the latest private equity deal in the sector. In December, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP BIP.N and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC took over short line and regional freight railroad operator Genesee & Wyoming Inc for $8.4 billion, including debt."

14.9413499521646," Kansas City Southern profit beats, signals strength in fourth quarter (Reuters) - Railroad operator Kansas City Southern KSU.N on Friday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by an increase in refined fuel shipments to Mexico and ongoing cost cuts. Shares of the company, which derives one-third of its revenue from Mexico, jumped 5.2% to $142.41 in early trading. “We have a positive outlook for the rest of the year,” Chief Executive Patrick Ottensmeyer said on a conference call with analysts. The results come as the railroad industry is seeing volumes fall because of competition from low-priced, long-haul truckers and U.S. President Donald Trump’s bruising tariff disputes with key trade partners like China and Mexico. Third-quarter net income available to common stockholders rose to $180.1 million, or $1.81 per share, from $173.5 million, or $1.70 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $747.7 million. Analysts, on average, had expected quarterly earnings of $1.79 per share and revenue of $734.9 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Refined fuel products and liquid petroleum gas shipments to Mexico rose sharply. Those were partly offset by lower revenue from frac sand, crude oil and automotive shipments. Efficiency improved during the quarter, when operating ratio, a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and a key metric for Wall Street, fell 2.7 points to 60.7% from a year ago. Executives, who are revising the railroad’s forecasts on the heels of the strong results, signaled caution on roughly 30% of the railroad’s overall revenue. ""We're currently being impacted by the GM strike,"" Michael Naatz, head of marketing, said of the United Auto Workers' strike at General Motors GM.N that affected the U.S. car maker's operations in Mexico and is rippling through the global supply chain. The two sides have reached an agreement that has yet to be finalized. The company’s intermodal business, which handles cargo that travels by ship, road and rail, is bearing the weight of tariff-weakened international trade and truck competition. “We’ll continue monitor the overall economic environment,” Naatz said."

18.00502114320927," Kansas City Southern profit beats on cost controls (Reuters) - Kansas City Southern KSU.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, as cost controls helped the U.S. railroad to make up for flat carload volume amid concerns of slowing economic growth. The railroad, which gets nearly half of its annual revenue from Mexico, on Friday dialed back planned spending on operational investments as it lowered its volume forecast for this year. U.S. freight volumes have declined for seven straight months, fueling worries that the domestic economy is succumbing to a global slowdown and pressure from President Donald Trump’s trade spats with key partners like China and Mexico. Kansas City Southern, which joined Union Pacific Corp UNP.N and CSX CSX.O in reporting weakness in coal, frac sand and intermodal shipments, said it is monitoring trade developments for potential impacts to its industrials and consumer units. It reiterated 2019 profit and revenue forecasts, even as it lowered volume expectations. It now sees flat to slightly lower volume for the year, down from its previous call for growth of 2% to 3%. Based on the new volume forecast, the railroad pared its capital spending plan to “below $600 million” for 2019, versus up to $660 million previously. “In spite of some troubling signals in the economy and still some unresolved trade issues, we feel really good about the progress we’re making and still feel good about the outlook,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Ottensmeyer said on a conference call with analysts. Kansas City Southern said its adjusted operating ratio - a closely watched measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue - fell to 63.7% in the second quarter from 64.0% a year earlier.

5.56088535123774," Kansas City Southern sees surging fuel-by-rail growth in Mexico MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican subsidiary of U.S. railroad operator Kansas City Southern expects its gasoline transport business to grow at least 15 percent by volume this year, and possibly much more, a senior executive said on Tuesday. Jose Zozaya, president of the Mexican unit, said the railway is being approached by new fuel importers, beyond existing clients that already supply their own retail gas stations in Mexico like U.S.-based ExxonMobil Corp and France’s Total SA. “Companies are reaching out to us that weren’t before,” he said, without naming the firms, estimating fuel-by-rail growth of 15 percent to 20 percent this year. Kansas City Southern later said in a statement that it would invest $123 million in Mexico this year. Zozaya suggested 2019 growth could even approach the 130 percent figure the firm registered in the year to February if new fuel storage facilities open, and if private fuel importers contract for the firm’s transportation services. Kansas City Southern’s bullish forecasts contrast with the stated desire of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to wean Mexico off imported gasoline and make it self-sufficient. The railway company, which derives a large share of its revenue from Mexico, currently services fuel storage facilities in San Luis Potosi and Guanajuato states. The San Luis Potosi terminal, which it partners with Watco Companies and WTC Industrial, will in April add 300,000 barrels to its daily storage capacity, from 40,000 barrels now. “It will grow from about one train to five, six or seven trains that can simultaneously arrive, unload and leave,” said Zozaya. Over the past two decades, Kansas City Southern has moved imported fuels from the United States for state-owned oil company Pemex. Since a 2013-2014 energy overhaul opened up the sector in Mexico to private importers, the railway has seen additional growth opportunities. A clampdown on fuel thieves launched in late December by Lopez Obrador, in which several key pipelines were shut due to persistent illegal taps, has also spurred growth. While more expensive than transporting fuels via pipelines, Zozaya touted so-called unit trains that only transport gasoline or diesel and make fewer stops as a safer option, even as other cargo trains operating in Mexico have been targeted by thieves. “The vandals take advantage when trains slow down or when they stop,” he said, pointing out that freight trains transporting containers are more susceptible to theft than fuel tankers."

Like many of it peers, the company is implementing efficiency measures known as Precision Scheduled Railroading aimed at keeping trains running on time. It bolstered that effort by retaining management consultant Sameh Fahmy, a former Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TO executive who worked beside industry turnaround expert Hunter Harrison. Kansas City Southern, which derives one-third of its revenue from Mexico, reported an adjusted fourth-quarter operating ratio of 64.3 percent, 30 basis points higher than prior year.

4.538668149550333," Kansas City Southern profit soars, trade worry eases; shares climb (Reuters) - Railroad operator Kansas City Southern's KSU.N quarterly profit jumped 34 percent, even after network congestion crimped operations in Mexico, where it has extensive services. Shares climbed 4 percent to $106.76 in midday trading, partly due to easing anxiety around U.S. trade skirmishes and Mexico’s leadership transition. Kansas City Southern Chief Executive Officer Patrick Ottensmeyer called the reworked United States, Mexico and Canada trade deal a positive, although steel and aluminum tariffs “need to be worked through.” Renegotiation of the former North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) “left the treaty largely intact and this removes a major risk that was hanging over the stock,” CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore said in a client note. Comments from Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, have further reduced uncertainty. “Most of the signals that we’ve gotten are positive and encouraging that we will not see any major shift in either foreign relations or economic policy on Mexico,” Ottensmeyer said on a conference call with analysts. The company dominates cross-border rail trade between the United States and Mexico, drawing about 30 percent of its revenue from such shipments. Cross-border carloads were up 20 percent from a year earlier, straining operations and sending rail car dwell times up in its Monterrey and Sanchez terminals. Overall volumes increased 4 percent during the latest quarter, when congestion in northern Mexico sent costs around $7 million higher. The railroad, which plans to take ownership of 50 locomotives next year, lowered its full-year volume growth forecast on the heels of its third-quarter results. It now expects full-year volume growth in the low single-digit percentages instead of mid-single digits. It cited delays in the start of crude oil movement and its own struggles to meet robust demand. Despite challenges in the quarter, the company’s operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, improved to 62 percent from 64.4 percent a year earlier. A lower operating ratio means more efficiency and higher profitability. Net income available to shareholders rose to $173.5 million, or $1.70 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $129.2 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.57 per share, in line with analysts’ estimate, according to data from Refinitiv.

-9.548772143370414," Trade deal, M&A potential could lift Kansas City Southern shares 20 percent: Barron's (Reuters) - U.S. railroad operator Kansas City Southern KSU.N could see shares rise as much as 20 percent thanks to a boost from a recent trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and its potential to be an acquisition target, Barron's magazine said. Kansas City Southern’s shares have lagged peers in large part because of trade tensions between the United States and Mexico, Barron’s said. Nearly half of the railroad operator’s revenue comes from trade with Mexico. U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement raised concerns among investors who felt that a potential breakdown in cross-border trade could impact Kansas City Southern’s profits, Barron’s said. The agreement with Mexico, announced last week, is “in essence a return to pre-Trump times,” Jason Seidl, an analyst with Cowen & Co, told Barron’s. Kansas City Southern could enjoy additional tailwinds from some of Mexico’s own recent policy changes, including a move to allow foreign firms to invest in its oil and gas industry, Barron’s said. The stock also could see an even bigger pop if it receives an acquisition overture from another railroad company. Its small size and lack of overlap with other railroads makes it one of the few railroad operators that could easily pass muster with anti-trust regulators, Barron’s said."
-4.148627621798894," Kansas City Southern's profit tops Wall Street view, shares up (Reuters) - Kansas City Southern KSU.N, a regional U.S. railroad operator with extensive operations in Mexico, topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Friday, as it transported higher volumes of petroleum, cars and chemicals. Shares gained 1.1 percent to $109.67 in afternoon trading, even after the company lowered its full-year volume growth forecast due to weaker-than-expected overall volume growth of 1 percent in the second quarter. Kansas City Southern now sees 2018 volume growth of approximately 3 percent to 4 percent versus its previous call for a mid-single-digit percentage rise. “As we move into the second half of 2018 and 2019, we expect volume growth to accelerate,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Ottensmeyer said in a statement. Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio marginally increased to 64 percent from a year earlier. Operating ratio measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue and is a closely watched gauge of railroad performance. Lowering that ratio improves profitability. Net income available to shareholders rose more than 10 percent to $148.2 million, or $1.45 per share, helped by higher volumes for petroleum, autos and chemicals. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.54 per share, beating analysts’ estimate of $1.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4 percent to $682.4 million, missing analysts’ estimate of $686 million. Kansas City Southern dominates cross-border rail trade between the United States and Mexico and draws about 30 percent of its revenue from U.S.-Mexico shipments. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants to hammer out a trade deal with Mexico, and then do a separate one with Canada, sowing fresh doubts about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump pledged during his election campaign to revamp the 24-year-old NAFTA trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which he has called a disaster for the United States.

-0.5162142869184897," UPDATE 3-Kansas City Southern results hurt by U.S. rail congestion (Adds details on rising costs) April 20 (Reuters) - Kansas City Southern, a regional U.S. railroad with extensive operations in Mexico, reported lower-than expected quarterly revenue on Friday despite a 1 percent overall increase in rail volumes. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company said its revenue gains in consumer goods, automotive and petroleum products were partially offset by big drops in agriculture, minerals and other energy cargo, as well as higher fuel and labor costs. Quarterly revenue of $639 million - a 5 percent increase from the year-ago period - fell short of the $641 million Wall Street analysts expected. Despite the miss, its shares increased by about 1 percent in early trade before settling flat at $110.41. The railroad said congestion in the U.S rail network was a big drag on the quarter. Kansas City Southern and other top U.S. railroads are facing scrutiny from the top federal rail regulator over persistent service complaints. Rising fuel prices shaved about $3 million off operating income, and its revenue was also hit by the closure of a coal-fired power plant in Texas, and by higher headcount despite a tiny overall bump in cargo volume. Analysts asked executives on a conference call about uncertainty over elections in Mexico and negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Kansas City Southern dominates cross-border rail trade between the United States and Mexico and draws about 30 percent of its revenue from U.S.-Mexico shipments. Chief Financial Officer Michael Upchurch told analysts he was “very pleased by recent progress” in the negotiations, while Brian Hancock, the head of marketing, said he expects “steady growth” as energy companies add new storage facilities in Mexico. “Tanks are now being constructed throughout the network as well as new projects being announced in the Gulf (of Mexico) at both Altamira and Veracruz ports,” he added. Quarterly net income of $145 million was down from $147 million in the year-ago period, but the railroad managed to eke out a rise in per-share net income, which was $1.40 compared with $1.38 per diluted share a year earlier. Adjusting for onetime items, the railroad reported earnings of $1.30 a share, compared with $1.17 a year ago. Analysts expected $1.33 per share. Its operating ratio - a closely watched measure of operating costs as a percentage of revenue - was 65.8 percent, a 0.4 point drop over the first quarter of 2017. Even so, the railroad maintained its outlook for mid-single-digit volume growth for full-year 2018. (Reporting by Eric M.
