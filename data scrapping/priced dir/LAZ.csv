9.96414211078287," Lazard fourth-quarter profit more than doubles as M&A activity surges (Reuters) - Investment bank Lazard Ltd reported a 147% surge in fourth-quarter profit on Friday, powered by growth in its financial advisory business as corporate dealmaking activity ended the year on a high. Lazard, whose business is split between asset management and financial advisory, reported adjusted net income of $192 million, or $1.66 per share, for the quarter, compared with $105 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 97 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Generally speaking it was a very strong M&A market both in the third and fourth quarter. I think the year is off to a pretty strong start across the board, both in the U.S. and Europe, and we’re seeing quite a bit of activity right now,” Lazard Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said in an interview. Global M&A activity, one of Lazard’s main revenue drivers, roared back to life in the second half of 2020, even though overall dealmaking activity fell to a three-year low as companies grappled with the financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s really technology-driven disruption across industries that’s driving a lot of the activity for most of the companies that have an advantage and those trying to catch up,” said Jacobs. An increase in shareholder activism, a surge in SPAC transactions and companies’ considerations around environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters have also contributed to the increased M&A activity, Jacobs added. Lazard’s net revenue for the quarter surged 22% to $878 million and its operating revenue rose to a record quarterly high of $849 million. Operating revenue from the financial advisory business grew 29% to a record quarterly high of $509 million, while revenue from the asset management arm rose 12% compared with the year-ago period."

9.96414211078287," UPDATE 1-Lazard restructures in Australia amid M&A sector shake-up (Adds M&A rankings, revenue for 2020) SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Investment bank Lazard Ltd said on Friday it is reorganising its Australia operations, retaining its asset management arm in the country in-house but handing over mergers and acquisitions advisory services to a new, “affiliated” firm. A person with direct knowledge of the situation said a number of redundancies were announced at the firm on Thursday, without disclosing how many jobs were affected. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the details were private. A Lazard spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the new advisory firm in Australia will retain an “affiliation” with Lazard and be headed by Melbourne-based Andrew Leyden, a seasoned infrastructure and energy banker who currently heads the firm in the country. The move comes amid a shake-up in the investment banking market in Australia, with South Africa’s Investec announcing plans to exit from the country in December, while newcomers such Barrenjoey -backed by Barclays Plc- and local firm Jarden, raid competitors for talent. M&A advisory revenue in Australia tumbled 50% in 2020 to $1.24 billion, according to Refinitiv data, as activity plummeted with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting economies and hurting business confidence around the world. Bankers, however, expect a rebound in 2021, driven by a global economic recovery, ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing from central banks. Lazard, “regularly reviews our global footprint; assessing local office productivity and potential for future growth,” the spokeswoman added. There would be “no impact on Lazard Asset Management in Australia”, she said. “We have good visibility on the Australian financial advisory business and decided this was the right time.” Lazard was 7th in target advisory rankings in Australia for 2020, according to Refinitiv, while Goldman Sachs topped the same league table. The firm is currently advising New Zealand’s takeover target Tilt Renewables Ltd and last year acted as defence advisor for wind and solar firm Infigen Energy. “A core team will continue to work on all current mandates,” the spokeswoman added. The person with direct knowledge of the matter said the new firm was expected to operate in a similar partnership model to Lazard’s operations in South Korea, where in 2013 it established a “strategic alliance” instead of a fully owned office.

The company, Lazard Growth Acquisition Corp. I, said it would sell 50 million units, made up of shares and warrants, at $10 apiece. The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) saw attractive investment opportunities in the healthcare, technology, energy transition, financial and consumer sectors, it said. (bit.ly/39eNvvp) A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an IPO to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded as a result. SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised. Lazard Growth Acquisition expects to list its units on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LGACU”. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as the sole book-running manager for the proposed offering."
-1.2380068793173231," Saudi NEOM JV working with Lazard on $5 billion hydrogen project - sources DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - A joint venture comprising Air Products, ACWA Power and NEOM has hired financial firm Lazard to advise it on a planned $5 billion hydrogen project in the NEOM high-tech business zone in Saudi Arabia, sources said. Lazard, which advised Saudi oil giant Aramco on its initial public offering in 2019, has recently approached banks to sound out their appetite for the project, said two sources familiar with the matter. Lazard, the world’s largest hydrogen producer New York-listed Air Products, Saudi energy developer ACWA Power and NEOM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The project, which will be equally owned by the three partners, will produce green ammonia for export to global markets, the companies said in July last year. Saudi Arabia is expected to borrow tens of billions of dollars this year to fill state coffers hit by lower oil prices and to boost liquidity at state entities such as the Public Investment Fund (PIF), NEOM’s cornerstone investor. NEOM - announced in 2017 as a pillar of Saudi plans to diversify the economy - is a 26,500-square-km (10,230-square-mile) high-tech development on the Red Sea with several zones, including an industrial and logistics areas, planned for completion in 2025. This week, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, unveiled plans to build a zero-carbon city at NEOM, with infrastructure costs of $100 billion to $200 billion. Hydrogen has gained traction as the future green fuel of choice, increasingly touted as a way to decarbonise emissions-intensive heavy industry and transport sectors. The $5 billion project in NEOM will consist of a 1.2 million tonnes a year green ammonia plant, which will use hydrogen produced from an electrolyser powered by more than 4 GW of solar, wind and storage. Production is due to begin in 2025."
19.025402511914443," Lazard snaps up PJT restructuring banker as COVID second wave hits LONDON (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd has hired restructuring banker Sam Whittaker from PJT Partners to oversee negotiations between companies and their creditors across Europe, the Middle East and Africa as a second wave of COVID-19 leaves many businesses fighting for survival. Whittaker, who started his banking career at Lazard LAZ.N in 2005 and then moved to fellow investment bank PJT in 2015, will re-join Lazard as a London-based managing director in its EMEA restructuring franchise. The 45-year old Briton will work closely with David Burlison, who co-heads Lazard’s EMEA restructuring practice, and Chris Mallon, who joined Lazard in April as a senior adviser. “One of the many benefits of having Sam back is that he has an extensive network of relationships with banks, hedge funds and lawyers which clearly is a big plus for us,” Burlison told Reuters. The U.S. bank, which leads Refinitiv’s league tables for this year’s global restructurings ahead of PJT Partners and Houlihan Lokey, has also hired James Simpson as a director in October as part of a push to win business on behalf of companies with liquidity issues and their creditors. Independent advisory firms with restructuring capability, such as Lazard and Houlihan Lokey, are in high demand as boardrooms seek to limit the damage of a new wave of lockdowns across Europe. “The second wave of coronavirus has made capital requirements even more acute and exacerbated the need for a comprehensive debt restructuring,” Burlison said. “As household disposable income is increasingly reduced through the course of the pandemic, more companies are likely to run into trouble,” he added. Lazard’s restructuring pipeline this year has been equally split between advising companies and their lenders. It has handled complex negotiations involving energy companies such as oil and gas producer Premier Oil and offshore oil drillers Valaris and Seadrill as well as hospital operator NMC Health. The 172-year old bank - founded in New Orleans by French brothers Alexandre, Lazare and Simon Lazard as a dry goods merchant dubbed Lazard Frères & Co - is also close to a number of European companies, such as Spanish renewable energy firm Abengoa, that have used Chapter 11 in the United States as a conduit for restructuring their debt. Burlison said restructuring mandates are the result of cooperation between various parts of the bank, including debt and equity capital markets as well as M&A advisory. “We all work in unison to provide a full spectrum of solutions to clients facing difficult times or periods of stress,” he said."
22.288325301063143," Lazard quarterly profit beats estimates on M&A recovery (Reuters) - Investment bank Lazard Ltd LAZ.N comfortably beat quarterly profit expectations on Thursday thanks to a recovery in deal-making activity, although weakness in its asset management arm weighed. Dealmaking activity spiked to a record $1 trillion in the third quarter. But mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals overall were down 21% at $2.2 trillion in the first nine months of 2020. Operating revenue from Lazard’s M&A financial advisory business, its biggest breadwinner, rose 1% in the quarter, while revenue from its asset management arm fell 8%. For the financial advisory unit, it was the first quarterly year-on-year increase since the last three months of 2018. Cheap financing for deals, companies’ ability to use stock as acquisition currency and a growing boardroom conviction about the economic landscape could ensure a sustained M&A recovery, according to Lazard Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs. “You don’t need necessarily an optimistic outlook on the economy. What you need is the ability to have some confidence to predict the future,” Jacobs said in an interview. The bank, whose business is split between asset management and financial advisory, said adjusted net income for the three months to Sept. 30 fell to $76 million, or 67 cents per share, from $88 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. The figure was higher than Refinitiv IBES estimates of 47 cents per share. Lazard’s total assets under management fell to $228 billion at the end of the quarter from $231 billion a year earlier but was up from the prior quarter. The quarterly inflows were supported by Lazard bringing in three new teams focused on credit, emerging markets and digital health investments, as well as three new fund launches."

25.60048296229718," Suriname taps Lazard to advise on debt restructuring plan PARAMARIBO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Suriname has tapped French investment bank Lazard Ltd to help the South American nation refinance its foreign debt, President Chan Santokhi said on Thursday. The priority will be to seek a rescheduling and restructuring of two loans from investment bank Oppenheimer, Santokhi said at a news conference. “It’s an amount of 550 million (U.S. dollars) plus 125 million in loans that the previous government had made, that we need to reschedule and bring them to a proportionally acceptable level,” Santokhi said. Lazard will provide support for negotiations with international lenders including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and will be tasked with helping find new capital for investment in Suriname, Santokhi said. The country’s central bank last month sharply devalued the Suriname dollar as the government’s finances have been stretched thin as following heavy spending by the previous administration. The country’s chief prosecutor is investigating former Finance Minister Gilmore Hoefdraad for alleged corruption and fraud. Three bank directors have been arrested for corruption. Hoefdraad has denied wrongdoing. Suriname’s foreign debt stands at around $4 billion, with debt service absorbing large amounts of government income.

33.386437349844336," HSBC in final talks to sell French retail business at hefty loss: sources FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Cerberus and a rival investment firm have told HSBC HSBA.L they would buy its French retail arm for a symbolic one euro provided the British bank ploughs more than 500 million euros ($582.70 million) into the business, sources told Reuters. HSBC is working with Lazard to sell its 270 retail branches in France as part of Chief Executive Noel Quinn’s strategy to slash costs across the banking group. The bank has been struggling to attract interest in the unit as bidders fret at the heavy restructuring assumed to be necessary and complex talks with local regulators. Cerberus and the other investor are the only bidders left in the process while French banks, which initially studied the dossier, have all walked away, three sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They did not name the other investor. Cerberus and HSBC declined to comment. HSBC has previously said the business is under a strategic review. Both bidders want the business to be fully recapitalised with HSBC injecting at least 500 million euros before they can buy it for a symbolic amount of one euro, the sources said. “The price is going to be disastrous for HSBC,” of the sources said. While the British lender is still working to reach an agreement by the end of the year, the process could still fall through due to regulatory demands and the prospect of heavy job cuts, another source said. The sale process is culminating just as European bank share prices come under fresh pressure due to concerns about the economic impact of a second wave of COVID-19, with the STOXX 600 bank index .SX7P hitting a record low on Friday. HSBC France said in its first half results that its private banking and wealth management business posted a 225 million adjusted loss before tax.

16.593801547337346," Lazard second-quarter earnings fall amid COVID-19 slump in dealmaking (Reuters) - Investment bank Lazard Ltd LAZ.N on Friday reported an 8% fall in second-quarter adjusted earnings per share, a smaller drop than analysts had expected, as the slowdown in corporate dealmaking due to the COVID-19 pandemic weighed. The slump came as global M&A activity, one of Lazard’s main revenue drivers, tumbled to its lowest level in more than a decade in the second quarter, as companies gave up on expansion plans to focus on protecting their balance sheets and employees in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Larger M&A activity has shown signs of picking up in the third quarter with 40 deals worth at least $1 billion announced during this month, down almost one third on July, 2019 but up 29% from June, according to Refinitiv data. “The one thing we’ve learned form this pandemic is that it’s reasonably difficult to predict the future. That said, it feels like Q2 probably turns out to be the low (M&A activity),” Lazard Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said in an interview. “At least at the moment there seems to be an increasing pace of conversations.” Lazard, whose business is split between financial advisory and asset management, said earnings per share was 67 cents, well ahead of a median of analysts’ expectations for 38 cents, according to Refinitiv, and compared to 73 cents a year earlier. Operating revenue from Lazard’s financial advisory business, its biggest source of earnings, dropped 11% in the second quarter year on year. Fellow investment banking advisory firm Evercore EVR.N has also reported falling revenues for the quarter. New York-based Lazard said average assets under management at the end of the second quarter was $215 billion, up from $193 billion in the prior quarter. Lazard shares are down 30% so far in 2020, lagging the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX."
28.896215321900677," Lazard gears up for post-COVID sovereign debt restructurings PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - More governments could be forced into negotiations with creditors this year as the coronavirus crisis piles further pressure onto countries already struggling with debt repayments, executives at investment bank Lazard said. The U.S. firm with roots in France, which has long carved out a niche advising states on their debt restructurings, is pitching for more mandates after adding clients including Argentina and Lebanon this year. “Countries that have borrowed in a currency that is not their own and don’t have a central bank that can help are being choked,” Pierre Cailleteau, managing director in Lazard’s Paris-based sovereign advisory team, told Reuters. “There are going to be many situations of financial distress.” Emerging market debt was sold heavily in March as lockdowns were put in place to halt the pandemic but has recovered some lost ground as economies restart and after G20 governments suspended payments owed by some of the poorest countries. Lazard executives declined to comment on which countries might be close to needing sovereign debt overhauls involving private creditors. Falling prices for raw materials and especially oil -- major foreign currency earners -- are among potential triggers for debt restructurings, according to Lazard’s head of France, Jean-Louis Girodolle. “The ingredients for there to be other situations of difficulties on the sovereign debt front are there,” he said. Belize said recently that it would ask holders of its U.S. dollar bond due in 2034 to agree a deferral of interest payments for six months, citing a devastating collapse in tourism revenues because of the pandemic. [nL1N2DV0RN] Falling tourism and textiles earnings are also straining Sri Lanka’s public finances, although its central bank said in May the island would honour all its debt service obligations. [nL8N2D43V9] Debt restructurings are likely to be more complex than ever, Cailleteau said, citing increasingly assertive bondholders, the rise of China as a creditor and questions over the approach index-tracking funds might take. “It’s very, very rare that we are going to have situations where you can just open the rulebook and go to chapter one,” he said. A wave of sovereign restructurings could be a potential boon for Lazard and its handful of competitors as the coronavirus outbreak derails company mergers and acquisitions, their other main area of expertise. Lazard’s team of 20 sovereign specialists has also been hired by Zambia and Ecuador this year. Some of the firm’s star bankers have left, including to competitors vying for the same business, with sovereign debt specialist Eric Lalo jumping ship to Rothschild and former French CEO Mathieu Pigasse joining U.S. boutique Centerview. Despite the merry-go-round, one restructuring banker who has pitched for business against Lazard said states were often keen to play it safe, one advantage for the firm. The Lebanese government for example had been reassured to see the bank hired by an “experienced defaulter” like Argentina, he said. The fact that Lazard does not lend meanwhile lessens any perception that its advice might be influenced by the potential for underwriting fees, according to David Fanger, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. Debt restructurings can be especially drawn-out affairs for advisors, which are mostly paid through success fees. Talks in Lebanon, which involve the International Monetary Fund, have been bogged down by internal disagreements, including between the government and the central bank. [nL8N2E72Y4] Lazard executives declined to comment on the outlook for Lebanon."
28.896215321900677," Corporate activist investors eye Europe, Japan more in first half: Lazard BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors demanded more change at European and Japanese companies in the first half of 2020 while giving U.S. companies a pass, for now, new data from investment bank Lazard show. While U.S. companies have long been activists’ favorite targets, they made up only 42% of all campaigns launched in the first six months of the year. Starboard Value's demands at GCP Applied Technologies GCP.N and Elliott Management's push for changes at Evergy EVRG.N ranked as major U.S. campaigns in the first half. In total investors launched 42 campaigns and put $9 billon to work. A year earlier, Lazard counted 71 campaigns at U.S. companies where investors put $15 billion to work in the first half. Europe and Asia, especially Japan, saw more activity, Lazard said, reporting that Europe’s share of global campaign activity rose to 28% in the first half. “U.S. campaigns declined notably in the first half of 2020, driven by ongoing uncertainty about the impact of COVID on corporate balance sheets, operations and performance, and the depth and length of a U.S. recession and recovery,” said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard. “Unlike the U.S., campaigns surged in Japan, driven by a growing set of local activists and large U.S. activists who see over-looked opportunities for change, and increased in Europe, particularly in Germany,” he added. In Japan, 19 campaigns were launched in the first half, matching the record 19 campaigns seen in all of 2019. U.S. investment firm ValueAct Capital asked that Nintendo 7974.T transform itself into a broader entertainment company, was a notable campaign. Activists also appeared to have backed off calls for companies to sell themselves as the coronavirus outbreak made for uncertain times.

5.391040976239707," Corporate activists flex muscles again with more campaigns in May: Lazard data BOSTON (Reuters) - Corporate agitators who had tread lightly as the deadly coronavirus spread in March and April stepped up the pressure on global corporations by launching 16 new campaigns in May, including five in Japan, data from Lazard Ltd LAZ.N show. The campaigns in May are double the number in April and bring the total to 83 in the first five months of 2020. But the pace is off monthly averages seen before the novel coronavirus outbreak, the investment bank which tracks the data said on Wednesday. The data will be released later in the day. Activists are putting “money to work to take advantage of attractive valuations while they last,” said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard. Near term, he said activity will remain subdued but there could be a “strong resurgence in activism in the second half of the year.” Investors like Elliott Management and Oasis Management took on companies ranging from CenterPoint Energy to Mitsubishi Logistics, illustrating fresh trends in finding partners for campaigns, and targeted Japanese companies long thought to be off limits. Elliott teamed up with mutual funds Fidelity, MFS and Capital Group to back energy delivery company CenterPoint Energy with $1.4 billion, while Oasis called for share buybacks and the election of new board members at Japan’s Mitsubishi Logistics last month. In April, Lazard said activist investors would likely scale back campaigns as target companies brace for a deep recession. But as markets recovered from dramatic virus-sparked sell-offs -- the benchmark U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 average is now down 6% after sinking roughly 30% earlier in the year -- the landscape has improved for corporate agitators. Starboard Value last month won eight board seats at GCP Applied Technologies and leads other hedge funds in winning seats this year with a total of 14."
14.027830960855688," Lazard boosts restructuring team as coronavirus-hit firms run into trouble LONDON (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd has bolstered its senior restructuring team as it seeks to win business from companies struggling to stay afloat in the midst of the economic turbulence caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. investment bank has created a new London-based role for former Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom partner, Chris Mallon, to join as a senior adviser to its global restructuring practice. “Chris will be involved on complex restructuring situations as a key part of our global team,” Lazard’s co-head of restructuring for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) David Burlison told Reuters. The International Monetary Fund has predicted the global economy will contract by 3% during 2020, a stunning collapse of activity that has forced companies into negotiations with lenders and governments to seek emergency aid. Independent advisory firms with restructuring capability such as Lazard and Rothschild are in high demand as boardrooms scramble to mitigate the damage of a downturn that has been compared to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Mallon has handled corporate restructurings for more than three decades, holding a senior role at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as well as Skadden. He worked on the demise of American energy company Enron and also advised the likes of Eurotunnel, operator of the tunnel linking Britain and France, Italian dairy group Parmalat and Danish shipping firm Torm A/S in their debt restructuring efforts. The 63-year-old Briton serves as non-executive director of London-based IT network firm Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) which completed a Chapter 11 financial restructuring in December under Lazard’s advice. In his new post he will support Lazard UK boss Cyrus Kapadia as well as Lazard’s most senior dealmakers around the world. RESTRUCTURING ‘BOON’ The surge in demand for restructuring work has proven a boon for advisory firms that need to offset lost opportunities from a sharp slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), which dropped 28% in the first quarter of the year and remains in freefall. Lazard, which also advises governments in restructuring their sovereign debt, has seen its corporate pipeline grow significantly since lockdowns were enforced in Europe and the United States, winning mandates for Boeing Co BA.N and Macy's Inc M.N, among others. “We’re working with a range of companies to help them assess the impact of coronavirus and to think through their business plans and liquidity positions,” Burlison said. Global debt restructuring deals have totalled $26.4 billion since the start of the year, according to Refinitiv data, down 70% from the same period last year. But more business is in the pipeline as most companies are expected to ask their lenders to relax covenants, prompting a new wave of mandates on behalf of creditors in the coming months. The 172-year-old bank has engaged various teams across its global network to woo cash-strapped clients with a range of options, including tapping equity capital markets and enhancing debt-raising capabilities. “It’s not just about restructuring,” Burlison said. “Ultimately companies across sectors want to ensure that they’re doing everything they can to protect their businesses.”"

The drop came as global banking revenue for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), one of Lazard’s main revenue drivers, fell 10% in 2019 to $25.8 billion, according to Dealogic. Lazard ranked seventh in global bank M&A last year, up from eighth in 2018, Dealogic league table data showed. Operating revenue from Lazard’s financial advisory business, its biggest source of earnings, fell 10% in 2019 to $1.36 billion. The decline slowed in the fourth quarter to 1% year on year. “We’ve got strong momentum in our business going into 2020. 2020 feels like a better start for us than 2019, which is good, on both sides of the business,” Lazard Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said in an interview. Net income in the fourth quarter came in at $76.98 million, a 32% year-on-year drop and missing a forecast for $82.2 million, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, and down from $111.4 million a year earlier. Lazard’s diluted adjusted net income per share for the fourth quarter fell to 91 cents, down 3% from 94 cents a year earlier but comfortably beating analysts’ average estimates for 82 cents. Shares pared early gains to trade down 1.1% at $42.19 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning. New York-based Lazard, whose business is split between financial advisory and asset management, said average assets under management at the end of the fourth quarter were $248 billion, up from $231 billion in the prior quarter.

13.274361462332493," Spain's Abengoa hires Lazard in bid to strengthen its capital structure MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish renewable energy and engineering firm Abengoa ABG.MC announced on Thursday it had hired U.S. investment bank Lazard to study ways to reinforce its capital structure. The company said the move was “aimed at strengthening its competitive position, its capital structure and its income statement.” It did not give further details. The Seville-based company in 2016 avoided becoming Spain’s largest-ever corporate bankruptcy after striking a refinancing deal on its debt worth 9 billion euros ($10 billion), which handed creditors control of the company. Abengoa’s statement came after Spanish paper El Economista said Abengoa was searching for an industrial partner to inject capital to fund its growth in engineering and construction. “The company headed by Gonzalo Urquijo is open to different options, but the main goal is to bring in capital from a new investor,” the newspaper said."
15.721445945684225," Lazard looks in-house for next crop of French rainmakers PARIS (Reuters) - Lazard’s Jean-Louis Girodolle has no intention of becoming a “public figure” as he emerges from the shadow of Matthieu Pigasse as the investment bank’s new boss in France. Pigasse, a former senior French Treasury official, was widely credited with bringing in millions of dollars of business during his 17 years at Lazard, including its mandate to advise oil giant Saudi Aramco on its planned listing. His abrupt exit last month raised questions over Lazard's LAZ.N ability to adapt its business model to life without a key ""rainmaker"". “It’s not a one-man show,” Girodolle, the new CEO of Lazard’s investment banking in France, told Reuters in an interview at its Paris offices on Boulevard Haussmann. “My intention is not to run alone. I will make sure that everyone feels included, listened to and part of the game,” the 51-year old executive said. Paris is the firm’s second most important hub after New York, running much of its European and Middle Eastern business, as well as all of its sovereign advisory work. Lazard ranks as France’s second biggest advisory firm after BNP Paribas for the first 10 months of 2019, Refinitiv data showed. “Matthieu didn’t leave because the Paris office is in some kind of crisis,” said Girodolle, sporting a goatee beard and dressed in a black suit. “This is one of the most dynamic offices within the organization and we don’t feel the need to change our strategy.” Girodolle, who joined Lazard in 2007, is known by rivals as the archetypal French banker, having previously worked for the French Government Shareholding Agency as well as the Ministry of Finance in various senior roles. Like Pigasse, also 51, Girodolle studied at the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris before attending the Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA), well-known as a stepping-stone for France’s political and business elite. He initially handled major deals involving state-backed firms, but his responsibilities grew in recent years to overseeing operations while Pigasse was on the road hunting down deal mandates. Pigasse, who has said he is looking to pursue a “new entrepreneurial project”, declined to comment when approached by Reuters. His farewell followed the departure of two other bankers Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual, who left in early October, prompting speculation of further defections among the roughly 140 bankers at Lazard Paris. Ken Jacobs, Lazard’s group chairman and chief executive, flew to Paris from the United States in late October to manage the exit of Pigasse, which the firm had denied just one week earlier. Pigasse oversaw an influx of six managing directors from rival banks in the last two years, while only two internal bankers were promoted, leading some to question his approach to developing talent within the firm. “Under Pigasse’s leadership, it was difficult for junior partners to emerge as he used to centralise the coverage of France’s biggest clients and personally handle these relationships,” former Morgan Stanley banker Xavier Mayer said. “Those who were supposed to replace the old guard ended up leaving and were never replaced,” he told Reuters. Shortly after Pigasse left, Jacobs broadened the leadership in Paris, appointing senior partners Charles-Henri Filippi and François Kayat to new co-chairmen roles for investment banking in France. “MOMENT TO SHINE” Girodolle has no immediate plans to significantly change staff numbers at Lazard, focusing instead on making its office in Paris a more “inclusive” workplace and giving everyone “their moment to shine”. “We’re not currently planning to hire senior people and if we did it would be on a very selective basis,” he added. He stressed the change in leadership will not lead to a change in strategy even if the bank faces an increasingly competitive landscape with several U.S. boutique banks looking to hire in Paris. Lazard has consistently ranked as one of France’s top five advisers since 2015, Refinitiv data shows, but its arch rival Rothschild remains the highest fee earner across all French investment banking. “Lazard’s dominance in France is on the wane as they are under pressure from both bulge-bracket banks and rival M&A boutiques,” said Mayer, whose grandfather Antoine Bernheim was a star Lazard M&A banker over three decades. Although Lazard is advising Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MI majority owner Exor EXOR.MI on its merger talks with Peugeot PEUP.PA, sources told Reuters it failed to land a major role representing Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH LVMH.PA on its $14.5 billion bid approach for jeweller Tiffany & Co TIF.N. Girodolle is taking nothing for granted. “You are never the owner of a client. Day after day you need to demonstrate that you deserve to be your client’s first choice,” he said."
13.796435833651591," Lazard axes 200 jobs as profit falls amid dealmaking slowdown NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd LAZ.N said on Thursday it had axed about 200 employees after a review of its business, as the investment bank reported a 21% drop in third-quarter adjusted net income amid a slowdown in worldwide deal activity. Lazard’s business is split between financial advisory and asset management services. Along with others in the industry it has suffered from a downturn in global merger and acquisition activity, which fell 10% in the first nine months from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. “The macroeconomic, geopolitical environment obviously is pretty complex right now and there has been a lot of volatility in markets. But I think where we came out in the quarter is ok and our momentum going into the future feels pretty good right now” Lazard Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said in an interview. Lazard posted net income of $88 million. That was short of the $111 million in the same period last year but beat analyst expectations for $82.2 million, Refinitiv data showed. The stock was down around 3.4% in early New York trading. The bank also said it had axed about 200 employees after a review of its business across financial advisory, asset management and corporate functions. At the end of 2018, Lazard had around 3,000 employees. “A lot of it is really just putting our chip on the areas that we wanted to continue to focus on so we continue to hire. This is just creating room, creating flexibility to continue investing for that growth,” Chief Financial Officer Evan Russo said on a call with investors. Jacobs said the bank wants to expand further into North America and non-M&A advisory. Revenue from Lazard’s financial advisory business, its biggest source of earnings, was roughly flat in the three months through September compared with a year earlier, but was down 13% for the first nine months of 2019. Fellow investment banking advisory firm Evercore EVR.N last week also reported a fall in quarterly profit. Lazard said average assets under management for the quarter were $234 billion, down from $237 billion in the prior quarter. The bank's shares are up around 4% so far in 2019, lagging an advance of about 21% in the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX."

17.936037943754407," Star French banker Pigasse resigns from Lazard PARIS (Reuters) - French banker Matthieu Pigasse is to leave Lazard after 17 years to pursue a new entrepreneurial project, an exit that will see the firm lose one of its biggest rainmakers. For Lazard, Pigasse has led the world’s largest sovereign debt restructurings in Greece, Argentina and Ukraine, as well as multi-billion mergers such as those between Unibail-Rodamco and Westfield, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim, Safran and Zodiac. “I am excited to begin my next chapter beyond investment banking in a new entrepreneurial project,” Lazard cited Pigasse as saying. Pigasse has been reflecting on his future for about eight months, a source close to the banker said, adding that he took the decision only in the last few days. Lazard did not want to let him go, the source said, but Pigasse needed a new challenge. His departure follows rumors about the future of the flamboyant 51-year-old Pigasse, a punk rock aficionado who has deep relationships with members of the French establishment. Reuters reported earlier this month that he had talked to several U.S. boutique investment banks. In May this year, Lazard announced a reshuffle of its senior leadership, with Pigasse named global head of banking and deputy CEO of financial advisory, while also retaining his job as chairman and chief executive of Lazard France. Lazard CEO Kenneth Jacobs said at the time that Pigasse was “central to our success in France and elsewhere” and that his new focus would be to help the firm’s new CEO of financial advisory, Peter Orszag, win more business globally. “It was not my decision, it was Matthieu’s decision (to resign),” Jacobs, who is in Paris, told Reuters on Sunday in a statement sent via a Lazard spokesperson. Pigasse is well-known in Paris business and media circles due to his shareholding in newspaper Le Monde and business interests in Radio Nova and Les Inrockuptibles cultural magazine. He joined Lazard as a managing director in 2002, becoming its youngest ever partner. The bank said it would announce a new leadership team in France shortly."

17.974514375397607," HSBC taps Lazard to sell French retail business: source LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings has hired U.S. investment bank Lazard Ltd LAZ.N to sell its French retail business, a source close to the matter told Reuters, as part of a plan by new interim chief executive Noel Quinn to reduce costs across the banking group. HSBC HSBA.L, Europe's biggest bank by assets, has carried out a strategic review of the French retail business, which has around 270 branches and employs up to 3,000 staff out of 8,000 in France overall. The business could be worth about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), analysts and bankers estimated. An auction process was expected to kick off in the coming weeks, when confidential information packages would be circulated to potential buyers to undertake due diligence checks on the business, the source said. Lazard declined to comment. Quinn, who became interim CEO in August after the bank announced the surprise departure of John Flint, has between six to 12 months from that date to make his case for the permanent role, so he is expected to move quickly to try and improve HSBC returns, which have been hit by an economic slowdown in China. The French sale is complicated by a general fall in profitability for retail banking among European banks, as low interest rates have constrained returns, banking sources said. Lazard was expected to sound out French banks, including BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, Credit Mutuel and Societe Generale SOGN.PA, these sources said, adding that talks would be tough as local banks were in no rush to bulk up their local presence. HSBC, which makes most of its profits in Asia, said in August it would be laying off about 4,000 people this year. Its business outlook has deteriorated due to an escalation of the trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market and Britain’s plan to leave the European Union. HSBC has been present in France, its biggest hub in continental Europe, since 2000 when it bought Credit Commerciale de France (CCF) for about 11 billion euros."

-1.5867924668537974," Lazard sees better financial advisory business in second half, shares up (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd LAZ.N said on Thursday it expects its financial advisory business to post better results in the second half of 2019, sending shares up about 6%. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory activity for the financial adviser has picked up globally since end June, including in Europe, where the company saw a dip in completed deals in second quarter, it said. Mega deals have set the pace for M&A globally as large U.S. companies defied U.S.-China trade row jitters and seized on strong equity and debt capital markets last quarter. While global M&A volume fell 27% to $842 billion from first quarter, it could have been significantly worse if it was not for those mega deals, Refinitiv data showed. Lazard advised on several high-profile deals in the quarter such as International Business Machines Corp's IBM.N $34 billion acquisition of software company Red Hat Inc and Ingersoll-Rand Plc's IR.N $15 billion spin-off of its industrial unit. “In financial advisory, we continue to expect the second half of 2019 to be stronger than the first half,” Chief Financial Officer Evan Russo said on a call with analysts. In the second quarter, revenue from the business fell 21%, but was better than what analysts’ had feared and even helped the financial adviser to beat quarterly profit estimates. Lower restructuring revenue and softness in European deal completions hurt the unit, the company said. Lazard wasn't the only one hurting. Financial advisory business was weak for several of the big U.S. investment banks such as Morgan Stanley MS.N and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N in the quarter. The company’s asset management business saw outflows of $5.2 billion and resulted in a 12% drop in revenue in the unit to $291 million. The Bermuda-headquartered company said total revenue fell 16% to $$650.8 million. Net income attributable to the company fell to $65.8 million, or 55 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $147.0 million, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier.

Lazard, often seen as a bellwether for the mergers and acquisitions advisory industry, said revenue in its financial advisory business fell 15 percent to $330 million, but still came above Wall Street estimates of $322.85 million. M&A activity in the United States got off to its strongest start since 2000, with $489.52 billion dollars in announced deals, up 9.4 percent compared to a year ago.

The company said in November it would review strategic alternatives for its portfolio of opioid-related assets, including Subsys. “We are in active negotiations with multiple parties regarding the potential divestiture of Subsys,” Chief Executive Saeed Motahari said on Thursday, adding the company expects the transaction to require shareholder approval. The potential divestiture process is being led by JMP Securities, a company spokeswoman said. “We engaged Lazard thereafter to advise us on our capital planning and strategic alternatives across the business. These are two independent efforts.” The news came amid an ongoing trial in federal court in Boston of five former Insys executives and managers including wealthy founder John Kapoor, who prosecutors allege engaged in a scheme to pay doctors bribes to prescribe Subsys. Prosecutors allege that Insys from 2012 to 2015 paid doctors kickbacks in the form of fees to participate in speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate medical professionals about Subsys that were poorly attended sham events. Kapoor, Insys’ former chairman who also served as CEO from November 2015 to January 2017, and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors brought the case amid a national opioid addiction epidemic. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in around 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017. In August, Insys said it had agreed to pay at least $150 million to resolve a related U.S. Justice Department probe. On Monday, Reuters reported that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is exploring filing for bankruptcy to address potentially significant liabilities from roughly 2,000 lawsuits alleging the drugmaker contributed to the deadly opioid crisis sweeping the United States."

Kathryn Hembree Night will start on Monday as a director, working for Jim Rossman who runs Lazard’s Shareholder Advisory practice, one of the sources said. Hembree Night spent five years at CamberView Partners and worked at Goldman Sachs in the bank’s mergers and acquisitions group before that. She is moving some six months after CamberView sold itself to boutique investment bank PJT Partners, becoming PJT Camberview. Demand is growing among corporations for help in protecting against activist shareholders who often suggest that management sell off divisions or return money to shareholders through share buybacks. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Evercore and Lazard as well as other banks offer such defense services. Hembree Night is one of a small number of women working in the activism defense sector and joins Mary Ann Deignan, who is a managing director in Lazard’s shareholder advisory group.

-1.6477877077877754," Serbia picks Lazard-led consortium to advise on major bank sale BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia’s government has chosen financial adviser Lazard, the Belgrade-based office of auditors KPMG and local law firm Prica and Partneri for the privatization of Komercijalna Banka, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. Serbia last year invited applications for a financial adviser to sell the government’s stake in the Balkan country’s second largest lender. “The next step is an analysis of bank’s financial position and preparation of all necessary documents needed for the (privatization) tender,” the ministry said in a statement. The state is the single largest shareholder in the bank, holding 41.75 percent. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank group, hold 24.43 and 10.15 percent respectively. A day earlier, Sinisa Mali, Serbia’s Finance Minister said the tender for the sale would be launched in May or June. Serbia wants to privatize Komercijalna Banka as part of 30-month non-financial advisory and monitoring program Between Belgrade and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Last month, Komercijalna Banka’s CEO Vladimir Medan said the lender has put its 2018 consolidated profit estimate at around 8.35 billion dinars ($80.37 million), the highest in a decade. Bermuda-headquartered Lazard had a market share of 25.1 percent for completed deals globally in the latest reported quarter, according to Refinitiv data. ($1 = 103.8900 Serbian dinars)"
-3.6812966045329354," Lazard trounces profit estimates on strength in M&A advisory (Reuters) - Financial adviser Lazard Ltd topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, buoyed by strong performance in its M&A advisory business, and said it expected further improvement in deal-making activity in 2019. Lazard, seen as a bellwether for mergers and acquisitions, said revenue from its advisory business rose a better-than-expected 19 percent in the fourth quarter, helped largely by M&As. “There has been an improvement in M&A from the third and fourth quarters, when there was a bit of concern about the outlook for markets, as well as the economy,” Chief Executive Officer Ken Jacobs said in an interview. U.S. market volatility spiked in the last month of 2018 due to uncertainty around global growth, the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit, hitting sentiment and prompting companies to delay striking big deals, as well as initial public offerings over valuation concerns. “Valuations are probably more reasonable than they were last year. Credit spreads have not widened a lot, so financing is still widely available in investment and non-investment grade factors,” Jacobs said. The Bermuda-headquartered advisory firm had a market share of 25.1 percent for completed deals globally in the latest reported quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Some of the big deals Lazard advised during 2018 included Aetna’s $78 billion sale to CVS Health and Express Scripts’ $67 billion sale to Cigna, the company said. While M&A remained strong in the quarter, the company’s asset management business saw outflows of $3.2 billion due to the higher market volatility and resulted in a 17 percent drop in revenue in the unit. The company, which has been trying to grow the asset management business to diversify its revenue streams, said total revenue was largely unchanged at $684.5 million in the fourth quarter. Lazard's adjusted net income fell 20 percent to $118.9 million, or 94 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.(reut.rs/2D6ZPMV) Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 92 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The comments come after the company posted a 1 percent year-over-year drop in the business to $304 million in the third quarter, mostly due to weakness in its restructuring operations. M&A volumes saw a double-digit increase, Jacobs said. Global M&As in the third quarter fell 35 percent from the prior quarter, as an escalating U.S-China trade dispute cast a shadow on the financial and regulatory prospects of some deals."
