-2.45283018867924," Colfax nears deal to sell air and gas unit to KPS: sources (Reuters) - Welding and valves manufacturer Colfax Corp CFX.N is nearing a deal to sell its air and gas handling division to private equity firm KPS Capital Partners for more than $1.8 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The sale would help Colfax pay down debt following its $3.15 billion acquisition in February of medical devices maker DJO Global Inc from buyout firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N. It underscores its decision to focus on high-margin and less cyclical businesses. A deal could be announced as soon as this week, the sources said, cautioning it was still possible that negotiations end without a deal. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations were confidential. Representatives for Colfax, which has a market capitalization of $3.2 billion, and KPS, which has assets under management of more than $5 billion, did not respond to requests for comment. Colfax’s air and gas handling unit provides heavy-duty centrifugal and axial cooling fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors and ventilation control systems to the energy, mining, wastewater and general industrial industries under the Howden brand. In addition to DJO, the sale would leave Colfax with its fabrication technology business, which develops and manufactures consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting and joining of steels and aluminum for the wind power, marine, pipelines and energy markets, largely under the ESAB brand. Colfax bought DJO - its biggest-ever deal - to tap into growing demand for medical devices such as knee and hip implants from aging baby boomers. At the time, it said it would explore options - including a possible sale - for its air and gas handling division, which in 2017 generated 40 percent of Colfax’s total revenue of $3.3 billion. Colfax's founders – brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales – are familiar with the medical equipment industry, as they also launched Danaher Corp DHR.N, a key player in medical devices, back in 1984. Colfax Chief Executive Matt Trerotola worked at Danaher before joining Colfax in 2015."
28.541042109740534," Exclusive: Colfax picks Goldman to sell Howden business - sources LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Colfax Corp CFX.N is pressing ahead with plans to sell its air and gas handling unit Howden as part of a shift to focus on the medical devices industry and has hired Goldman Sachs to handle the process, four sources close to the matter told Reuters. An auction process for the 165-year old Scottish company, which makes heat exchangers and gas compressors largely for oil and gas companies, is expected to kick off in the coming days, the sources said. Colfax is hoping to fetch about 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) from the sale of the business, which employs more than 5,000 people globally and has operations in 16 countries including Mexico and Canada. It employs 350 people at its main UK site in Renfrew, near Glasgow. Howden, founded in 1854 and bought by Colfax in 2012, makes core earnings of more than 150 million pounds, two of the sources said, adding the business would mainly appeal to private equity funds due to lackluster interest amid industry buyers. Goldman, which declined to comment, is expected to send confidential information to potential bidders this week, one of the sources said. Colfax was not immediately available for comment. The sale would cement Colfax’s shift from its industrial roots following the $3.15 billion purchase of medical devices maker DJO Global Inc. in November. Colfax, which has a market value of $2.8 billion, bought DJO - its biggest ever deal - to tap growing demand for medical devices such as knee and hip implants from aging baby boomers. At the time, it said it would explore options - including a possible sale - for Howden, which in 2017 generated 40 percent of Colfax’s total revenue of $3.3 billion. The change of direction spooked some investors, with Colfax shares tumbling 15 percent on the news. Colfax's founders – brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales – are familiar with the medical equipment industry as they also launched Danaher Corp DHR.N, a key player in medical devices, back in 1984.

13.364250141831786," Colfax churns its business with $3.15 billion purchase of medical device maker (Reuters) - Colfax Corp CFX.N made a big bet on the medical device industry with its $3.15 billion purchase of DJO Global Inc, but its shares fell 15.2 percent as investors worried about its shift away from its industrial roots to a completely new sector. Colfax said it is exploring strategic options, including a sale, for its air and gas handling business, which makes compressors and turbines largely for oil and gas companies. The DJO deal, the company's biggest ever, moves it to a fast-growing industry familiar to its founders and chief executive officer. Brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales, who founded Colfax two decades ago, also built medical equipment company Danaher Corp DHR.N, while CEO Matt Trerotola worked at Danaher before joining Colfax. But the acquisition and plans to offload the air and gas unnerved investors and analysts. “It’s a completely new market for the firm, outside of the industrial market. Also, the strategic review of the non-welding business was unexpected,” Northcoast Research analyst Tom Hayes said. The company is buying DJO Global from Blackstone Group BX.N, hoping to tap the growing demand for medical devices such as knee and hip implants from aging baby boomers. “DJO strengthens our exposure to higher-growth, higher-margin, less cyclical markets,” Trerotola said on a call with analysts. The air and gas handling business, which makes heat exchangers and gas compressors, generated about 40 percent of Colfax’s total revenue in 2017. The core of the air handling business is tied to global energy projects, Hayes said. “These tend to be large in nature and thus are cyclical and can also be deferred or delayed, which makes the revenue from these projects more unreliable.” The DJO deal will add to Colfax’s adjusted profit in the first full year after the deal closes in the first quarter of 2019. DJO will operate as a new segment within Colfax after the deal. Colfax will fund the deal with cash, debt and equity. J.P. Morgan is the financial adviser of Colfax. Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo Securities LLC are advising DJO."
