15.463849043126293," TD Bank faces Stanford Ponzi scheme liquidators seeking $5.5 billion in trial TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank will defend itself in a trial starting in a Canadian court on Monday in which liquidators of the collapsed Antigua bank of former Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford are seeking $5.5 billion in damages. The joint liquidators of Stanford International Bank (SIB) allege “negligence and knowing assistance” by TD, Canada’s second-biggest lender, in allowing SIB to maintain correspondent accounts, according to a statement filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2019. Correspondent banking is the business of providing services to offshore financial institutions. The joint liquidators are Grant Thornton in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. The trial is scheduled to last three months, a spokesman for one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers said. Stanford is serving a 110-year prison term after being convicted in 2012 of running a $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme. “Like everyone else, during the time that Stanford International Bank was a customer of TD, we had no knowledge of, and no reason to suspect, any fraudulent activity was taking place,” a TD spokesman said. “TD is not responsible for the fraud committed by Allen Stanford.” TD estimated reasonably possible losses from legal and regulatory actions including the Stanford litigation of between zero and C$951 million ($750 million) as of Oct. 31. Provisions related to legal action will be taken when a loss becomes probable and an amount can be reliably estimated, it said in its 2020 annual report here. The plaintiffs allege that SIB’s “exponential” growth from 2002 to late 2008 made it TD’s largest correspondent banking customer and a significant source of revenue, claims the Canadian bank has denied. They are also seeking a full accounting of the revenue and profit from TD’s dealings with SIB and a return of those funds to Stanford’s investors. In November, a Swiss court ordered Societe Generale SA to surrender $150 million deposited by Stanford, saying it had failed to do proper due diligence. ($1 = 1.2680 Canadian dollars)"

9.375768204116804," TD, CIBC close out better-than-expected quarter for Canadian banks; outlook uncertain TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank TD.TO and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO beat analyst expectations for third-quarter profit on Thursday as strong earnings growth in their capital markets businesses helped offset weakness in almost every other unit. The results close out a reporting season that saw all but one of Canada’s six major banks beat expectations, as conservative provisions in the prior quarter and a jump in trading revenues helped limit the hit from the coronavirus pandemic. Even so, the banks warned of an uncertain environment ahead as government assistance and loan deferral programs wind down in the fourth quarter. While they anticipate an increase in delinquencies as a result, the lenders said the allowances they have built up should cover an increase in bad loans, as long as current economic assumptions hold. Shares of TD, Canada’s second-largest lender, rose 0.9% to C$66.97 in Toronto, while CIBC shares climbed 2.15% to C$104.20, both on track for their highest close since early March. The Canadian banks index .GSPTXBA is up 4.3% since Monday's close, compared with a 1% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark .GSPTSE. TD’s provisions for credit losses (PCL) more than tripled to C$2.2 billion from a year earlier, although they were down from C$3.2 billion in the previous quarter. “Over the last two quarters, we’ve added significantly to allowances for performing loans,” TD Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in an interview. “Our expectation is that the economic recovery will be a little bit uneven across regions and different businesses and we expect the recovery to be prolonged.” CIBC’s PCL jumped 80% to C$525 million from a year earlier, although they were down from C$1.4 billion in the previous quarter. That was better than estimates of C$715.7 million. The bank continues to see growth in deposits and loan growth, although that has moderated in some areas, but “going forward, it’s hard to see how things will play out,” CIBC chief financial officer, Hratch Panossian, told Reuters. TD Bank posted an 81% increase in capital markets profit, while CIBC’s rose 67%, in stark contrast to the performance of their Canadian and U.S. personal and commercial banking businesses, which saw earnings slide. Higher loan-loss provisions in these units and lower net interest margins amid decade-low interest rates eroded gains from increased loan and deposit volumes. With pandemic-driven loan deferral programs starting to wind down, CIBC’s Canadian loan balances in deferral accounted for about 11% of the total, from about 14% in the prior quarter. TD said total balances in deferral fell to 6% from 8% in the previous quarter. ($1 = 1.3144 Canadian dollars)"
12.892435747579157," TD Bank ordered to pay $122 million for overdraft enrollment practices: U.S. consumer agency WASHINGTON/TORONTO (Reuters) - TD Bank has been ordered to pay $97 million in restitution and $25 million in civil penalties for charging U.S. consumers fees without consent on its optional overdraft service, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said on Thursday. The U.S. unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank TD.TO charged consumers overdraft fees for ATM and one-time debit-card transactions without their consent, after claiming it was a free service. That violated regulations that govern electronic funds transfers, the agency said in a statement announcing one of its largest orders against a U.S. lender under the Trump administration. TD also failed to establish reasonable written policies regarding consumer-account information it provided to two specialty consumer reporting agencies, the CFPB said. It also issued pre-marked disclosure notices in some cases. As early as 2014, TD managers instructed bankers to present to certain off-site applicants of its Debit Card Advance (DCA) as a “free” service or benefit, while downplaying the fees and disclosures associated with the service, the CFPB said in its order. Bankers were also required to frame the accounts as a “feature” or “package” that “comes with” all new consumer-checking accounts, rather than as an option that new customers must opt into, the CFPB found. TD did not admit or deny the CFPB’s allegations, but agreed to pay the retribution to nearly 1.5 million customers, the agency said. It also required TD Bank to correct its DCA enrollment practices and to stop using pre-marked overdraft notices to obtain a consumer’s consent to enroll, among other changes, the agency said. “Throughout the period in question, TD had a clear process to secure formal consent before providing this service to customers, enabling them to make an informed and conscious choice,” said the bank’s president and CEO, Greg Braca. “At TD, we put our customers first and our business is built on a foundation of ethics, integrity and trust,” he added."

Their pain is real, and their heartbreak is deep.” TD Bank’s U.S. retail business accounted for 22% of earnings in the quarter ended April 30, and its employees there made up nearly 30% of its total workforce. Masrani, of Indian descent, was born in Uganda, according to a 2014 profile of him in the Globe and Mail newspaper.

The massive jump in provisions took the total amount set aside by Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal , Bank of Nova Scotia, National Bank of Canada , CIBC and TD Bank to C$10.93 billion ($7.94 billion).

Canadian banks have grown their oil and gas loan books faster than total lending in recent quarters, and their business loan books overall expanded during the second quarter as borrowers unable to access debt markets drew down credit lines. CIBC posted an adjusted profit of 94 Canadian cents per share for the quarter ended April, compared with analysts’ expectations of C$1.58 per share. TD Bank, Canada’s second-biggest lender, reported an adjusted profit of 85 Canadian cents per share, missing estimates of 89 Canadian cents. The lender reported a fall in net income across its Canadian, U.S. retail and wholesale units. CIBC also reported lower net income across divisions and higher expenses.

-23.33525803675914," Canada's TD, CIBC say restructuring possible in 2020 as RBC, BMO say no more cuts TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto Dominion Bank TD.TO and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO chief executives declined to rule out restructuring charges on Tuesday as Canadian banks turn to controlling costs to drive earnings growth in what is expected to be a tough year. Royal Bank of Canada's RY.TO chief executive, meanwhile, said its focus will be on eliminating unproductive activities rather than employees, while Bank of Montreal's CEO BMO.TO acknowledged ""restructure fatigue"" after the lender's repeated one-off charges over several reporting periods. The executives spoke at RBC Capital Markets’ Canadian Bank CEO conference, which was webcast and monitored by Reuters. Following a year in which most banks posted disappointing earnings growth on higher loan-loss provisions, subdued margin expansion and weak investment banking performance, analysts expect risks to outweigh opportunities in 2020. Most banks have said they expect earnings growth of 3-4% in 2020, similar to last year, versus their medium-term growth targets of double that rate. TD CEO Bharat Masrani said restructuring is necessary to adapt to industry changes. “In the phase we’re in, you should expect that this becomes more regular until... the level of innovation slows down dramatically,” he said. “Jobs within TD are changing quite dramatically... That requires us to restructure certain parts of our bank.” TD Bank and Royal Bank took restructuring charges of C$154 million and $83 million respectively in the fourth quarter. BMO took a C$484 million ($372.16 million) pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter as part of its push to reduce its workforce by 5%, or about 2,300 employees, following a C$120 million charge earlier in the year and a C$260 million charge in 2018. “We don’t intend to pull this lever again,” BMO CEO Darryl White said. “We have to make sure that 5% of the work goes away... we’re doing that through technology, through rewiring the organization... and it’s completely different from anything we’ve done in the past.” Following the banks’ fourth-quarter earnings in December, CIBC analyst Robert Sedran said in a note that the pressure on expenses will not abate and forecast more such charges in the quarters ahead. Most of the banks said they expect adjusted expense growth to fall to 2-3% in 2020, from about 5% in 2019. A restructuring charge “is always a possibility,” said CIBC CEO Victor Dodig. “If there is an opportunity to take a charge that makes sense, that we can clearly communicate to our investors, we may consider that.” The Canadian banks index .GSPTXBA closed 0.2% lower on Tuesday, compared with a 0.4% gain in the Toronto stocks benchmark .GSPTSE."

Toronto Dominion Bank, Canada’s largest bank by assets, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce were the last of the top six lenders to report on Thursday. Both missed analysts estimates, sending shares sliding. . For stock action. Canadian banks are facing rising loan loss provisions and limited appetite for dealmaking as economic uncertainties mount. Oil price declines and decade-high consumer insolvencies in Canada are also creating headwinds. “Certainly, the days of robust growth for banks are over,” said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Asset Management, who forecasts 3% to 5% earnings growth in fiscal year 2020. “A lot of the growth we saw over prior years was really a recovery from such terrible environments coming out of the financial crisis.” Since Bank of Nova Scotia kicked off fourth-quarter reporting on Nov. 26, the Canadian banks index has lost 4%, compared with Toronto stock benchmark’s 1.3% decline. Many banks said they expect 2020 earnings growth to match the 3% to 4% expansion achieved in fiscal 2019, rather than their medium-term growth targets of at least 7%. Earlier in the year, faster growth in Canadian banks’ U.S. units helped offset a slower pace at home, said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management. But slower U.S. expansion more recently, and challenges in other segments like capital markets, will continue to weigh into 2020, he said. Pressure on net interest margins in the United States could ease as the Federal Reserve pauses rate cuts following three reductions this year. Canada faces the prospect of lower rates if global trade uncertainties escalate, which could pressure margins at home. As growth slows, banks are seeking to increase longer-term efficiencies through investments in new technologies, and undertaking restructures, which is lifting short-term costs. “Banks are in a slow-growth environment but are having to continue making these investments,” Teich said. Despite the challenges, Schwartz said Canadian banks are still worth holding as they are attractively valued. Canadian banks are trading at between 9.3 and 11.3 times forward earnings, compared with valuations of over 12 times earnings for some of the biggest U.S. banks. “Where will you find 3-5% dividend (yield and growth in 2020) at 10 times earnings?

The bank posted 11% growth in adjusted earnings in its U.S. retail business and a surprise 9% increase in wholesale banking, which includes capital markets and investment banking, while Canadian retail income rose 3.4%. TD Bank shares rose 0.8% to C$72.10 in morning trading in Toronto, while the Toronto stock benchmark .GSPTSE gained 0.7%. Total loan-loss provisions at TD Bank climbed 17% to C$655 million ($493.41 million) in the quarter, better than the C$689 million analysts had expected. Amid mixed results, top banks in the country, including Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO and Bank of Montreal BMO.TO, have raised the amounts set aside to cover bad loans. Montreal-based lender Laurentian Bank of Canada LB.TO on Thursday said loan-loss provisions jumped to C$12.1 million in the third quarter, from C$4.9 million a year earlier. Total loan-loss provisions at Canada’s six biggest banks jumped 27% to C$2.45 billion in the three months ended July 31 from a year earlier, much of that driven by bad loans in the oil and gas industry. “The energy sector has some concerns broadly across the Canadian economy, so it probably makes sense to increase provisions for credit losses in that sector,” Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investment, said in an interview. “Canadian commercial banking has been a bit better than expected, capital markets was expected to be light and it was,” he added. “While a lot of people are concerned about the inverted (U.S. Treasury) yield curve, it doesn’t seem to be affecting earnings yet.” TD, the last major Canadian lender to report results for the quarter ended July 31, warned of margin compression from slowing economic growth and uncertainties stemming from trade concerns and Brexit. A three-basis-point increase in net interest margins in TD’s Canadian retail operation was more than offset by a six-basis-point drop in the U.S. retail business. “We do see some compression in margins that can arise from the overall interest rate environment,” Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said, adding that this “is good for the economy and could possibly be mitigated by volume increases and better credit performance.” The bank's net income rose 4.6% to C$3.25 billion ($2.45 billion), or C$1.74 per share, from a year earlier.

Canadian lenders are faced with a sharply slowing economy, a cooling house market, with a record high household debt-to-income ratio stoking concerns of loan losses. Both banks posted double-digit growth in money set aside for such losses in the second quarter. On Wednesday, smaller rival Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce estimated zero earnings growth, sending its shares down for a second straight day on Thursday. “Last quarter’s higher provisions seemed to be an anomaly, but with Q2 also higher, we think it could be the beginning of an overall weakening,” Chris Kuiper, senior analyst at CFRA Research, said. “The first time, it was easy to give them a pass as a “one-off” but with the second quarter also showing higher provisions it seems like this is becoming more of a trend,” he added. RBC blamed losses in personal and commercial banking for a 55% rise in quarterly provisions. On a post-earnings call with analysts, bank executives said that some of their oil and gas clients had come under pressure due to a fall in crude prices. Provisions at TD rose 14% to $633 million from a year earlier due to increase in money set aside to meet future losses in the banks’ personal lending portfolios. RBC also said it expected net interest margin or NIM, a key measure of profitability, to be relatively flat over the next several quarters, given the outlook for interest rates. RBC shares were down 2.4%, while TD shares rose 2.2%, helped by a stronger earnings beat, and relative share price underperformance ahead of the earnings. The Canadian central bank and U.S. Federal Reserve have paused interest rate hikes after raising them multiple times since July 2017. In the reported quarter, higher rates in Canada and the United States helped improve NIMs at the banks, as they earned more from loans than they paid out on deposits. Total loans at RBC jumped 9% in the second quarter, while at TD, they rose 3%, with home, personal and business lending showing growth. CIBC, which is most exposed to Canadian economy, reported negligible quarterly loan growth on Wednesday. Residential mortgage loan growth has been a focus for investors following stringent regulatory changes that require borrowers of uninsured mortgages to be stress-tested to check their ability to repay. “Regulatory changes have helped some of Canada’s major housing markets stabilize, particularly in Ontario and to the East. Western Canadian markets remain under downward pressure,” said RBC Chief Executive David McKay. Loans grew not only in the domestic markets, but also in the United States, where both banks have sizeable businesses. “RBC is showing decent domestic loan growth and strong growth south of the border,” said John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays. At TD, “underlying retail loan growth remains strong on both sides of the border,” he added. TD's net income, excluding special items, rose to C$3.27 billion ($2.43 billion), or C$1.75 per share, in the three months ended April 30, from C$3.06 billion, or C$1.62 per share, a year earlier. [reut.rs/2whvJDj] Analysts on average expected earnings per share of C$1.67, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Trading rose at RBC on “improved market conditions and increased client activity,” while it fell at TD due to “challenging market conditions and reduced client activity.” Top U.S. investment banks reported huge declines in equities trading in the most recent quarter due to the U.S.-China trade war. RBC's adjusted earnings per share of C$2.23 beat analyst estimates of C$2.21, while TD's C$1.75 per share profit beat estimates by 8 Canadian cents. (reut.rs/2JXVLU9)"

-8.244759736780557," TD Bank profit tops view but shares dip as peers do better TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank reported third-quarter profit which topped expectations, helped by a sharp rise in earnings from the United States, but analysts said its performance was less impressive than rival Canadian lenders. Canada’s second biggest lender said earnings per share, excluding one-off items, rose to C$1.66 in the quarter ended July 31, from C$1.51 a year ago. Analysts, on average, estimated earnings of C$1.63, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income, excluding one-off items, rose to C$3.13 billion ($2.42 billion) from C$2.87 billion a year earlier. Shares in TD, which have risen about 7.5 percent in the year to date, more than any other Canadian bank, were down 0.2 percent at 10:10 am EDT (1350 GMT). “After two quarters in which TD’s results were clearly the best of the group, Q3 marked a step down for the bank as its results, while still good, shone less brightly relative to some peers,” said Cormark Securities analyst Meny Grauman. Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault said TD’s performance in the quarter amounted to a “relatively modest beat”. Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have posted stronger beats over the past week while Royal Bank of Canada’s earnings also exceeded expectations. Bank of Nova Scotia reported earnings in line with analysts’ forecasts. TD’s core tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of its financial strength, was 11.7 percent at the end of July, the highest among Canada’s six biggest banks and up 70 basis points from a year ago. Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said that gives the bank flexibility to invest in the business including making acquisitions. “We’re always open to looking at acquisitions if they make sense from a strategic and financial point of view,” he said in an interview. Ahmed said opportunities to expand on the U.S. East Coast would be attractive. “Also, we have an excess of deposits in the United States that need to be invested and, therefore, good asset generating businesses would be attractive to us,” he added. Net income, excluding one-time items, at the bank’s U.S. retail business rose by 29 percent to C$1.16 billion, benefiting from improved margins and tax changes. Net income at the bank’s Canadian retail business grew by 7 percent to C$1.85 billion, reflecting improved margins and an increase in loans and deposits. ($1 = 1.2919 Canadian dollars)"
