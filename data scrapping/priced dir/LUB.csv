-6.410256410256415," Luby's dining chain defeats board challenge from Bandera Partners NEW YORK (Reuters) - Casual dining chain Luby’s Inc said on Friday it had defeated a long-term shareholder’s bid for four board seats, as investors sided with management and elected all nine of the company’s director nominees. The support from investors ended the company’s proxy fight with Bandera Partners, a New York-based hedge fund that owns roughly 10 percent of Luby’s shares and demanded more accountability and oversight by the board. From the start, it was an uphill battle for Bandera because some 37 percent of the stock is controlled by the Pappas family. In recent days Bandera had reached out to other shareholders and proxy advisory firms backed some of the hedge fund’s ideas and highlighted its concerns. A week ago Luby’s took action and announced plans to invite two new independent directors to replace two sitting members. It also said it would select a new chair, in steps that may have swayed some investors to side with management instead of backing the activist Bandera, analysts said. After the vote on Friday, Gasper Mir III, Luby’s independent chair, sounded a conciliatory note to the activist. “We will welcome the input and views of Bandera Partners during our board refreshment process and will be seeking to engage further with them in the near term,” he said in a statement. The company’s stock price, which is thinly traded, seesawed on Friday, first rising 6 percent and then tumbling to end down 13.8 percent at $1.56. Over the last year, it has fallen 40 percent. Bandera, run by co-founder Jeff Gramm, has owned Luby’s stock for more than a decade but Gramm’s patience ran out last year when he mounted his first proxy contest to protest the company’s sinking share price and what he called “unfulfilled promises” and excessive executive and director compensation. “We believe we won the vast majority of votes from non affiliated shareholders,” Gramm told Reuters, adding “It is clear to me that shareholders are frustrated with the company and desperate for change in the boardroom.” Investors backed management even after proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Egan-Jones recommended investors elect Gramm and his father, former U.S. Senator Phil Gramm to the board. Glass Lewis, another advisory firm, recommended that investors add Jeff Gramm. ISS, which supported the Gramms, wrote: “The incumbent board has overseen alarming underperformance over the past decade and deteriorating financials over the past five years.” Law firm Sidley Austin represented Luby’s and Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff & Cohen represented Bandera."

-2.6143790849673225," Luby's will add two to board amid pressure from hedge fund investor (Reuters) - Casual dining chain Luby's Inc LUB.N will shake up its board, it said on Friday, just one week before shareholders vote on whether to add an investor activist's representatives as directors. The company, which is facing pressure from Bandera Capital, a New York hedge fund that owns nearly 10 percent of its shares, will invite two new independent directors to replace two sitting members and will choose a new chair. “Luby’s has recently been engaged in in-depth discussions with many of our shareholders, and based on the feedback we have received, we have chosen to accelerate our plans to transform the Board,” board chairman Gasper Mir III, said in a statement. Mir plans to give up his role as chair but stay on the board. At Luby’s Jan. 25 annual meeting shareholders will decide whether to put Bandera’s nominees, which include the hedge fund’s founder and his father, Philip, a former U.S. Senator from Texas, on the board. Bandera has criticized the chain’s high expenses, and investors are unhappy as its share price has tumbled 42 percent in the last year and traded at $1.60 on Friday morning. Bandera, run by Jeff Gramm, is urging other investors to back it in demanding more accountability and oversight by the nine-member board. Proxy advisory firm ISS recommended electing Gramm and his father to the board while another advisory firm, Glass Lewis, recommended adding only Jeff Gramm. Bandera is urging investors to add four newcomers. Luby’s operates 142 restaurants nationally, including 82 Luby’s Cafeterias, 59 Fuddruckers, and 1 Cheeseburger in Paradise."
-20.218579234972683," Proxy advisory firm ISS backs two dissident nominees in Luby's fight NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that shareholders elect two dissident nominees at Luby’s Inc after the current board oversaw “alarming underperformance” at the casual dining chain. ISS recommended votes for Jeff Gramm, whose hedge fund Bandera Capital is running the proxy contest, and his father, Philip Gramm, a former U.S. senator from Texas, according to the report seen by Reuters. Bandera asked shareholders to elect four dissidents. The report criticized Luby’s board for standing by as company’s stock price deteriorated at a time the broader industry thrived. “The incumbent board has overseen alarming underperformance over the past decade and deteriorating financials over the past five years,” the report said. The share price of Luby’s, which owns hamburger chain Fuddruckers, has dropped 37 percent in the last 52 weeks. ISS also wrote that current board members are out of touch with shareholders’ concerns and that “further change is not only warranted, it is overdue.” A spokesman for Luby’s said the company was pleased that ISS did not throw its weight behind Bandera’s other two nominees, Savneet Singh and Stacy Hock. “We strongly disagree with their recommendations to vote for Senator Philip Gramm and his son Jeff Gramm – a familial combination that ISS itself described as ‘suboptimal,’” a spokesman said. The vote is on Jan. 25."

-0.6451612903225812," Luby's calls hedge fund's nominees unqualified as contest heats up BOSTON (Reuters) - Luby's Inc LUB.N on Tuesday hit back at criticisms from a long-time investor that wants to shake up the casual dining chain's board by questioning the qualifications of the hedge fund's director nominees. The Texas-based restaurant company, which owns hamburger chain Fuddruckers and has a market capitalization of $39 million, said that Bandera Partners, which is running a proxy contest, has proposed unqualified nominees who have no business being elected to a public company’s board. The company plans to file its documents with regulators later on Tuesday after having presented its case to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. Investors will vote on directors at the company’s Jan. 25 annual meeting and ISS will have issued its view before then. There is little argument that business has not been going well at Luby’s, whose share price has tumbled 80 percent in five years to trade at $1.55 a share. Bandera is urging other investors to back it in demanding more accountability and oversight by the nine-member board. However, the fight at Luby’s may be less than evenly matched, with some 37 percent of the stock controlled by the Pappas family and roughly 10 percent owned by Bandera Partners. Chris Pappas, president and chief executive of Luby’s, recently put his salary at $1 a year. Bandera, a New York-based hedge fund that has roughly $150 million in assets and has been in business since 2006, has been a Luby’s investor for a decade. In November, founder Jeff Gramm’s patience ran out and by late 2018 he was running his first-ever proxy contest. “We are tired of years of unfulfilled promises at the company and excessive director and executive compensation,” Gramm said. “We feel there needs to be change in the board room.” But Luby’s said in its documents, which were seen by Reuters, that Gramm, his father, former U.S. Senator Philip Gramm, and two other nominees - philanthropist Stacy Hock and Savneet Singh, interim chief executive officer at PAR Technology - are not up to the job. It called the hedge fund’s behavior “confusing and concerning” and questioned whether Gramm “or anyone nominated by him is suited to sit on any public board.” Bandera offered to settle with the company in November but demanded an answer within 48 hours and then revoked its settlement agreement."
