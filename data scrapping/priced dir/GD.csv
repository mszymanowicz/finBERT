22.50038584096128," General Dynamics profit misses, but 2021 outlook boosts shares (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday, as its aerospace unit delivered fewer Gulfstream jets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but 2021 revenue guidance sent shares up nearly 4% in early trading. During a post earnings conference call Phebe Novakovic, the General Dynamics CEO, said she expected 2021 revenue to be up $1 billion to $39 billion and forecast earnings share in the range of $11.00 to $11.05 per fully diluted share. The 2021 outlook counteracted investor disappointment that quarterly Gulfstream jet deliveries declined to 40 units from 44 a year ago, which sent shares down slightly in early trading. Business jet deliveries in 2020 were hampered by coronavirus shutdowns, making it harder for defense contractors like General Dynamics to deliver jets due to COVID-related travel restrictions and factory slow-downs. Sales in the company’s aerospace unit posted a 16.9% fall to $2.44 billion. Total revenue fell 2.7% to $10.48 billion. However, the broader business jet market saw an order boost late in 2020 as U.S. buyers rushed to take advantage of favorable tax rules they feared could change under the new Biden administration. During the quarter, General Dynamics’ marine systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, was awarded a $9.47 billion contract for the construction of Columbia class submarines, moving the U.S. Navy’s top procurement priority out of the early-construction phase. The shift to the construction phase for the first two Columbia class submarines added to General Dynamics’ backlog which sat at record-high $89.5 billion at the end of the year. Net earnings fell to $1 billion, or $3.49 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.02 billion, or $3.51 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of $3.54 per share on a revenue of $10.78 billion, according to Refinitiv data."

14.96437932535086," UPDATE 1-General Dynamics awarded Columbia class submarine construction contract -Pentagon (Adds background, navy official comment) WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp was awarded a $9.47 billion contract for the construction of Columbia class submarines, moving the U.S. Navy’s top procurement priority out of the early-construction phase, the Pentagon said on Thursday. The contract for the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines covers the move to full construction of the first ship in the class, the USS Columbia, as well as continued advanced construction of the second ship, the USS Wisconsin, the Navy said. General Dynamics was named as the prime contractor for Columbia class in 2016 here with Huntington Ingalls working on design and construction of major assemblies and modules for the submarines. The 12 boats in the program will replace the 14 Ohio class submarines that are slated to begin retiring in 2027. The Ohio class is one of the three legs of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The program is on a tight schedule as the first boat is slated to begin patrols in 2031. The lead ship, usually the costliest, will be $9.2 billion in current year dollars. The average cost per ship must stay below $8 billion in 2017 dollars, a navy official told reporters during an online briefing on Thursday. The Navy has estimated that the procurement cost for the fleet of submarines at about $110 billion. But the Government Accountability Office, a U.S. government watchdog, has said that this cost estimate is unrealistic “because it is based on several overly optimistic assumptions, such as the amount of labor needed for construction.” In 2019, GAO has said the program has an expected cost of $267 billion over its life cycle including procurement. A boost to the Pentagon’s budget this year was in part due to the need to increase funding to buy the submarines. (Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington Editing by Matthew Lewis and Grant McCool)"
14.41668048571117," General Dynamics third-quarter sales fall amid aerospace headwinds, but margins rise WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp GD.N reported an 8.7% fall in third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, sending its shares lower as the coronavirus crisis continues to impact aerospace sales. Shares fell 1.1% in morning trading, and had earlier dropped 2.6% before the market opened. On an earnings conference call with investors , Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic reaffirmed a forecast given a quarter ago of 2020 earnings per share of between $11 and $11.10. Novakovic said that of 100,000 employees, 1,800 have had COVID-19, with 1,500 of those recovered and back at work. Profit margins rose to 11.5%, up slightly from the second quarter, as workflow techniques were improved during the pandemic. Margins were still down 1 percentage point from a year ago before the pandemic. The Gulfstream business jet maker delivered 32 planes to customers, six fewer than a year ago. Pandemic-related lockdowns have hindered jet deliveries since early in the year. Revenue at the aerospace unit fell 20.8% to $1.95 billion compared with a year ago. Profit margins at the unit also fell to 14.3% from 15.8% in the same period last year. The marine systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, saw revenue up 7.6% compared with a year earlier. Half that growth comes from the Columbia-class submarine program, Novakovic said on the call with investors. Earnings per share fell to $287 million, or $2.90 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, from $291 million, or $3.14 per share, a year earlier. Analysts’ mean estimate for General Dynamics Corp was for earnings of $2.86 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. General Dynamics’ total order backlog at the end of the third quarter was $81.5 billion, up 21% from the year-ago quarter as the U.S. Department of Defense continues to place orders with U.S. defense contractors.

-11.45292412311853," General Dynamics cuts 2020 profit forecast as pandemic weighs on IT, aerospace (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp GD.N cut its full-year profit outlook on Wednesday as its information technology and aerospace units grappled with coronavirus-led disruptions, although it signaled a gradual pick-up in demand for its Gulfstream jets. The company said some high-margin programs at its IT business had come to a “hard stop” because of the pandemic, leading to a 12.7% drop in sales at the unit in the second quarter. The business accounted for about 21% of its 2019 revenue, while adding 13.5% to its operating earnings. Earnings per share for the year are now expected to be between $11 and $11.10, down from a previous forecast of between $11.30 and $11.40. The defense contractor, however, topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit as it delivered 32 jets, up from 23 in the preceding quarter, despite challenges in making deliveries due to COVID-related travel restrictions. “When we look at where we are right now at Gulfstream, we’ve seen the beginning of what would appear to be an increase in demand,” Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic said on a post earnings call. Novakovic, however, cautioned that it was still too early to tell the slope of recovery. Executives and forecasters are seeing a rise in demand for business jet flights this summer due to a pick-up in leisure trips and easing European travel restrictions. That, in turn, has led to expectations of new orders at business jet makers. Sales at the aerospace unit fell 7.6% to $1.97 billion. Its marine systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, was a bright spot, with sales rising 6.3% to $2.47 billion. Total revenue fell 3% to $9.26 billion.

Shares were flat on Wednesday as the company flagged a $549 million decline in revenue at its aerospace segment, with Gulfstream deliveries totaling 23 jets in the first quarter, down from 34 a year earlier. “For the year, we had anticipated delivery of somewhat in excess of 150 aircraft. It now appears that we will be between 125 and 130 deliveries,” Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a post earnings call with analysts. She said that the supply chain had slowed its production and there was a shutdown of at a Gulfstream facility in the midst of the pandemic. Revenue at its aerospace unit fell 24.5% to $1.69 billion. Profit margins at the unit also fell slightly. Earnings per share for the year are now expected to be between $11.30 and $11.40, Novakovic said on the call. In January the company forecast 2020 earnings per share of between $12.55 and $12.60. During the quarter, the company issued bonds and boosted its cash position to more than $5 billion, up from just under a billion. Defense contractors like General Dynamics are expected to see much less disruption linked to the outbreak of the coronavirus as most of their revenue is from government contracts, which are considered to be reliable as governments are unlikely to reduce spending during the pandemic. The Pentagon, General Dynamics’ biggest customer, increased interim payments to defense contractors and is also paying for sick time for quarantined employees, which is expected to buoy the defense industry as the pandemic affects the economy. During the quarter, the company’s Combat Systems business unit, which makes tanks, was awarded a $300 million contract from the U.S. Army to upgrade its M1A2 Abrams tanks. The unit saw revenue up 4.4% over the same quarter a year earlier. The U.S. Navy awarded General Dynamics a contract worth $875 million for refueling ships during the quarter. The Marine Systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, saw revenue up 9.1% from the same period last year.

Shares fell 1.7% during morning trading after CEO Phebe Novakovic offered guidance during a conference call with investors. She said the company expects “slightly more than” $40.7 billion of revenue, up 4% over 2019,” with an operating margin of 11.9%. Earnings per share in 2020 were expected between $12.55 and 12.60, up from $11.98 in 2019. Weapons makers are expected to benefit from U.S. tensions with Iran over the past few months. The company delivered 44 Gulfstream jets in the quarter, up from 42 a year ago. The new G700 business jet was unveiled and the company began taking orders for customer deliveries planned in 2022. Sales in the aerospace unit which makes the business jet grew 8.4% from a year earlier to $2.93 billion. In December, General Dynamics was named lead contractor on a $22.2 billion U.S. Navy contract to build nine Virginia-class submarines, the Navy’s largest-ever shipbuilding award. Eighteen Virginia-class submarines have already been delivered to the Navy. The first ship of the nine new orders will be delivered in 2024. The Navy plans to buy 40. The award is a major contributor to the General Dynamics backlog of orders which now totals $86.9 billion, up 28.1% from a year ago. General Dynamics Land Systems unit had the only on-time submission to replace the U.S. Army’s Bradley fighting vehicle, but the service went back to the drawing board and will restart the competition later. Net earnings rose to $1.02 billion, or $3.51 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $909 million, or $3.07 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $3.44 per share, according to Refinitiv data. The maker of a wide range of weapons and communications systems for the U.S. military posted a 3.8% rise in revenue at $10.77 billion. Defense contractors like General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin LMT.N and Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N are expected to outperform this year, a general pattern for the sector during U.S. presidential election years. Under President Donald Trump, defense spending has gone up. This year’s $738 billion defense policy bill for fiscal 2020 increased defense spending by about $20 billion over last year."

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Ottawa would buy 360 light armored vehicles from General Dynamics Land Systems Canada in a deal worth up to C$3 billion ($2.26 billion). It is also offering the firm a repayable loan of C$650 million. The vehicles will be built in London, in the province of Ontario. The Liberals hold most of Ontario’s seats in the House of Commons and need to retain them to stand any chance of holding onto power in the Oct. 21 election. The deal is the latest in a string of high-profile government spending announcements in politically sensitive parts of Canada. The official opposition Conservatives, tied in polls with the Liberals, accuse their rivals of trying to buy votes. Sajjan spokesman Todd Lane denied any link to the election, saying money for the vehicles had been announced in 2017. “This is about taking care of our women and men in uniform,” he said by telephone. The contract will help preserve jobs at the General Dynamics plant amid continuing uncertainty over the fate of a separate $13 billion deal to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia. Critics, citing concerns over Riyadh’s human rights record, insist the contract be scrapped. Ottawa is still studying whether to tear up the deal, which it says would cost millions of dollars in penalties."

Mattis, a retired Marine general, had served on General Dynamics’ board but resigned in 2017 to take the top job at the Pentagon after being nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump. Mattis resigned from the Defense Department in December after clashing with Trump on issues such as the president’s abrupt decision to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. “Jim is a thoughtful, deliberate and principled leader with a proven track record of selfless service to our nation,” said General Dynamics Chairwoman and Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic in a statement. “We are honored to have him on our board.” The Trump administration has been a revolving door for industry executives serving in the government. Former Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who filled the role as acting secretary after Trump pushed Mattis out early, was a Boeing Co BA.N executive. Recently confirmed Defense Secretary Mark Esper is a former lobbyist for weapons company Raytheon Co RTN.N. Mattis was often at odds with Trump on major policy points. He reassured North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in 2017 that it was “the most successful and powerful military alliance in modern history” after Trump questioned the need for the organization. His resignation was met with discomfort on Capitol Hill from Republicans and Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement at the time he was “particularly distressed” that Mattis was resigning over sharp differences with the president. Mattis will not engage in lobbying to the Pentagon for at least five years after his departure from the government, according to an ethics pledge issued in a Trump executive order."

Revenue from its aerospace unit jumped 23 percent to $2.24 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, as Gulfstream deliveries, an important metric for investors, increased to 34, from 26 a year earlier. “We’re in a period of solid, but not overheated demand” for business jets, General Dynamics Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a conference call to discuss the results. Revenue at the company’s IT unit, which serves the Department of Defense, surged 91 percent to $2.17 billion. Shares of the Falls Church, Virginia-based company were down 0.7% at $181.03 in late morning trading, erasing gains after earlier surging as much as 5.9% following the results. Defense contractors like General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Corp are expected to benefit from higher defense spending as U.S. President Donald Trump’s looser policies on foreign arms sales have boosted demand for ships and jets. Forecasters and corporate planemakers expect higher business jet deliveries this year, fueled by the recent entry into service of new aircraft such as Bombardier’s Global 7500 and U.S. rival Gulfstream’s G500.

In February, Reuters reported that General Dynamics would see its first G600 delivery by the end of June.

5.203244579553122," General Dynamics 2019 outlook disappoints, fourth-quarter profit rises (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp on Wednesday forecast 2019 profits lower than analysts estimated and said margins in its critical business jet unit would not improve substantially until 2020, sending shares down nearly 4 percent. The U.S. aerospace and defense company said the cost of ramping up production of next-generation Gulfstream business jets has sapped profits in its highest margin unit, overshadowing a strong fourth-quarter performance, led by information technology services. Its shares rose 4 percent after it reported results but reversed course after company executives discussed its outlook during a conference call with analysts. The Falls Church, Virginia-based company forecast 2019 earnings in the range of $11.60 to $11.70 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $12, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. Margins at the aerospace unit, the company’s most profitable, fell to 14.1 percent during the quarter, compared with 17 percent a year ago, pulling down the overall margins as well. The company will continue to ramp up business jet production in the first and second quarters, Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic said on the call. She predicted earnings and margins at the unit would improve in 2020. Revenue from the business jet unit rose 36.4 percent to $2.7 billion as jet deliveries, another important metric, increased to 42 from 30 in the same quarter a year ago. Management estimated the unit would have 2019 revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion over 2018, on 145 deliveries, but margins in 2019 would be 15.5 percent compared with 17.6 percent in 2018. Payments for armored land vehicles going to Saudi Arabia also slowed during the quarter. “Our payment issue got caught up in a larger, international political issue,” Novakovic said. General Dynamics is making the vehicles in Ottawa, Canada, but political opponents, citing the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the Yemen war, insisted Canada’s government scrap the deal negotiated by the previous Conservative government. Novakovic said “that will resolve. It’s a timing issue and we’re quite comfortable and quite confident.” Total operating margins for the quarter were 11.8 percent, down from 12.8 percent last year. Operating margins measure how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales. Net earnings rose to $909 million, or $3.07 per share, from $636 million, or $2.10 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $2.99 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Total revenue jumped 25.4 percent to $10.38 billion, beating estimates of $10.36 billion. The stock fell 3.6 percent to $169.66 in afternoon trading."

5.62951631154059," General Dynamics warns Canada: Canceling Saudi deal would cost billions OTTAWA (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp GD.N on Monday put pressure on Ottawa over the sale of armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, warning that the federal government would incur ""billions of dollars of liability"" by unilaterally scrapping the deal. The remarks by the Canadian unit of General Dynamics - which one defense expert called unusual - reflect increasing tensions over a $13 billion agreement that is becoming politically awkward for the Liberal government. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking in an interview aired on Sunday, said for the first time that he was looking for a way out of the deal. Political opponents, citing the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the Yemen war, insist Trudeau should scrap a pact that was negotiated by the previous Conservative government. “Were Canada to unilaterally terminate the contract, Canada would incur billions of dollars of liability to General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada,” the company said in a statement. “Terminating the contract would have a significant negative impact on our highly skilled employees, our supply chain across Canada, and the Canadian defense sector broadly,” the statement added. Canadian allies such as Germany have already halted weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Ottawa is reviewing arms exports to Saudi Arabia, but Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, said no final decisions had been taken. Trudeau previously said there would be huge penalties for walking away from the deal. Last month, he said Canada could freeze the relevant export permits if it concluded the weapons had been misused. David Perry, defense analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada normally kept a very low profile. “I can’t imagine they are anything other than extremely worried,” he said in a phone interview. Doug Wilson-Hodge, manager of corporate affairs at the firm’s Canadian unit, declined to elaborate when asked why it had issued the warning. Trudeau often stresses the importance of human rights, and continuing to sell arms to the Saudis could leave him open to accusations of double standards. But abandoning the deal could kill thousands of jobs in the struggling city of London, Ontario, where his Liberals will need to do well in a federal election next October. “We are in constant contact with the company, and are committed to the workers at the London facility as well as the suppliers in London and across Canada,” Austen said."

-0.8331842062842185," General Dynamics sales miss estimates, shares fall (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and defense company General Dynamics Corp GD.N quarterly profit beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, but sales came in below expectations, sending its shares down nearly 5 percent in early trading. Total revenue rose 20 percent to $9.09 billion, but fell short of estimates of $9.38 billion. Analysts were also disappointed to see how much of the earnings were attributable to lower tax payments, as compared to income from operations. Lower business jet deliveries also raised investor concerns. Revenue from the company’s aerospace division, which makes business jets, rose 1.8 percent. Total new Gulfstream deliveries, a key metric for investors, fell to 27 from 30 compared with the third quarter last year. The company closed its $9.7 billion purchase of IT services-heavy CSRA Inc in the middle of the year. This was the first full quarter for General Dynamics to report the results of that business as the U.S. government is in the midst of a broad modernization effort. Revenue rose at all of the company’s businesses, with its information technology unit recording the biggest jump. Revenue from the IT business more than doubled to $2.31 billion, as integration of CSRA continued, coupled with several contracts wins during the quarter. These included a $330 million contract from the U.S. Census Bureau and a $210 million contract from the Centers Medicare & Medicaid Services. Profit margins at the IT services business slipped from 9.5 percent to 6.8 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Total operating margins for General Dynamics were 12.5 percent, down from 14 percent in the same period last year. Net earnings rose 11 percent to $851 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.89 per share, beating Refinitiv estimates of $2.76. The company’s total backlog at the end of third-quarter 2018 was $69.5 billion, up 4.9 percent from second-quarter 2018. The biggest backlog contributor came from a $3.9 billion contract from the U.S. Navy for the construction of four Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyers."

-15.765672071494313," General Dynamics profit beats estimates on IT services demand (Reuters) - General Dynamics GD.N topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the maker of Gulfstream jets and U.S. Navy ships benefited from stronger demand at its combat systems and information technology businesses. Shares rose as much as 2.6 percent to $201.90 in early trading after General Dynamics said sales at its IT services unit more than doubled. The company closed its $9.7 billion purchase of IT services-heavy CSRA Inc early in the quarter. The U.S. government is in the midst of a broad modernization effort. Sales of combat systems, including battle tanks, rose 8.5 percent during the quarter. The results come as U.S. arms makers seek to take advantage of expanding defense budgets in NATO countries and in other regions. Defense spending in the United States is increasing as well. On Monday, Senate and House of Representatives negotiators reached agreement on a $716 billion defense policy bill. “The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well,” Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a post-earnings call with Wall Street analysts. Revenue jumped nearly 20 percent to $9.19 billion. Novakovic raised the company’s earnings-per-share outlook for the year to a range of $11 to $11.05 from $10.90 to $11 during the call with analysts. Its aerospace division, which makes business jets, reported a nearly 9 percent drop in revenue as quarterly Gulfstream aircraft deliveries slipped to 26 from 30 a year earlier. Still, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company said margins in that business were nearly 21 percent and orders for the jets were up 21 percent versus the same quarter last year. “The CSRA acquisition and related costs complicated the results, but the Gulfstream margin was particularly strong with profits in the remaining segments and other items providing a further boost,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research, said in a note. General Dynamics’ net earnings climbed to $786 million, or $2.62 per share, in the second quarter ended July 1, from $749 million, or $2.45 per share, a year earlier. Excluding onetime items, General Dynamics earned $2.82 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $2.49 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the quarter, the total order backlog for General Dynamics grew 6.7 percent from $62.1 billion to $66.3 billion. During the call with analysts, General Dynamics’ chief financial officer said the company’s tax rate in the second quarter was 19 percent."

-4.697547634633616," General Dynamics' jet delivery delay hurts profit beat (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp GD.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, with sales of tanks and weapons systems lifted by greater U.S. defense spending, even as overall sales figures were dented by fewer corporate jets deliveries. The company’s shares dropped $9.42 or 4.2 percent to $212.49 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Sales in the combat systems unit, which makes boats and tanks, rose 11.9 percent to $1.44 billion in the quarter ended April 1. But the company’s aerospace division, its biggest unit, reported a 12 percent drop in revenue due to lower deliveries of its larger cabin Gulfstream aircraft. The delivery delay of two Gulfstream jets was done at the request of the customers, CEO Phebe Novakovic said during a call on Wednesday with Wall Street analysts. “They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter, but were delayed for the convenience of the customer.” Novakovic said. The business jet market has struggled to recover since the financial crisis, with overall global sales last year about half of the 1,317 planes delivered in 2008. “We think Gulfstream business jet deliveries have found a bottom and the aerospace segment will begin growing again,” Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins said in a pre-earnings note. The company’s earnings per share beat expectations but quarterly profit margins shrank 5 percent from 14.1 to 13.4 percent since last year. The company increased investment in research and development. In addition to strong arms sales during the quarter, earnings were also buoyed by favorable changes in the U.S corporate tax law that passed late last year. The effective tax rate was 16.8 percent for the quarter, CFO Jason Aiken said on the call. Last year General Dynamics reported it had 28.6 percent effective tax rate. In order to take further advantage of the new tax law, Aiken said the company planned to increase its pension contribution from $300 million to $550 million. He said move would impact operating cash forecasts. In the first quarter, cash flow was negative $600 million which Aiken attributed to the timing of “payments from customers and payments to suppliers.” Earlier this month, General Dynamics bought peer CSRA Inc CSRA.N in a deal valued at about $9.7 billion. The competitive sale process for CSRA was won by General Dynamics because it was able to pay cash, something other bidders were unable to do. The purchase will begin to help earnings per share in the third quarter of the year, management said on the call. During the quarter, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company’s order backlog shrank from $63.1 billion at the end of 2017 to $62.1 billion. Net earnings rose to $799 million, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended April 1 from $763 million, or $2.48 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.49 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $7.5 billion from $7.4 billion."
