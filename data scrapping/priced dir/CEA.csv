-3.296698717948724," Breakingviews - Corona Capital: Oil, Delta, Hunger NEW YORK/HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights. - Oil - Delta - Hunger SLIPPERY SLOPE. Oil producers can’t stop the bad news. On Tuesday the International Energy Agency said world energy demand may not make a full recovery until 2025 as economic slowdowns linger. The same day, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its estimate of world oil demand in the current quarter. That’s a problem for a market that, even before Covid-19, was awash in black gold. The price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, at around $40, is a far cry from its mid-April price, when it went below zero. Yet plenty of markers suggest oil may never get above $50, the price the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas suggests the U.S. drillers break even. Top of the list: electric vehicles may be on track to triple their market share in Europe this year. Even when global economies bounce back, an increased need for oil may be a thing of the past. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin) LIGHTER WINGS. Delta Air Lines is looking less bad, and that’s saying something. The Atlanta-based airline said its cash burn slowed to $18 million per day in September from a daily rate of $27 million in June. The company expects that loss to narrow to as little as $10 million by the end of the year. With some $16 billion in cash or the equivalent on the balance sheet, Delta could last more than four years at the burn rate predicted for the end of 2020 before running out of dough. The company seems to be managing itself fairly well through the pandemic. While Chief Executive Ed Bastian said it could be two years before the airline achieves a “normalized revenue environment”, it has cut down on fleet, headcount and overhead since the start of the year. During a pandemic, that’s the equivalent of liftoff. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin) STILL HUNGRY. The pandemic has overshadowed many other problems confronting humanity. Over 55 million people in seven troubled countries are living in a food crisis or emergency, according to an Oxfam study. Funding, moreover, hasn’t been forthcoming, with food security donations meeting less than 11% of the $2.4 billion requested by the United Nations. Oxfam warned in July that by the end of the year, as many as 12,000 people per day could die from Covid-19-related hunger – potentially more fatalities than from the disease itself – even as eight of the largest food and beverage companies had paid out over $18 billion to shareholders. The pandemic, and the resources deployed to tackle it, has meant that the problem of feeding people now competes with other pressing priorities. At the same time, disruption to food production and supplies continue to hurt the most vulnerable of communities. The funding gap only highlights this growing inequality. (By Sharon Lam) GIFT BALLOON. China Eastern Airlines, one of the country’s Big Three state carriers, is getting a $4.6 billion injection of capital after losing $1.3 billion in the first half. Rival China Southern received similar help last year. These investments are not supposed to be considered bailouts, but rather part of Beijing’s fuzzy “equity diversification” push. This case involves no private money, only funds from different government-controlled investors, including a life insurer and a tourism company. However thin the reform excuse, cash is always welcome. It lands at a good time for $10.8 billion China Eastern, whose Hong Kong shares have tumbled 23% this year as passenger traffic nosedived. Domestic air travel showed some signs of revival during the October national holiday week, while the recent rally in the yuan should help with dollar-denominated fuel costs. China Eastern isn’t yet clear for takeoff, but some financial clouds have cleared. (By Pete Sweeney) VACCINE SETBACK. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine “pause” is another stumble on the increasingly treacherous path to a Covid-19 remedy. On Monday night, the $400 billion drug giant stopped all trials of its coronavirus inoculation after one of its participants had an “adverse event”. Last month, British drug giant AstraZeneca slammed the brakes on its vaccine after a participant fell ill. While it’s still unclear whether J&J’s vaccine caused the condition, it may still suffer a delay. After all, U.S. trials for AstraZeneca’s remedy are still on hold. The news may also do little to reassure the two-thirds of Americans that say they are either not very likely or not at all likely to take a first generation inoculation. J&J might also struggle to recruit the 60,000 participants it needs for its final trial. With more and more vaccines stumbling, hope for a Covid-19 silver bullet is fading. (By Aimee Donnellan) SPEND AND TAX. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a tricky few years. The latest analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, shows that the country’s borrowing is set to balloon to 350 billion pounds this year as the coronavirus ravages the economy and pushes up government spending. Equivalent to 17% of GDP, that’s higher than any year except during the two world wars. The legacy of the pandemic means Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s manifesto pledge to cut borrowing as a percentage of national income is in tatters. The question is how quickly Sunak should try to bring debt, likely to exceed 112% of GDP by 2025, under control. Merely to keep borrowing at around 100% of GDP would require a harsh fiscal consolidation equivalent to 2.1% of GDP, the IFS reckons. Yet some three-quarters of the increase in national debt is due to low growth, not Sunak’s crisis measures. That suggests targeted borrowing to boost growth should not be off the cards.

-4.618198234193031," China Eastern Airlines to receive $4.6 billion capital injection BEIJING (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines 600115.SS will receive a cash injection of 31 billion yuan ($4.60 billion) from four new investors as part of an equity diversification plan, the company said on Monday. China Life Investment Holding Limited, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Life Insurance Co 601628.SS, will inject 11 billion yuan into the airline, while Shanghai Jiushi Group, another state company, will inject 10 billion yuan, according to the public filing. China Reform Holdings Corporation and China Tourism Group, both state-owned entities, will inject 5 billion yuan each. The move is part of long-standing China’s efforts to diversify ownership structures among its state-owned enterprises and comes at a critical time after China Eastern posted a net loss of 8.5 billion yuan in the first half due to the COVID-19 pandemic. China Southern Airlines 600029.SS also announced last year that it would receive a capital injection of 30 billion yuan from three investors."

8.034186993496231," UPDATE 1-China's biggest airlines reduce 70% of capacity in Feb as coronavirus bites (Adds figures from Air China, China Eastern Airlines) BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - China’s three biggest airlines reduced about 70% of their capacity in February, data showed on Wednesday, as they grappled with the plummeting demand caused by the coronavirus epidemic. China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines each reported a 73% drop in February passenger capacity from a year earlier. Air China, the country’s flag carrier, cut about 68% of capacity. Passengers carried in February plunged more than 80% for all of the three airlines, while load factors for Air China and China Eastern came in better than China Southern at a touch above 50%. Load factor for China Southern in February was at 47.11%, representing a decrease of 38.11 percentage points. Both China Eastern and China Southern warned investors of the uncertain impact from coronavirus outbreak. All of them said they would further optimise capacity and step up cost-cutting.

-17.8876406652599," China Eastern unveils OTT Airlines to operate Chinese-made jets BEIJING (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd 600115.SS launched on Wednesday a fresh subsidiary - OTT Airlines - to push home-grown aircraft to wider markets, the carrier said on its official account on Chinese social media platform Weibo. The Shanghai-based airline said OTT Airlines, which translates to ‘one two three’ in Chinese, would be the first airline to operate Commercial Aircraft Corp of China’s (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] C919 narrow-body planes, which are undergoing flight testing. China Eastern was initially slated to be the first operator. The C919 was designed to compete with the Airbus SE AIR.PA A320 family and the Boeing Co BA.N 737 MAX model that remains grounded after two deadly crashes. OTT will also operate COMAC's regional jet - the ARJ21. Last August, China Eastern ordered 35 of the planes on the same day as fellow state-backed carriers Air China Ltd 601111.SS and China Southern Airlines Co Ltd 600029.SS. China’s C919 single-aisle plane has already received 815 provisional orders, but very few from airlines or leasing companies outside the Asian country. Meanwhile, COMAC is seeking certification from the European aviation regulator to help it operate in many other countries. Development of the C919, at least five years behind schedule, is going slower than expected, a dozen people familiar with the program told Reuters last month, as COMAC struggles with a range of technical issues that have severely restricted test flights."

-15.656737025259131," China Eastern asks Boeing for compensation over 737 MAX grounding BEIJING (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines has formally requested compensation from Boeing Co for the grounding of its 14 737 MAX aircraft and has delayed deliveries of future planes, the company said on Tuesday. The airline’s move was first reported by domestic media, including the state-run People’s Daily newspaper. The reports did not say what amount of compensation the airline is seeking. “The grounding of 737 MAX aircraft since March 11, 2019 has caused relatively big losses to China Eastern. With the passing of time, related losses will further expand,” the paper cited the company as saying. “At the same time, delayed deliveries of planes ordered by China Eastern also caused economic losses.” An airline spokesman confirmed its comments in the People’s Daily report to Reuters. China Eastern has 14 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, including those from subsidiary Shanghai Airlines. The aircraft have been mothballed according to aircraft maintenance standards, the People’s Daily said. The company had not communicated with other carriers regarding compensation, it added. A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment on China Eastern’s move, saying it did not discuss conversations with its customers. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is hosting a meeting of global regulators in Dallas on Thursday to review software and training proposals from Boeing before deciding whether, and when, to end the two-month grounding. China and the European Union each have their own aerospace industries and are likely to fix their own conditions for allowing 737 MAX flights to resume, analysts say."
-14.377185480493413," UPDATE 1-China Southern, China Eastern Airlines post annual losses on fuel costs, weak yuan (Adds results from China Eastern Airlines) BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines on Friday both posted a slump in annual profits, hit by rising fuel costs and a weak yuan currency, missing analyst forecasts. China Southern, the country’s largest carrier by passenger numbers, said its 2018 profit attributable to shareholders fell 49.6 percent to 2.98 billion yuan ($443.59 million), compared with an average forecast of 3.81 billion yuan based on 19 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose 12.66 percent on the year to 143.62 billion yuan, in line with growing demand for travel in the world’s fastest-expanding aviation market. The airline warned that big fluctuations in the yuan this year, along with rising oil prices, were likely to weigh on profits in the year ahead. Foreign exchange losses amounted to 1.74 billion yuan as the yuan fell against the U.S. dollar in the 12-month period, versus a gain of 1.79 billion yuan a year earlier. The yuan fell by more than 5 percent against the U.S. dollar last year, pushing up financing costs at airlines which have bought planes with mainly U.S. dollar-denominated loans. China Eastern, the country’s second-largest carrier by passenger numbers, reported a 57 percent slump in net profit last year to 2.71 billion yuan. It missed the average forecast of 4 billion yuan from 18 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue jumped 13.0 percent year-on-year to 114.93 billion yuan, the carrier said, while incurring foreign exchange losses of 2.0 billion yuan in the 12-month period. Their main rival Air China, in contrast, posted a 1.3 percent increase in its annual net profit, outperforming analysts’ forecasts, as better passenger yields outweighed the impact of rising fuel costs and a softer yuan. A gain on its investment in Cathay Pacific Airways that reported a profit for the first time in three years also helped boost performance. Chinese airlines are among carriers worldwide that have grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft over safety concerns. It is still unclear whether they will have to bear any costs, analysts say. China Southern has grounded 25 737 MAX 8 aircraft while China Eastern has 4, data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24 shows. Air China has 15 Max 8 aircraft grounded."

12.844373450861701," China Eastern Airlines' third quarter profit slumps 38 pct BEIJING, Oct 26 (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd reported a 38 percent drop in third-quarter net profit on Friday, dragged down by a weakening yuan and rising fuel and debt costs. While Chinese airlines have seen revenue surge in tandem with growing travel demand, their costs have been recently by rebounding oil prices and a volatile currency. China Eastern - the country’s second-largest carrier by passenger numbers - said net profit attributable to shareholders dropped to 2.2 billion yuan ($317 million) in the July-to-September period, from 3.6 billion yuan a year earlier, although revenue rose 13.5 percent to 33.5 billion yuan. For the first nine months of the year, net profit was down 43.3 percent from a year earlier to 4.5 billion yuan. The yuan has fallen by about 6 percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of this year, pushing up financing costs at airlines which have bought planes with mainly U.S. dollar-denominated loans. China Eastern reported 2.2 billion yuan in foreign exchange losses for the first three quarters, as the Chinese currency depreciated against the dollar. The airline said in a separate announcement that it plans to issue up to 15.4 billion yuan in corporate bonds to fund aircraft purchases and replenish working capital. In July, China Eastern announced that it would raise up to $2.23 billion in a share sale to expand its fleet and to replenish working capital.

5.075626065972431," China Eastern, Japan Airlines team up to tap Chinese tourism boom SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd 600115.SS and Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) 9201.T on Thursday said they would form a joint venture (JV) to capitalize on a boom in Chinese tourism, in the first such deal between a Chinese and Japanese carrier. The pair, which already have a codesharing agreement, said the venture will allow them to coordinate flight times, offer more connecting flights, lower ticket prices and share revenue on routes they both fly such as Tokyo-Shanghai. They aim to begin operations in the first half of 2019 pending approval from competition regulators. “This partnership will generate more passenger traffic between the two countries and open up commercial opportunities,” said JAL Chairman Yoshiharu Ueki. The tie-up comes at a time of relative calm between two countries whose relationship has been historically strained. Six years ago, a territorial dispute sparked anti-Japanese protests across China and a temporary drop in Chinese visitors to Japan. Chinese tourism to South Korea and Taiwan has similarly fallen in recent years during times of diplomatic crises. “We understand we may have political risks in China,” said a spokeswoman for JAL. “We don’t have any backup plans. But we believe we share any difficulties between us - not only political but also others. We think that is joint business.” A joint venture in the airline industry refers to an agreement to coordinate aspects of business such as scheduling and pricing. The JAL spokeswoman also said there were no plans for the airlines to make equity investments in each other. Corrine Png, chief executive of transport research firm Crucial Perspective, said regulatory approval was likely based on today’s diplomatic relations but there was a risk of delay or cancellation if relations soured during the application process. China has been experiencing a boom in tourism in tandem with rising household income. Neighboring Japan has been one of the main beneficiaries, with the Chinese comprising the largest group of visitors to the country. Last year, the number of Chinese visitors to Japan jumped 15 percent from a year earlier, Japanese data showed. Only a third as many Japanese visited China in 2016, latest data showed. Will Horton, senior analyst at CAPA Center for Aviation, said the China Eastern-JAL joint venture made commercial sense but would not bring as big a financial benefit as ventures involving long-haul flights where connections were more common. “Short-haul JVs have limited impact across the network aside from when the two airlines control a notable amount of capacity on a trunk route (such as Tokyo-Shanghai). Then they can choke the consumer and then shake the change out,” Horton said. JAL is part of the oneworld airline alliance whereas China Eastern is a member of the rival SkyTeam group. Cross-alliance deals have become increasingly common as airlines seek financially beneficial bilateral tie-ups."
