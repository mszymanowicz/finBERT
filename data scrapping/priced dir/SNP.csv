13.19785668449198," China's Sinopec builds first phase of new shale gas field in Sichuan SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp said on Wednesday it had completed building the first phase of a new shale gas field, Weirong, in southwestern Sichuan province with an annual production capacity of 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Weirong, located in Neijiang and Zigong cities, is the state energy giant’s second major shale gas development after Fuling, which is also located in the same Sichuan basin. With an average well depth of 3,750 meters (2.33 miles)beneath earth’s surface, Sinopec has tapped proven reserves of 124.7 bcm at the deep shale gas field. Under the first phase of development that started around late 2019, Sinopec said it had drilled 56 wells attached to eight drilling platforms. Sinopec, Asia’s biggest oil refiner, will proceed to Phase-II development that will lift Weirong’s annual output capacity to 3 bcm in 2022, or sufficient to cover 16 million households’ annual consumption of the fuel. Currently, Weirong is pumping 3.5 million cubic meters of gas a day. China’s national energy producers are ramping up natural gas supplies in recent weeks of both domestic productions and imports to meet a demand surge amid a colder-than-usual winter and robust post-pandemic manufacturing activity."

On Monday China’s central economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) urged companies to step up imports of natural gas and thermal coal as temperatures are set to fall sharply. Sinopec, already Asia’s top spot importer of LNG via a string of tenders ahead of winter, said on its micro blog its LNG imports into receiving terminals in north China’s Tianjin and east China’s Qingdao will reach new highs in January, without giving a volume. The company will also increase domestic natural gas production by another one million cubic meters a day by the end of January by accelerating the drilling of new development wells. It’s also maximising extracting gas from its underground storage in central and east China, while maintaining high inventories at LNG storage tanks, the company said."

17.26384619465464," China's Sinopec plans to produce over 30 bcm natural gas in 2020 BEIJING (Reuters) - China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, said on Thursday it plans to produce more than 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas in 2020, marking an increase of just 1.1% from its output in 2019. The company’s gas production in 2019 was at 29.67 bcm, a jump of 7.2% from the prior year. Sinopec churned out a total 21.87 bcm of natural gas over the first three quarters this year, 0.2% lower than the same period last year, the company said, without offering a reason behind the slowed output growth in 2020. “Amid low oil prices situation, natural gas has become a significant growth point of profit margins in the company,” it said in a statement, adding that its investments on natural gas production capacity and development costs were decreasing. The projected gas output is seen helping the company offset some of the hefty losses it incurred from paying higher prices for gas imports than the current market value. An executive from the company said last month Sinopec had boosted spot purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at low prices during the January-September period, which helped cut losses on its gas imports business. Sinopec also aims to raise the share of natural gas in its energy production portfolio to more than 50% in 2023, when its gas production capacity would reach 40 bcm per annum. The share was 41% in 2019. The firm recently announced it had added 83 bcm of newly proven natural gas reserve at Chuanxi field and some 192 bcm of certified new reserve at its shale gas project Fuling in the Sichuan basin in southwestern China."

7.614372401199741," China's Sinopec awards 10-year gas tender to Qatargas: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp has awarded a 10-year tender to buy 1 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas annually from Qatargas, two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday, to take advantage of current low prices. Sinopec has agreed to pay at a slope of 10.19% to Brent crude on a delivered ex-ship basis, said one of the sources. The deal shows how some buyers are taking advantge of the heavily oversupplied market, with industry sources saying many producers were taking part in the tender. The Chinese state oil and gas producer issued the tender in July, seeking supplies starting 2023, after prices dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic hammering global demand for the fuel. China’s long-term gas demand is expected to grow, supported by the country’s push to shift to the cleaner fuel from coal. Sinopec and Qatargas did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. The low price slope to Brent crude also shows how persistent Qatar could be in the current market environment. Despite the global oversupply, its exports were slightly higher this year compared with the same period a year ago, Refinitiv data showed, while many other producers have to reduce exports signifcantly. The slope to Brent means that the price of LNG is calculated as a percentage to a Brent crude contract. On Friday, the front-month Brent futures price was on course for its biggest weekly decline since June as weak demand figures added to concern over a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. [O/R]"

Asia’s biggest oil refiner, known as Sinopec, reported its first interim loss on record late on Sunday as the coronavirus hobbled industrial activity and curbed travel, cutting fuel demand. However, with China’s economic recovery taking hold, end-user demand for gasoline, diesel and kerosene should rise 1% in the second half from a year earlier, after a 13% fall in the first half, a company vice president said at a briefing. Sinopec reported a net loss of 21.725 billion yuan ($3.17 billion) for the first six months of 2020 - the only half-year period it has ended in the red in Refinitiv Eikon data going back to 2003. That compared with a 32.206 billion yuan profit a year earlier and implies a loss of 1.943 billion yuan in the April-June period, far smaller than the first-quarter loss of 19.782 billion yuan. The company’s “operations and profitability have improved month by month from the second quarter” and its performance has stabilised, Sinopec said. The company also wrote off an estimated 11.8 billion yuan in assets after re-evaluations. First-half revenue fell 31% from a year ago to 1.03 trillion yuan, with refined product sales down 26.1% as the pandemic crippled energy consumption. “The industry has experienced unprecedented difficulties,” Sinopec said. Processed crude oil volumes fell 10.5% to 110.95 million tonnes，or 4.45 million barrels per day. The firm, which recently launched a new 200,000 bpd refinery in southern China, aims to raise throughput to 130 million tonnes (5.1 mln bpd) in the second half. Upstream, Sinopec produced 140.27 million barrels (771,000 bpd) of crude oil, down 1% year-on-year, while natural gas production edged up 0.1% to 512.41 billion cubic feet. The firm is targeting output of 138 million barrels and 580.5 billion cubic feet in the second half. China’s leading shale gas developer, Sinopec aims to nearly double its output of the unconventional fuel to 13 billion cubic metres in 2025, company president Ma Yongsheng said. Capital expenditure came in at 44.99 billion yuan, less than a third of annual guidance of 143.4 billion yuan. Sinopec said it expects full-year spending at about 10% below that target."

10.675180756047272," Sinopec Shanghai Petchem to raise second-half crude throughput BEIJING (Reuters) - Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical, a refining subsidiary of Asia’s top refiner Sinopec, plans to raise daily crude oil throughput by 7.8% in the second half of 2020. The Chinese company aims to process 7.68 million tonnes of crude oil in July-December, equivalent to 304,700 barrels per day, a company official said at a briefing on Thursday. That compares to 7.02 million tonnes of crude oil in the first half of 2020, which was down 6.1% from the same period last year due to the coronavirus outbreak and refinery overhaul. The firm has annual crude refining capacity of 16 million tonnes. That indicates Sinopec Shanghai would still lag behind its 2020 crude oil throughput target of 15.3 million tonnes. Shanghai Petchem recorded a net loss of 1.7 billion yuan ($247.10 million) in the first half of 2020 based on Chinese accounting standards, as the coronavirus pandemic dampened fuel demand, according to company statements filed with the Shanghai Stocks Exchange. “The coronavirus outbreak had brought huge pressure on our production and operation in the first half of 2020...We were forced to cut crude throughput...and we were just able to ease inventory pressure since May,” said Huang Fei, a vice general manager at Shanghai Petchem at the briefing. Huang also said the coronavirus crisis had forced the company to cut fuel exports in the second quarter. However, the group’s average crude oil refining cost in the first six months of 2020 fell 17.9% year-on-year to 2,717 yuan per tonne, or around $54 per barrel, thanks to the decades-low oil prices. Shanghai Petchem bought around 84% of its crude oil from the middle east and around 10% from Latin American countries in January-June. It plans to maintain a full-load refining operation in the second half of this year, in particular increasing production of low sulphur marine fuel. “We are confident of turning losses into gains in the second half and posting a full-year profit,” said Guan Zeming, general manager of Shanghai Petchem.

3.232128393674103," Sinopec merges two Guangdong-based refineries, lifts more U.S. oil SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp has merged two subsidiary refineries in Guangdong, two company sources said, as the state refining giant looks to improve operations in the face of rising competition in South China. The company in July combined the newly launched Zhongke refinery complex and a neighbouring old plant Dongxing Petrochemical, both based in the coastal city of Zhanjiang, and named the merged entity Zhongke Refining and Chemical Co. Guangdong province is China’s top oil-consuming region. Sinopec alone operates nearly 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity in the province and rival PetroChina is building a new 400,000 bpd refinery. “It’s part of Sinopec’s strategy to form regional refining hubs so to be more integrated into feedstock supply and crude oil purchases,” said one Sinopec official. Both sources declined to be named due to company policy. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The new entity has a crude refining capacity of 300,000 bpd and is due to start a new 800,000 tonne per year ethylene complex in September at the Zhongke plant. The older Dongxing plant, which operates a 100,000-bpd crude unit, has since 2017 become China’s leading processor of U.S. crude oil, mostly of low sulfur quality that fits the plant’s configuration, said a second official. Between 2017 and 2019, Dongxing processed about 15 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate crude, replacing some of its previous regular imports from West Africa. After a lull in U.S. oil imports in 2019 due to souring relations with Washington, China since earlier this year has resumed U.S. oil purchases following the Phase 1 trade deal agreed in January. Dongxing is slated to receive 1 million barrels of WTI crude each month between June and October, the second source said. WTI crude typically gives a high yield of naphtha, a feedstock needed for the start-up of the Zhongke ethylene plant."

Sinopec, officially named China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, is seeking 1 million tonnes of LNG a year for delivery over 10 years starting from 2023, said six industry sources. Offers are due by Friday and will remain valid until mid-August, one of the sources said. Sinopec declined to comment. The firm is likely seeking long-term LNG at a time when prices for both long-term contracts and spot cargoes are low, a second source said. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS, which buyers are increasingly using as a gauge to negotiate their long-term contracts, are hovering near record lows. Prices of long-term contracts that are typically priced on Brent oil are also being negotiated at lower levels. “Expectations for long-term demand are still bullish so it’s a good time to buy long-term cargoes,” another of the sources, based in Beijing said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media. “It’s the lowest price range now and so is a good time to discuss long-term deals.” Sinopec is also looking for volumes from the United States as part of the tender requirement, a fourth source said. Sinopec, expected to be the next major Chinese buyer of U.S. LNG, had been in discussions with Houston-based Cheniere Energy to sign a 20-year deal but Reuters reported in January that both companies were planning to review terms of the deal after a sharp drop in prices. China’s long-term gas demand is expected to grow, stoked by the country’s push to shift to the cleaner fuel from coal."

The Sinopec venture, situated in coastal city of Zhanjiang, comprises a 200,000 barrel per day (bpd) crude oil refinery and an 800,000 tonne-per-year ethylene facility, built at a cost of 44 billion yuan ($6.2 billion), Sinopec said in a statement. Two other complexes with combined refining capacity of 800,000 bpd have started up since early 2019, one built by privately-controlled Hengli Petrochemical Corp and the other by Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp. Sinopec said its project would bring new investment worth 200 billion yuan to Guangdong province and thousands more jobs by supporting the manufacture of high-grade plastics, electronics and chemicals. The new plant operates a 300,000 tonnage crude oil terminal and also berths that can dock vessels with capacity to carry 100,000 tonnes of refined products, Sinopec said."

1.8205842767654146," Sinopec expects to start Zhanjiang oil refinery at end of July BEIJING/SINGAPORE, May 28 (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp is expected to start commercial operations at its oil refining and petrochemical complex in Zhanjiang at the end of July, a company spokesperson said on Thursday. The refinery is capable of processing 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and the petrochemical plant will produce 800,000 tonnes per year of ethylene. The project, with first phase investment of 40 billion yuan ($5.59 billion), is located in southern China’s Guangdong province. The refinery received its first crude oil cargo of 128,900 tonnes from a very large crude carrier (VLCC) that arrived at the plant’s 300,000-tonne capacity berth in early May, Sinopec said on May 9. The Zhanjiang refinery is Sinopec’s first capacity addition since the start up of the similar-sized Qingdao refinery on China’s east coast in 2009. The Zhanjiang plant is located about 60 km (37 miles) from Sinopec’s 400,000-bpd Maoming refinery. Sinopec also owns commercial crude oil storage tanks in Zhanjiang that serve as a delivery point for crude oil futures contracts traded on China’s International Energy Exchange (INE). The Guangdong provincial government aims to set up an oil refining and petrochemical industry base to shore up its economy. German chemical giant BASF is also building a $10-billion integrated petrochemical project in Zhanjiang. An Sinopec executive at the Zhanjiang refinery proposed during China’s annual parliament conference, the National People’s Congress (NPC), to include the Maoming-Zhanjiang base into the list of national-level petrochemical bases, according to a report on the proceedings released by the NPC on Monday. Companies involved in the national petrochemical bases would be expected to receive preferential policies from the government on taxes and land purchases. China has seven national-level petrochemical bases at Dalian in Liaoning province, Caofeidian in Hebei province, Lianyungang in Jiangsu province, Shanghai, Ningbo in Zhejiang province, Gulei in Fujian province and Huizhou in Guangdong."
5.858772249546814," China's Sinopec appoints new oil trading chief amid 2018 loss probe: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp has appointed Chen Gang, acting president of its trading arm Unipec as the new managing director of the unit, three people with knowledge of the matter said. He replaces former president Chen Bo, who was suspended in 2018 after Unipec incurred record derivatives trading losses that are the subject of an investigation. Under the role of managing director, Chen Gang will be head of the trading arm, formally known as China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co and which turns over the equivalent of about 8 million barrels of oil per day - on a par with the likes of top independent energy trader Vitol. Chen Gang has also been appointed as Unipec’s Communist Party secretary, the sources said. The management changes were announced internally in March, but haven’t been previously reported, they said. Chen Gang was made acting president in late 2018. Unipec recorded 3.13 billion yuan ($441 million) of profit in 2019, according to Sinopec’s annual report. It reported 4 billion yuan in losses in 2018 after the trading losses. Sinopec, Asia’s top refiner and largest crude oil buyer, has now officially discharged Chen Bo, but he remains a Sinopec employee, one of the sources said. Chen Bo did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment. Unipec’s former Communist Party secretary Zhan Qi, who was also suspended alongside Chen Bo in 2018, has also been officially discharged, the source said. A Sinopec spokesman described the appointment of Chen Gang as a normal personnel change. He did not comment on Chen Bo or Zhan Qi. China’s State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) is due to wrap up an investigation into the 2018 trading losses, one of China’s largest derivatives debacles in nearly a decade. The investigation will reach a conclusion next month, said one source. SASAC did not respond to a request for comment. The sources requested anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media. “Unipec has over the past year beefed up its back-office functions,” said the source. “The company also enhanced its internal reporting system to avoid big mishaps in the future.” Sinopec has said little about Unipec’s trading losses beyond blaming them in January 2019 on “inappropriate trading strategies” in crude oil hedging. The refiner, however, dropped a five-year crude oil purchasing strategy in early 2019 that the management believed was partially to blame for speculative derivatives activity, Reuters has previously reported. Sinopec also appointed Peng Zhiming, formerly with Sinopec Hong Kong, as the new chief financial officer for Unipec, replacing Tian Xiaoyan, a company veteran, sources said."
-6.8027104033464685," Oil prices surge on last day of roller-coaster month NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped on Thursday, after several producers said they would cut output and as signs the U.S. crude glut was not growing as quickly as many had feared brought an upbeat close to one of the most volatile months for oil trading in history. Fuel demand worldwide slumped about 30% in April. Even after major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia agreed to slash production by nearly 10 million barrels per day (bpd), U.S. crude futures closed on April 20 at a record low in negative territory. That collapse in U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures made traders frantic to avoid taking delivery as the May front-month contract expired, forcing traders to pay $37.63 a barrel at settlement to get rid of their contracts. Prices have recovered somewhat but remain down over 60% since the start of the year. On its last day as the front-month, Brent futures for June delivery rose $2.73, or 12%, to settle at $25.27 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for June rose $3.78, or 25%, to settle at $18.84. That was the highest close for Brent since April 20 and WTI since April 16. Brent, the international benchmark, gained about 11% in April after falling more than 65% over the prior three months. WTI, meanwhile, fell for a fourth month in a row, dropping over 70% during that time, including an 8% loss in April. The more actively traded Brent futures for July, which will soon be the front-month, gained about 9% to settle at $26.48 a barrel. Volume in WTI futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange hit around 36 million contracts in April, which Refinitiv data puts as second only to the previous month’s 40.9 million record. “Oil prices are looking very constructive because over the next month or two, supply will meet demand,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, noting oversupply worries are slowly easing with a steady stream of headlines of crude production cuts. Western Europe’s largest oil producer, Norway, said it would lower output from June to December, cutting production for the first time in 18 years as it joined other major producers’ efforts to support prices and curb oversupply. Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, meanwhile, announced its first dividend cut since World War Two. U.S. oil and gas company ConocoPhillips COP.N said it would sharply reduce oil production in coming weeks, aiming to shut in 35% of its total output by June. Russian gas producer Novatek PAO NVTK.MM said it plans to cut capital expenditure by a fifth this year, mainly for developing its oil projects, a company manager said on Thursday. U.S. crude inventories grew by 9 million barrels last week to 527.6 million barrels, Energy Information Administration data showed, below the 10.6 million-barrel rise analysts had expected in a Reuters poll. [EIA/S] Storage concerns, however, continue to weigh with the International Energy Agency saying global capacity could peak by mid-June. U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration would soon release a plan to help U.S. oil companies. Nine companies including Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N have agreed to rent space to store 23 million barrels of crude in the U.S. emergency oil reserve."

Diesel sales match the level of a year ago, while sales of gasoline have rebounded to 90% and petrochemical products to 86%, of the levels seen last year. “Fuel and chemical products consumption is expected to further improve with the acceleration of production resumption at companies in China. Supply and demand will be balanced again,” the company said in a statement. On Wednesday, the listed branch of Sinopec 600028.SS0386.HK on reported a 19.782 billion yuan ($2.80 billion) net loss in first-quarter earnings under Chinese accounting standards, as the coronavirus pandemic walloped fuel consumption and led to collapsing oil prices. That was the state-owned oil company’s first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 2014 and was the biggest quarterly loss since it went public in 2003, according to Refinitiv Eikon’s records. The loss compared with net profits in the first quarter of 2019 of 14.76 billion yuan and 14.31 billion yuan in the fourth quarter last year. Sinopec said its refinery throughput fell 13% year-on-year to 53.74 million tonnes, or about 4.31 million barrels per day (bpd), as the coronavirus curtailed demand for refined oil products. Its oil refining sector suffered a 25.8 billion yuan loss in the first three months of 2020. The company said last month it expected lower refining runs for the full year of 2020, but for refined oil consumption to return to normal in the third and fourth quarters. Utilisation rates at its refineries have been resuming after touching as low as 66% in February. Crude oil production in the first quarter at Sinopec dipped 0.2% from a year earlier to 70.65 million barrels, while natural gas output fell 2.4% to 249.68 billion cubic feet. Its realised crude oil prices were $49.15 per barrel, down 14.8% on year, following the drop in global oil prices triggered by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Realised natural gas prices were $6.43 per thousand cubic feet, down 9.2% from a year ago, it reported."

-1.3351046478830575," RPT-China's Sinopec in talks to buy stake in Hin Leong's Singapore terminal - sources (Repeats APRIL 22 story. No change to text.) SINGAPORE, April 23 (Reuters) - Chinese state energy company Sinopec is in early-stage talks with Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd to buy a stake in an oil storage terminal that is partly owned by the Singapore trader, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The sale could provide much needed cash for family-owned Hin Leong, one of Asia’s biggest independent traders. The company owes a total of $3.85 billion to 23 banks and has applied to a Singapore court to delay its debt repayments, according to a Hin Leong presentation to lenders on April 14 contained in the court filing, which was reviewed by Reuters but has not been made public. Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, was approached by Hin Leong earlier this month to look at investing in the Universal Terminal in Singapore, said one Beijing-based Sinopec official. Hin Leong’s founder Lim Oon Kuin and his family own 41% of the terminal through Universal Group Holdings Pte Ltd. PetroChina holds 25% and Australian investment bank Macquarie the remaining 34%. “Sinopec is interested, and is evaluating the quality and cost of the asset,” said the official, who declined to be named as the discussions are not public. The three sources did not know the size of the stake Sinopec might be interested in buying, or the potential price. Hin Leong and Sinopec did not respond to requests for comment. A previous sale of a stake in the terminal in 2016 valued the whole terminal at more than $1.5 billion, industry sources said at the time.

-2.605351991161728," China's Sinopec in talks to buy stake in Hin Leong's Singapore terminal: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese state energy company Sinopec is in early-stage talks with Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd to buy a stake in an oil storage terminal that is partly owned by the Singapore trader, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The sale could provide much needed cash for family-owned Hin Leong, one of Asia’s biggest independent traders. The company owes a total of $3.85 billion to 23 banks and has applied to a Singapore court to delay its debt repayments, according to a Hin Leong presentation to lenders on April 14 contained in the court filing, which was reviewed by Reuters but has not been made public. Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, was approached by Hin Leong earlier this month to look at investing in the Universal Terminal in Singapore, said one Beijing-based Sinopec official. Hin Leong’s founder Lim Oon Kuin and his family own 41% of the terminal through Universal Group Holdings Pte Ltd. PetroChina holds 25% and Australian investment bank Macquarie the remaining 34%. “Sinopec is interested, and is evaluating the quality and cost of the asset,” said the official, who declined to be named as the discussions are not public. The three sources did not know the size of the stake Sinopec might be interested in buying, or the potential price. Hin Leong and Sinopec did not respond to requests for comment. A previous sale of a stake in the terminal in 2016 valued the whole terminal at more than $1.5 billion, industry sources said at the time. Sinopec, which owns several storage facilities outside China - in Rotterdam, Antwerp and Fujairah - has long been looking for more storage sites to boost its global trading profile, the company official said.

-7.323516208369887," China's Shanghai energy exchange adds to Sinopec oil warehouse storage capacity SHANGHAI, April 9 (Reuters) - China’s Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) said in a statement on Thursday it increased the storage capacity at two of energy giant Sinopec’s crude oil futures delivery warehouses. The delivery warehouses, one at the Yangpu Economic Development Zone storage in the southern province of Hainan and the other at Rizhao city in the eastern province of Shandong, would see additional storage capacity of 200,000 cubic metres each, according to the INE, which is owned by the Shanghai Futures Exchange. This would bring the exchange’s total warehouse capacity for crude oil futures to 4.7 million cubic metres. Reuters reported last week that oil traders seeking to take advantage of a price anomaly by delivering crude into Shanghai crude futures contracts are unable to do so as storage designated by the exchange is full. Shanghai crude oil futures have pulled ahead of ICE Brent, making it attractive for traders to deliver Middle East crude into China. Some companies are holding onto their warehouse receipts as INE’s storage costs are relatively low, making profits by delivering oil into the facilities, sources said, with one adding that most of the space had been booked and held by investors who treat warehouse receipts as a financial tool. The INE last week gave its approval for Dalian PetroChina International Storage and Transportation Co, Ltd to increase its delivery warehouse storage capacity by 750,000 cubic metres to 1.15 million cubic metres in Dalian city, in the northern province of Liaoning. China launched its internationalised yuan-denominated crude oil futures contract in March 2018 with the aim of establishing an Asian oil price benchmark.

The joint venture between China’s Sinopec and South Korea’s SK Innovation had since early this year halted construction at the expansion project based in the city of Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the novel conoravirus. The expansion program started in late 2018 and is expected to be completed by early 2021, when the firm’s ethylene capacity will be enlarged to 1.1 million tonnes per year from 800,000 tonnes, Xinhua said. More than a fifth of the total 1,000 construction staff on the project have returned to work, after the firm carried out strict quarantines and virus checks, Xinhua reported. The agency also reported that the existing petrochemical facilities have been operational all along during the virus outbreak and are now ramping up to full capacity from 80% previously.

-6.67808293367049," Sinopec expects lower 2020 refining runs as coronavirus hits demand BEIJING (Reuters) - Asia’s top refiner China Petroleum Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, expects its full-year 2020 refining runs will be lower than in 2019 because of a contraction in Chinese fuel demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The fall in demand will last for the first half of this year and lead to lower full-year demand but refined oil consumption is expected to return to normal in the third and fourth quarters, said Ling Yiqing, vice president of Sinopec, during an earnings call on Monday. “Due to the impact of the first and second quarters, our expectation of full year consumption of oil products will be negative growth,” said Ling. “In terms of refining utilization rates in the full year 2020, due to the impact of coronavirus outbreak and exports, our whole year number will be affected,” he said. State-backed Sinopec lowered the utilization rates at its crude oil refineries to 66% in February amid the outbreak, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and prompted the government to impose stringent travel bans. The average utilization rate at Sinopec’s oil refineries was 91.3% in 2019. Ling also said the spread of coronavirus overseas will impact oil product exports, negatively affecting Sinopec’s oil refining in the second quarter. Inventory of refined oil products was seen at a high level in February at Sinopec, Ling said, but it is expected to fall back to a normal level by end-March. The company, which will trim 2020 capital expenditure by 2.5%, was making a detailed plan to reduce capex and would report this in April during first-quarter earnings, said Zhang Yuqing, chairman of Sinopec, on Monday. Zhang expects that oil prices will fluctuate around $42 per barrel, and the low price scenario might remain for a longer-than-expected period. He added that coal-to-liquids (CTL) and coal chemical projects will not have any competitiveness when oil prices fall below $35 per barrel. Sinopec, which has three coal-chemical projects, will strive to lower costs this year and work on future planning, Zhang said. Asia’s largest oil refiner also warned about lower petrochemical output in the coming months as it expects a notable decline in global consumption in the next one to two months. Sinopec, which had lowered operation rates by 10% at its petrochemical plants in February, has resumed operations to nearly 100%, but it still sees a high level of inventory of petrochemical products, Yu Baocai, a vice president at Sinopec, also told the Monday briefing. Sinopec’s mainland-listed shares eased 0.7% by midday on Monday but its Hong Kong-listed shares were up around 2%."

Sinopec plans to spend 143.4 billion yuan ($20.21 billion) this year, with 61.1 billion yuan on upstream exploration focusing on an oilfield in northwestern China and construction at two shale-gas fields in the southwest. The cuts will mainly come from Sinopec’s refining units, which will reduce spending by 9 billion yuan from 2019 to 22.4 billion yuan, and from the sales division, down by 7.6 billion yuan, according to a company statement filed to the Shanghai Stocks Exchange on Sunday. But, capital expenditures for its petrochemical sector will increase by 9.9 billion yuan to 32.3 billion yuan. “Due to the coronavirus outbreak, Sinopec is adjusting the 2020 production and operation plans in accordance to market trends,” the statement said. Sinopec has been boosting its capital spending in response to Chinese president Xi Jinping’s call to increase domestic oil and gas output. However, companies are cutting budgets this year after the collapse in global crude oil prices and concerns over waning refined oil consumption. Analysts indicate that breakeven costs for most of Sinopec’s production range between $50-$60 per barrel, much higher than the current price of benchmark Brent crude at $25. “The company initially plans to maintain stable crude oil production and to increase output of natural gas,” said Sinopec. The company produced 284.22 million barrels of crude oil in 2019, down 1.5% from 2018. Among which, 34.79 million barrels were churned out from overseas blocks, which is 12.1% lower from the previous years. It also produced 1,048 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2019, up 7.2% from 2018. Sinopec on Sunday also reported a 8.7% fall in net profit last year due to shrinking refining margins amid industrial overcapacity and lukewarm fuel demand. Net earnings for 2019 were 57.59 billion yuan, down from 63.089 billion yuan in 2018 but higher than 51.119 billion yuan in 2017. Crude oil throughput at Sinopec last year rose 1.8% from 2018 to 248.5 million tonnes, with gasoline, diesel and kerosene output up 2.6%, 2.1% and 7.8%, respectively. Sinopec said that it will speed up construction of cleaner marine fuel production and storage projects in 2020 to increase its market share.

-10.393374188433505," Oil hits 13-month lows as coronavirus cuts demand NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell to the lowest in more than a year on Monday as the coronavirus outbreak curtailed Chinese demand and sparked potential supply cuts by OPEC and its allies. Brent crude LCOc1 settled down $2.17, or 3.8% at $54.45 a barrel, its lowest since January last year. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell $1.45 a barrel to $50.12 after touching a session low of $49.91, also the lowest since January 2019. “We have not seen a demand destruction event of this scale that moves this quickly,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. As the outbreak hits fuel demand in China, the world's biggest crude oil importer, refiner Sinopec Corp 0386.HK told its facilities to cut throughput this month by about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 12%, the steepest cut in more than a decade. Independent refineries in Shandong province, which collectively import about a fifth of China’s crude, cut output by 30% to 50% in a little more than a week, executives and analysts said. The outbreak could particularly curtail jet fuel demand growth in China, wrote analyst Paul Sankey, managing director at Mizuho in New York. Wuhan airport is China’s busiest inland hub carrying about 25 million passengers per year, and conservative estimates are that the number of travelers have fallen by about a third, Sankey said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are considering a further 500,000 bpd cut to their oil output, three OPEC sources and an industry source told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported that another option being considered would involve a temporary cut of 1 million bpd by Saudi Arabia to jolt oil markets. “The market needs assurances that the supply/demand equation remains in balance for prices to hit a floor. This suggests a commitment from OPEC not just to extend oil supply cuts, but even implement deeper ones beyond March,” said FXTM analyst Hussein Sayed. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said the oil market is under pressure with prices dropping below $60 a barrel, and “efforts must be made to balance it.” Ratings agency Fitch on Monday said the coronavirus outbreak could push the global oil market into surplus and that OPEC+ may need to cut production further if the outbreak lasts for several months. On the first day of trade in China since the Lunar New Year holiday, investors erased $393 billion from the nation’s benchmark equities index, sold the yuan currency and dumped commodities as coronavirus fears dominated markets. The first-month Brent contract traded at 8 cents less than the second-month contract LCOc1-LCOc2, a reversal from the front-month premiums seen as recently as last week. The discount briefly widened to 12 cents, the largest since July. “There’s an expectation that it’s not going to last, but we’re oversupplied in the near term,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. The U.S. crude's discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 narrowed to as little as $4.32 a barrel, the least since September. Brent values dropped more precipitously than U.S. crude because China is the top destination for crude that is priced relative to Brent, said Kilduff.

-17.23228934530184," Exclusive: Sinopec to review potential $16 billion U.S. gas deal with Cheniere - sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec, expected to be the next major Chinese buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), is planning to review terms of a potential $16 billion supply deal with Cheniere Energy Inc after a sharp drop in LNG prices, industry officials said. That could delay sign-off on a deal that would help Beijing meet ambitious targets it set for U.S. energy purchases in a Phase 1 trade agreement it signed with the United States on Wednesday. Sinopec, officially named China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, and Houston-based Cheniere had been expected to sign the 20-year deal once a trade truce was reached between Beijing and Washington. However, the LNG market has shifted since news of Sinopec and Cheniere’s negotiations became public early last year. In the intervening period, the U.S.-China trade war sapped Chinese purchases of U.S. LNG, and several other gas suppliers, including Qatar, the lowest-cost producer, decided to build new export plants. That coming supply would add to an existing glut that has caused gas prices to collapse to their lowest levels in years and could keep them suppressed - giving Sinopec additional leverage with Cheniere. Both companies declined to comment. A source familiar with the talks said many items needed to be reviewed as U.S. gas prices have more than halved since 2018. “Sinopec is talking to several other U.S. suppliers,” said a second source. “It’s really not clear at this stage what will come out.” The firm, as one of the few state buyers with appetite to sign new multi-year LNG supply deals, also needs to lobby Beijing to remove or rebate a 25% tariff that has made U.S. imports uneconomical in the past year, one of the sources said. “(The deal) will be renegotiated... over delivery terms and price,” said an industry executive with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named as the matter is not public. “It may not be tough, but will take time.” Sinopec, which plans to more than double its LNG receiving capacities to 41 million tonnes by 2025, emerged last year as China’s biggest spot buyer of LNG, as it is a much smaller purchaser under long-term deals than PetroChina Co Ltd or China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC). Those two firms are committed to other long-term contracts, and therefore much less likely to seek new supply agreements with U.S. exporters. They are also facing slower domestic demand growth and weaker prices, which have led to losses in their LNG import business. State oil firm China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has already fulfilled its supply needs through existing deals with Cheniere, and is also anticipating new supply from investments in the Russian Arctic and Mozambique, said one trading executive. The prospect of buying U.S. LNG is even more remote for China’s so-called second-tier independent gas companies, because they have little access to terminal facilities. “We’ll be in close contact with U.S. suppliers, but price is always the key,” said Frank Li, assistant to the president of private city gas distributor China Gas Holdings. “For now Russian pipeline gas is cheaper, Qatari gas is cheaper.” A top state-oil trading executive said his level of management had received no internal briefing from the government over what products Beijing had in mind when agreeing the Phase 1 trade deal. “We’re already under steep pressure to absorb high-cost term supplies ... and as the market is expected to stay over-supplied beyond 2023, why should we sign up to more term deals?” a CNOOC gas manager said."

With a processing capacity of 150,000 barrels per day, REGAP is the fifth-largest refinery of eight up for sale by Petrobras, as part of a plan to raise around $10 billion to pay debts and sharpen its focus on offshore oil exploration and production. REGAP in the state of Minas Gerais is the only refinery for sale in southeastern Brazil, the nation’s economic powerhouse and the heart of its oil industry. The bid marks an entry into the race by Washington-based EIG, as the private equity firm looks to boost its downstream presence in Brazil’s energy industry. Reuters had reported last month that EIG was interested in REGAP. Sinopec had already delivered a non-binding offer for RLAM, a refinery in the northeastern state of Bahia, which is part of the first block of refineries put up for sale by Petrobras. Other firms selected for the second round of bidding on that block of refineries are Abu Dhabi’s state investor, plus fuel distributors Ultrapar Participações SA and Raizen. REGAP could offer operational efficiencies for EIG, which owns the Port of Açu in Rio de Janeiro state. Oil received at the port could be transported 500 kms (310 miles) inland to REGAP. EIG also owns a major stake in a Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline and has bid on other assets divested by Petrobras. EIG declined to comment. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, said it would announce any noteworthy developments via public filings. The buyer of REGAP will also receive pipeline infrastructure connecting it to the region of the REDUC refinery, near Rio de Janeiro city, one of the sources said. Connections from there to nearby seaports, such as Açu, are under study, the source added. Brazil’s Raizen and Ultrapar Participacoes SA were also eyeing REGAP, but it is not clear if they delivered bids."

-7.187115485856577," Sinopec's third-quarter profit drops a third year-on-year on fuel glut, lower oil prices BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp, Asia’s top refiner, posted a 35% fall in third-quarter net profit versus a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on a company filing, dragged down by narrowing refining margins and weaker global oil prices. The decline follows the launch of two privately owned mega-refineries and the expansion of other major refining plants, which added to the fuel surplus in China’s refined oil market, slashing profit margins for oil processors. Sinopec reported 11.94 billion yuan ($1.69 billion) net earnings for the July-September period, down just over a third from the same period last year. In the first nine months of 2019, Sinopec’s net profit was down 27.8% year-on-year at 43.28 billion yuan under Chinese accounting standards, while revenue reached 2.23 trillion yuan, up 7.7%, the company said in its filing on Wednesday. During the same nine-month period, Sinopec produced 212.78 million barrels of crude oil, down 1.6% from a year earlier, and 773.41 billion cubic feet of natural gas, up 8.4% on the year. Sinopec, among China’s top three importers of natural gas, recorded a 5.5 billion yuan loss in the imports of 10 million tonnes of the fuel over the first three quarters, it told analysts in a briefing on Thursday, without giving a year-on-year comparison. Despite a weaker global gas market, however, the company managed to lift sales prices to an average of $6.19 per thousand cubic feet during the period, up from $5.91 a year earlier. Capital spending in the company was 78 billion yuan over the first three quarters, mainly for shale gas exploration in southwestern China and oilfield expansion in the northwestern part of the country, as well as the construction of its Zhanjiang integrated refinery in Guangdong. Company officials said on Thursday that capital spending so far accounted for 57% of the annual budget and the company expects to step up spending in the fourth quarter to meet its target for the year."

Refining margins have yet to catch up with the jump in freight rates, forcing refiners to absorb the costs for now. “Refineries are facing strong pressure as spot premiums are high and freight rates have jumped, so it’s not economical to import crude,” one of the sources said, adding that Sinopec was considering drawing down crude inventories to manage its needs. A second source said Sinopec was studying whether it could reduce import volumes and see which cargoes from suppliers in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East it could cut among those due to arrive in China in December. “The cargoes have been purchased so it’s still unsure whether the volume, especially for long-haul cargoes, can be cut,” he said. “Freight rates have jumped to $8-$9 a barrel, up by $7 a barrel. It’s eaten up a chunk of the (refining) margins,” he added. In a sign the company was already trying to unload some excess supply in the spot market, Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec UK offered four west African crude cargoes last week, but failed to sell them, traders said. Sinopec declined to comment."
5.981862863020035," Sinopec resumes production at key gas processing unit in Sichuan SINGAPORE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp last month resumed production at a key natural gas processing plant in southwestern Sichuan province after a planned maintenance, the parent company of the state oil and gas group said on Tuesday. By August-end, Sinopec had completed maintenance at a desulphurising facility at Puguang gas field - the firm’s largest gas-producing asset in China - ahead of the heating season, which normally begins at mid-November. There will be a surge in the consumption of natural gas surge during the heating season. The company conducted a regular overhaul at a separate desulphurizing unit in the same gas field in May. Sinopec did not give a current production level at Puguang. State media reported in late 2018 that Sinopec aimed to maintain gas output at Puguang at 10 billion cubic metres by 2025."
1.5845964067578457," Sinopec to start producing low-sulphur bunker fuel at Qilu by end-Oct BEIJING, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp expects to start operations at the marine fuel oil blending facilities at its Qilu refinery in eastern China’s Shandong province by the end of October, the company said on Thursday. Work on the blending facilities is in “full swing” and on completion the first phase will have a production capacity of 300,000 tonnes per year of low-sulphur marine fuel, Sinopec said on its official news website. Sinopec, Asia’s top refiner, has been making adjustments at its plants to ensure its marine fuel meets International Maritime Organization (IMO) emission standards coming into force on Jan. 1, 2020. The IMO rules ban ships from using fuel oil with a sulphur content above 0.5% next year, compared with 3.5% now, unless they are equipped with exhaust “scrubbers” to clean up sulphur emissions. Sinopec plans to have a company-wide low-sulphur fuel oil production capacity of 10 million tonnes per year by 2020. A second phase at the Qilu plant will have a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year, or one-tenth of the total target, Sinopec said.

-4.500410585444733," China's Unipec accelerates U.S. crude purchases after Saudi oil attacks NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s Unipec, the trading arm of Asia’s top oil refiner Sinopec, chartered at least four crude tankers this week from the United States, ramping up shipments after attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities and as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies cool, sources said on Tuesday. Three Aframax vessels that can carry about 750,000 barrels, and one supertanker that can hold about 2 million barrels of crude, have been chartered by Unipec tentatively, according to a shipping source and Refinitiv Eikon data. The attack on Saudi oil facilities on Saturday knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production, or 5% of global output, sending prices soaring and setting off a flurry of inquiries for export cargoes out of the U.S. Gulf Coast in anticipation of a prolonged outage. Imports of U.S. oil into China soared in August, ending the month at 505,000 bpd as Chinese purchasers likely rushed to import U.S. oil ahead of a 5% tariff that came into effect this month, analysts at Kpler said on Monday. This week, Unipec chartered Aframaxes FSL Piraeus, Philotimos and Searanger along with the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) New Solution, after the attacks, according to the source and Refinitiv Eikon data. Unipec’s new shipments came to light as the window to profitably ship U.S. crude on supertankers to Asia and Europe narrowed significantly on Tuesday, quelling the sharp rise in Gulf Coast chartering inquiries. Freight rates for VLCCs from the U.S. to Asia had jumped following the Saudi attacks, to between $7 million to $8 million per vessel, shipbrokers said. Chartering for smaller classes of oil tankers was still active, the sources added. The spread between U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent narrowed to $5.55 a barrel on Tuesday after hitting the widest in nearly two months a day earlier. Futures dropped following a Reuters report that Saudi output might return fully within a few weeks, faster than anticipated, according to a top Saudi official. China imports more Saudi crude oil than any other nation, averaging 1 million barrels per day (bpd). As the spread narrowed, U.S. cash crude differentials weakened. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at Midland, Texas, considered the nation’s flagship crude, traded at parity to U.S. crude, down from a 75-cent premium on Monday. Coastal grade WTI at East Houston, or MEH, fell to a $3.25 a barrel premium, down $1 from Monday."
2.271632090251666," Caught in tariff war, Sinopec seeks waiver for imported U.S. oil: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, is seeking a tariff exemption for U.S. oil being imported in coming months, sources familiar with the matter said, after Beijing late last week imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including crude oil. The largest refiner in Asia is expected to receive four supertankers carrying 8 million barrels of U.S. crude at Tianjin in September and October, according to the sources, data from analytics companies Refinitiv and Kpler. On Friday, China announced its latest round of punitive tariffs against about $75 billion worth of American goods, adding U.S. crude to the list for the first time with a 5% tariff to take effect from Sept. 1. The tax is expected to increase the cost of a barrel of U.S. crude by $3, the two sources familiar with the matter said. Sinopec 600028.SS plans to seek tax exemptions from Beijing for its U.S. crude oil imports, or store the oil in bonded storage for future sales if the waiver does not come through, they said. Beijing has provided Chinese companies a channel to apply for tax waivers, the sources said. The company is also weighing other options, which include temporary storage of U.S. crude oil in bonded warehouse or sending the crude to other destinations, said one of the sources. “It depends on how the communication (with the government) goes,” said the other source. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media. Sinopec declined to comment. (Graphic: China's imports of U.S. crude link: ) U.S. crude futures CLc1 hit its lowest in more than two weeks during Asian trade Monday morning amid escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. China’s move against U.S. crude is expected to put upward market pressure on other varieties of crude. “This is bearish for U.S. grades, but bullish for Brent and Dubai price spreads as China seeks alternatives,” Energy Aspects’ Singapore-based analyst Virendra Chauhan said. U.S. oil imports by China, the world’s largest crude oil importer, in the first seven months this year were about 126,000 barrels per day, about 63% below the same period a year ago, China customs data showed. In June last year, Beijing announced an import tariff on U.S. oil imports but canceled it before it was implemented. But the move has kept Chinese oil buyers on edge, and most private refiners have shunned U.S. oil. Unipec, the trading arm of Sinopec, resumed buying U.S. crude oil cargoes in April, having halted them in September last year."

Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, posted a net profit of 31.34 billion yuan ($4.42 billion) in the first six months of the year under Chinese accounting standards. That put the profit in the April-June period at 16.58 billion yuan, up from 14.76 billion yuan in the first quarter but down 27% year-on-year, according to Reuters calculations based on company statements filed with the Shanghai Stocks Exchange. Revenue in the first six months rose 15.3% from a year ago to 1.5 trillion yuan, the company said. “Domestic demand of refined oil products continued to grow in the first half of this year (but) competition in the market was extremely fierce with ample supplies,” Sinopec said in a statement. Refining margins at Chinese refiners were cut after the start-up of two mega-sized plants, Hengli Petrochemicals and Zhejiang Petrochemical, with combined capacity of nearly 800,000 barrels per day. However, demand for refined oil products, especially gasoline and diesel, were tepid amid stagnating car sales and an economic slowdown. Some fuel producers were forced to make extended curbs to their output as profit margins fell into the red. Average profit margins of oil refining at Sinopec were reported to be 383 yuan a tonne in the first half of 2019, down 161 yuan a tonne, or 29.6% year-on-year. Oil throughput at Sinopec was at 123.92 million tonnes in the reported period, or about 5 million bpd, up from 4.87 million bpd in the first half of last year. The company said it produced 141.68 million barrels of crude oil, down 1.4% on year, and 509.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas, up 7% from the same period last year. Sinopec plans to further boost its oil and gas exploration and development in the second half of this year by building oil production capacity in the Shunbei block in the northwestern region of Xinjiang and an offshore block in the Shengli oilfield.

2.277383543586364," China charters first U.S. crude cargo since newest Trump tariff threat: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese oil trader Unipec chartered a supertanker to ship U.S. crude to China in September, trading sources said, the first such cargo since U.S. President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs on Chinese import, ending a monthlong trade truce. Unipec, the trading arm of state refiner Sinopec, has fixed the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Anne to load U.S. crude in mid-September, according to a shipbroker and Refinitiv Eikon data. VLCCs are capable of transporting about 2 million barrels of crude. Unipec has three other vessels, the New Caesar, the KHK Empress and the New Melody, either loading or set to depart the United States this month, the data showed. China is set to receive nearly 11 million U.S. barrels in August, the highest since June 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data. Another 4.1 million barrels are currently set to arrive in September. Tankers loading in August and September are estimated to arrive by October and November, market sources said. China was the third biggest buyer of U.S. crude in June, a period of relative calm during the prolonged trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Since then, Trump has announced new tariffs. While China has imposed levies of its own on most imports from the United States, it has thus far not elected to do so with crude oil. China’s purchases of U.S. crude have dropped sharply from record levels last year. U.S. crude’s discount to Brent narrowed to the smallest since July 2018 on Friday, falling to as little as$4.25 a barrel. That makes U.S. crude less attractive to foreign buyers, U.S. crude sellers and traders said. “At this WTI/Brent level no one should be buying U.S. crude if they have a choice,” one trade source said."
-8.516385667348533," China's Sinopec sets up fuel oil unit in Sri Lanka BEIJING (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, known as Sinopec Corp, said on Monday it has set up a fuel oil company in Sri Lanka as it looks to supply fuel to ships along a major maritime route. The new unit, called Fuel Oil Sri Lanka Co Ltd, has been registered in Hambantota on the southern tip of the country, according to a report on the website of Sinopec Group, parent of Sinopec Corp. Fuel oil is a refined product mostly used as bunker fuel for ships and is also burned in power stations. The move marks the latest investment in Sri Lanka by China, which sees the South Asian island nation as a pivotal part of its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure plan. Sinopec stressed the strategic location of Hambantota port on the Indian Ocean along a key shipping route between the Suez Canal and the Malacca Strait, which is transited by two-thirds of global oil shipments. The market to supply fuel to ships had “huge” potential, it said. In March, India’s Accord Group and Oman’s Ministry of Oil and Gas signed a $3.85 billion deal to build a 200,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery near Hambantota port, in the biggest single pledge of foreign direct investment ever made in Sri Lanka. China Merchants Port Holdings, China Harbour Engineering Corp and other Chinese companies are investors in the port and industrial zone. Sinopec has set a company-wide target of 10 million tonnes of production capacity by 2020 to supply low-sulphur bunker fuels that meet the cleaner emission standards set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)."
-6.633694491165615," China launches anti-dumping investigation into synthetic rubber product BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Commerce Ministry said on Wednesday it is launching an anti-dumping investigation imports of a synthetic rubber product from the United States, South Korea and the European Union following a request from major petrochemical producers. The investigation into ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) should be finished by June 19, 2020, but can be extended further under special circumstances, the ministry said in a statement. The trade measures were launched at the request of Jilin Petrochemical, a unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), and Shanghai Sinopec Mitsui Elastomers Co. Ltd, the statement said., The companies are top producers of EPDM, a chemical product that is widely used for electric cables and tyres. In 2018, the United States sold 105,797 tonnes of EPDM to China, while imports from South Korea were 53,413 tonnes. That same year the European Union exported 25,368 tonnes of the chemical product to China. The data for all three countries was in an application document submitted by the two Chinese companies published on the ministry’s website. Total shipments from the three countries and region account for almost 80% of China’s overall EPDM imports, according to the document. Export prices of EPDM from the U.S., South Korea and European Union were below the prices of the product in their domestic markets, and the dumping into China had caused substantial damage to the applicants, the document said."

-10.247799949873329," China's Sinopec resumes U.S. oil imports after six-month halt: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec is set to receive its first U.S. crude oil cargo this week since halting imports from the country in September, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. The resumption is a sign that the Chinese refiner sees fewer risks from importing U.S. oil as trade talks between the two world’s largest economies have progressed. Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec suspended imports in September in case Beijing imposed punitive tariffs on U.S. oil imports as part of the U.S.-China trade war. The supertanker Maran Artemis, carrying about 2 million barrels of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland crude, is waiting off eastern China’s Qingdao port to discharge its oil, according to Refinitiv analyst Emma Li. Noble, a second Very Large Crude Carrier also carrying 2 million barrels of WTI Midland crude, is scheduled to arrive in Zhanjiang in southern China in early May, Refinitiv data showed. Unipec has purchased more cargoes to arrive in May and June as the company gradually resumes U.S. oil imports, the sources said. Sinopec could not be immediately reached for comment. “The suspension was a precautionary measure,” one of the sources said. The company could have imported U.S. oil in recent months, but it decided not to take the risk of having cargoes at sea that could be caught out by the introduction of a Chinese tariff, he added. Some of China’s smaller, independent refiners have previously tested the system by importing smaller cargoes in November and March which successfully cleared customs without invoking tariffs, trade sources said. China imported 245,600 barrels per day of U.S. oil in 2018, equivalent to about 3-1/2 supertankers per month, data from China customs showed, equivalent to about 2.7 percent of China’s total imports."
-12.962819716048788," Shell enters China's shale oil scene with joint study with Sinopec SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has entered China’s shale oil sector, signing an agreement with state-owned Sinopec to study an East China block, part of the nation’s early efforts to unlock the potentially massive unconventional resource. China is already in the initial stages of developing its vast shale gas resources, with production last year making up just 6 percent of total gas output after more than a decade of work. China’s shale oil is at an even more basic phase due to challenging geology and hefty development costs, experts said. Shale oil makes up less than 1 percent of China’s crude output after several years of development, according to Angus Rodger, research director of Asia-Pacific upstream at Wood Mackenzie. “China’s shale oil has very low permeability, which means very low per well output that makes the economics hard to work,” said an oil and gas official with China’s Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). The official declined to be named because he’s not authorized to speak with the press. Sinopec said on Monday it had agreed with Shell to study the Dongying trough of Shengli in China’s eastern province of Shandong, without giving further details. Shell confirmed the joint study agreement, but did not offer further comment. That makes Shell one of the few international oil and gas explorers venturing into China’s shale oil sector, and follows the Anglo-Dutch company’s exit from shale gas drilling in Sichuan province in the southwest after spending at least $1 billion and getting unsatisfactory results. Unlike shale gas resources, which are highly concentrated in Sichuan, most of China’s shale oil is trapped in eastern regions such as the Songliao and Bohai Rim basins. North China’s Ordos and Junggar basins are also believed to hold large shale oil resources, the experts said. The Dongying trough is part of the Bohai Rim basin, where top Chinese oil and gas group China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) said in February that it is developing another small shale oil field with an annual output of 50,000 tonnes this year. In 2013, U.S. energy firm Hess Corp signed a production-sharing contract with PetroChina, CNPC’s listed arm, to develop the Malang block of Santanghu basin in the northwest region of Xinjiang, China’s first shale oil deal. Hess quit the block around late 2014 due to poorer-than-expected drilling prospects and as global oil prices plunged, said the MNR official. “The understanding of geology, resource and the best recovery techniques (for shale oil) has only just begun,” said Woodmac’s Rodger. Sinopec is hoping Shell’s expertise in shale oil exploration could help the Chinese state major turn around its fortunes at Shengli oilfield as the reserves at the giant conventional oilfield are depleting rapidly, said Rodger."

Sinopec, Asia’s largest crude oil buyer and its largest refiner, in January abandoned a buying formula used since 2014 to establish performance targets for Unipec and aimed at driving down its crude feedstock costs to a pre-set discount to global oil benchmarks. Under the strategy, Unipec had raked in a total 16.6 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) in net profit between 2014 and 2017, including a record year in 2016 at 6.17 billion yuan, according to Sinopec’s annual reports. The formula-based cost target, though, was blamed by two of the sources for driving speculative trades that led to a nearly $700 million loss for Unipec in the final quarter of 2018. “The headquarters believes that the purchasing scheme may be accountable for the trading debacle,” said one of the sources, “They are struggling to find a better way to manage (Sinopec’s) buying, but chose to drop it for now.” The changes are expected to make the state trader a less active player than in recent years in both physical and derivatives markets, the sources said, although it is not possible to quantify the exact impact on volumes. Unipec cut back its over-the-counter (OTC) paper activities shortly after news of the fourth-quarter loss broke, said a trader active in derivatives. “They used to be doing more OTC trades, like taking positions in forward curves for Brent and Dubai, but I don’t see them doing that anymore,” the trader said. Ending the purchase strategy will see Unipec - which last year bought some 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil for Sinopec refineries - reduce its activities in both paper and physical markets, said the sources. The sources declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the matter. Sinopec declined to comment on the change in purchasing strategy. Adding in global oil products trading, crude oil for China’s independent refiners and liquefied natural gas, Unipec handled more than 7.3 million bpd of oil equivalent last year, on par with top independent trader Vitol SA. Over 2017 and 2018, Unipec was asked to buy crude at $1 a barrel below a weighted average of benchmark crudes U.S. West Texas Intermediate, North Sea Brent and Middle East Dubai, two of the sources said. “That’s an aggressive goal but it gave Unipec large scope to optimize purchasing cost through active paper and physical trades, and also the freedom to market their trading cargoes to refineries as they saw fit,” said a trading executive familiar with Unipec’s strategies. But it also was a factor in the fourth-quarter loss, which occurred amid an unexpected plunge in global oil prices that caught many traders off-guard, and led to Unipec posting a net loss of 4 billion yuan for the whole of 2018 as reported by Sinopec last month. The trading executive said the trader would likely now be less active and less aggressive in benchmark spot markets such as Dubai and curb its exposure in Brent-WTI spread trades. Sinopec in January blamed “inappropriate trading strategies” in crude oil hedging for the record fourth-quarter loss, without giving further details. With the departure of former president, Chen Bo, who was suspended in December for the loss, traders expected Unipec to err on the conservative side under new management. Chen, a chemical engineer by training who joined Unipec around 1993 as a crude desk operator and worked his way up to the presidency in 2013, was known in the industry as an aggressive front-line crude oil trader. The new acting president Chen Gang, a Unipec veteran, has spent most his career on the products desk and risk management."

Over 2017 and 2018, Unipec was asked to buy crude at $1 a barrel below a weighted average of benchmark crudes U.S. West Texas Intermediate, North Sea Brent and Middle East Dubai, two of the sources said. “That’s an aggressive goal but it gave Unipec large scope to optimize purchasing cost through active paper and physical trades, and also the freedom to market their trading cargoes to refineries as they saw fit,” said a trading executive familiar with Unipec’s strategies. But it also was a factor in the fourth-quarter loss, which occurred amid an unexpected plunge in global oil prices that caught many traders off-guard, and led to Unipec posting a net loss of 4 billion yuan for the whole of 2018 as reported by Sinopec last month. The trading executive said the trader would likely now be less active and less aggressive in benchmark spot markets such as Dubai and curb its exposure in Brent-WTI spread trades. Sinopec in January blamed “inappropriate trading strategies” in crude oil hedging for the record fourth-quarter loss, without giving further details. With the departure of former president, Chen Bo, who was suspended in December for the loss, traders expected Unipec to err on the conservative side under new management. Chen, a chemical engineer by training who joined Unipec around 1993 as a crude desk operator and worked his way up to the presidency in 2013, was known in the industry as an aggressive front-line crude oil trader. The new acting president Chen Gang, a Unipec veteran, has spent most his career on the products desk and risk management. ($1 = 6.7096 yuan)"

The four-year deal is for the supply of about 0.45 million tonnes of LNG a year to Unipec Singapore, Santos, which holds a 13.5 percent stake in the PNG LNG project, said in a statement. The deal will take the $19 billion PNG LNG project’s total contracted LNG volumes to about 7.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), it said. “The supply and purchase agreement (SPA) with Unipec ... is the final mid-term LNG SPA that the project has been seeking to secure,” said Peter Botten, managing director at Oil Search , which has a 29 percent interest in PNG LNG. The project signed similar LNG supply deals with PetroChina Co Ltd and a unit of British oil giant BP last year."

Sinopec’s upstream capital expenditure rose to 59.6 billion yuan ($8.9 billion), its highest since 2014, as the company prepares to ramp up exploration at the Shengli oilfield and shale gas blocks in the southwestern Sichuan province. The jump in spending was partially in response to Beijing’s call for energy security, while untapped proven crude reserve from Shengli fell to 16 million barrels by the end of 2018 from 49 million barrels in 2017. Sinopec also came under more pressure to source cheap crude as it plans record refinery runs in 2019. Its total cost for purchasing crude oil rose 41 percent to 701 billion yuan because of higher global oil prices. Sinopec plans to increase its crude processing rate to 4.92 million barrel per day (bpd), up from 4.88 million bpd last year. Its gasoline sales volumes last year were up 4.9 percent to 88 million tonnes, while diesel sales volumes dipped by 4.7 percent. Average diesel prices, however, rose 19 percent last year. The refiner on Sunday posted its smallest quarterly net profit since at least the third quarter of 2016 after its oil trading business Unipec registered one of China’s largest derivatives trading losses in nearly a decade. Sinopec’s fourth-quarter net profit plunged 76 percent from a year ago to only 3.1 billion yuan because of the one-off Unipec trading loss. Its revenue increased 33 percent to 818 billion yuan in the period, according to Reuters calculations. Sinopec said Unipec had a net loss of 4.02 billion yuan last year. Unipec lost 4.65 billion yuan on crude oil hedging in the fourth quarter. For 2018 as a whole the state-owned company still managed robust growth. Net earnings rose 23 percent to 63 billion yuan, the best annual results since 2013, and total revenue of 2.89 trillion yuan compared with 2.36 trillion yuan a year earlier. The strong growth was mainly because of higher sales prices and volumes of refined products and chemicals, the company said in a filing to Shanghai Stock Exchange on Sunday.

-18.251931663430224," Sinopec may ink 20-year LNG deal with Cheniere when trade spat ends SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp plans to sign a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply agreement with Cheniere Energy once China and the United States end their trade dispute, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. Cheniere and China Petroleum and Chemical, known as Sinopec, reached a consensus in late-2018 on commercial terms after months of negotiations, but the signing of the deal was held back by the ongoing trade friction between the world’s top two economies, one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters. “Without the trade spat, the deal should have been signed some time ago,” the source said, declining to be named because the matter is not public. In recent weeks, Beijing and Washington appear to have moved closer to a deal to end a bruising eight-month dispute that has seen the countries slap tariffs on billions of dollars worth of the other’s good. A resolution is widely expected to include stepped-up Chinese purchase of U.S. goods. Sinopec intends to buy close to 2 million tonnes a year of LNG from Houston-based Cheniere starting 2023, the two sources added, without giving a deal value. Cheniere may start delivering some supplies before 2023, said the second of the two sources. Based on the delivered cost of U.S.-sourced supplies into east China in January at $8.30 per million British thermal units given by Chinese customs, the 20-year deal would amount to roughly $16 billion. Sinopec and Cheniere both declined to comment on the status of a deal. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that as part of a trade deal with the United States, China would buy $18 billion worth of natural gas from Cheniere. Officials from Cheniere visited Beijing in late February, said a third source, who was also familiar with the matter. Sinopec, a late comer to China’s LNG scene compared to domestic rivals China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and PetroChina, has said it wants to more-than double its receiving capacity over the next six years to around 41 million tonnes annually, by building three new terminals along China’s east coast and expanding existing facilities. China, the world’s second-largest LNG buyer after Japan, imported just over 2 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel in the first nine months of 2018 from the United States, according to Chinese customs. Imports have since almost dried up after Beijing announced a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG in September, with sporadic shipments in November and January, amid an escalation of the tit-for-tat trade war. In February 2018, before the trade war started, PetroChina’s parent company CNPC signed a 20-year deal with Cheniere to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG a year through 2043, with a portion of the supply beginning in 2018. Thanks to its shale boom, the United States is on track to become the world’s third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019, after Australia and Qatar. Cheniere said last week it planned to make a final investment decision to build a sixth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana in the coming months."

Reuters reported last week that the planned pipeline group will combine the long-distance pipeline assets of the country’s state-owned energy companies in the sector’s largest reshuffle in two decades.

-17.784984466856947," Chinese county stops shale gas mining amid quake fears: Xinhua SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A county in southwestern China has ordered a halt to shale gas mining amid fears it may have helped cause an earthquake in the area that killed two people, state news agency Xinhua reported. The magnitude 4.9 quake hit Rongxian county in Sichuan province on Monday afternoon, damaging thousands of buildings, injuring 12 people and affecting more than 13,000 people, Xinhua said. It was the third earthquake above magnitude 4 to strike the area in two days, Xinhua said late on Monday. It cited experts as saying the earthquakes might have occurred due to natural causes, “but they could not rule out industrial mining”. “Due to safety reasons and requirements on safe production, shale gas mining companies have suspended mining work,” it quoted the county government as saying. Rongxian county is part of the region known as the Weirong block where state oil and gas firm Sinopec Corp is drilling for shale gas. Weirong is Sinopec’s second main shale discovery after its flagship Fuling project in the Chongqing municipality, which is located in the same geological basin of Sichuan. Sinopec declined to comment. PetroChina, which also operates in the nearby Weiyuan block, said in an email to Reuters that “due to safety reasons and production safety requirements, the shale gas development enterprises have suspended their operations upon communication with PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Branch.” The company did not provide further details. Citing experts from the Sichuan provincial earthquake bureau, local state media reported earlier on Tuesday that it could not be ascertained whether the quakes in Rongxian were related to industrial mining activity. Meanwhile, the state-run Global Times said five quakes had hit the area since January including two on Monday above magnitude 4, prompting “some residents” to gather outside the government’s offices to call for a halt to shale gas exploitation. The newspaper cited video footage on social media showing more than 1,000 people attempting to topple the gate of the government building with some 100 police trying to keep the gate upright. Reuters has not independently verified the footage. “Some residents came this afternoon after the earthquake, and now they have calmed down and left. Government officials have responded to their requests,” the newspaper quoted a Rongxian county government official as saying. China’s state-owned energy companies were set to increase spending on domestic drilling this year to the highest levels since 2016, after Chinese President Xi Jinping called last August to boost domestic energy security. Mountainous Sichuan is a hub for China’s decade-long drive to tap shale gas, which makes up about 6 percent of the country’s total gas output."

Asia’s top refiner, which said the loss had pulled down its fourth quarter profits, suspended Unipec President Chen Bo last month, citing unspecified trading losses. State-owned Sinopec still managed to report its best annual results since 2013 on Friday. “Investigations have shown Unipec has applied some inappropriate trading strategies in hedging crude oil business,” the company said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange after the markets closed on Friday. “Because of wrong calls on the oil price moves, (the company) incurred losses on the futures side of the hedging when oil prices fell,” Sinopec said in the statement, without specifying what futures products it traded. Chen is an industry veteran who helped the company become one of the world’s largest oil traders. A senior Communist Party representative of the company was also suspended. John Driscoll, managing director of consultancy JTD Energy said as the world’s largest crude importer, China is naturally exposed to any upside shifts in the market. “Being net short crude, they are a natural buyer of futures, swaps or call options. When the market tanks, unfortunately, long-side forward hedges are hit with losses,” Driscoll said. Benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were down by more than 30 percent at end-2018 after hitting their highest in four years in October. Prices were hit by oversupply concerns as major producers ramped up output while the United States unexpectedly issued waivers that allowed countries to continue importing Iranian oil despite sanctions. Sinopec said in the filing that Unipec had also saved 6.4 billion yuan for its refineries in physical crude oil purchases when measured against the global oil benchmarks. “Immediately after noticing abnormalities in the financial indicators. ..Sinopec terminated the transactions and carried out several measures to prevent further losses.” the company said, adding it has stepped up internal compliances. Sinopec reported 62.39 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) in net profit for 2018, up 22 percent from the previous year, data from the filling showed. Total revenue also rose 22 percent in 2018 to reach 2.88 trillion yuan for the full year, Sinopec said. Fourth quarter net income, however, was only 2.41 billion yuan, Reuters calculations based on the filing showed, down 86 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and Sinopec’s worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2015. Revenue in the last quarter of 2018 rose to 808.6 billion yuan from 615.2 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier. Sinopec also said on Friday that its refinery throughput last year rose 2.3 percent over 2017 to 244 million tonnes, or 4.88 million barrels per day. Its crude oil output fell 1.75 percent to 288.5 million barrels but natural gas rose 7.1 percent to 977 billion cubic feet. In 2009, three Chinese state-run airlines reported book losses totalling 13.17 billion yuan on aviation fuel hedging contracts."

-1.8683415210334569," Sinopec's marketing arm listing may prove hard sell in soft markets SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp 0386.HK, Asia's top refiner, may have a hard time finding buyers for a multi-billion-dollar stock offering of its fuel marketing arm because of investor pushback against higher valuations amid tepid equity markets. Sinopec won final regulatory approval in December for the listing of its marketing unit in Hong Kong, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The company runs the world’s largest retail fuel network with over 30,000 gas stations, 23,000 convenience stores, as well as pipelines and storage for refined fuel products across China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer after the United States. But, Sinopec may have picked a bad time for an initial public offering (IPO) for a fuel marketing company amid investor fears of slowing economic growth in China, which posted a drop in exports and imports in December as its trade war with the United States drags on. Hong Kong's Heng Seng Index .HSI has dropped 19 percent since it hit a record in January 2018. More specifically, there are concerns about slowing Chinese oil demand growth and the potential oversupply of fuels in the country. In November, Sinochem Energy put its Hong Kong IPO on hold even after it lowered its valuation, reducing the amount of funds it expected raise to about $1.4 billion from $2 billion. “It will be a hard sell for Sinopec,” said one of the two sources, a banking analyst who tracks Sinopec closely. “The market has an average price/earning ratio of 8 or 9 times, but Sinopec is looking for more than 10 times,” said the analyst, referring to a common metric for valuing companies that measures how much an investor is paying for a portion of a company’s earnings. Sinopec Corp declined to comment on its IPO plans. The slowing market may mean a further delay for an IPO that has been under discussion since 2016. Sinopec attempted to raise $12 billion through a listing of the fuel marketing business in 2017. In 2014, Sinopec sold a nearly 30 percent share of the business to investors for $17.5 billion, valuing the company then at about $58 billion, in the then largest privatization push of state-owned enterprises since President Xi Jinping took office. This time, Sinopec will list the marketing arm through a separately incorporated entity, Sinopec Marketing Co. Ltd, which was set up just weeks after the National Development and Reform Commission and later the State Council approved the listing plan, said the second of the two sources familiar with the matter. “Sinopec will try its best to list its marketing division in 2019, now that the top government body has given the go-ahead,” the source said, declining to be named as the subject was not public. A separate banking source estimated that Sinopec’s IPO could happen in the fourth quarter as the firm has not started discussing the sale with banks yet and none have been mandated to work on the deal."

Unipec’s President Chen Bo, an industry veteran who helped the company become one of the world’s largest oil traders, has been suspended along with the senior Communist Party representative at the company, Zhan Qi, Sinopec said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. “The Company was informed that Unipec incurred some losses during certain crude oil transactions due to the oil price drop. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the details of such circumstance,” Sinopec said. Reuters earlier reported Chen Bo and Zhan Qi had been suspended after Unipec suffered losses, citing five sources. Neither Chen nor Zhan could immediately be reached for comment. Vice president Chen Gang has been appointed to handle the company’s administrative work, Sinopec added in the filing. “The government inspectors were looking into the company’s operations for the past few years ... one of the problems they found was the severe trading losses in the second half of this year because of wrong market judgment,” one of the sources said. The sources did not refer to any wrongdoing on the part of the two men. Benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices CLc1LCOc1 have fallen by about 40 percent since hitting their highest in four years in October, amid oversupply concerns as major producers ramped up output while the United States unexpectedly issued waivers that allowed countries to continue importing Iranian oil despite sanctions. A sudden widening of WTI’s spread with Brent earlier this year also led to hefty losses at major traders. Chen Bo, who rose through the ranks to take on Unipec’s top role, started the company’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading desk. He also advocated boosting China’s crude oil imports from the Americas to help the world’s largest oil importing country to diversify its suppliers. Oil traders said Chen’s removal could create uncertainty at Unipec. “He’s been a key man in the oil trading industry in the past decade,” said a veteran oil trader in Asia. Shares in Sinopec 600028.SS closed at 5.25 yuan ($0.76) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the lowest in two years and down 6.7 percent from Wednesday. “Sinopec’s stock has been performing badly in the fourth quarter,” said a Beijing-based equity analyst who cannot be named due to local stock exchange rules. The news today caused “a selloff and decline in prices,” the analyst added. In October, Sinopec reported that third-quarter net profit fell from the previous quarter, after rising for five consecutive quarters. For the first nine months of 2018, the company reported a loss of 5.47 billion yuan ($794 million) from foreign exchange rate changes and holdings in derivative financial instruments, according to financial reports issued in October. In the first nine months of 2017, the company reported a gain of 1.13 billion yuan. Of the 2018 losses, 4 billion yuan occurred in third quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on the financial reports. Sinopec does not provide a breakdown for revenues at its trading unit."

1.0803767146873255," China's Iran oil imports to rebound in December as buyers use U.S. waivers BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Iranian oil imports are set to rebound in December after two state-owned refiners in the world’s largest oil importer began using the nation’s waiver from U.S. sanctions on Iran, according to industry sources and data on Refinitiv Eikon. Sinopec 600028.SS resumed Iran oil imports shortly after Tehran's biggest crude buyer received its waiver in November, while China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)will restart lifting from its own Iranian production in December, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Reuters reported in November that China’s waiver on U.S. sanctions allows it to buy 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil for 180 days. Top Chinese energy group CNPC, which has invested billions of dollars in Iranian oilfields, is ready to load its full share of production from December, said an oil executive with direct knowledge of CNPC’s Iran activities. The executive, who asked not to be named, estimated CNPC will load at least two million barrels a month from December, doubling previous levels to help compensate for cuts made before sanctions on Iran’s oil exports went into effect on Nov 5. Before the waivers had been announced, Sinopec, Asia’s largest oil refiner, had planned to stop loading Iran oil in November, but resumed imports within days of getting the exemption, a second source said, also asking to remain unnamed. “We continued lifting Iranian oil in November because we received the waiver,” the second source said. Sinopec and CNPC will likely use up the 360,000 bpd of Iranian oil imports allowed to China under the waiver. Another source said Iranian oil is “attractively priced” versus rival supplies from the Middle East. For November and December, Iranian Heavy crude sold to Asia has been priced at $1.25 a barrel below Saudi’s Arab Medium, a discount not seen since 2004. The source also said many Chinese refiners were geared toward processing Iranian crude grades. At 360,000 bpd, China’s purchases would still be 45 percent less than the average 655,000 bpd imported during the January-September period. GRAPHIC: China's crude oil imports from Iran - tmsnrt.rs/2QhuRLt The rise in Iranian oil supply and surging production from the United States, Russia and OPEC countries has pulled down crude oil prices LCOc1 by almost a third since October. Ahead of the sanctions being implemented in early November, China’s crude oil imports from Iran fell to 1.05 million tonnes (247,260 bpd) in October, the lowest since May 2010, Chinese customs data shows. Data from Refinitiv Eikon, however, shows that 2.77 million tonnes of Iranian crude were discharged into Chinese ports in October, including into bonded storage tanks in Dalian. GRAPHIC: Iran crude prices versus Saudi Arabia oil - tmsnrt.rs/2RG5Bv8 By December, China’s Iran oil imports could reach almost 3 million tonnes, the Eikon data showed. A total 2.51 million tonnes of Iranian crude were discharged into Dalian in October and November, according to the data. Other major Iranian oil buyers, including India, South Korea and Japan, are also increasing or resuming orders. It is still not clear whether Iran will be able to export much oil after the U.S. sanctions waivers expire around the start of May."

-1.3294381538558098," China's Sinopec, CNPC speed up oil, gas drilling to boost output BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec and CNPC [CNPET.UL] are speeding up drilling and exploration from major tight and shale oil and gas formations in the country’s western regions to boost domestic output, according to company reports on Monday. New exploration in shale gas, tight oil and tight gas will lead to growth in production for the country’s largest oil and gas producer, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the firm’s official newspaper reported on Monday, citing an internal conference from its upstream services unit. The drilling cycle at the Mahu field in Xinjiang, one of CNPC’s largest findings in recent years, fell 40 percent from a year go, CNPC said, implying that oil wells are being completed and produced at a faster rate. Despite having large domestic oil and gas reserves, China has become the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, and this year it is also expected to overtake Japan as the top buyer of liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG shipments cost China around $25 billion in October alone, according to Reuters calculations. CNPC this year increased spending in its upstream sector after a government call to safeguard China’s energy security by increasing domestic output. Sinopec said on Monday it planned to tap 66 new natural gas wells and install 23 gas drilling stations over winter to increase supplies from its fields in southwestern China, the company said in its official newspaper. China needs more gas because it is in the midst of a gasification push that is moving millions of households and factories from coal-fired power and heating to gas. The aggressive gasification targets and an unusually cold winter last year caused a supply shortage. To prevent a repeat, Chinese companies have this year increased spending on domestic production and filled up storage tanks ahead of winter."
3.1387443604395924," China's Sinopec Q3 profit up 60 pct on year, but down from record Q2 BEIJING, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Chinese oil and gas major Sinopec’s net profit rose to 18.38 billion yuan ($2.64 billion) in the third quarter, up 60 percent from a year earlier, on robust refining margins and improving earnings from crude oil and gas production. The figure was down, however, from a record high of 22.83 billion yuan in the second quarter, company filings to the Hong Kong stock exchange showed on Tuesday night. The quarter-on-quarter decline came after Sinopec’s profit grew for five consecutive quarters. It could increase concerns that a glut in fuel markets and the higher cost of crude oil, amid looming sanctions on Iran and U.S-China trade tensions, is hurting the performance of Asia’s largest refiner. In the first nine months of 2018, net profit was up 56 percent at 59.98 billion yuan, Sinopec said in its filing. Its third-quarter revenue was 772.7 billion yuan, a 33 percent increase from a year earlier. Revenue for the first three quarters reached 2.07 trillion yuan, up 18 percent from the year earlier period. The company’s crude production continued to drop despite higher crude prices. Sinopec produced 216 million barrels of crude between January and September, down 1.7 percent from the year earlier period. Its natural gas output in the first three quarters grew 6 percent to 714 billion cubic feet."
2.763810111425617," Germany's BASF scoops second China chemicals deal in four months BEIJING (Reuters) - Chemical giant BASF BASFn.DE said on Monday it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China's Sinopec Corp 600028.SS to build a steam cracker in east China, the second major investment pledged by the German firm in four months. China, the world’s top chemicals consumer, is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors, as well as polyesters for clothing. According to the MoU, BASF-YPC, the German group’s joint venture with Sinopec in Nanjing, will invest in a 50 percent stake in the new cracker. SINOPEC Yangtzi Petrochemical (YPC) will take the other 50 percent. “This additional investment into a new steam cracker and the expansion of our BASF-YPC joint venture in Nanjing underline the strong partnership between Sinopec and BASF and the commitment to our customers in China,” BASF Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller said. BASF said the new steam cracker will have an annual capacity of one million tonnes of ethylene, a building block for plastics, rubber and synthetic fiber. The group declined to disclose financial details. A joint venture consisting of French oil group Total TOTF.PA, Borealis [BESGR.UL] and NOVA Chemicals [INPTVN.UL] last year said it would spend $1.7 billion on an ethane steam cracker at Port Arthur, Texas, with a similar capacity. In July, BASF landed a preliminary deal to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex in Guangdong, worth some $10 billion in investment to 2030, aided in part by trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The German group made 22 percent of sales in the Asia-Pacific region last year, its annual report shows. It does not break out Chinese numbers. BASF said a joint pre-feasibility study on the cracker will be completed by the end of 2018. Zhong Jian, chief analyst with consultancy JLC, said global chemicals firms have been encouraged by China’s top leaders, who have repeatedly expressed support this year for foreign investment in the petrochemicals sector. “The companies are more ambitious than just building ethylene plants. They are aiming for a bigger market share in the whole supply chain and the ethylene complex might just be their first step,” said Zhong. BASF and Sinopec will also explore new business opportunities in China’s fast-growing battery materials market, they said. Founded in 2000, BASF-YPC has spent approximately $5.2 billion in China. “The rising importance of alternative energy in China, especially in the automotive industry, has led to a surge in demand for innovative battery materials for a range of applications,” the groups said in a joint statement. Following on from BASF's July deal, U.S. energy titan Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N signed a pact in September to build a petrochemical complex in Huizhou city of Guangdong, which will also be solely foreign-owned. Just a week later, Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE followed suit and signed a deal with Fujian government."

If agree, a supply deal would likely start ahead of an expected surge in China’s demand this winter and it will be for about three years, two of the sources briefed on the matter said. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak with media. The exact volumes under discussion were not immediately clear but project holder Oil Search said in its half-yearly results statement in August that negotiations are ongoing to contract the project’s final batch of mid-term supply totalling 0.45 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa). Exxon’s existing LNG deal with Unipec from the PNG project, signed in 2009, is to supply about 2 mmtpa for 20 years. The overall PNG project has a total contracted volume of 7.5 mmtpa so far, according to Oil Search. The project has signed mid-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with PetroChina and oil major BP, and has sold 6.6 mmtpa under long-term contracts to Japanese trading giant JERA, Osaka Gas, Sinopec and Taiwan’s CPC Corp. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Exxon is also currently in talks with other potential buyers of Papua New Guinea LNG. Exxon holds a 33.2 percent stake in PNG LNG, while Oil Search has a 29 percent interest. Two PNG government-linked entities and Australia’s Santos Ltd hold smaller stakes. An Exxon spokeswoman in Papua New Guinea declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on commercial matters. A Sinopec spokesman did not comment. “Everyone is worried about a winter shortage,” said one major LNG buyer in China, adding this is driving Chinese companies to lock in supply ahead of winter when demand typically surges. For example, China’s Petrochina International inked a three-year agreement with the PNG LNG project in July for the supply of 0.45 million tonnes of LNG a year. It also signed a 22-year deal with Qatargas in September for 3.4 million tonnes of LNG a year. China, the world’s second-largest LNG importer, is expected to import a record 54 million tonnes of the fuel this year, surging more than 40 percent from 38 million tonnes last year, according to consultancy SIA Energy earlier this week. Last winter, an over-ambitious attempt to convert millions of Chinese households from coal to gas heating driven by a gasification push by the government, left many villages without gas supplies amid freezing temperatures.

-30.555552743126498," China's Sinopec halves Iran oil loadings under U.S. pressure: sources BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp is halving loadings of crude oil from Iran this month, as the state refiner comes under intense pressure from Washington to comply with a U.S. ban on Iranian oil from November, said people with knowledge of the matter. The sources did not specify volumes, but based on the prevailing supply contract between the top Chinese refiner and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), its loadings would be reduced to about 130,000 barrels per day (bpd). This would be 20 percent of China’s average daily imports from Iran in 2017, dealing a blow to Tehran, which has counted its top oil client to maintain imports while European and other Asian buyers wind down purchases to avoid U.S. sanctions. The cut marks Sinopec’s deepest reduction in years as the Hong Kong and New York-listed state oil company faces direct pressure from a U.S administration determined to choke off the flow of petrodollars to the Islamic Republic. GRAPHIC: Asia's Iranian crude oil imports - tmsnrt.rs/2cNidjY The move comes after senior U.S. officials visited the refiner in Beijing last month, demanding steep cutbacks in Iranian oil purchases, said one of the sources. “This round is completely different from last time. Then it was more of a consultative tone, but this time it’s almost like an ultimatum,” said the source. The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter. Sinopec declined to comment. NIOC did not respond a Reuters email seeking comment. Further complicating the matter, Iran is having difficulty securing insurance for its oil vessels, said shipping and insurance sources, as most European and U.S.-based re-insurance firms are winding down their Iranian business. Chinese buyers, including Sinopec and state-run trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp, have since July shifted their cargoes to vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC) to keep supplies flowing amid the reinstatement of economic sanctions by the United States. During the last round of United Nations sanctions around 2011, officials from Washington asked Chinese firms to curb investments in Iranian oil and gas fields, but stopped short of demanding a full stop to oil shipments. (reut.rs/2xHEYy2) It’s not clear if Zhuhai Zhenrong has also reduced loadings this month. The state trader is contracted to lift some 240,000 bpd from Iran, mainly to feed Sinopec refineries. It’s also not clear if Sinopec and PetroChina are cutting loadings from their upstream investment in key Iranian oilfields that total between 100,000 to 150,000 bpd. These loadings are separate from their annual supply contracts. Beijing has repeatedly defended its energy trade with Tehran, worth about $1.5 billion a month, as transparent and lawful. Some of the top oil refineries that come under Sinopec are configured to process Iranian oil."
-13.40900350781307," China's Sinopec plans to build Canadian oil refinery WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp has joined a group planning to build an oil refinery in Alberta, an enterprise that would strengthen demand for the Canadian province’s heavily discounted crude. State-owned Sinopec, formally known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp 600028.SS, along with an Alberta indigenous group, China State Construction Engineering Corp 601668.SS and Alberta management company Teedrum, plan to build a refinery to process 167,000 barrels per day of crude into gasoline and other products, the project's consulting firm Stantec Inc STN.TO said in a statement on Thursday. The SinoCan Global refinery would cost C$8.5 billion, with a financing plan still to be worked out, said Teedrum President Ken Horn, who is leading the effort. Ownership has not been determined. The group hopes to receive regulatory approval from the Alberta and Canadian governments within two years, he said in an interview on Friday. Most of the refined products will be exported. “It helps create value for the bitumen,” Horn said, referring to the tarry, semi-solid form of Alberta’s heavy crude. “Right now we ship most of that (crude) out of the province. We should do a lot more to maximize the value of that asset.” Most of Canada’s crude is produced in landlocked Alberta, where pipeline capacity has not expanded as rapidly as production. Resulting bottlenecks have hindered transportation to U.S. refineries, steepening an already deep price discount for the province’s crude, which grew to a multi-year high this week. Sinopec’s interest is encouraging news for a Canadian sector that has seen foreign oil majors retreat over concerns about high production costs and the oil sands’ environmental toll. China's involvement would complement its existing Alberta investments, Horn said. State-owned CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK bought energy producer Nexen in 2013. If Sinopec plans to ship refined products from Canada to China, it would likely move them by rail to the Pacific Coast, since pipeline space is limited, said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn. It may make more sense for China to import Canadian crude and refine it domestically, he said. Alberta’s previous government declined to support the aboriginal-led refinery proposal in 2012, after deciding the project did not make economic sense. This time, the project involves China and is not soliciting government help, Horn said. A spokesman for Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said on Friday that building a refinery is “ambitious”, and positive for the economy if the project can competitively move refined products offshore. Sinopec could not be reached."

Chevron agreed last year to sell its 75 percent stake to state-owned Sinopec, before miner and commodities trader Glencore swooped in after reaching a deal with minority shareholders, who backed it and exercised preemptive rights on the sale. The assets include a 110,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 845 service stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana. Glencore is providing funding to, and making its bid through, its Black Economic Empowerment partner Off The Shelf Investments (OTS), a minority shareholders’ group, which already owns virtually all the remaining shares in Chevron SA. South Africa’s competition watchdog approved the bid in August, but the Competition Tribunal makes the final ruling on deals. Sinopec’s bid was also approved by the competition authorities but the Tribunal said Glencore-backed OTS had right of first refusal to close the transaction. The conditions for the proposed merger included the preservation of jobs after the deal and the continuation of CSA retirees’ medical aid subsidy among others, it said.

Known as Sinopec, the company said in a statement late on Sunday that first-half net income was 41.6 billion yuan ($6.05 billion), up 54 percent from the same period a year. That marks its best first-half performance since it listed 18 years ago, a company spokesman said on Monday, topping its own forecast of 50 percent profit growth, issued late in July. The company doesn’t give a breakdown for second-quarter results. But according to Reuters calculations based on Sinopec’s first-quarter earnings, April-June net income climbed to 22.8 billion yuan from 18.8 billion yuan in the first three months of the yea, the highest since at least the start of 2013. The stronger earnings came after oil topped $80 a barrel in May for the first time since 2014, boosted by OPEC-led output cuts and falling Venezuelan and Libyan output, as well as by an imminent drop in Iranian exports as U.S. sanctions return. Sinopec’s bumper results also come as state oil refiners have exported record volumes of diesel and gasoline, grabbing a bigger share of the market as smaller, independent refiners struggle with tough new taxes, a government-led environmental crackdown and crippling costs from the higher crude oil. The company’s shares in Hong Kong were up more than 5 percent on Monday at HK$7.65, while the exchange benchmark index was up 2.2 percent. Total revenue in the first six months of the year rose to 1.3 trillion yuan, up 12 percent from a year earlier, amid higher crude prices, rising natural gas production and stronger fuel margins, the statement said. Second-quarter revenue was 679 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations. Still, Sinopec warned on Sunday processing rates for crude to stay flat in the second half of 2018, amid an oversupply of refined fuels. The company said it will process 121 million tonnes of crude oil in the second half of the year, the same as in the first half, and its domestic fuel sales will be 90.5 million tonnes, compared to 88.45 million tonnes in the first half, it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. “Sinopec ramped up efforts to sell fuel in domestic market by giving a discount especially for diesel in the second quarter. The discounts have boosted sales volume but hurt revenue,” Eyebright Securities said in a research note last week after the company gave a results forecast. Crude oil production in the first half fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier to 143.6 million barrels while natural gas output was up 5.3 percent from a year earlier to 476.2 billion cubic feet, Sinopec said. Sinopec will produce 146 million barrels of crude oil in the second half of 2018, it said. Refined product sales in the first half were down 2.1 percent from the same period a year earlier.

The company said it will process 121 million tonnes of crude oil in the second half of the year, the same as in the first half, and its domestic fuel sales will be 90.5 million tonnes, compared to 88.45 million tonnes in the first half, it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. “Sinopec ramped up efforts to sell fuel in domestic market by giving a discount especially for diesel in the second quarter. The discounts have boosted sales volume but hurt revenue,” Eyebright Securities said in a research note last week after the company gave a results forecast. Crude oil production in the first half fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier to 143.6 million barrels while natural gas output was up 5.3 percent from a year earlier to 476.2 billion cubic feet, Sinopec said. Sinopec will produce 146 million barrels of crude oil in the second half of 2018, it said. Refined product sales in the first half were down 2.1 percent from the same period a year earlier. Chinese offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd last week reported its best profits since 2015. China’s largest oil producer PetroChina, will publish their final first-half results on Aug. 30.

-11.648228356103669," South African watchdog approves Glencore's bid for Chevron assets JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's competition watchdog approved Glencore's GLEN.L roughly $900 million bid for Chevron's CVX.N local and Botswana assets on Thursday, bolstering its chances of scuppering a rival bid from China's Sinopec 000554.SZ. Chevron agreed last year to sell its stake to state-owned Sinopec before miner and commodities trader Glencore swooped in after reaching a deal with minority shareholders, who backed it and exercised preemptive rights on the sale. At stake is a 75 percent share in Chevron’s South African subsidiary that runs a 100,000-barrels-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban and 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. The sale also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana. For Glencore, the deal would secure the trader’s first refining asset since it ventured into downstream investments. For Sinopec, it would mark its second major refinery investment as the company looks to expand overseas amid a saturated home market. Both deals have now been given the green light from the Competition Commission subject to several conditions that include the preservation of jobs after the deal. It is now up to the Competition Tribunal, which makes the final ruling on deals, to decide whether to accept the Commission’s recommendations. The Tribunal has already approved Sinopec’s bid."

The project, to be built in Wenzhou of Zhejiang province, includes four tanks each able to store 200,000 cubic meters of LNG, a berth to dock tankers of 30,000 cubic meters to 266,000 cubic meters, as well as a 26-km (16-mile) pipeline. The two companies launched on Monday new entity Zhejiang Zheneng Wenzhou LNG Co Ltd that is 51 percent owned by the Zhejiang group, 41 percent by Sinopec and 8 percent by a local investment firm, said a Sinopec press official. This will be Sinopec’s fourth LNG receiving terminal after similar-sized facilities built in Qingdao, Beihai and Tianjin. The state group is expanding its LNG receiving capacity rapidly under Beijing’s push to replace coal with cleaner gas. Zhejiang Energy Group, established in 2001, is a provincial government-backed entity engaged in thermal power generation and pipeline gas distribution, according to its website. The group supplies 61 million tonnes of coal a year, nearly half of Zhejiang’s consumption, and distributes 8.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year, meeting 83 percent of the province’s need for gas. The Wenzhou terminal puts the Zhejiang group into China’s so-called “second-tier” of LNG players, which are local-government-backed city gas distributors that are emerging as new merchants in the global gas market."
-9.760706302167659," China sells diesel to South Africa as refiners seek new export markets BEIJING (Reuters) - State-run oil company Sinopec is selling diesel as far afield as South Africa as China’s refiners seek homes for their surplus fuel in the latest sign of troubles in the domestic refining business. Sinopec said on Monday it shipped its first 30,000 tonnes of diesel from its Shanghai refinery heading for South Africa. This cargo and another September shipment marked the first batch to South Africa in two years, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping data. Such shipments have also been extremely rare in the past five years, according to the data. “China’s four oil majors are facing a glut overhang in domestic market and the companies are fully aware of the headwinds ahead,” a product trader from a state-owned oil company said. “Chinese companies are looking to expand sales to emerging market countries beyond South East Asia where margins have weakened amid competition,” he said referring to India and South American countries. He declined to be named to due company policy. Sinopec’s rival CNPC also sold its first ever gasoline to Americas in April. China exported record volumes of diesel in May, with the total almost hitting 2.4 million tonnes. Shipments have remained firm since, as domestic fuel demand growth stagnates. Vehicle sales, a barometer of gasoline demand, were down 4 percent in July. An environmental crackdown has also hurt diesel sales from trucks in the past two years. “Refinery runs were growing fast but domestic consumption did not catch up. With two more new refineries expected to start soon, the glut is only going to get worse,” Liu Mengkai, fuel products analysts with consultancy Sublime China said. “Chinese refiners are vying for a bigger share of fuel market in countries like Australia where consumption is still good,” Liu said. Eikon trade data showed that China’s total fuel exports to Australia hit 11 cargoes or 344,800 tonnes in July, a record high. In Africa, Sinopec is seeking to buy Chevron’s assets in South Africa and Botswana, giving Asia’s top refiner its first major African refinery as well as petrol stations and convenience stores. China’s refinery runs rose in June as state-controlled oil majors boosted output of fuel products, data showed."

The state oil major and China’s top refiner, usually known as Sinopec, said in a statement it expects first-half net profit to rise by 50 percent from 27.1 billion yuan ($3.98 billion) in the same period a year ago. That would be 40.65 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations and the highest on records back to 2013. On a quarterly basis, that would be 21.9 billion yuan, the highest for Sinopec since the third quarter 2013, records show. “The global crude oil prices increased year-on-year in H1, and company’s upstream business improved substantially,” the company said in the statement, adding that it has seen favorable mid- and downstream business results. Oil topped $80 a barrel in May for the first time since 2014, boosted by OPEC-led output cuts and falling Venezuelan and Libyan output, as well as by an imminent drop in Iranian exports as U.S. sanctions return. The bumper results also come as state oil refiners have exported record volumes of diesel and gasoline, grabbing a bigger share of the market as smaller independent refiners struggle with tough new taxes, a government-led environmental crackdown and crippling costs from the higher crude oil. Sinopec, offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd and China’s largest oil producer PetroChina will publish their final first-half results in August."

1.015837211415141," China signals to state giants: 'Buy American' oil and grains SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China will import record volumes of U.S. oil and is likely to ship more U.S. soy after Beijing signalled to state-run refiners and grains purchasers they should buy more to help ease tensions between the two top economies, trade sources said on Wednesday. China pledged at the weekend to increase imports from its top trading partner to avert a trade war that could damage the global economy. Energy and commodities were high on Washington’s list of products for sale. The United States is also seeking better access for imports of genetically modified crops into China under the deal. As the two sides stepped back from a full-blown trade war, Washington neared a deal on Tuesday to lift its ban on U.S. firms supplying Chinese telecoms gear maker ZTE Corp 000063.SZ0763.HK, and Beijing announced tariff cuts on car imports. But U.S. President Donald Trump indicated on Wednesday that negotiations were still short of his objectives when he said any deal would need a “different structure”. China is the world’s top importer of both oil and soy, and already buys significant volumes of both from the United States. It is unclear how much more Chinese importers will buy from the United States than they would have otherwise, but any additional shipments would contribute to cutting the trade surplus, as demanded by Trump. Asia's largest oil refiner, China's Sinopec 600028.SS will boost crude imports from the United States to an all-time high in June as part of Chinese efforts to cut the surplus, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec has bought 16 million barrels, or about 533,000 barrels per day, of U.S. crude to load in June, they said, the largest volume ever to be lifted in a month by the company and worth about $1.1 billion. “The government has encouraged us to lift more U.S. crude,” one of the sources said. China has been one of the top buyers of U.S. crude exports since Washington lifted a 40-year ban on shipments in late 2015. Since then, U.S. crude exports have risen rapidly as output from shale fields hits record highs. Exports are straining U.S. pipeline and port capacity, and may be reaching a limit until capacity expansion underway are completed, one of the sources said. “We want to buy more but they might not be able to export more,” the source said. Other Chinese refiners are looking to reconfigure their plants so they could buy and process U.S. oil, one trade source said. In agriculture, China’s state grain stockpiler Sinograin returned this week to the U.S. soybean market for the first time since early April, two sources said. Soybeans are America’s top agricultural export to China, worth $12 billion last year, and the absence of Chinese buyers from the market had left U.S. farmers wondering if their biggest buyers was going to want their next harvest. Sinograin enquired about prices for U.S. soybeans this week, traders said, which market participants interpreted as a sign that government curbs on buying American goods had been lifted “Sinograin is in the market today asking U.S. suppliers to make offers for shipment of old-crop as well as new-crop beans for shipment August onwards,” said a source who works at a private soybean crushing company in China. “It is a clear message to even private companies that it is OK now to import U.S. beans.” Two other sources briefed on the matter said Chinese state grain trader Cofco [CNCOF.UL] would be permitted to buy U.S. soybeans again, ending restrictions imposed by Beijing as trade tensions rose. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Sinograin, Cofco and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. The Ministry of Commerce had not told state companies to increase purchases of U.S. soybeans, a ministry spokeswoman said. U.S. Gulf export prices for the new soybean crop rose on Tuesday, which a U.S.-based trader said may indicate a revival in demand from China. Exporters were lining up supplies for October to December shipment, the trader said. Improving trade relations appeared to be rekindling interest from China for other grains, traders said. That will come as a big relief to U.S. farmers, who saw orders cancelled and business dry up as Washington and Beijing threatened each other with trade tariffs."
1.015837211415141," China's Sinopec to boost U.S. crude imports to all-time high: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, will boost U.S. crude oil imports to an all-time high as China tries to reduce its trade deficit with the United States, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The company’s trading arm Unipec has bought 16 million barrels, or about 533,000 barrels per day (bpd), of U.S. crude to load in June, they said, the largest volume ever to be lifted in a month by the company. “The government has encouraged us to lift more U.S. crude,” one of the sources said. Sinopec could not immediately be reached for comment. China has pledged to buy more U.S. goods to reduce the huge trade deficit with the United States and help ease the threat of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Energy and commodities are high on Washington’s list of products for sale. Unipec’s June oil purchases would be worth about $1.1 billion at current prices. They would represent a notable increase in China’s imports of U.S. crude, which have averaged about 330,000 barrels a day for the six-month period ended in February, according to U.S. Energy Department data. An arbitrage opportunity has also opened up after U.S. crude futures recorded the widest discount in three years against Brent at $8.06 a barrel last week, enabling Unipec to boost imports to replace more expensive Middle East oil. Washington is keen to sell more of the country’s surging oil and gas production. However, U.S. energy exports can grow only gradually due to infrastructure bottlenecks, and only if U.S. oil, gas and other goods remain attractively priced compared with global competition. “We want to buy more but they might not be able to export more” because of infrastructure constraints in the U.S. Gulf Coast, a source said. The United States exported a record 2.6 million bpd of crude oil in the week ended May 11, and analysts estimate the country’s limit is somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million bpd. However, reaching that level would be a stretch, because only one terminal - the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) - is equipped to handle the very large crude carriers (VLCCs) that transit many Asian ports; the LOOP only started testing VLCCs for export in February. “Whenever we talk about these numbers, the issues are not just of pure dock capacity. For China, the more important issue for them is the size of vessel that you can load. (Of) all of the main (U.S.) regions where loading is occurring, none can load a VLCC directly,” said Sandy Fielden, director of research in commodities and energy at Morningstar. Also, China prefers a heavier quality of crude whereas the bulk of U.S. oil exports is light crude, the source said."

2.907408479450734," China's Sinopec plans to cut Saudi crude oil volumes for second month in June SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, plans to cut the volume of Saudi crude oil it loads in June by 40 percent for a second month, after the price of the kingdom’s key grade rose to a near 4-year high, said an official from trading arm Unipec. Saudi crude remains overvalued compared with other Middle East grades, the official said on Thursday, declining to be named due to company policy. The Unipec executive declined to elaborate on how the 40 percent cut would be implemented, and Saudi Aramco could not be immediately reached for comment. The cut to Saudi supplies could continue for a third month in July, other Unipec officials said late in April, as they expect Saudi prices to remain elevated. It is not clear if Unipec can cut the volumes by 40 percent without paying a penalty. Crude contracts with state-owned Saudi Aramco are normally done on a take-or-pay basis, with adjustments allowed only in a plus or minus 10 percent range. The supply cut for May-loading cargoes will coincide with planned refinery maintenance for Sinopec, but the Unipec official said all refineries will resume operations in July. “Peak turnarounds will be over by then so they are likely to need the crude, but if April imports also come in at around 9.4 million barrels per day, domestic crude stocks will also give them some buffer,” Michal Meidan, Energy Aspects analyst said. Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy said Sinopec’s imports from Saudi Arabia dropped to 730,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, from 845,000 bpd in the same period a year ago, while demand for Saudi oil from other Chinese state refiners grew by 73 percent or 120,000 bpd year-on-year. Companies that increased Saudi crude imports include PetroChina, CNOOC and China North Industries Group Corp (Norinco), which all brought new refining capacity online in the second half of 2017. “As China largest refiner and as its company profitability is heavily reliant on the refining segment, Sinopec is very sensitive to feedstock prices,” SIA Energy’s Seng Yick Tee said. The consultancy said Sinopec has also cut crude imports from Angola and Russia in the first quarter, probably because they were also overpriced. In contrast, Sinopec increased crude imports from the United States, Brazil, Iran, Colombia and Iraq, Tee said. “I think it’s not only an issue of crude economics (for Sinopec). If Saudi increases prices, other Middle East producers will follow,” said a Singapore-based oil trader. Saudi Aramco on Wednesday raised the June price for its Arab Light crude to Asia to a premium of $1.90 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, the highest level since August 2014. Saudi prices set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million bpd of oil bound for Asia."
3.9272103744248916," China's Sinopec posts best quarterly earnings in nearly 3 years BEIJING, April 26 (Reuters) - China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec) reported its best quarterly profit since June 2015 on strong earnings from its refining department and firmer crude oil prices. Net profit at Asia’s largest refiner grew 12.3 percent in the first three months versus the same year-go period to 19.31 billion yuan ($3.05 billion). This was up from 12.75 billion yuan in the fourth quarter when losses from operating its gas business crimped earnings, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday. Sinopec’s total revenue rose to 621.3 billion yuan in the January to March period, up 6.7 percent from the year earlier period. Higher processing margins have benefited both state-owned and private refiners and pushed the country’s refinery throughput to record high in March. Sinopec’s refinery throughput gained 2.1 percent from the first quarter last year at 60.16 million tonnes, or about 4.88 million barrels per day (bpd). The company might rake in less revenue from its refining business in the second quarter as its largest subsidiary plant Zhenhai is slated for a major overhaul from May. Sinopec reported realized natural gas prices at $6.28 per thousand cubic feet, up 25.6 percent from a year earlier. Realised crude oil prices were $59.8 a barrel, up 22 percent from a year earlier. The firm produced 71.35 million barrels of crude oil during the period, down one percent on year. Its natural gas production inched up 0.6 percent to 239.83 billion cubic feet.

3.9272103744248916," China's top refiners plan second-quarter maintenance, cast doubts on global oil optimism BEIJING (Reuters) - Some of China’s top refineries will shut in May and June for maintenance, cutting nationwide throughput by some 10 percent and dampening oil demand in the world’s largest crude importer after record run levels in March, according to a Reuters survey. At least six state-owned and private refiners are planning a full annual maintenance shutdown in the second quarter for 30 days or more, including China’s largest refiner Sinopec’s Zhenhai unit, a Reuters survey of 11 plants showed. [nB9N1P702P] A slowdown in China’s refining activity could result in lower Chinese imports of crude oil, which in turn could undercut a two-month price rally that has lifted crude to more than $75 a barrel for the first time in over three years. [O/R] Analysts and traders say imports may also be disrupted by a shutdown of major oil import hub Huangdao, part of Qingdao port in northern Shandong province, further crimping consumption. “If Shandong prepares to shut down the Huangdao port, crude arrivals could start dropping starting in late May,” said Emma Li, senior analyst at Thomson Reuters Oil Research. Port authorities declined to comment on what measures they might take ahead the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Qingdao in June. Qingdao is a major commodities port, and Beijing usually adopts tighter pollution controls and curbs shipping traffic for big events to ensure blue skies. In total, the six plants to be fully shutdown process around 1.09 million barrels per day (bpd), accounting for 10 percent of China’s average monthly crude runs, Reuters calculations based on refinery rates from China’s statistics bureau showed. The pace of outages due to maintenance is down from 1.26 million bpd in the same period last year, Reuters calculations also showed. [nL3N1GX1NC] But the actual volume of outages could grow as a flurry of independent refineries are considering undertaking maintenance in June and early July to avoid the potential pollution curbs. The early start could prolong China’s annual maintenance season. Independent refiners, often known as teapots, typically carry out their routine repairs later in the summer. “Usually the maintenance period falls in July and August, but this year we are planning one in June,” a crude purchasing manager with a Shandong-based refiner said. The outages and potential slowdown in demand will likely put brakes on China’s voracious appetite for crude oil as refineries have been churning out fuel at a record pace to take advantage of bumper profit margins. Trade data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows China will likely take in more than 9 million bpd of crude in April, its most ever. [nL8N1RW0F7] Some of those arrivals are spill-overs from March due to a backlog at Qingdao, Li said, and some private refiners might have already bought more to prepare for any disruption at the port. Crude arrivals in May 2017 fell more than 4 percent from April last year due to Chinese refiners’ maintenance plans. Further denting forward crude demand is that many of the teapot refiners, including Tianhong Chemical and Haiyou, will undertake maintenance this year. [nB9N1R5002] Shandong Haike Group will also close for the whole of June, an official at the plant told Reuters. And another ten private refiners will shut between April and June, data from energy consultancy JLC’s own survey showed. The 13 plants together have a total of 400,000 bpd in capacity. “We are seeing a drop ... for May crude cargoes from private refiners,” said Zhou Guoxia, a senior energy analyst at JLC."

The Unipec executives, who declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media, said the reductions in May followed state oil company Saudi Aramco's IPO-ARMO.SE decision to raise its official selling prices (OSP) for Arab Light crude which made the grade uncompetitive against other crudes. The unexpected price increase prompted some Asian refiners to trim imports and seek substitutes in the spot market. “Arab Light’s economics are not as good as oil from other Middle East producers. So our refineries have reduced their consumption and we will continue to cut,” one of the Unipec executives said. “We have cut imports in May and we plan to reduce (Saudi oil supply) in June and July,” he said, without indicating how much supplies will be cut. “There’s no reason to use the oil if the (Saudi) OSPs are high and economics do not improve.” Saudi Aramco did not respond to an e-mail from Reuters seeking comment on Sinopec’s cuts. Sinopec’s request for a 40 percent cut in their May Saudi crude imports also coincides with scheduled maintenance at its largest refinery. Still, the big supply cut raised eyebrows as Saudi Arabia only sells its oil through long-term contracts where the permitted change in the monthly contract volume is plus or minus 10 percent. This clause, known as operational tolerance, is to allow both parties to adjust volumes based on shipping conditions. “The 40 percent cut seems unprecedented. Cuts beyond the usual tolerance levels in crude oil sales contracts typically need to be agreed between buyer and seller in advance,” said Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co. Usually long-term buyers would consult with their suppliers if the monthly OSPs are “too high above” levels suggested by market fundamentals, said Doshi, a former Saudi Aramco executive. If credible, the buyer’s views would be incorporated into setting the OSPs for the following months in the interest of customer relations and to remain competitive, he said. The Unipec executives declined to elaborate on how the 40 percent cut would be implemented. Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the top oil supplier to China in 2017. Saudi Arabia remained the No. 2 supplier to China in the first quarter, although its exports were down 5.7 percent from a year ago.
