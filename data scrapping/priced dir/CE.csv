27.679201444750984," Celanese declares force majeure on product deliveries in Americas, EMEA Feb 18 (Reuters) - Chemicals maker Celanese Corp said on Thursday it is declaring force majeure on deliveries in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Asia (EMEA), citing impacts from severe weather conditions in Texas. A long list of companies around Texas and New Mexico have halted operations as they grapple with a rare deep freeze which has killed nearly two dozen people and knocked out power to millions. Celanese said its decision follows unplanned shutdowns and similar notices by its own suppliers and service providers in the Texas Gulf Coast. The chemicals company said sustained below freezing temperatures at the company’s and its partners’ plants have made Celanese unable to get natural gas, electricity, industrial gas, and other raw materials it needs to operate the facilities. The company added that it cannot give exact details or timing of the full impact to its customers due to the ‘rapidly developing’ nature of the situation, but it will notify them when production resumes.

34.270066384384194," EU fines ethylene cartel Orbia, Clariant, Celanese 260 million euros BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Eu antitrust regulators on Tuesday fined ethylene companies Orbia, Clariant CLN.S and Celanese CE.N 260 million euros ($295.5 million) for taking part in a cartel while Westlake WLK.N avoided a penalty as it alerted the cartel to the EU. The European Commission said the four companies took part in a cartel related to purchases on the ethylene merchant market by colluding to buy ethylene at the lowest possible price. “The four companies in the cartel have colluded and exchanged information on purchasing prices which is illegal,” EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The EU competition enforcer reduced the fines for the four companies by 10% because admitted to taking part in the cartel. However it also increased the penalties by 10% to avoid under-deterrence of such practices."
