16.053758383762844," Japan Tobacco to launch new heated tobacco device later this year Japan Tobacco Inc (JT) (2914.T) said on Tuesday it planned to cut around 1,000 jobs and focus its efforts on winning market share in heated tobacco devices, as it forecast an unexpected slump in profit this year. The company said it expects 2021 operating profit to fall 23% to 363 billion yen ($3.46 billion), compared with the market's forecast for a slight recovery to 476 billion yen, according to Refinitiv data. JT, despite commanding over half of the domestic cigarette market, has lagged rival Philip Morris in the increasingly popular category of heat-not-burn (HNB) cigarettes. The company said it was looking to cut around 1,000 jobs, offering voluntary and early retirement packages, citing declining sales of conventional cigarettes. At the same time, it said it will bolster investment in what it calls reduced risk products (RRP), including its heat-not-burn Ploom sticks which compete with Philip Morris' IQOS. It plans a new heat stick product later this year, aiming to boost its position in Japan, the world's biggest market for such products as regular e-cigarettes with liquid nicotine are banned. ""The RRP category in Japan is the most mature and competitive in the world,"" JT Group President and CEO Masamichi Terabatake said in a statement. ""Reflecting this and the decline of sales volume in recent years... we had to take some difficult yet necessary decisions.” ($1 = 104.7800 yen)"

17.269201445690445," Medicago to kick off large study of COVID-19 vaccine with GSK booster (Reuters) - A combination of Canadian drug developer Medicago’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine and a booster from Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline will enter a large study with more than 30,000 volunteers this year, the two companies said on Thursday. The news comes days after early-stage data showed Medicago’s plant-based vaccine candidate produced virus-fighting antibodies in all volunteers. Medicago, backed by cigarette maker Philip Morris International, is Canada’s most advanced COVID-19 vaccine project, but lags larger, global rivals. The mid-to-late-stage clinical studies will test the safety and immune response capabilities of a regimen involving two doses of the vaccine with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant given 21 days apart. Medicago has said a lower dose of the vaccine will be used for further trials, for which Dynavax Technologies’ adjuvant will not be used as before. “Proven dose sparing and a high immune response due to GSK’s adjuvant make us confident of delivering an efficacious vaccine with an acceptable safety profile in collaboration with Medicago,” said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer at GSK’s vaccines division. In study groups of adults under the age of 65, five in six participants will be given the vaccine at random, in the smaller, mid-level, Phase II stage, whereas in groups with volunteers aged 65 or more, two in three will receive the vaccine. Medicago’s vaccine uses a technology known as virus-like particles (VLP), which mimic the structure of the coronavirus, but contain no genetic material from it. Used to develop vaccines for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus, a VLP vaccine for COVID-19 from Medicago is the furthest along in testing. It will also be the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate to use GSK’s adjuvant in late-stage trials. The late-stage, Phase III part of the Medicago study will likely begin before the end of the year."

10.05516082148605," GSK to develop plant-based COVID-19 vaccine with Canada's Medicago (Reuters) - The world’s largest vaccine-maker GSK has put its vaccine booster technology to work in a potential new COVID-19 shot, to be developed with a Canadian biopharmaceutical company backed by tobacco company Philip Morris. Rather than developing its own vaccine in the global race to combat the pandemic, GSK has instead focused on contributing its adjuvant technology to at least seven other global companies, including Sanofi and China’s Clover. The latest deal, with Canadian firm Medicago, uses plant-based technology that differs from GSK’s other coronavirus-partnerships and boosts the London-listed company’s chances of finding a successful candidate and scaling production relatively quickly. There are no approved vaccines for the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, but 19 vaccines are being trialled in humans globally and some treatments, such as Gilead’s remdesivir, have been approved in certain regions. Medicago’s approach, already used in a flu vaccine awaiting Canadian approval, takes the leaves of a plant as bioreactors to produce one of the three spike proteins of the novel coronavirus, the S-spike, which can be then used in the vaccine with GSK’s adjuvant. GSK said on Tuesday the companies aimed to make their vaccine available in the first half of next year and produce about 100 million doses by the end of 2021. An early-stage human trial of three different dosage levels is expected to begin in mid-July. Adjuvants, or efficacy boosters, are added to some vaccines to increase the immune response with the aim of achieving more lasting immunity against an infection. Medicago, headquartered in Quebec City, Canada, is privately owned. PMI has a 33% stake, and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma holds the remainder. PMI has said it is evaluating options for its stake in Medicago. It was not immediately available for further comment."

-5.418672225138603," BAT files patent suits against Philip Morris' IQOS products (Reuters) - British American Tobacco said on Thursday that it sued Philip Morris International Inc in the United States and Germany, alleging that the tobacco heating technology used in its bigger rival’s IQOS devices infringed its patents. The Lucky Strike cigarette maker said it had filed two patent infringement claims in the United States against Philip Morris, one through the International Trade Commission (ITC) and one in the Virginia federal court, seeking remedies for damages caused and an injunction on importing the product. The lawsuits in Germany and the United States focus on the heating blade technology used in IQOS, which BAT said was an earlier version of the technology currently being used in its glo tobacco heating devices. BAT has laid out plans to launch glo range of products in Germany this year. “If we win we may be able to get an ITC exclusion order blocking the importation of IQOS into the U.S. by Philip Morris unless they agree to take a license to our patents,” BAT spokesman Will Hill said when contacted for comment. Philip Morris started selling IQOS in the United States last year. The device is also the only tobacco heating product to be approved for sale in the country. “We have seen media reports that BAT has filed legal actions but have not had the opportunity to evaluate its allegations. We can say, however, that we will vigorously defend ourselves,” Philip Morris said in a statement. The ITC and district court cases will run separately and the courts’ decisions are not dependent on one another, BAT said. Tobacco companies are spending billions of dollars to develop smokeless alternatives such as e-cigarettes and tobacco-heating devices as fewer people smoke traditional cigarettes. Unlike combustible cigarettes, IQOS devices heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper that generate an aerosol containing nicotine. They are also different from e-cigarettes such as Juul, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid. In the UK, the company said it was challenging the validity of a Philip Morris’ patent, in response to a lawsuit filed against BAT by the American company in Japan. BAT did not disclose the amount it was seeking in damages from all the cases. Shares of BAT, a FTSE-listed company, closed up about 3% on the London Stock Exchange. Philip Morris shares were up 2.5% at $76.52 the New York Stock Exchange."

20.069417091334458," Thai court fines Philip Morris $4 million for customs violations BANGKOK, March 20 (Reuters) - A Thai court on Friday fined the local unit of tobacco company Philip Morris 130 million baht ($4 million) for dodging tax on cigarette imports from Indonesia. The Thai public prosecutor filed charges in 2017 against Philip Morris Thailand and seven of its Thai employees for inaccurate price declarations of cigarettes imported from Indonesia between 2002 to 2003. The court on Friday dismissed all charges against the seven former employees. Philip Morris Thailand said it viewed the charge as a government move to protect state-controlled Thailand Tobacco Monopoly, and is planning to appeal the court’s decision. “We strongly disagree with today’s decision as the decision is contrary to domestic and international customs law,” said Gerald Margolis, a branch manager of Philip Morris Thailand. “We believe this case underscores the country’s disregard for the rules in international trade and is the latest in a line of cases against foreign companies that will have an impact on continued and new foreign investment,” he said. The ruling follows a court decision to fine the tobacco giant 1.2 billion baht ($40 million) last November for similar customs violations regarding cigarette imports from the Philippines. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled that Thailand had not met obligations under the Customs Valuation Agreement, regarding the valuation of cigarettes imported by Philip Morris Thailand from Philip Morris subsidiaries in the Philippines and Indonesia."

Philip Morris said Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer at France's Schneider Electric SCHN.PA, will take King's role as finance chief in May. IQOS, a ""reduced risk"" alternative to traditional cigarettes, was developed by Philip Morris and is sold in the United States through a partnership with U.S. Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc MO.N. The device is central to Philip Morris’ efforts to overhaul its image through initiatives like its “unsmoke” campaign, which promotes “smoke-free” alternatives like IQOS as a way to accelerate the shift away from cigarettes. However, the company’s marketing strategy for the device has drawn ire overseas for mimicking tobacco companies in the mid-20th century, when cigarettes were associated with Hollywood and high society."
-9.431700667359204," South African unit of Philip Morris welcomes tax stance on cigarette alternatives JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African unit of cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc PM.N welcomed the government's decision to introduce a lower excise tax on heated tobacco products than on regular cigarettes.   In his annual budget speech on Wednesday, Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni said, in line with Department of Health policy, his government will start taxing heated tobacco products such as hookah or “hubbly bubbly”. But he said the rate will be set at 75 per cent that of the tax on cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or so-called vapes, will only be taxed from 2021, Mboweni said. Philip Morris’ South Africa Managing Director, Marcelo Nico said on Thursday there was a growing body of evidence that regulating less harmful tobacco products differently to cigarettes can reduce smoking rates to the overall benefit of public health. “By creating this differentiation, Minister Mboweni and his team recognize the role that taxation can play in encouraging adult smokers to switch to less harmful tobacco products,” he said in an emailed statement. In July, Philip Morris opened its first flagship store in Johannesburg in an attempt to boost demand for its “reduced risk” heated-tobacco device IQOS. Rival British American tobacco BATS.LBTIJ.J, which is also striving for a bigger chunk of the global market for smoking alternatives as demand for traditional cigarettes continues to slide, recently acquired South African vapor maker Twisp. Vapour Products Association of South Africa (VPASA) has raised concerns about the excise for electronic vapor products, saying it will considerably increase the retail price of these electronic products, while at the same time hurting small to medium business owners. On Wednesday, the association, which represents manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of vapor products in South Africa, called for a moratorium period of three years to allow the electronic cigarettes industry to grow. On Thursday, the association’s chief executive Asanda Gcoyi said she was still concerned that the proposed legislation of tobacco and EVP will present a hindrance to the growth and opportunities the EVP industry is able to contribute to South Africa’s economy. Health concerns about vaping have grown despite evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers to quit, and have led to bans in some countries including India and Brazil."
-19.942061714651217," Inside the Philip Morris campaign to 'normalize' a tobacco device (Reuters) - At Germany’s Bambi Awards for the media industry in November, celebrities posed for red-carpet photos against a backdrop of established luxury brands. Alongside the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Swiss watchmaker Chopard was a newer name: IQOS, a “reduced risk” heated-tobacco device sold by cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc. Across Europe, Asia and South America, the tobacco firm has affixed the IQOS brand to music festivals and art exhibits. The company also markets through IQOS lounges at mountainside resorts in the Pyrenees and in fashionable neighborhoods of Rome. Throughout Europe, it has partnered with “IQOS friendly” bars and restaurants - closed to cigarettes but open to IQOS. Such promotions are part of a wide-ranging ""normalization"" strategy by Philip Morris PM.N to scrub its image as a purveyor of cancer-causing cigarettes and present its new smoking alternatives as youthful, upscale lifestyle products, according to a ten-month study by tobacco researchers at Stanford University, who shared it exclusively with Reuters before its release on Friday. The marketing strategy mimics that of tobacco companies in the mid-20th century, when they started associating cigarettes with Hollywood and high society. “Philip Morris, as a company name, is somewhat of a pariah,” said Robert Jackler, a professor who led the study and heads Stanford’s Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising. “IQOS is an attempt to sanitize their product line.” The Stanford researchers said their study was spurred in part by a May 2019 Reuters investigation that found Philip Morris had used young online personalities, including a 21-year-old woman in Russia, to promote IQOS. The company's internal marketing standards prohibit it from using youth-oriented celebrities or ""models who are or appear to be under the age of 25."" The Reuters report prompted the company to acknowledge it had violated its own policy and to suspend its use of social media influencers. The Stanford study found that, although the company suspended its “most visible” social-media influencer programs, IQOS marketing continues to stray substantially from its corporate standards on youth-oriented marketing. “Its use of youth-oriented social media channels, trendy pop music festivals and celebrity influencers are mis-aligned with their commitment to exclusive ‘adult smoker’ targeting,” the Stanford report concluded. (For the full report, see: here ) Philip Morris declined to answer detailed questions from Reuters on its IQOS marketing strategy and the Stanford findings, saying it did not have access to the full report. “However, we doubt that there is anything PMI could say or do that Dr. Jackler, and others who criticize our scientific commitment and smoke-free vision, would ever find satisfactory.” The IQOS device is central to the firm’s efforts to overhaul its image through such initiatives as its “unsmoke” campaign, which promotes such “smoke-free” alternatives as a way to accelerate the shift away from cigarettes. The device heats up but does not burn packages of ground-up tobacco, which resemble small cigarettes, to create a nicotine-filled aerosol that is similar to that produced by e-cigarettes, which heat flavored liquid nicotine. At this year’s Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland - a gathering of some of the world’s richest people - Philip Morris set up an “Unsmoke your mind” lounge, where panelists argued against regulations preventing “truth in marketing” by tobacco firms looking to promote smoking alternatives. IQOS is sold in about 50 countries, including the United States through a partnership with U.S. Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. The two companies pledged to regulators that they would market the device only to adult smokers, showing sample advertisements of adults conservatively dressed in business attire. But in other markets across the world, the Stanford study said, Philip Morris uses “coaches” and “ambassadors” to market IQOS. In Romania and Russia, employment agencies recruit attractive women as young as 19 to market IQOS, according to job postings mentioned in the Stanford report and reviewed by Reuters. Instagram postings for Be Like Me, a Romanian marketing agency, show young women posing with the IQOS device in recent months, often wearing robe-like uniforms in malls. The Instagram account for RBT Group, a staffing agency in Russia that markets IQOS, similarly shows photos of attractive young women in front of IQOS signs or posing with other “coaches.” Be Like Me and RBT Group could not be reached for comment. Other Instagram accounts with the “IQOS” name, including one called “iqostyle.arm,” based in Armenia, continue to show young women posing with the IQOS in what appear to be professional photographs. One photo on that account from last July - two months after Philip Morris said it had suspended all influencer marketing - showed Nika Shuvalova, a 22-year-old Ukrainian model, posing in a swimsuit on a boat with an IQOS. Shuvalova could not be reached for comment. A message sent to the “iqostyle.arm” Instagram account was returned by someone calling themselves Tiko, who said the IQOS postings were a “hobby” and that he had not been paid by Philip Morris. BIG BET ON IQOS AND ‘NORMALIZATION’ The stakes for Philip Morris are huge: The company invested $6 billion in developing “smoke-free” products such as IQOS in hopes of staving off a trend of declining global cigarette sales. In 2018, company CEO Andre Calantzopoulos told shareholders that it hoped to receive about 40% of its revenue - nearly $20 billion - from “reduced risk” products by 2025. Internal Philip Morris documents underscore the importance of its larger strategy: “Make ‘normalization’ a PMI priority and imbed this mindset into the organization,” read an internal company document from 2014, reviewed by Reuters as part of a 2017 investigation. The document also cited “the threats posed by PMI/industry de-normalization” - such as lobbying bans and exclusions from international treaties and trade agreements - “and the need to reverse this trend to drive future growth.” The Stanford researchers pointed to wide-ranging company efforts to associate IQOS with fashion, art and popular culture in a way that cigarette brands such as Marlboro have been unable to do, given changing social attitudes and laws around the world that prohibit such advertising and promotions. IQOS has been present at events such as Germany’s Bambi Awards - which honor stars in TV and film, sports, art and music - as well as that country’s Playboy Playmate of the Year Awards. Philip Morris worked with British sculptor Alex Chinneck on a dramatic installation at the 2019 Milan Design Week. The work depicted the facade of an old, two-story building being unzipped like a pair of jeans - meant to signify the IQOS “notion of opening the future,” the sculptor said in an interview with FAD magazine. A representative of Chinneck confirmed the partnership. The company also worked with distinguished industrial designer Karim Rashid to create an installation at the previous year’s Milan Design Week. In an interview with website fashionrepublik.com, Rashid described his installation, showing two faces meeting one another, as similar to the IQOS, which he called “an intimate device that speaks to forward-thinking and original expression.” A representative of Rashid said he was unavailable for an interview on Thursday. The company has also sought to distinguish IQOS from smoking through partnerships with restaurants, bars and salons who designate themselves as “IQOS friendly” spaces, where cigarettes are banned but the IQOS device is allowed. The Stanford researchers found evidence of hundreds of “IQOS friendly” establishments in places such as the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Romania and Japan. Philip Morris did not respond to questions about its business relationships with the establishments that promote the device and display its branding. The Stanford researchers and other experts say such policies undermine public smoking laws and encourage dual use of cigarettes and alternative devices. Many users will continue smoking outdoors, but turn to e-cigarettes or IQOS where they are permitted indoors. Such switching can “deepen nicotine addiction and make cessation less probable,” the Stanford report said. The brand also had a presence at a Tel Aviv University student music festival last year - where the minimum age for entrance was 16, and where a video showed young IQOS staff at a pop-up booth. At a launch party for IQOS in Albania last year, a performer in an elaborate white sequined dress did an interpretive dance on stage with an IQOS, while another performer attached to wires performed acrobatic moves in the air while playing a violin. “They’re trying very hard to resurrect the glory era of smoking, where it was glamorous and sophisticated and stylish,” Jackler said. “It’s about associating it with all the good things in life.”"

-4.810258292448596," Philip Morris' life insurer Reviti looks to Japan's vaping market (Reuters) - Philip Morris' PM.N new UK life insurer, Reviti, is looking to take its ""get a discount if you vape"" model to Japan, where the tobacco giant has a more than 70% share of the heat-not-burn market. Reviti Chief Executive Dan Pender told Reuters that the insurer was spending time looking at the Japanese market because it has a significant number of people who smoke and boasts many vaping products. “We think the Reviti proposition would work extremely well for Japanese consumers,” he said. Most insurers have long treated smokers and vapers the same, meaning they can pay close to double the premiums of non-smokers. Reviti, however, offers a discount of up to 15% for vapers in Britain. Customers who quit tobacco and nicotine altogether get a discount of up to 50%. Pender said the insurer was working with a number of established Japanese insurers and looking at how to launch. Philip Morris’ iQOS heat-not-burn product dominates Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for the vaping industry, offering opportunities for the start-up insurer to grow. British American Tobacco BATS.L has said it would launch two new tobacco heating products in Japan. Pender said Reviti could disrupt the market in Japan, where most life insurers work on aggregate rates, meaning they do not distinguish between smokers and non-smokers in terms of prices. “If you’ve got somebody who is a heavy smoker and they say I kind of know smoking is bad for me, but my insurance premium is the same for someone who doesn’t smoke, explain that to me,” he said. Reviti’s move to Japan comes as deaths in the United States from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping have risen to 52. Health concerns about vaping have grown despite evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers to quit, and have led to bans in some countries including India and Brazil."

The Thai public prosecutor filed charges in 2016 against Philip Morris Thailand and seven of its Thai employees, alleging under-reporting of the value of more than 270 entries of imported cigarettes from the Philippines between 2003 and 2006 which led to a revenue losses of more than 306 million baht. “I’m very happy for the employees that were completely acquitted in this case,” said Gerald Margolis, branch manager of Philip Morris Thailand. “However, we strongly but respectfully disagree with this decision and we’ll promptly appeal,” he said, adding that the company has complied with local laws and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The Philippines went to the WTO in 2008 to complain that Thailand was illegally discriminating against imports to protect its state-controlled Thailand Tobacco Monopoly. A 2010 WTO said that Thailand had no grounds to reject the import price of cigarettes from the Philippines. The Philippines has said that a series of domestic taxation and customs valuations by Thailand that started in 2006 undermined the competitiveness of its cigarettes against those produced by the state-controlled Thailand Tobacco Monopoly."

But the company said fewer-than-expected people were trying out and switching to its “heat not burn” Ploom S cigarettes, which compete with Philip Morris’ more popular IQOS products."
7.9502868485598235," Breakingviews - Smokeless tobacco yet to set Philip Morris alight NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - With the world turning against smokers, Philip Morris International hopes its new cigarette substitute IQOS will bring back the spark. Investors in the $126 billion Marlboro maker aren’t buying it. PMI’s main product will, statistically, kill half its customers. So the company wants to convert smokers to devices that heat rather than burn tobacco, which it says are safer. These are still a fairly small source of sales – they accounted for under 18% of net revenue, which excludes sales incentives and excise tax, in the third quarter of 2019. But the business is growing rapidly, while cigarettes are in decline. Imagine IQOS takes off. A Breakingviews interactive calculator lays out what would happen if PMI can achieve roughly the same annual revenue from smokeless products a decade from now that it makes from old-school products today, around $25 billion. Assume by then IQOS and other devices make a 40% EBITDA margin, similar to regular cigarettes, and that PMI spends the equivalent of around 4% of revenue on capital expenditure. Using a discounted cash flow valuation, smokeless smokes could be worth $67 billion today. PMI’s current valuation doesn’t factor in anything like that. The cigarette enterprise is probably worth 12 times EBITDA, roughly where the company has traded for the past few years, giving it a value of $115 billion today, or $88 billion in equity value after deducting net debt. The implication is shareholders are valuing PMI’s smokeless products at only about $38 billion, only just over half Breakingviews’ valuation. Why so skeptical? IQOS only started limited U.S. sales this month. Moreover, liquid-based vaping products like those sold by Altria-backed Juul Labs have been linked to lung injuries that have killed 33 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. IQOS isn’t vaping, so it might win customers from Juul. Or the two might get lumped together despite their differences. Philip Morris has learned from some of Juul’s mistakes, eschewing fruity flavors. And IQOS has marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will want to know the product isn’t targeting teenagers. That means it may not have Juul’s breakneck adoption rates. For shareholders that could be a bonus, because it might also mean PMI avoids incinerating its market before it has even begun."

Democratic lawmakers late Tuesday moved to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, and indexes weakened briefly early in the day after the White House released a summary of a telephone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The Ukrainian president said he was not pushed by Trump to investigate a political rival. Helping sentiment, data showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August, a sign that the struggling housing market was starting to get a lift from lower borrowing rates. “Good economic data is fighting with political noise and good data is winning,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Adding to bullish sentiment, Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected, comments that were in contrast to his harsh rhetoric on Tuesday on the dispute. Nike Inc shares jumped 4.2% after the company’s first-quarter results beat market expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 170.69 points, or 0.64%, to 26,978.46, the S&P 500 gained 18.76 points, or 0.63%, to 2,985.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 86.81 points, or 1.09%, to 8,080.44. Also on the trade front, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced initial details of an emerging trade deal between the two countries, with Trump saying it would open up Japanese markets to $7 billion worth of American products. Shares in Philip Morris surged 6.1% after the tobacco company called off merger talks with Altria Group Inc and said it would instead focus on the U.S. launch of its tobacco-heating product, iQOS. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.60-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 95 new lows.

14.292201093191903," BAT launches more vaping products in Japan to take on Philip Morris (Reuters) - British American Tobacco BATS.L said it would launch two new tobacco heating products in Japan under its glo brand, as it seeks to close the gap with market leader Philip Morris International Inc PM.N in the country's fast-growing vaping industry. The new products, glo pro and glo nano, come with new heating technologies and slimmer sizes and will be available in Japan from October, the company said, a month after it launched another product - glo sens - in Tokyo. The glo brand was introduced in Japan in 2016. The introduction of these vaping devices, known as “heat-not-burn” products, is part of new Chief Executive Jack Bowles’ plan to slim down the company’s “new categories” business to just three brands, including glo. Unlike combustible cigarettes, heat-not-burn products heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid. Philip Morris leads the heat-not-burn (HNB) market with its iQOS product in Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for vaping products since e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country’s pharmaceutical regulation. According to analysts at Nomura, the HNB market nearly doubled in Japan in 2018 from the year earlier, with iQOS commanding a 71.8% share of the market, followed by BAT's glo products with 20.1%. Local player Japan Tobacco Inc's 2914.T Ploom TECH comes third with 8.1%. The urgency for BAT to strengthen its business in Japan comes on the heels of Philip Morris’ announcement last week that it was in talks to merge with Altria, which has a stake in U.S. e-cigarette market leader Juul. Analysts have said their proposed combination could create a company with the scale and resources to dominate the e-cigarette market."

16.93505392851419," Philip Morris and Altria in merger talks as Marlboro fades and e-cigs light up (Reuters) - Marlboro maker Philip Morris International Inc PM.N said on Tuesday it was in talks to reunite in a merger with Altria Group Inc MO.N following its 2008 spin-off, as the tobacco giants seek to pool resources in the fast growing e-cigarette market. The merger between the two companies, the biggest ever in the consumer sector and the fourth-largest deal of all time, would create a tobacco giant with a market capitalization of approximately $200 billion. It would come two years after British American Tobacco Plc BATS.L bought out Reynolds American Inc for $49 billion, underscoring how the decline in cigarette smoking globally is pushing tobacco companies to seek scale and pool resources in their development of alternative products. Under the terms of the all-stock merger being discussed, Altria shareholders would receive no premium and own between 41% to 42% of the combined company, with Philip Morris shareholders owning the remainder, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the details publicly. The board of the combined company would be split evenly between Philip Morris and Altria directors, the source said. If the deal negotiations prove successful, an agreement could be reached by the end of September, the source added. The two U.S.-headquartered companies separated 11 years ago to focus on different geographic markets, at a time when tobacco stocks generated steady yields. Since then, the industry has been disrupted by a move away from traditional smoking into e-cigarettes and vaping. The two have responded with new offerings. Philip Morris, which operates outside the United States, has developed a heated tobacco product called iQOS. Altria, which operates in the United States and still sells Marlboro in the country, acquired a 35% stake in vaping company Juul Labs Inc last year for $12.8 billion. Some analysts and investors fretted that the lack of geographic overlap between the two companies could limit the value of operational synergies. Philip Morris and Altria shares ended trading on Tuesday down 7.8% and 4%, respectively, giving the companies market capitalizations of $112 billion and $84.5 billion. “There currently is no overlap in operations of both companies other than the IQOS licensing agreement in the U.S. As such there would be little in the way of cost synergies other than corporate overheads and better leafbuying power,” Jefferies analysts said in a research note. Philip Morris and Altria see scope in consolidating their manufacturing operations to generate annual synergies of more than $800 million, according to the source. Industry-wide cigarette sales volumes tumbled 4.5% on an adjusted basis in 2018, according to analysts at Cowen. Global sales of cigarettes were estimated at $714 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International. GRAPHIC: Market Shares of Tobacco Companies Worldwide - In contrast, the e-cigarette market was worth about $11 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at more than 8% annually over the next five years, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence. In April, Philip Morris won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell iQOS in the United States. “With disruption facing the world of tobacco, we can see some merit in a re-merger,” Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott said in a note. “The combined entity - Philip Morris 2.0 - could present a united front” on next-generation products such as iQOS, and “go about a coordinated global brand-building exercise the same way Philip Morris originally built Marlboro.” Unlike combustible cigarettes, iQOS devices heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, generating an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid. Altria already can market iQOS in the United States under a licensing agreement, which includes royalty payments to Philip Morris. A merger between the two companies would simplify that agreement. The source close to the deal talks said the merger negotiations started as an extension of this partnership. At the same time, Altria could tap into Philip Morris’ global sales force to aid in Juul’s international expansion. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said a deal would create the leading global nicotine company by improving cash flow and accelerating the worldwide rollout of Juul and iQOS. Philip Morris has annual revenue of nearly $30 billion, while Altria generated about $20 billion last year. Both companies said there could be no assurance a deal would be reached. Any deal would need to be approved by the companies’ respective boards and shareholders."

-4.343614367645407," Under fire, Swiss minister dumps Philip Morris as Expo sponsor ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland scrapped a 1.8 million Swiss franc ($1.8 million) sponsorship deal with Philip Morris International PM.N for the country's pavilion at Expo 2020 in Dubai after being widely criticized for taking tobacco money to promote its image abroad. Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis made the decision so as “not to undermine the primary objective of the Swiss presence in Dubai, which is to convey a positive image of Switzerland”, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. “After examining the case, he decided that the work on this sponsorship should not be continued.” The World Health Organization (WHO) had criticized the deal for violating agreements it had struck over Expo sponsorships. Eight Swiss universities offering health education also told Cassis, a medical doctor, in a letter last week that taking money from a cigarette maker contradicted ethical principles. Cassis has ordered revisions to the ministry’s sponsorship policy by the end of the year to prevent similar situations from re-occurring. Philip Morris, which during the controversy had emphasized its efforts to promote heated tobacco products as an alternative to traditional smoking, said it was disappointed. “We regret not only this decision, but also the circumstance that the foreign minister was brought into this position by activists and organizations, especially since these actors say they want to end smoking but apparently don’t have any interest in an open dialogue about grounded science, innovation and better alternatives for smokers,” it said in a statement. The WHO, in a report on the global tobacco epidemic, said last week that e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products were not helping fight cancer. The Geneva-based group said Philip Morris’s “Unsmoke” campaign aimed to ensure tobacco remained socially acceptable, while confusing consumers about products with toxic emissions and unknown health effects."
-2.681091948760308," Philip Morris launches first Africa store to spark alternative cigarettes demand JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African unit of cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc PM.N opened its first flagship store in Johannesburg on Thursday, as it tries to grow demand in Africa for its alternative heated tobacco product IQOS. The store in Sandton gives Philip Morris access to tourists and business people from Africa who frequent Africa’s richest square mile, allowing it to use its retail footprint as a springboard to expand in the rest of the continent. “If you look at Sandton, it’s the business hub of South Africa and Africa as well so it’s the one place where we need to start with our permanent flagship store,” Philip Morris South Africa Managing Director Marcelo Nico told Reuters at the sidelines of the launch. South Africa is the first and only market in Africa where Philip Morris sells IQOS, an acronym for “I quit ordinary smoking,” which the company says contains up to 95% fewer toxic compounds than regular cigarettes. “We are bringing the first experience of commercializing this technology on the African continent and the objective is, based on this experience over time, roll it out in the rest of the continent,” Nico said. Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, launched a pilot store in Cape Town in late 2017, which operated for about a year, to test the market’s appetite, Nico said. Over time it plans to return to Cape Town with a permanent store. The firm began selling IQOS in 2017 in South Africa with the affordable 2.4 model and later launched the IQOS 3 and MULTI in November last year. Unlike traditional smoked cigarettes, IQOS devices electronically heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper just enough to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid. The 160 square meter (1,722 square foot) store’s interior is minimalistic with lounge couches, bright lighting and an information section, where consumers are shown the different effects of burnt cigarettes and IQOS through a machine that emits a white cloudy smoke for IQOS and brownish smoke for normal cigarettes. Consumers can also hold their phones up to the large picture displays in the store in order to get detailed information, demonstrations and videos about the product. An estimated 70% of South African adults who have switched to the product since the launch have converted fully to IQOS, the company said in 2018. One such adult is 33-year-old Evans Manyonga, who started using IQOS two years ago because he was “coughing a lot” from cigarettes and has since converted two of his friends. “I don’t smell of cigarettes. I don’t cough. It’s smoother and classier,” Manyonga, who has been smoking for 10 years, told Reuters at the store’s opening. Neil Borthwick, who was trying IQOS for the first time at the launch, said, “you can smoke it anywhere without smoke or ash and it gives you that same satisfaction that you have with a normal cigarette.”"
1.4562929075763964," India asks its states not to partner with Philip Morris-funded foundation NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's health ministry has asked all state governments in the country not to partner with the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (FSFW) because of its links to tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc PM.N, a letter seen by Reuters showed. Established in 2017, the FSFW focuses on eliminating usage of cigarettes and works toward smoking cessation using new technologies and alternative products. It says it works independently, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there are “clear conflicts” due to the $80 million in annual funding the foundation receives from Philip Morris. At least three Indian anti-tobacco groups earlier this year wrote to the federal health ministry in New Delhi calling for the rejection of any possible partnerships with FSFW, according to copies of their representations seen by Reuters. India’s federal health ministry has sent a letter, dated June 24, to chief secretaries of all states, saying they should not partner with FSFW and also advise other departments and institutions in their region accordingly. The ministry said Philip Morris was funding FSFW as well as manufacturing and promoting harm-reduction smoking devices. Reuters has previously reported Philip Morris has plans to launch its iQOS smoking device in India which it says is less harmful than conventional cigarettes. “Any collaboration with the Foundation for a Smoke Free World should be avoided in the larger interest of Public Health,” senior health ministry official, Sanjeeva Kumar, wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. The Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which is led by former WHO official Dr. Derek Yach, said it “operates with complete independence from Philip Morris” and was committed to full transparency about who its funders were. Philip Morris, which has a stated longer-term vision to replace cigarette sales with products such as its iQOS device, in a statement said FSFW was “an independent body governed by its own independent Board of Directors”. In recent years, the Indian government has intensified its tobacco-control efforts, raising cigarette taxes and ordering companies to print bigger health warnings on cigarette packs. India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, and more than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses. A federal health ministry official said on Sunday the letter on FSFW had been sent as a preventive measure to dissuade states from any collaboration with the foundation, and similar instructions were likely to be sent to other federal ministries. The FSFW said there were no projects with any state government institutions in India. “We seek partnerships with all who share our goal to end smoking in the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. In May, FSFW said its team was committed to working with others “to accelerate an end to smoking in this generation” in India. It also invited people to study its strategic plan. That same month, Philip Morris in a press statement said it had urged the Indian government to create a regulatory environment for devices such as its iQOS. When the FSFW was launched in 2017, the WHO had said it will not partner with the foundation and asked governments around the world and public health communities to follow the agency’s lead.

The office, known as the AGU, announced the landmark lawsuit late on Tuesday against the two multinational companies and their Brazilian subsidiaries. The legal action seeks to recover the cost to Brazil’s public health system for the treatment of patients for 26 illnesses related to smoking tobacco or coming into contact with cigarette smoke, the AGU said in a statement. The value of the costs the government seeks to recover will be calculated at a later date, should it win the lawsuit filed in the southern city of Porto Alegre, the AGU said. “Since the profit from this business is sent abroad, it is fair that these multinational companies pay for this responsibility they have left to Brazilian society,” prosecutor Davi Bressler said in the statement. The AGU said the companies through their subsidiaries, Souza Cruz Ltda, Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda and Philip Morris Brasil SA, produce about 90 percent of the cigarettes sold in Brazil. The lawsuit was heralded as historic by groups that advocate in favor of reducing tobacco consumption. “The suit is the first of its kind for Brazil and a significant step toward holding the two major tobacco companies who do business in Brazil and their parent companies responsible for the enormous financial and health burdens caused by tobacco use,” the Washington-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said. Despite the advancements in tobacco control policies in Brazil, tobacco remains the country’s leading cause of preventable death, the group said in a statement.

-1.083860859514349," Exclusive: Philip Morris suspends social media campaign after Reuters exposes young 'influencers' (Reuters) - Cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc has suspended a global social media marketing campaign in response to Reuters inquiries into the company’s use of young online personalities to sell its new “heated tobacco” device, including a 21-year-old woman in Russia. The company’s internal “marketing standards” prohibit it from promoting tobacco products with youth-oriented celebrities or “models who are or appear to be under the age of 25.” The company told Reuters of the decision late Friday, saying it had launched an internal investigation into marketing posts and photographs that Reuters sent to the company for comment earlier this week. They included a paid post plugging the tobacco product by social media “influencer” Alina Tapilina in Moscow - who listed her age as 21 on Instagram - alongside often seductive photos of herself drinking wine, swimming and posing with little clothing in luxurious settings. “We have taken the decision to suspend all of our product-related digital influencer actions globally,” the company told Reuters. “Whilst the influencer in question is a legal age adult smoker, she is under 25 and our guidance called for influencers to be 25+ years of age. This was a clear breach of that guidance.” “No laws were broken,” the company told Reuters. “However, we set high standards for ourselves and these facts do not excuse our failure to meet those standards in this instance.” The company added: “We were deeply disappointed to discover this breach and are grateful that it was brought to our attention.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month decided it would allow sales of the IQOS device in the United States after a two-year review process in which Philip Morris repeatedly assured the regulator that it would warn young people away from the product. The FDA declined to comment Friday evening on Philip Morris’s decision to suspend the marketing campaign. The agency earlier said it would “keep a close watch on ... how the company is marketing its products.” While most of the social media influencers hired by Philip Morris overseas did not list their ages on Instagram, a Reuters review of the firm’s social media marketing of IQOS in Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Russia and Romania shows that Tapilina’s online persona was typical of what the company called its social media “ambassadors” for the device - rail-thin young women who revel in the high life. The company did not directly respond to additional questions Friday night regarding the intended audience for its digital influencer campaigns. Many of the messages contained the hashtag “#IQOSambassador,” tying them into a network of social media influencers that the international tobacco giant has relied on to brand the IQOS as a safer alternative to cigarettes and a sexy fashion accessory. “I finally have the new IQOS 3, and I can confidently say yes to change … the level of harmful substances is on average about 90 percent lower than in smoke,” Tapilina wrote in an April post. “You haven’t yet switched to IQOS?” One Romanian IQOS marketer is 25 years old, according to a separate actress biography, but did not list her age on Instagram. Tapilina and nine other IQOS marketers did not respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris, in its statement to Reuters, said its suspension of the social marketing campaign is “concrete proof” of its “conviction to achieve a smoke-free world through socially responsible practices.” Matthew Myers, president of The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, had a different take upon hearing of the suspension Friday night. The advocacy group collected some of the IQOS marketing images reviewed by Reuters. Philip Morris, he said, “is changing their behavior only when caught red-handed.” The company, Myers said, has historically been “the single most successful across the globe in making cigarettes fashionable to young people.” Over the past year, Philip Morris has increasingly publicized its “mission” to prevent young people from using tobacco products. Last month, it issued a release calling on “all tobacco and e-cigarette companies to do their part to guard against youth nicotine use.” “Let me be clear: We at Philip Morris International do not, and will not, market or sell our products to youth,” CEO André Calantzopoulos said during a speech in Boston earlier this month. “For Philip Morris International, age matters.” When Philip Morris submitted marketing plans with an FDA application for IQOS in 2017, its sample advertisements featured models appearing at least a decade older and wearing modest, professional clothes. That application, which is still pending before the FDA, seeks approval to market the IQOS as less harmful than smoking and outlines company plans to ensure it doesn’t market the device to “non-intended audiences.” The device heats up but does not burn packages of ground-up tobacco, which resemble small cigarettes, to create a nicotine-filled aerosol. In Japan, the intended audience for IQOS marketing includes the Instagram followers of Ayame Tachibana, a 27-year-old DJ and model. In one post, she shows off a Valentine’s Day message for the IQOS device, lovingly scrawled with multicolored pens. “Happy Valentine IQOS. Love you sooo much!” reads the Instagram post from February. Alina Eremia, a Romanian actress and singer, holds a gold-colored IQOS in front of a Christmas tree. “My list of resolutions contains 95% fewer moments without a smile,” says Eremia, who is 25 according to her actress biography on multiple movie and celebrity information websites. Philip Morris says the IQOS - an acronym for “I quit ordinary smoking” – contains up to 95 percent fewer toxic compounds than cigarettes. Vlad Parvulescu, a manager for Eremia, confirmed she had been hired to promote IQOS and said she had been contacted by a Romanian public relations agency. He did not respond to additional questions about the financial arrangement. Marketing deals between companies and social media influencers vary widely, according to industry experts. But typically a company will work through third-party public relations or advertising firms that have relationships with online personalities. Compensation typically ranges from $20 to $25,000 or more for each post. Corporations have become increasingly sophisticated in how they approach their social media campaigns in the past two years, said Joe Gagliese, co-founder of Viral Nation, a marketing and talent agency that works with influencers. He once had to explain the basic concept of an “influencer” in pitch meetings. Now, companies approach him with “tailor-made decision briefs saying, ‘this is exactly what we want.’” Reuters reviewed dozens of social media posts featuring the IQOS device. Many included hashtags such as #IQOSAmbassador, #paidad, and #notriskfree, indicating that they are IQOS marketing posts. Many of the Instagram influencers featuring the products had tens of thousands of followers, and a few had more than a million. Devices such as IQOS and Juul hold potential as a way for cigarette smokers to transition to less harmful nicotine products, but some public health advocates worry the sleek new devices are addicting young people who would have never smoked cigarettes. Among traditional cigarette smokers, 90 percent start smoking before the age of 18, according to federal data. Philip Morris said there have been “no reports” of “worrisome levels” of unintended use of IQOS. As part of the FDA review process, Philip Morris pledged to market only to adult cigarette smokers once it begins selling IQOS this summer through a partnership with Altria Group Inc, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the U.S. IQOS delivers about the same level of nicotine as a traditional cigarette. Altria did not respond to requests for comment. Social media marketing has become a flashpoint in the debate over regulation of tobacco products, particularly the newest generation of products such as the wildly popular Juul e-cigarettes. Some of Juul’s early social media and YouTube marketing included images of attractive young people, particularly at a 2015 product launch party. Twitter images from that time on Juul’s official account featured sensual images of a young woman breathing out Juul vapor in a group, next to the slogan, “Share a #Juulmoment.” Those early campaigns sparked an explosion of video and photo posts from young people showing themselves using the product at school or with friends, often under the hashtags #doit4juul or #juullife. Juul Labs Inc has since said it stopped using social media influencers and requires anyone in its ads to be a former cigarette smoker older than 35. Juul Labs Inc said in a statement it recognizes that “some of our earliest marketing initiatives did not fully reflect the goal of our company,” which it describes as helping cigarette smokers transition to its products. “As a young company, we learned from our experiences and instituted changes to help ensure that we are only reaching current adult smokers,” the company said. U.S. laws governing tobacco advertising - which is banned on radio and television - were drawn up long before social media and digital advertising became a dominant force in consumer marketing. Although no current state or federal law restricts tobacco advertising on the Internet - including for e-cigarettes and devices such as IQOS - the FDA can use its authority over new devices to assert sweeping control over a company’s marketing. As a condition for allowing the device to be sold, the FDA is requiring Philip Morris to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches through digital advertising. Philip Morris is also required to submit any new advertising campaigns, including digital and social media efforts, to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them. Any paid influencers promoting the product also must disclose “any relationships between you and entities that create labeling for, advertise, market, and/or promote the products, on your behalf, or at your direction.” Those rules aim to restrict youth access to tobacco marketing, the FDA said in a statement, “especially in shared digital properties such as social media sites.”"
-2.4309024493235505," FDA permits sale of Philip Morris IQOS tobacco-heating alternative to cigarettes (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it would allow Philip Morris to sell a heated tobacco product called IQOS in the United States, a major victory for the international tobacco giant as it looks to sell more alternatives to traditional cigarettes. Following a review of about two years, the FDA determined that authorizing the device for sale in the U.S. market was “appropriate for the protection of public health” because the products produce “fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes.” Unlike combustible cigarettes, the IQOS devices heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, which generates an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid. The FDA’s move is certain to add fuel to a growing debate among public health advocates on whether such smoking alternatives shift lifelong smokers to less harmful products or risk addicting a new generation to nicotine. E-cigarette use among middle- and high-school students surged last year, according to federal data, sparking a crackdown on the device makers by the FDA. Altria Group Inc, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, will market IQOS devices as part of a licensing agreement with Philip Morris International. Altria Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Willard said the IQOS will first be introduced in the Atlanta area, through an IQOS-branded store and other convenience store outlets such as Cirle K. The products will be sold in Marlboro and Marlboro menthol flavored varieties. The move gives Altria yet another stake in a product designed as an alternative to traditional cigarettes, following its $12.8 billion deal in December to take a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc. Unlike the Juul, where users insert a pre-filled, flavored nicotine cartridge into a device resembling a USB, IQOS users insert what looks like a miniature cigarette into the end of a device, which heats the tobacco for inhalation. André Calantzopoulos, CEO of Philip Morris International, called the FDA announcement a milestone. “All of us at PMI are determined to replace cigarettes with smoke-free alternatives that combine sophisticated technology and intensive scientific validation,” he said. While Tuesday’s FDA decision allows Philip Morris to sell IQOS products, they must carry similar warning labels as traditional cigarettes and are subject to the same restrictions on television, radio and print advertising. The FDA also placed restrictions on how the products can be marketed on the internet and through social media. The FDA is still reviewing the company’s request to make claims that the products pose less of a health risk than cigarettes. IQOS is currently available in Japan, South Korea, and throughout much of Europe. Tuesday’s announcement by the FDA opens a huge market for the devices and the decision is likely to be cited by health regulators in other countries as Philip Morris expands distribution. Japan was one of the first markets where Philip Morris introduced IQOS, and it remains one of the most popular markets for the devices. E-cigarettes using liquid nicotine are not allowed in Japan, meaning heat-not-burn devices such as IQOS have less competition from vaping devices. Philip Morris International has made the IQOS a centerpiece of what it is calling its “smoke-free future” initiative, which the company has promoted heavily in full-page newspaper advertisements in the United States and across the world. Company executives have promoted the idea that non-combustible products such as IQOS will replace cigarettes and that the company is well positioned to help smokers switch to less harmful products. Anti-smoking and public health advocates have criticized the campaign, asking why the company does not stop selling cigarettes altogether. Last year Philip Morris International derived about 14 percent of its annual revenue from “reduced-risk products” such as IQOS. In its review of the IQOS product, the FDA found that Philip Morris’ studies “do not demonstrate reduction in long-term disease risks,” but found that smokers who switch completely to the IQOS “will have reduced toxic exposures and this is likely to lead to less risk of tobacco-related diseases.” The FDA’s review found that current cigarette smokers were the “most likely” group to use IQOS. The agency noted there was limited research on youth use of IQOS, but that data in Italy and Japan found “low uptake by youth and current non-smokers.”"

The company said it would deconsolidate RBH from its financial statements, and it cut its full-year 2019 diluted earnings per share forecast to at least $4.90 at prevailing exchange rates, from at least $5.28 in the forecast it made on March 4, shortly after the ruling in Quebec. The Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld the bulk of a 2015 decision that awarded about C$15 billion ($11.19 billion) to smokers in the Canadian province, a blow to several big tobacco companies, including RBH. Some observers criticized the creditor protection calling it an attempt to avoid making payments. “The company’s strategy is to obtain a sweetheart settlement of all tobacco lawsuits in Canada, and then to carry on business as normal”, said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst from the Canadian Cancer Society. “The company is highly profitable and is not anywhere close to bankruptcy.” On an adjusted basis, the current forecast for full-year 2019 represents earnings per share growth of at least 8 percent over last year, the Marlboro cigarette maker said. The deconsolidation, which will not have an impact on the company’s current annualized dividend rate, will result in an estimated one-time non-cash charge of about $0.10 per share, it said. The operating cash flow for full-year 2019 is now estimated to be about $9.5 billion, down from “at least $10 billion” in the forecast it made on Feb. 7. The creditor protection process, granted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, will allow RBH to carry on its business in the ordinary course, Philip Morris added."

The British team’s decision follows that of Ferrari to drop Philip Morris branding for their “Mission Winnow” initiative at Albert Park, citing problems with Australia’s health authorities McLaren announced a “global partnership” with BAT last month, which included having BAT’s “A Better Tomorrow” branding on cars and drivers’ overalls. BAT said last month the branding focused on its “commitment ... to providing less risky tobacco and nicotine choices”. A McLaren spokesman said in an email to Reuters on Thursday: “So BAT decided in advance not to brand the car or team with A Better Tomorrow but instead pass their branding rights onto Seven Eleven for this race.” BAT said it was “mindful of the stance that the Australian government currently takes towards potentially reduced risk products.” “Combined with the fact that we consequently don’t sell these products there, it makes sense to pass on the branding rights to one of our key business customers instead of using them ourselves,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. Australian media reported last month that government health departments were looking into whether Ferrari’s original Philip Morris livery had broken the ban on tobacco advertising. Ferrari replaced the Mission Winnow logo in Melbourne with a “90 years” livery, which marks the 90th anniversary of the Italian racing company established by Enzo Ferrari.

-10.161410743853734," Exclusive: Philip Morris paid for India manufacturing despite ban on foreign investment – documents NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc has for years paid manufacturing costs to its Indian partner to make its Marlboro cigarettes, circumventing a nine-year-old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry, internal company documents reviewed by Reuters showed. The Indian government in 2010 prohibited foreign direct investment (FDI) in cigarette manufacturing, saying the measure would enhance its efforts to curb smoking. Restricting foreign investment leaves cigarette manufacturing largely in the hands of domestic players, and is supposed to prevent any foreign-funded expansion. A year after the government’s decision, Japan Tobacco exited India, citing an “unsustainable business model”. Philip Morris, though, stayed in India and used another route, according to company documents dated between May 2009 and January 2018. A year before the FDI ban, it struck an exclusive deal with India’s Godfrey Phillips to locally manufacture the world-famous Marlboro cigarettes. Ever since then, Godfrey has publicly acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India, while Philip Morris’s majority-owned local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand. But dozens of internal company documents - including invoice bills, legal agreements, e-mails and accounting statements - show Philip Morris has for years indirectly paid costs related to Marlboro cigarette manufacturing in India. Some former Indian enforcement officials said the practice of indirectly paying for manufacturing-related costs violates regulatory rules. However, some lawyers such as Pratibha Jain, a partner at Nishith Desai Associates, disagreed, pointing out that the federal rules did not explicitly prohibit such payments. Philip Morris’ director for corporate affairs in India, R. Venkatesh, in an e-mail, said the company’s “business arrangements with Godfrey Phillips India comply with Indian Foreign Direct Investment Rules”. He did not elaborate. The company did not answer detailed questions for this article and did not offer any executive for interview, despite repeated requests from Reuters over the past month. Six invoices issued by Godfrey showed billing of 45.5 million Indian rupees ($644,200) to Philip Morris between December 2013 and January 2018 for manufacturing-related charges. Philip Morris paid for items ranging from large cigarette-making machines to costs of smaller equipment such as barcode scanners and printers deployed in Godfrey’s factories. One invoice from January 2018 sent from Godfrey to Philip Morris showed the Indian company had spent 206 million rupees ($3 million) on capital expenditure for Marlboro-related manufacturing activities since 2009, though it was not clear how much of that was paid by Philip Morris. Godfrey Phillips’ head of corporate affairs, Harmanjit Singh, said in an email that all the commercial arrangements “are in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing the Indian Foreign Direct Investment and other applicable laws, and, incidentally, all transactions are in Indian Rupees. Also, it is our considered view that no illegality can be impugned to these commercial transactions between the parties.” Philip Morris’ local unit and Godfrey arranged a mechanism for such transfer of funds around the time they struck the 2009 deal. A 94-page “procurement agreement” signed between the two sides that year, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters, said that Godfrey may acquire new machinery for solely manufacturing Marlboro cigarettes and will then “invoice PM (Philip Morris) India” for charges in a phased manner. Philip Morris “shall pay such invoice by bank transfer”, the agreement said. The agreement specified Philip Morris would make periodic payments calculated according to the normal depreciation charge of the machinery, plus 10 percent per annum on its net book value. Other than those regular payments, Philip Morris also signed off on one-time expenses and refurbishment costs incurred by Godfrey on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, according to internal e-mails and accounting records. It then accounted those transactions internally under a heading “Packaging - Research”, accounting records showed. “THEY ARE CAMOUFLAGING” Three former officials and one former head of India’s main financial crime-fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate, reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for circumventing India’s foreign investment rules. One of the former officials said that paying for machines to manufacture cigarettes essentially resulted in the promotion of cigarettes, and the government’s intent of banning foreign direct investment in 2010 was to deter that. Bhure Lal, a former head of India’s Enforcement Directorate, said the companies “should be investigated ... they are camouflaging”. The current chief of India’s Enforcement Directorate, Sanjay Kumar Mishra, did not respond to a request for comment. If the Enforcement Directorate investigates a company and finds it to be in violation of the rules, Indian law allows it to impose a penalty of up to three times the amount contravened. Jain of Nishith Desai Associates, which also advises global companies on foreign investment rules and reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters, said the company was able to circumvent the FDI prohibition in cigarette manufacturing by paying for the machines through invoices. That’s because the Indian regulations only restrict direct foreign investments into a company and were silent on such indirect payments for machines, she said. “The company can argue in its defense that it is only funding the equipment purchases and not investing directly in an Indian cigarette manufacturing company, and they would be technically correct,” Jain told Reuters. The Indian journey of Philip Morris, which is one of the world’s largest international tobacco companies, began in the late 1960s when it acquired a majority stake in the London-based parent of Godfrey Phillips. It gradually reduced its stake in Godfrey over the years, in part due to regulatory changes, and currently holds a 25 percent equity stake. Though India banned foreign investment in cigarette manufacturing in 2010, it still allowed tobacco companies to invest through technology collaboration and licensing agreements. Investments could also be made by forming a trading company. Ahead of the 2010 ban, Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey. The New Delhi-headquartered local unit, named IPM India Wholesale Trading Pvt. Ltd, is 50.1 percent owned by the global tobacco giant, with the rest owned by Godfrey and an investment firm. Among the payments outlined in the documents, Godfrey in January 2018 sent an invoice to Philip Morris’s local unit for 10.2 million rupees ($144,500), billing for charges for the preceding six-month period, an invoice showed. In August 2017, Godfrey sent an invoice for manufacturing-related charges of 9.5 million rupees ($134,600). The documents also showed that Philip Morris at times would discuss with Godfrey which type of equipment should be used for Marlboro manufacturing, and then sign off on related payments. In July 2016, the head of Philip Morris’s India supply chain operations, Nilay Mehta, asked a Godfrey Phillip executive in an e-mail to raise a purchase order for an embossing roller, a type of equipment used in cigarette manufacturing. Given the equipment had to be used only for Marlboro manufacturing, “IPM will be picking the cost for this”, Mehta said in an email to a Godfrey executive on July 26, 2016. Mehta did not respond to an e-mail from Reuters. India has 106 million smokers, second only to China, and a young demographic makes it an attractive market for tobacco companies. Philip Morris is a small player in India's estimated $12 billion cigarette market but has seen its market share rise steadily in recent years. That was aided by its marketing activities, such as advertising at roadside kiosks and free distribution of cigarettes at parties. Both tactics were described as illegal by health officials in a Reuters investigation published in 2017. (reut.rs/2uy9vOr)"
11.428493081791927," Japan Tobacco forecasts strong sales amid tepid heat-not-burn products market TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco expects the country’s heated tobacco market to post moderate growth this year but sees a nearly 80 percent rise in its own sales as it attempts to catch up with the sector leader Philip Morris International. Japan, a major heated tobacco market globally, saw a sharp slowdown last year following an initial surge in sales after Philip Morris started selling its “heat not burn” products in 2014, as competition heightened and consumers turned more conservative in adopting the new products. “What we learned last year is it is very difficult to forecast the domestic market” for HNB, said Masamichi Terabatake, CEO of Japan Tobacco, at an earnings briefing. “The growth in (HNB) market slowed down a lot in 2018,” he said, adding, however, the company still believes the category is a growth field in a longer term. The former state-monopoly last month ratcheted up the smokeless war with the launch of two new products. Despite commanding 62 percent of the local cigarette market, Japan Tobacco has been caught on the wrong side of the rising popularity of HNB alternatives and has lagged in the category in its own backyard versus the Marlboro maker. Philip Morris in 2014 started selling its IQOS HNB device in Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for vaping products since e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country’s pharmaceutical regulation. IQOS had a 71.8 percent share of Japan’s HNB market in 2018, while British American Tobacco’s glo had 20.1 percent and Japan Tobacco’s Ploom TECH 8.1 percent, Nomura estimates. Japan Tobacco said it expects to sell HNB tobacco products equivalent of 5 billion cigarettes this year in Japan, up from 2.8 billion cigarette equivalent last year. Ploom TECH uses tobacco leaf-packed capsules and the company provides sales volume counts in the equivalent of conventional cigarettes. HNB products, including rivals’, are expected to account for 22-23 percent of Japan’s overall tobacco market in 2019, versus 21 percent a year ago, Japan Tobacco said on Thursday. Japan Tobacco expects its domestic sales of conventional cigarettes to fall over 7.5 percent this year, after dropping 11.7 percent in 2018."
19.363462177901464," Japan Tobacco ratchets up smokeless war with new products TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc 2914.T on Thursday unveiled two ""heat-not-burn"" products, as it races against market leader Philip Morris International Inc PM.N for a larger share of the vaping space with conventional cigarettes steadily falling out of favor. Despite commanding 60 percent of the local cigarette market, Japan Tobacco has been caught on the wrong side of the rising popularity of heat-not-burn (HNB) alternatives and has lagged in the category in its own backyard versus the Marlboro maker. Philip Morris in 2014 started selling its IQOS HNB device in Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for vaping products since e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country’s pharmaceutical regulation. Japan Tobacco managed to roll out its vaping product, Ploom TECH, only by 2017 after repeated production delays. And even then, some users have complained about its weak taste. It is now planning to start selling Ploom TECH+ and Ploom S in Japan from Jan. 29 to tap into the HNB market that continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Ploom TECH+ is priced at 4,980 yen, while Ploom S will sell for 7,980 yen - same as IQOS’ cheapest version. “We are aiming for the No. 1 position,” said Mutsuo Iwai, head of Japan Tobacco’s domestic tobacco business. “Japan is the biggest HNB market, a success in Japan will lead to a success globally.” IQOS had a 71.8 percent share of Japan's HNB market last year, while British American Tobacco's BATS.L glo had 20.1 percent and Ploom TECH's 8.1 percent, Nomura estimates. HNB products accounted for 20.9 percent of Japan’s tobacco market in 2018, versus 12 percent a year ago, according to an estimate by Satoshi Fujiwara, an analyst at Nomura. Japan Tobacco has said it expects vaping products to account for 30 percent of the domestic tobacco market by end-2020 and will spend heavily in the field as cigarette sales drop. Japan Tobacco’s conventional cigarette sales volume in the country fell 11.4 percent over Jan-Nov last year. The former state monopoly, still one-third owned by the government, has been scrambling to launch new HNB products after many smokers found the taste of its current one weak. Unlike IQOS and glo, Ploom TECH does not directly heat tobacco rolls. Instead, it generates vapor that goes through a tobacco-packed capsule, emitting far less smell but, according to users, less potent than rival products. This has partly hurt sales, with the firm in October cutting its Ploom TECH capsules sales forecast by 30 percent for 2018. Iwai said the new products were Japan Tobacco’s answer to user complaints as they are designed to give a stronger taste. “We believe we can lure back those who tried Ploom TECH but stopped using it,” he said."
-15.096573717691255," Philip Morris aims to revive Japan sales with cheaper heat-not-burn tobacco TOKYO (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc released cheaper versions of its IQOS “heat not burn” products in Japan on Tuesday as it tries to revive sales and ward off competition from other alternatives to conventional cigarettes. As regular e-cigarettes with nicotine-laced liquid are effectively banned in Japan, the country has become the main market for “heat not burn” (HNB) products, which emit less smoke and smell less than conventional cigarettes. Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, was first to start selling HNB products in Japan in 2014. But after an initial surge in sales last year, it has run into competition from British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco Inc, and its market share has stopped growing in recent quarters. The companies slashed prices of their heating devices earlier this year, as competition intensified. “Clearly IQOS sales have slowed down” since their launch in Japan, Philip Morris CEO Andre Calantzopoulos told reporters on Tuesday. But he said the increased competition was not necessarily a bad thing in the long run if the increased choice made the products more popular among consumers. A new “HEETS” line priced at 470 yen ($4.18) a pack would be available from Tuesday, he said. That is cheaper than Philip Morris’s current HeatSticks, tobacco rolls used with IQOS devices, which are priced at 500 yen per pack. “Clearly, for some people, spending 30 yen more, 40 yen more per day is expensive,” Calantzopoulos told Reuters in a separate interview. In mid-November, the company will also release newer versions of its “IQOS 3” and “IQOS 3 MULTI” devices. The existing versions will still be available at current prices. Philip Morris, the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, has seen weaker-than-expected growth in IQOS recently, after building a leading position in the global HNB market. Japan accounts for about 85 percent of the $6.3 billion HNB market, according to Euromonitor. Philip Morris says IQOS has a 15.5 percent share in Japan’s overall tobacco market, including conventional cigarettes, but market share has stabilized. “I think it’s natural in any category that you have slowdowns,” Calantzopoulos said. “We have people who adopted earlier and people who are more conservative.” Philip Morris has also made a marketing application to the FDA for IQOS, which would allow the company to sell it with a claim of reduced risk. Philip Morris was spun off from Altria Group Inc nearly a decade ago, and Altria will commercialize IQOS in the United States. Calantzopoulos said permission for commercialization would come hopefully before the end of the year and Altria was “ready to launch”. A Reuters report in December identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA by Philip Morris. On Monday, Philip Morris drew accusations of hypocrisy after using a four-page newspaper advertisement to urge smokers to quit cigarettes."

-14.389490699397731," Pricing boost helps Philip Morris quarterly results to beat estimates LONDON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International PM.N, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, maintained its full-year guidance on Thursday after higher pricing helped it to report better than expected quarterly sales and profit. Shares of the company rose 4.7 percent in New York, although the unchanged outlook signals weakness in the current fourth quarter. “With full year guidance unchanged you will expect a give back,” Jefferies analysts said in a note. “Nonetheless, optically a 12 percent beat always looks good and it should support today.” Sales were helped by market share gains and pricing increases, the company said. Philip Morris is pinning its hopes for the future on its IQOS device, which heats tobacco instead of burning it, thereby producing a vapor instead of smoke. It says this is less dangerous than smoking. However, the company has previously cut its full-year forecast twice this year, citing currency fluctuations and slower IQOS sales. Shares in Philip Morris also fell this week after rival British American Tobacco BATS.L cut its full-year revenue target for cigarette alternatives such as vaping pens and tobacco heating devices, citing a flat market in Japan and a product recall in the United States. Philip Morris stood by its 2018 forecast for diluted earnings per share of between $4.97 and $5.02 at prevailing exchange rates. Excluding currency fluctuations, it said its forecast represented growth in adjusted earnings of 8-9 percent. The company expects sales to fall 5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to the year earlier period, and earnings to be hurt by greater investment in its new IQOS models. It reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.44, ahead of $1.27 in the same period last year and analysts’ average estimate of $1.28, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Net revenue was $7.5 billion, up 0.4 percent, held back by currency fluctuations. Analysts had expected $7.17 billion. Total volume of cigarette and heated tobacco units was 203.7 billion, down 2.1 percent. Excluding the impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, volume was up 1.1 percent, the company said. The company said distributors in Japan reduced inventories of existing IQOS products ahead of the launch of new models of the device, which heats up small tobacco sticks. Nonetheless, the company said worldwide sales of its heated tobacco units was set to almost double this year, and it continued to expect shipments of 41 billion to 42 billion units."

6.86813926458861," BAT to launch heated tobacco in U.S., shares jump LONDON (Reuters) - British American Tobacco BATS.L on Thursday said it would test launch its Eclipse tobacco heating product in the United States within the next 12 months, giving it a head start in a highly competitive market. Its shares rose more than 5 percent as BAT, the world’s second-biggest international tobacco company by revenue, also reported better-than-expected first-half profit, helped by its recent takeover of Reynolds American. BAT said it received a “substantial equivalence” clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an improved version of its carbon-tipped tobacco heating product called Eclipse, a major regulatory hurdle that it says clears the way for it to test the product in the next 12 months. ""This means it will be first to the market ahead of IQOS,"" Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said, referring to Philip Morris International's PM.N tobacco heating device. “It remains to be seen how popular heated tobacco will be in the U.S. but being first ... positions it well.” A similar application for its Glo device, filed in February, has passed into scientific review, it said. In addition, the company said it expects a scientific hearing regarding its Camel Snus to take place in September. The maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes said it remains confident of exceeding 1 billion pounds of reported revenue from next generation products this year, as new launches should bolster growth in the back half of the year, following a slowdown in some key markets such as Japan and Korea. In the first half of the year, BAT reported sales of 11.64 billion pounds ($15.36 billion), roughly in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters data. Adjusted earnings per share were 137.2 pence, ahead of expectations. Its shares were up 5.2 percent at 0900 GMT. BAT said foreign exchange rates were a headwind of 8 percent in the first half of the year and are estimated to hurt sales by 5 to 6 percent for the full year, during which it anticipates another good year of adjusted earnings growth at constant rates of exchange.

0.3671213851779972," Philip Morris plans to target Indian smokers with iQOS device: sources NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc PM.N is planning to launch its iQOS smoking device in India, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the tobacco giant seeks a foothold in a country with the world's second-biggest smoker population. Philip Morris says the sleek, penlike iQOS heats but does not burn tobacco, producing a nicotine-containing vapour rather than smoke and making it less harmful than conventional cigarettes. The company says it wants to one day stop selling cigarettes altogether. India has stringent laws to deter tobacco use, which the government says kills more than 900,000 people every year. But the country still has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China according to the World Health Organization (WHO), making it a lucrative market for Philip Morris to target. A government source said New Delhi would keep an “open mind” if Philip Morris approached it to discuss a device that helped people quit smoking, but added such devices, including e-cigarettes, could be banned if found to be harmful. The health ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Philip Morris plans to start strategising an iQOS launch in India, which would include work on branding and pricing, as well as reaching out to media and regulators, sources aware of the plan said. The company’s top corporate affairs executive in India, R. Venkatesh, has been interviewing candidates for a senior executive who would focus on iQOS, the sources said. The company wants “to put together a strategy to achieve its acceptability as a reduced risk product”, said one of the sources, adding that Philip Morris wanted to have a public relations strategy in place before moving ahead. A Philip Morris spokesman said “we do not comment on our launch plans, but are committed to working hard to replace cigarettes with scientifically substantiated smoke-free products”. Venkatesh did not respond to a request for comment. But the company appears to have already started building a public case for iQOS in India. On “World No Tobacco Day” last week, Venkatesh wrote a column for India’s Economic Times newspaper, calling for “effective regulations” for alternative smoking devices. “With alternatives to cigarettes available and countries already delivering on their smoke-free ambitions, the incentive is there for lawmakers to support Indian smokers - who deserve a better option,” Venkatesh said. Prakash C. Gupta, director at the Healis Sekhsaria Institute of Public Health near Mumbai, criticized Philip Morris’ plans, saying iQOS would be used by affluent young people in India “which will be harmful for public health”. Philip Morris has for years promoted its Marlboro cigarettes in India. Though its market share has quadrupled in recent years, Marlboro still accounts for only about 1.4 percent of India’s $10 billion cigarette market. According to internal documents published by Reuters last year, the company sees India as a “high potential market” where it aimed at “winning the hearts and minds” of people between 18, the minimum legal age to buy tobacco products, and 24. IQOS is currently used by nearly 5 million people in more than 30 countries, led by Japan which effectively bans regular e-cigarettes but allows “heat not burn” devices. India could offer Philip Morris a huge opportunity due to its burgeoning middle class, said Shane MacGuill, head of tobacco research at Euromonitor International. “It’s a bet on the future,” MacGuill said. “In the longer term, there could be very big rewards for them in India.” Philip Morris’ so-called reduced risk products, such as iQOS, helped the company clock $3.8 billion in net revenues last year, compared with $739 million in the previous year. To garner support for iQOS in India, Philip Morris plans to reach out to influential people who could voice public support for the device ahead of its launch, two of the sources said. Still, if Philip Morris seeks Indian approvals, it would need to convince a government that has in recent years raised cigarette taxes, ordered companies to print bigger health warnings on tobacco packs and launched a quit-smoking helpline. Philip Morris has also applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the device as being less harmful than cigarettes. Dr. Vinayak M. Prasad, who leads WHO’s tobacco-free initiative in Geneva, said the agency had advised those governments that had consulted it that it had no evidence to show products such as iQOS were less harmful than conventional forms of tobacco. “These products should be regulated, not allowed to be used in public places that are smoke-free and taxed sufficiently high enough to deter young people to get addicted,” Prasad told Reuters on Friday. To view a graphic on Philip Morris iQOS, click: tmsnrt.rs/2JwvlJl India’s health ministry has for years said it wants to regulate e-cigarettes - devices which use a nicotine-laced liquid. Still, there is no federal regulation for the product that activists say is harmful and acts as a gateway to tobacco. In a filing to a Delhi court that is hearing a plea to regulate e-cigarettes, the federal health ministry in April described such Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) as “new emerging threats”. The ministry, in its filing seen by Reuters, said it was developing guidelines for regulating - including possibly banning - the manufacture, import or sale of e-cigarettes. “Glamorizing marketing techniques of ENDS as less harmful products purely mimics the marketing techniques used by the cigarette industry,” the ministry said, without specifically mentioning heat-not-burn smoking devices such as iQOS. Despite that stance, the government source said the health ministry was still undecided on whether to ban or regulate e-cigarettes, and wanted more consultation to decide whether their efficacy as an aid to help people stop smoking regular cigarettes outweighed any potential harm. Globally, Philip Morris also lobbies regulators to not classify iQOS as a regular cigarette, an argument that, if won, can lead to lower taxes. The company says the tobacco plugs inserted into the iQOS do not produce smoke, and the device itself is an electronic product. It plans to do the same in India. “The first thing is to ensure the customs duties are not prohibitively high,” said one of the sources."
-0.6895498205085759," Japan Tobacco to cut heated tobacco prices in battle with Philip Morris TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc 2914.T is set to slash prices on its heated tobacco products early next week after a similar move by bigger rival Philip Morris International Inc PM.N, signaling increased competition in Japan's nascent market for alternative cigarettes. Japan, where regular e-cigarettes with nicotine-laced liquid are effectively banned, has become the main market for “heat not burn” (HNB) products which emit less smoke and smell less than conventional cigarettes. The country accounts for over 90 percent of the $5 billion HNB market, according to Euromonitor. Tobacco makers initially struggled to keep up with strong demand as they began introducing HNB products in limited Japanese markets a few years ago. But they have since ramped up production, with investors now worried about slowing growth. Japan Tobacco said it would cut the price of its Ploom TECH device to 3,000 yen ($27.61) from 4,000 yen, timed with the official start of nationwide sales on Monday. “We are finally prepared and confident that we can reverse our position and go on the offensive,” said Chito Sasaki, president of the company’s domestic tobacco business, told Reuters. The company, while a dominant player in Japan’s cigarette market with a 60 percent share, has been lagging rivals in the HNB category. Philip Morris, which was first to start selling HNB products in Japan in 2014, claims iQOS has a 16.8 percent share in Japan’s overall tobacco market, including conventional cigarettes. Philip Morris has said it will cut the price of its tobacco-heating device iQOS by about 30 percent to 7,980 yen from Friday. It said the move was designed to encourage more smokers who are considering switching from conventional cigarettes. British American Tobacco PLC (BAT) BATS.L started to sell its ""glo"" device at 2,980 yen earlier this month, from 5,980 yen as a time-limited offer through late December. The cuts come as analysts said the industry may need catalysts for more growth after an initial surge in sales to those eager to try out HNB products. Philip Morris in April reported weaker-than-expected growth of iQOS devices in Japan in the first quarter, prompting a dive in company’s share price. Industry officials, however, still see strong growth ahead, with Japan Tobacco forecasting HNB products accounting for 23 percent of Japan’s overall tobacco market in 2018, nearly double last year’s 12 percent. A Reuters investigation in December described irregularities in the clinical trials that supported Philip Morris’ iQOS application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

5.829610570394451," Special Report: Philip Morris device knows a lot about your smoking habit TOKYO/NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - In seeking regulatory approval for a new smoking device called iQOS, Philip Morris International Inc is claiming the electronic gadget is less likely to cause disease than traditional cigarettes. But the iQOS holds another, less obvious advantage over regular smokes: the ability to harvest personal data about users’ smoking habits. The tobacco giant is already building a database of iQOS customers who register with the company. And it has developed a software application that could take things a step further. The initiative, if allowed by regulators, could extract information about a user’s smoking routine from the device and use it for marketing purposes, said a former project manager at the company who tested the software in Japan. That data would include the number of puffs and average consumption per day, said Shiro Masaoka, who worked at Philip Morris in Japan from 2012 to 2016. Asked about Masaoka’s comments, Philip Morris said the software in the device that controls temperature and duration of use “is not used for marketing purposes whatsoever.” A Canadian firm that specializes in reverse-engineering tech devices says the iQOS is equipped with two microcontroller chips, including one that, with modifications to the device, could support the storing of usage information that could then be transmitted back to Philip Morris. From the product description of the chips used, the data could include details like the number of puffs by a user and how many times a person smoked the device in a given day, according to Ottawa-based TechInsights Inc, which examined the iQOS’ innards for Reuters. The firm’s inspection included the hardware and components; it did not test the functionality of the device’s software. Reuters is publishing TechInsights’ teardown report as part of a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files, which includes internal company documents. Presented with the TechInsights findings, Philip Morris said in a statement: “No data information from the device is linked to a specific consumer, only the device.” A patent filed by a Philip Morris subsidiary in 2009 suggests how communication with the smoker would work. It describes an iQOS-like device as having “an interface for establishing a communications link for uploading data to and downloading data from an Internet-enabled host.” Gregory Connolly, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who has studied iQOS technology and patents, said Philip Morris’ ability to gather user data could give the device remarkable power. “What they’re going to have is a mega database of how Americans smoke,” he said. “Then they’ll be able to reprogram the current puffing delivery pattern of the iQOS to one that may be more reinforcing and with a higher addiction potential.” Told about those comments, Philip Morris referred to remarks in January by its vice president for scientific and public communications, Moira Gilchrist. “I can reassure that there’s no technology in there that’s intended to manipulate in any way what is delivered from iQOS,” Gilchrist told a panel of scientific advisers for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The only time the company extracts data from the device, Philip Morris says, is when trying to figure out why there’s been a malfunction. ‘CAPTURE DATA’ Gilchrist told the FDA panel that iQOS delivers roughly the same level of nicotine as a standard cigarette. Philip Morris says the device’s nicotine delivery cannot be altered. Gilchrist did say, though, that the company is able to “capture data,” such as the number of puffs taken on an iQOS, but doesn’t do so unless it’s necessary to examine a device that has a technical problem. The number of puffs by a user and smoking time per tobacco insert are automatically regulated by the device, she said. The company says that by heating tobacco instead of burning it, the iQOS significantly reduces a user’s exposure to the levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in a regular cigarette. As a result, the company claims, the device “is likely to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases.” The iQOS system uses cigarette-like inserts containing tobacco, branded in some markets as HeatSticks. They slide into a pen-size holder, equipped with a heating component called a “blade.” The device comes with a USB cord, and has Bluetooth wireless communication availability in some markets. Philip Morris says iQOS is for smokers who would otherwise not quit. It is applying to the FDA for permission to market the device in America as being less harmful than cigarettes. The panel of advisers at the FDA hearing in January voted its approval of a finding that scientific studies show switching completely from cigarettes to iQOS significantly reduces a smoker’s exposure to harmful chemicals. But it also found that Philip Morris had not demonstrated that the reduction is “reasonably likely” to result in a “measurable and substantial” reduction in disease and/or death. A Reuters investigation published in December identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant’s application to the FDA. Former Philip Morris employees and contractors described irregularities in those studies. Reuters did not find any evidence that the outcome of the experiments was manipulated or falsified. Philip Morris said in a statement to Reuters that “all studies were conducted by suitably qualified and trained Principal Investigators,” researchers who oversee a clinical trial. In a letter in February, which mentioned Reuters’ findings, a group of 10 U.S. senators asked FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to “avoid rushing” the approval of products such as iQOS “without requiring strong evidence that any such product will reduce the risk of disease, result in a large number of smokers quitting, and not increase youth tobacco use.” The company has filed a series of patents related to electronic smoking devices. One such patent published in 2016 describes a mouthpiece with a sensor to measure the amount of nicotine byproduct in a user’s saliva and allows for remote adjustments to the device. Such changes would allow for the monitoring and controlling of the “maximum threshold” for the amount of nicotine that a user receives, according to the patent. In a statement in December, Philip Morris said that patent “is not used in any of our products and we have no plans for it in the foreseeable future.” At the January meeting of the FDA advisory panel, Gilchrist was quizzed on how the company is using Bluetooth, which provides for greater connectivity with iQOS users. She replied that it is used to remind consumers, for instance, when they have to clean their device or re-order HeatSticks so they didn’t run out and have to revert to regular cigarettes. “You know, for example, a message may come up: ‘Hey, you haven’t used your iQOS device today,’” Gilchrist said. “Have you stopped smoking, or is it because you’ve gone back to combustible cigarettes?” In Japan, which has more permissive tobacco marketing laws than many countries, Philip Morris is collecting user information through registrations for the device. At a flagship boutique in Tokyo’s fashionable Harajuku district, where the word iQOS stretches down the side of a glass-encased building, customers were offered a discount on buying the device in exchange for signing up on the company’s iQOS website. The company offered incentives on the website for people to register, including the iQOS discount. In doing so, potential customers were asked to enter a list of smoking preferences as well as the user ID for their Instagram social media account. Philip Morris said in a statement that it does so “to ensure that these consumers can follow the iQOS Instagram account, which is closed and limited to age-verified consumers registered in the Philip Morris Japan iQOS consumer database.” An internal Philip Morris handbook dated 2016 discussed approaches to social media. It gave examples of possible Facebook posts aimed at customers. “Did you know?” one suggested post reads. “Our newest version of iQOS can be connected to an app that’ll help you adjust to the product much quicker. Take it for a spin and learn more.” (For a graphic on 'Scientists describe problems in Philip Morris e-cigarette experiments' click here) (For a graphic on 'How Philip Morris is selling regulators on its hot new smoking device' click here)"
