24.387755102040803," LG Display reports stronger profit on iPhone demand, rising panel prices SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd reported its highest quarterly profit in over three years on Wednesday, with help from increased shipments of Apple Inc’s new iPhones. The Apple supplier posted an operating profit of 685 billion won ($622 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of 422 billion won in the same period a year earlier. It was the display panel firm’s highest quarterly profit since the second quarter of 2017, and soundly ahead of market expectations for a 286 billion won profit, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate derived from 12 analyst estimates. “As the global work-from-home situation continued in the fourth quarter, demand for TV and IT products remained strong,” LG Display said in a statement. Shipments and prices of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels rose for both TVs and smartphones, while the strong earnings were helped by full-scale production at its Guangzhou OLED plant, the company said. Analysts highlighted increased shipments of OLED panels for Apple Inc’s new iPhone 12 and higher prices for liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. LCD prices rose on the back of growing demand for TVs from global consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple’s iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter were likely up 21% on-year due to the strong performance of the iPhone 12, according to Counterpoint data. Stronger iPhone sales should spill over into LG Display’s first quarter result, analysts said. “The first half of the year is usually a seasonal down-cycle, but this year is different. It will continue to swing to profit, as iPhone 12 sales are expected to increase panel shipments by 1.5 to two times the amount a year earlier,” said Kim Kwang-jin, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea. LCD panel prices should also remain high in the first quarter, he said. LG Display, which had previously said it planed to halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by 2020, said in an earnings call on Wednesday that it will be flexible on domestic production based on market conditions this year. A power outage in Nippon Electric Glass’ (NEG) Japan-based glass manufacturing facility in December may affect LG Display’s first-quarter shipments, as about 80% of its glass came from NEG in the first half of 2020, analysts said. But the lower supply of large-sized glass could further lift panel prices in the first quarter, offsetting the impact of any fall in shipments, they added. Revenue rose 16% to 7.5 trillion won, LG Display said in a regulatory filing. Its shares fell 5% on Wednesday compared with a 0.6% drop in the wider market, which analysts put down to profit-taking. The stock has still gained some 63% since the start of November. ($1 = 1,101.0000 won)"

49.92867332382311," LG Display swings to profit on new iPhone, says Huawei impact 'manageable' SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd 034220.KS on Thursday reported a profit for July-September, ending a six-quarter run of loss, helped by shipments for Apple Inc's AAPL.O new iPhone and stay-at-home trends boosting panel demand for TVs and laptops. LG Display expects rising panel shipments and sales in the current quarter as well and suggested it has pushed back plans to phase out all of its domestic liquid crystal display (LCD) TV panel production by year end to respond to TV demand. It also painted a positive outlook for its sales to Apple, which would offset the suspension of sales to China’s Huawei as a result of U.S. sanctions. LG Display posted a third-quarter operating profit of 164 billion won ($145 million) versus a loss of 437 billion a year earlier. That topped the 64 billion won expected by 17 analysts, Refinitiv SmartEstimate data showed. Revenue rose 16% to 6.7 trillion won, LG Display said in a regulatory filing. LG Display, which supplies mobile OLED panels for Apple’s iPhone 12, said an expanded supply of mobile OLED panels to an identified strategic customer in North America, helped lift its earnings and it is using its full production capacity to respond to demand from the customer. It said it will be able to resume business with Huawei after the company along with other suppliers gain U.S. export licences. “Strategically speaking, it’s a very important client for the company, but when it comes to the volume itself, we are not at the stage of providing mass volume, so when it comes to the impact on business itself, it’s more than manageable.” Chief Financial Officer Suh Dong-hee said during an earnings briefing. LG Display, which said in January it would halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by year end, said there is no change to its plan to revamp its LCD business structure, but suggested that it would keep some of capacity for the time being to respond to solid demand for TVs. It said the start of its China OLED TV display fab contributed to its earnings rise, and expected annual sales to reach around 4.5 million units this year, although this would fall short of its earlier target of 6 million, as the pandemic hit demand for high-end TVs earlier in the year."

Samsung Display, which counts Samsung Electronics and Apple AAPL.O as major customers for OLED display screens, declined comment. LG Display said in a statement the U.S. move will have a minimal impact on the company given its limited panel shipments to Huawei, adding it will continue to diversify its customer base. The U.S. further tightened restrictions on Huawei in August, banning suppliers from selling chips made using U.S. technology to the Chinese telecom giant without a special license. Samsung Display and LG Display decided to stop the supply to Huawei from when the restrictions take effect on Sept. 15, as the ban includes chips needed to operate displays, and orders from Huawei do not take up a large portion of their business compared to customers like Apple, Chosun Biz reported, citing industry sources."
27.579737335834892," Apple supplier LG Display posts larger loss, but says the worst is over SEOUL (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier LG Display Co Ltd 034220.KS said on Thursday it expects profitability to improve in the second half of this year as the new iPhone launch boosts demand for its smartphone panels, despite posting a larger operating loss. “Considering the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, it is true that the macroeconomic environment is still not favourable. However, we observe that the worst is over,” said Suh Dong-hee, chief financial officer and senior vice president. The South Korean panel maker posted its sixth straight quarter of operating losses as retail stores were shut around the world during the second quarter to contain the spread of the virus. Its loss for April-June widened to 517 billion won ($431.96 million) from a loss of 369 billion won in the same period a year earlier. That compared with analysts’ forecast loss of 449 billion won, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. Revenue fell 1% to 5.3 trillion won, the company said in a regulatory filing. LG Display said an increase in working from home and online education helped strong sales of IT products such as monitors, tablets and laptops, but it was not enough to offset weak demand for televisions as shoppers stayed home. “LG would likely see an uptick in performance in the second half of the year as it will be supplying OLED panels for iPhone 12, but fresh COVID-19 cases, especially in North America, and possible new lockdowns is casting a shadow over the outlook,” said Park Sung-soon, a Seoul-based analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. Suh expected a “significant improvement” in profitability with an increase of shipments of smartphone P-OLED panel and OLED panels from its factory in China. The company is starting mass production in the latter part of this year at its large-sized organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panel plant in Guangzhou. LG Display's stock has fallen more than 20% so far this year, compared with a 1.4% rise in the benchmark KOSPI market.KS11. Its earnings announcement was issued after the market close."

The South Korean panel maker posted its fifth straight quarter of operating losses, as the coronavirus pandemic added to the problems of the industry already grappling with demand falls and a supply glut. LG Display posted an operating loss of 362 billion won ($294.70 million), better than Refinitiv SmartEstimate’s 390 billion won loss, but nearly triple the operating loss of 132 billion won a year earlier. Revenue fell 20% to 4.7 trillion won. LG Display said an increase in working from home and online activities meant demand for products such as monitors, laptops and tablets would increase in the second quarter, but it might not be enough to offset weak demand for TVs and smartphones. “We expect volatility in demand to increase down the road,” LG Display said. Analysts also said the spread of the coronavirus across the globe would lead to further losses. “It’s likely that LG Display will continue to have another quarterly loss, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus on North America and Europe, which now have become its epicentre,” Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said. LG Display’s shares ended up 0.5% versus the wider market’s fall of 0.98%. Its earnings announcement was issued after the market close. The flat-screen maker also said it delayed production at its new Chinese factory for its advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display to the second quarter, citing difficulties in deploying technical staff because of travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. It had aimed to start production at the factory in Guangzhou in the first quarter. Although liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices rose when production was disrupted in China at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak there, the price increases were shortlived as Chinese rivals resumed production, contributing to a supply glut.

Samsung Display, a unit of South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, said in October that it suspended one of its two LCD production lines at home amid falling demand for LCD panels and a supply glut. “We will supply ordered LCDs to our customers by the end of this year without any issues,” the company said in a statement. In October, the Apple Inc supplier said it will invest 13.1 trillion won ($10.72 billion) in facilities and research to upgrade a production line, as it contends with oversupply amid weak global demand for smartphones and TVs. The investment for the next five years will be focused on converting one of its South Korean LCD lines into a facility to mass produce more advanced “quantum dot” screens. The company runs two LCD production lines at factories in South Korea and two LCD-only factories in China.

-28.115015974440894," LG Display looks to a more positive 2020 on OLED demand, shares rise SEOUL (Reuters) - Apple supplier LG Display Co Ltd posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Friday and offered an optimistic outlook for the year on higher demand for its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, sending its shares up 4%. The forecast comes after a rough year for the South Korean company that saw a prolonged decline in liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices, a management shake-up, and costs from restructuring and strategy changes. The company has said it will halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by the end of the year and is now investing heavily in OLED displays that are generally thinner and allow more flexibility in device design than LCDs. “In the second half of the year, revenue from our large OLED panels will rise steeply in line with the increase in production from (the firm’s) Chinese OLED fab,” LG Display’s Chief Financial Officer Suh Dong-hee said on an earnings call. The company, which recently became a plastic-OLED display vendor for Apple Inc’s latest iPhones, has said it expects to kick off mass production at its China OLED factory some time in the March quarter. LG Display has not yet closed any of its Chinese factories since the outbreak of a new coronavirus which has killed over 200 people in the country and infected thousands, the company said, adding the matter increased uncertainty on the LCD supply side. The company posted a loss of 422 billion won ($361.6 million) in the October-December quarter, compared with an operating profit of 279 billion won a year earlier. Analysts expected a 578 billion won loss, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. LCD panel prices have been falling for two-and-a-half years in a market crowded with Chinese makers. The glut has forced LG Display and rival Samsung Display - a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd - to cut output, a move analysts said could take some pressure off prices this year. Prices have risen slightly since late December, but on Thursday, Samsung Electronics said it nevertheless expected the business to remain weak in 2020. “South Korean display makers including LG Display could benefit from a recent uptick in LCD prices, but LG Display will likely speed up its transition to OLED business as the global LCD market has long been suffering from a supply glut,” said analyst Kim Chul-joong at Mirae Asset Daewoo Research. Shares of LG Display were up 4.4% as of 0230 GMT, compared with the broader KOSPI’S 0.4 gain."

The suspension of domestic LCD TV production comes after the company last year chopped its spending, replaced its long-time CEO and started a voluntary redundancy program. “We will be wrapping up our LCD TV production in South Korea by end of this year and focusing on our LCD TV production in China,” CEO Jeong Ho-young said at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas. In October, the South Korean Apple AAPL.O supplier said it planned to ""downsize"" two of its LCD TV panel production lines in South Korea and was looking into various options. LCD TV businesses accounted for 32% of LG’s revenue in the July to September period, down from 41% the previous quarter due to fewer shipments from its LCD TV panel plants. LG Display operates two LCD TV production sites, one in South Korea and another in China. The company suffered three consecutive quarterly losses between January and October last year, but Jeong said the panel maker is expecting to see “further improvement” in its performance in the second half of this year. While terminating domestic LCD TV production, LG Display aims to shift its focus to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.

LG Display, which has posted three consecutive losing quarters, is going through “structural reforms at zero base”, Chief Financial Officer Suh Dong-hee said on an earnings call. It will cut capital spending to 7.5 trillion won from a planned 8 trillion, LG said. LG also plans to “downsize” two of its LCD TV panel production lines in South Korea and is looking into various options, it said, without elaborating. Suh said the reforms could be completed by early next year and that LG would share details later. LG Display has been struggling with a global supply glut in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) used in television sets, which has pushed down prices. LCD TV businesses accounted for 32% of LG’s revenue in the third quarter, down from 41% the previous quarter due to a reduced utilization rate of LCD TV panel plants, LG said. Instead, LG Display is trying to diversify into plastic OLED (organic light-emitting diode) panels used in high-end smartphones. The quickest way LG Display can counter the impact of TV panel price declines is by winning a sizable order for OLED panels for Apple’s new iPhone models, analysts said. Prices for LG Display’s main product, 50-inch LCDs for television sets, were down nearly 16% in the third quarter from a year earlier, data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce, showed. Analysts said Chinese display makers supported by government subsidies have been aggressively producing panels to ramp up market share, resulting in a global glut and driving down prices. LG rival Japan Display Inc 6740.T, which depends on Apple for around 60% of its revenue, has lost money for the last five years and its liabilities now exceed its assets.

17.105263157894736," Samsung Display considers suspending output at South Korean LCD plant SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean panel maker Samsung Display said on Friday it is considering suspending one of its liquid crystal display (LCD) production lines at home due to a supply glut. Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, currently operates two LCD production sites in South Korea and one in China. “Samsung Display has been adjusting the production output and facility operation due to oversupply and worsening profitability, and we are still considering the suspension of the line, but nothing has been decided,” the company said in a statement. Rising competition from Chinese rivals, a shift to more advanced OLED (organic light emitting diode) panels and slowing demand for smartphones and televisions have led to falling offtake and weak prices of LCD panels for South Korean display makers. Samsung Display’s cross-town rival LG Display Co Ltd converted one of its LCD production lines to an OLED production line. That’s a path that Samsung Display may also take, said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. LG Display is also considering various scenarios for its remaining LCD production line in South Korea, said Chief Financial Officer Suh Dong-hee at an earnings briefing last month. Prices for LG Display’s main product, 50-inch TV LCDs, slid as much as 7.5% in April-June versus the same period last year, data from WitsView, which is part of research provider TrendForce, showed. Market researcher IHS Markit said TV panel prices continued their “free fall” in July, even after some Chinese panel makers started to adjust their production due to the high inventories. The researcher said panel makers were reacting to the lackluster demand forecast by their TV customers ahead of the year-end shopping season."
-20.1923076923077," LG Display aims to diversify suppliers due to South Korea-Japan spat SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Display Co Ltd 034220.KS on Tuesday said it is looking to diversify its supplier base in case a diplomatic spat sees Japan extend export curbs on display-making materials bound for South Korea. Japan this month placed restrictions on the export to South Korea of three high-tech materials used particularly in making chips and displays, in a move widely attributed to a dispute about their shared wartime past. The restrictions - which essentially add paperwork and delays to the materials’ export - have the potential to disrupt the global tech industry as Korea is home to some of the world’s largest chipmakers and best-known consumer electronics brands. South Korean firms have responded by stockpiling and seeking alternative suppliers, though market watchers have questioned the ability to match the quality of the affected materials, for which Japan dominates the global market. “There are, so far, no concerns significantly affecting the company, but we are making preparations, ensuring uninterrupted sourcing for the short term, and diversifying sourcing channels over the medium term,” said LG Display Chief Financial Officer Suh Dong-hee during an earnings briefing. ""Though it's possible that Japan's exports curbs will be extended in the future, it's very difficult to predict what would come next,"" Suh said, after the Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier reported a second-quarter operating loss that was deeper than market estimates. One of the restricted materials is hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas when making chips and displays. South Korea imported about 44% of its hydrogen fluoride from Japan in the first five months of this year, Korean industry data showed. The impact of the restrictions on LG Display is likely to be less acute than on chipmakers as the firm has alternative sources of hydrogen fluoride of the quality it needs, said analyst Park Sung-soon at Cape Investment & Securities. LG Display has been struggling with a global supply glut in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) used in television sets, which has pushed down prices. Like many other global tech firms, it is also dealing with uncertainties caused by a Sino-U.S. trade dispute involving import tariffs on tech goods and services. Prices for LG Display’s main product, 50-inch TV LCDs, slid as much as 7.5% in April-June versus the same period last year, showed data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce. Analysts said TV makers have stockpiled panels for fear of further tariffs, raising inventories and exacerbating the glut. “Set makers have been stocking up on panels in advance due to fears of a 25% tariff to be placed into effect in the third quarter, leading their panel inventories to pile up and resulting in conservative purchasing,” said analyst Iris Hu at TrendForce ahead of the earnings release. For April-June, LG Display said its operating loss widened to 369 billion won ($313.02 million) from 228 billion won a year earlier. That compared with analysts’ forecast loss of 268 billion won, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. Revenue fell 5% to 5.4 trillion won. “There wasn’t really any good news for its second-quarter with demand still weak and sentiment still remaining negative because of the U.S.-China trade dispute,” said Cape Investment & Securities’ Park. Declines in panel prices and shipments both were wider than expected, Park said. Also on Tuesday, LG Display said it would invest $2.6 billion in its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels production line in South Korea."

-16.587112171837713," LG Display calls for patience in 2019 as weak smartphones, OLED costs weigh SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Display Co Ltd on Wednesday said OLED R&D costs and stalled smartphone growth will likely translate into a weak 2019, after the Apple Inc supplier booked a first-quarter operating loss that was wider than analyst estimates. The South Korean manufacturer may underperform market expectations as it invests heavily in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels at a time of weak demand for smartphones and tech gadgets in general, its chief financial officer said. “This year will require patience,” Suh Dong-hee said on a call briefing analysts and journalists on its financial results. LG Display’s share price was 5.4 percent lower as of 0328 GMT, versus the wider market’s 1.1 percent fall. The comments come as smartphone makers attempt to revive enthusiasm in the market with the first mainstream foldable handsets scheduled for launch this year, while panel makers also pump money into miniaturising OLED screens mounted on plastic rather than glass for use in smart devices. “There doesn’t seem to be enough phones that are attractive enough to win over consumers, meaning there isn’t high demand for LG Display’s panels,” said analyst Park Sung-soon at BNK Securities. Weak China sales of Apple’s iPhone is also a bad sign for LG Display’s earnings, Park said. Analysts have said capturing a fresh order for Apple’s next line of iPhones may be central to LG Display’s future as competition intensifies with China and Japan in the market for small OLED panels. Reuters exclusively reported earlier this month that Japan Display Inc will begin supplying OLED panels for the Apple Watch later this year, threatening LG Display’s position as majority supplier of such panels for the device. “We are on track to build a firm foundation for an OLED-focused business portfolio for future growth and expect to show solid performance starting from next year,” said LG Display’s Suh. Meanwhile, prices for one of LG Display’s main products, 50-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) for TV sets, slid as much as 23 percent in the first quarter versus the same period last year, showed data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce. “Price falls in large TV LCDs will likely continue in the second quarter, as one of LG Display’s Chinese rivals ramps up production in that segment and drags down prices,” said BNK’s Park.

-4.789053591790193," LG Display warns of panel price weakness as wearables boost fourth-quarter profit (This story was refiled to correct typo in paragraph 5) SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd on Wednesday warned of weaker panel prices in the year ahead due to global economic uncertainty and U.S.- China trade tensions, as it posted a jump in quarterly profit thanks to surging sales of wearable screens. The company said strong sales of high-end screens for smart watches helped improve profitability, even as overall sales fell due to weakness in the television segment. The surge in profit from wearable screens underlines the Apple Inc supplier’s ongoing efforts to focus on high value-added products to fend off declining prices for large panels due to aggressive output from Chinese rivals. “It seems hard to forecast a positive panel price trend for 2019,” Daniel Lee, head of LG Display’s Market Intelligence Division, told an earnings call, citing the U.S.-China trade war and panel oversupply. Operating profit for October-December came in at 279 billion won ($249.7 million), from 44 billion won in the same period a year ago, LG Display said. Revenue fell 2.5 percent to 6.9 trillion won. Operating profit was above a 132 billion won forecast of 10 analysts based on I/B/E/S Refinitiv data, but the company’s shares fell more than 4 percent following the results on concerns for panel prices, analysts said. “The negative panel price outlook given by the company is dragging down the shares,” said Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities. LG Display said it expected panel shipments to fall by a high-single-digit percentage in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter due to seasonally weak demand. It gave no specific guidance on the full-year price outlook. Weaker global smartphone sales particularly in China, the world’s biggest market, have clouded the outlook for electronics makers including Apple, which said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected. Even so, the U.S. tech giant told analysts on an earnings call it had seen strong growth in sales of wearable devices including the Apple Watch in the fourth quarter. Shinyoung Securities analyst Lee said increasing demand for LG Display’s smaller liquid crystal display (LCD) panels helped to offset poor sales of its LCD panels for Apple’s struggling XR smartphone. LG Display shares fell 40 percent last year amid a global tech selloff prompted by investor fears over the impact on supply chains of the U.S.-China trade war. The stock was down 4.2 percent as of 0419 GMT versus the wider market’s 0.7 percent rise."

23.398328690807794," South Korea's LG Display says trade wars weigh on global panel business SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd 034220.KS said trade conflicts would undermine the global panel business, as it posted a 76 percent fall in third-quarter profit on Wednesday despite a seasonal price boost. Recovering Liquid-Crystal Display (LCD) prices ahead of the year-end holidays helped the Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier swing to profit after two consecutive quarterly losses, but it said the trend was not expected to continue into the fourth quarter. The outlook for the global display panel market, valued at $164 billion by research firm Mordor Intelligence, was clouded by over-supply from China and fears of the economic impact of rising tariffs and protectionism, the firm said. “The LCD market is still expected to see double-digit growth in supply. As for demand, market volatility continues to grow, as macro uncertainties are aggravated by tariffs, trade frictions and foreign-exchange risks in emerging economies,” LG Display Executive Vice President Don Kim told analysts. LG Display ranks second by unit shipments in the large LCD panel market after China's BOE Technology Group Co Ltd 000725.SZ, according to IHS Markit data released this month. It posted operating profit of 140 billion won ($123.2 million) for the July-September quarter, after two quarters of consecutive losses, helped by higher seasonal panel prices. The result beat an average forecast of 79 billion won from 10 analysts, according to a Refinitiv poll, but was still well down on the previous corresponding period amid a global supply glut. Revenue fell 12 percent from a year earlier to 6.1 trillion won. Prices for 50-inch (127 cm) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) television panels began to rebound in August to $117 after hitting a record low of $109 in June, according to data provider WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce. The costly OLED TV panel business turned to profit in the third quarter, supported by sales volume growth, LG Display said. The firm did not disclose the size of the profit. Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Securities, said the OLED business was not doing enough to shore up profit and the seasonal price rise would peter out in the fourth quarter. With China’s push into the industry and its miscalculations on panel prices, LG Display has seen tough times, cutting benefits for its employees and planning a voluntary redundancy program. The firm said it was developing foldable screens but would take time to commercialize them."

LG Display plans to receive applications in October for voluntary redundancy among employees in production that make up about 65 percent of its workforce, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported earlier on Saturday citing the company, adding the target size of the voluntary redundancy has not been decided. The spokeswoman said the voluntary retirement offer is driven by automation as well as the company’s portfolio switch from liquid crystal display (LCD) to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, which require fewer production personnel. The company will secure competitiveness by increasing the portion of R&D workers and engineers, she added. Prices of LCD screens, the company’s mainstay, have plummeted partly due to Chinese competition, causing LG Display to say in July it would slash $2.7 billion in capital spending planned through 2020 in order to switch its portfolio to OLED screens. Company officials had previously said that it was not planning layoffs for fear of losing talent to China."

So he donned a pair of goggles, picked up a hammer, and smashed a liquid-crystal display screen to bits. The symbolism was impossible to miss: LCD panels, the company’s mainstay for years, were being relegated to the industrial dustbin. The company’s future would depend on a newer technology, organic light-emitting diode, or OLED. “I’ve never seen him do such a thing,” said one company official who was present. “His performance showed a grim determination to weather this crisis.” Yet LG Display’s predicament was in many ways one of its own making. Less than a year earlier, the company had showered employees with perks and bonuses as profits rolled in, driven by the company’s leadership in LCD screens for TVs, computer monitors and smartphones. But LG Display had misread the market: Chinese competitors were coming on strong, and by early this year prices for LCD screens were plummeting. The fat profits of 2017 turned into big losses in 2018 - and the company abruptly announced in July that it would slash $2.7 billion in capital spending it had planned through 2020. It did not reveal its total or previous targets but made about $6 billion in capital expenditures in 2017, according to Eikon data. The company’s troubles stand as a stark example of the risks inherent in hotly competitive technology businesses that require massive capital investment. “It seems that LG Display made a major miscalculation on its LCD business, not accurately judging the timing to pull away when they could see China’s rapid catch-up,” said Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities. “We knew from last year LCD prices would go down but we did not expect this big and fast fall,” acknowledged one LG Display official, who, like others in this article, declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “Customers had been asking for price cuts, but we didn’t act until it got too late.” LG Display posted five straight years of strong profits after Han took the helm in 2012, riding a tide of LCD screen orders from Apple Inc AAPL.O and strong demand for both phone and TV screens from LG Electronics 066570.KS, which owns more than a third of the display-maker. LG Display also began to invest in OLED displays, which unlike LCD screens don’t require backlighting and can deliver more natural-looking colors. OLED screens also consume less energy and can be bent and folded. But the technology is expensive, and LG Display was earning the vast majority of its revenue from LCDs. Until its recent cutbacks, it was running eight LCD production lines in South Korea and another in China. While LG Display hummed along, Chinese companies, led by BOE Technology Group Co Ltd 000725.SZ, were pouring huge sums into LCD production. By January 2017, BOE had become the No. 1 supplier of LCDs larger than 9 inches, according to market tracker IHS Markit, taking 22.3 percent of unit shipments versus 21.6 percent for LG Display. It was the first time a Chinese display maker had taken the top spot. By early 2018, prices for many types of LCDs were in free-fall. Prices for 50-inch LCD television panels, for example, slid 32 percent in August versus the same month last year, according to IHS Markit. LG Display's big South Korean rival, the display unit of Samsung Electronics 005930.KS, had begun pulling back from LCD years earlier, shutting down older LCD production lines in South Korea beginning in 2010, according to a Samsung Display official. The company now has just two LCD factories in South Korea and one in China. But LG Display was caught flat-footed and is now furiously slashing LCD capacity. It has closed three LCD production lines since last year and abandoned plans for a new one. The company in April also rolled out an “emergency management system,” with employees being told to use cheaper flights and cut back on group meals, company sources told Reuters. Cash flow has become a concern: it was negative 838.2 billion won ($743.93 million) in the second quarter, according to Eikon data, and has been negative for three straight quarters. Three company sources say the company is not planning layoffs for fear of losing talent to China, but some employees are frustrated with cuts in benefits. “Executives are trying to keep the morale up, telling us media reports about a voluntary redundancy program are false,” a company source with knowledge of the matter said. LG Display is now betting the house on OLED, and says it can fund $17.6 billion in OLED investments over the next three years. It expects the newer technology to account for 40 percent of revenue by 2020, up from just 10 percent today. As OLED becomes more prevalent, LG Display’s fortunes could turn, analysts say. LG Display’s OLED panels have helped its sibling, LG Electronics, take the lead in high-end televisions.

-15.265486725663708," FOCUS-LG Display struggles for footing after LCD forecasting error leads to crisis SEOUL, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The chief executive of South Korea’s LG Display, Han Sang-beom, was determined to deliver a strong message when he appeared before 1,000 employees at the firm’s main manufacturing plant last spring. So he donned a pair of goggles, picked up a hammer, and smashed a liquid-crystal display screen to bits. The symbolism was impossible to miss: LCD panels, the company’s mainstay for years, were being relegated to the industrial dustbin. The company’s future would depend on a newer technology, organic light-emitting diode, or OLED. “I’ve never seen him do such a thing,” said one company official who was present. “His performance showed a grim determination to weather this crisis.” Yet LG Display’s predicament was in many ways one of its own making. Less than a year earlier, the company had showered employees with perks and bonuses as profits rolled in, driven by the company’s leadership in LCD screens for TVs, computer monitors and smartphones. But LG Display had misread the market: Chinese competitors were coming on strong, and by early this year prices for LCD screens were plummeting. The fat profits of 2017 turned into big losses in 2018 - and the company abruptly announced in July that it would slash $2.7 billion in capital spending it had planned through 2020. It did not reveal its total or previous targets but made about $6 billion in capital expenditures in 2017, according to Eikon data. The company’s troubles stand as a stark example of the risks inherent in hotly competitive technology businesses that require massive capital investment. “It seems that LG Display made a major miscalculation on its LCD business, not accurately judging the timing to pull away when they could see China’s rapid catch-up,” said Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities. “We knew from last year LCD prices would go down but we did not expect this big and fast fall,” acknowledged one LG Display official, who, like others in this article, declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media. “Customers had been asking for price cuts, but we didn’t act until it got too late.” LG Display posted five straight years of strong profits after Han took the helm in 2012, riding a tide of LCD screen orders from Apple Inc and strong demand for both phone and TV screens from LG Electronics, which owns more than a third of the display-maker. LG Display also began to invest in OLED displays, which unlike LCD screens don’t require backlighting and can deliver more natural-looking colours. OLED screens also consume less energy and can be bent and folded. But the technology is expensive, and LG Display was earning the vast majority of its revenue from LCDs. Until its recent cutbacks, it was running eight LCD production lines in South Korea and another in China. While LG Display hummed along, Chinese companies, led by BOE Technology Group Co Ltd, were pouring huge sums into LCD production. By January 2017, BOE had become the No. 1 supplier of LCDs larger than 9 inches, according to market tracker IHS Markit, taking 22.3 percent of unit shipments versus 21.6 percent for LG Display. It was the first time a Chinese display maker had taken the top spot. By early 2018, prices for many types of LCDs were in free-fall. Prices for 50-inch LCD television panels, for example, slid 32 percent in August versus the same month last year, according to IHS Markit. LG Display’s big South Korean rival, the display unit of Samsung Electronics, had begun pulling back from LCD years earlier, shutting down older LCD production lines in South Korea beginning in 2010, according to a Samsung Display official. The company now has just two LCD factories in South Korea and one in China. But LG Display was caught flat-footed and is now furiously slashing LCD capacity. It has closed three LCD production lines since last year and abandoned plans for a new one. The company in April also rolled out an “emergency management system,” with employees being told to use cheaper flights and cut back on group meals, company sources told Reuters. Cash flow has become a concern: it was negative 838.2 billion won ($743.93 million) in the second quarter, according to Eikon data, and has been negative for three straight quarters. Three company sources say the company is not planning layoffs for fear of losing talent to China, but some employees are frustrated with cuts in benefits. “Executives are trying to keep the morale up, telling us media reports about a voluntary redundancy program are false,” a company source with knowledge of the matter said. LG Display is now betting the house on OLED, and says it can fund $17.6 billion in OLED investments over the next three years. It expects the newer technology to account for 40 percent of revenue by 2020, up from just 10 percent today. As OLED becomes more prevalent, LG Display’s fortunes could turn, analysts say. LG Display’s OLED panels have helped its sibling, LG Electronics, take the lead in high-end televisions. Some analysts believe LG Display has been pressured to supply those panels cheaply, hurting its profitability, though the company denies that is the case. But the OLED market promises to be tough. Samsung boasts that it has been investing in OLED since 2005. BOE is getting into OLED too. There are also still technical challenges in making large-panel OLED TV screens that don’t wear out too quickly, noted Ross Young, CEO of research provider Display Supply Chain Consultants. Son Young-jun, LG Display’s vice president of public relations, said in a statement that the company is the only producer of large-size OLED displays and had “unmatched technological expertise” in OLED. “The potential and outlook ahead is promising,” he said. LG Display says its OLED division will turn a profit in the third quarter.

-18.538713195201748," Apple supplier LG Display slashes investment plans as losses mount SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd 034220.KS, a key Apple supplier, slashed its investment plans by $2.7 billion to 2020 citing concern for the global smartphone market, as it posted a second consecutive quarterly loss on sagging panel prices. The cut underscores the bleak outlook for electronics makers and comes a week after another Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, also scaled back its revenue and investment estimates. “It is a conservative approach resulting from uncertainty around the mobile market,” Don Kim, LG’s chief finance officer, told an earnings conference call, referring to the capex reduction. LG shares tumbled 7 percent versus the broader market's .KS11 0.3 percent fall after it flagged faster-than-expected panel price declines and an uncertain outlook. “Market conditions are turning favorable, but still the unpredictability is high,” Kim added. “Oversupply and asymmetrical competition are unavoidable.” LG said it would trim investment by 3 trillion won ($2.7 billion) from what was planned by 2020, without revealing its total or previous capex targets. It also warned that it could adjust production in South Korea and China in response to trade disputes between Washington and Beijing. The investment cut would not impact plans to “speed up the shift” from LG’s mainstay liquid crystal display (LCD) business toward next-generation organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, the company said. Plans to invest about 20 trillion won in OLED panels by 2020 remained unchanged, meaning the cuts would apply mainly to LCD operations. The OLED panel business has yet to make a profit for LG but the company said it would be positive for earnings in the third quarter. LG is focused on investing in OLED technology, with strong positions in large OLED TV screens. The shift comes as its traditional LCD business, which analysts estimate makes up more than 90 percent of LG’s sales, is struggling with falling prices as fast-growing Chinese panel makers ramp up their capacity. Prices of 50-inch LCD panels slid 38 percent in May versus the same month last year, according to South Korean government data. “LCD industry is already in a down-cycle, which will be difficult for LG to get away from, so LG will concentrate more on OLED to differentiate,” said John Ko, analyst at NH Investment & Securities. LG Display posted an operating loss of 228 billion won ($202.1 million), hit by declining panel prices, compared with an average forecast of a 247 billion won loss derived from a Thomson Reuters survey of 11 analysts. Revenue for the April-June quarter fell 15 percent from a year earlier to 5.6 trillion won. It was LG Display’s second consecutive quarterly loss amid an uncertain time for the global panel industry, with Chinese manufacturers ramping up capacity and a glut of LCD output crimping prices and profit margins. A structural oversupply in panels and fierce competition among display makers were expected to continue, LG said in a statement. China recently approved an LG joint venture to run a new OLED factory there, as the company tries to expand its OLED business towards Chinese TV makers. ($1 = 1,128.8000 won)"

In a filing to the stock exchange, LG Display also denied media reports that the flat-screen maker has received direct investment worth 1 trillion won ($929.15 million) from the U.S. technology giant.

-18.70567375886524," South Korea's LG Display looks up after posting first loss in six years SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd forecast higher panel shipments and more stable prices in the second quarter as it reported its first operating loss in six years on Wednesday, hit by a flood of supply from Chinese rivals. Sluggish sales of liquid crystal displays for TVs and investment costs of shifting production to meet growing demand for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels also weighed on earnings in the first quarter. But CFO Don Kim said the second quarter was looking brighter, with panel area shipments expected to grow on-quarter as consumers upgraded to bigger screens to watch major sporting events. LCD panel prices should stabilize while demand for large-size OLED panels was also expected to remain strong, he added. “The market situation has changed more rapidly than expected,” he said in a statement, adding the company had underestimated the impact of new Chinese supply. “We will be focusing on efficient and flexible management in capital expenditure and maintaining operational performance including intensified cost reduction.” The Apple Inc supplier posted an operating loss of 98 billion won ($91 million) for January-March. That compares with a 1 trillion won profit in the same period a year ago and an average forecast of a 58.1 billion won loss drawn from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 19.6 percent to 5.7 trillion won. LG Display shares, which have been trading near three-month lows so far in April, were up 0.2 percent by 0303 GMT compared with a 1 percent fall in the wider market. “Investors are betting that this is the last bad result, and it can only go up from here,” said Kim Hyun-soo, analyst at Hana Financial Investment. Chinese panel makers, bolstered by government subsidies, are ramping up production and putting pressure on panel prices, analysts have said. Prices of key LCD panels are estimated to have fallen between 6 percent and 10 percent in the first quarter, they added. Concerns about a glut in the market had driven LG Display shares down about 17 percent so far this year. LG Display said that while it expected 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly lower than previous guidance of 9 trillion won, investments would partly depend on the strength of the smartphone market. Flagging the possibility of deeper cuts in capex, it said would take a “flexible” approach to investing in smaller OLED panels for mobile devices due to “increased uncertainty”. Less-than-expected sales of Apple’s OLED-screened iPhone X led rival Samsung Electronics’ display business, which has near 100 percent market share in mobile OLED, to lower the utilization of its production lines in the first quarter, according to research provider WitsView."
