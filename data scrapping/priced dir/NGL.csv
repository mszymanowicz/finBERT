-22.081153365092778," Pilot Flying J buying NGL Energy's TransMontaigne assets: sources DENVER (Reuters) - Pilot Flying J, a top operator of highway truck stops in North America, has agreed to acquire NGL Energy Partners' NGL.N TransMontaigne Product Services assets, according to two people familiar with the matter. NGL, an operator of pipelines, barges and railcars, in early August said it had agreed to sell its TransMontaigne business unit and associated assets for roughly $300 million to an undisclosed buyer. Those assets include terminal agreements and line space on the Colonial and Plantation pipelines, two of the biggest fuel pipelines in the country that connect the Gulf Coast refining hub to the Southeast and populous East Coast markets. The deal also includes two refined products terminals in Georgia, and other assets, including customer contracts. The sale resulted from a strategic review of its refined products business, NGL said at the time. A representative for Pilot Flying J did not respond to a request for comment. NGL Energy Partners’ chief financial officer Trey Karlovich declined to comment on the buyer or share any additional details of the sale. Privately owned Pilot Flying J has been expanding its footprint in recent years, notably in the crude marketing space. This year the company hired Pat Grimes, previously head of U.S. trading for AOT Energy Americas, and last year it acquired Bridger’s crude transportation business to expand its presence in trucking and crude hauling. Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) first identified Pilot Flying J as the buyer of NGL Energy’s TransMontaigne assets."

-20.96690947901565," UPDATE 1-NGL Energy looking to expand Delaware Basin water business -CEO (Adds background on water business, CEO comments) HOUSTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator NGL Energy Partners LP is looking to expand its position in its growing water solutions business in the Delaware Basin, and sees one or two attractive assets remaining in the largest U.S. oil field, Chief Executive Mike Krimbill said on Thursday. The Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company will participate in any sale processes initiated for those water assets but does not plan to start “a buying spree” in the water segment, Krimbill said in a call with investors. NGL Energy spent about $200 million in capital expenditures on its water solutions business earlier this year, and processed about 849,0000 barrels of wastewater per day in the quarter ended in June, the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2020. The water business generated about $41.1 million in pre-tax earnings. The company reported a quarterly loss of 96 cents per common unit. “We see a wall of water coming at the end of September,” Krimbill said, though the company has not provided guidance on water volumes for coming months. “We’re expecting very significant ramp through the last half of the year.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton in Houston Editing by Bill Trott and Paul Simao)"
