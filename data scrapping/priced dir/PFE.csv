16.789982768566947," Pfizer to double weekly U.S. output of vaccine in next few weeks - CEO PORTAGE, Mich. (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Friday that the drugmaker expects to be able to double the weekly number of doses of its COVID-19 vaccine it will supply to the United States in the next few weeks. Bourla, speaking after U.S. President Joe Biden toured his company’s vaccine manufacturing facility in Michigan, said Pfizer was currently sending out an average of 5 million doses per week and expects to “more than double that number” in coming weeks. “We have improved our processes to double the batch size and increase yield and we have deployed more efficient lab test methods to reduce release times,” Bourla said in his remarks. He said those measures allowed the company to reduce the time it takes to make the vaccine from 110 days to 60 days. Bourla said that by Feb. 17, Pfizer had supplied the United States with 40 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech SE. The company has agreed to supply 300 million doses to the United States by the end of July. Bourla said Biden had challenged the company to beat that target, and it would look for ways to improve its production."

16.789982768566947," First month of shots find no safety issues with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna vaccines: U.S. data (Reuters) - The two COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States have reassuring safety profiles with no concerning new issues found in data collected from the first month of vaccinations, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday. After administration of 13.8 million doses of the Pfizer/ BioNTech and Moderna Inc vaccines to the U.S. population, most reports indicated non-serious side effects of the type that had been expected, such as headaches and fatigue. No deaths have been attributed to the vaccines, the data showed. The CDC collected data between Dec. 14, 2020 and Jan. 13, 2021 from both an existing national surveillance system for adverse events and its own safety monitoring system established for COVID-19 vaccines. During that time, 6,994 reports of adverse events after vaccination were recorded in the national surveillance system with 90.8% of them classified as non-serious and 9.2% as serious. Rare cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction requiring medical attention, were reported with both vaccines at a rate of 4.5 cases per million doses administered, down from the agency’s previously reported rate of 5 per million doses administered. “Healthcare providers and vaccine recipients can be reassured about the safety of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,” the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. A total of 113 deaths were reported and available information, including from death certificates and autopsy reports, found no causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and fatalities, CDC said."
16.789982768566947," South Africa advisers back Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after study JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Two of the South African government’s top advisers on COVID-19 backed Pfizer’s vaccine on Friday, despite a study earlier this week showing that the dominant local coronavirus variant may reduce protective antibodies it triggers. The country is counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering its first Johnson & Johnson doses on Wednesday. AstraZeneca vaccinations are on hold after a small local trial found the shot offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year. The laboratory study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the 501Y.V2 variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer vaccine by two-thirds. But scientists were quick to caution that because the study’s findings were from a lab it was difficult to judge what they might mean in the real world. Professor Barry Schoub, chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, told Reuters the two-thirds reduction in antibodies mentioned in the study “means there is quite a significant remnant neutralising potency, ... we feel Pfizer is still a very good vaccine in our context”. The advisory committee held its regular weekly meeting on Thursday and discussed the study. While it has not been established in a clinical trial that the Pfizer vaccine protects against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, “we can have a reasonable extrapolation because it’s such a potent stimulator of the immune system”, Schoub said, adding that authorities would monitor closely those who get the Pfizer vaccine. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday that South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June. ‘WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS’ Professor Salim Abdool Karim, another government adviser, said in a separate interview that the reduction in neutralising activity identified in the study was “within the tolerable limits of what we can accept”. Importantly, he said, it was not yet established that antibodies against the spike protein that the virus uses to infect human cells correlate with protection. “It is one of many hypotheses that are currently being investigated,” he said, adding: “We do not know what it is in these vaccines that’s leading to protection.” Asked whether he would recommend pausing Pfizer vaccinations for now, he said: “No, in fact the opposite. This is within our tolerable limits of neutralisation.” He said there was little point in doing a clinical study to further test the Pfizer vaccine against the local variant because it was already being adapted with a 501Y.V2 insert. “So if we had to start a clinical study, by the time we get the results they will already have their new vaccine,” he continued. South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and over 48,000 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa. It lagged richer nations in launching its immunisation campaign."
16.789982768566947," Turkey to procure 105 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines by end-April - Sabah ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey aims to procure 105 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of April, its health minister said on Friday, adding Ankara would also receive some 800,000 doses of the shots developed by Pfizer and BioNTech this month. Ankara started a nationwide vaccination programme last month that has so far administered a first dose to some 5.5 million people. More than a million people have received the second dose of the vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd, according to health ministry data. Speaking to the Sabah newspaper, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said Turkey planned to procure a further 105 million doses by the end of April, but did not specify which vaccines would be obtained. He said Turks would be given the option to choose between the Sinovac and BioNTech shots once both are available. “By the end of April, a procurement of 105 million vaccine doses is being planned,” Koca said. “It is expected that around 800,000 doses of (BioNTech) vaccines will arrive this month,” he was quoted as saying. Koca said Turkey was preparing to administer 35 million shots in March. “Citizens whose vaccination turn arrives will be presented this option. Their confirmations will be received. This vaccine will also especially be offered to the group of 60 year-olds and younger,” he said, referring to BioNTech’s shots. Turkey has ordered 50 million doses of Sinovac’s Coronavac and has been in talks to buy shots developed by other companies. Ankara has so far received 13 million doses of Coronavac, but no BioNTech shots. Turkey has reported more than 2.6 million cases and nearly 28,000 deaths from COVID-19 since March. In December, it imposed weekend lockdowns, nightly curfews and other curbs in the face of rising cases. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday Turkey will begin a gradual return to “normal life” in March on a province-by-province basis."

16.789982768566947," Israeli studies find Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine reduces transmission JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine greatly reduces virus transmission, two Israeli studies have found, shedding light on one of the biggest questions of the global effort to quash the pandemic. Data analysis in a study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Pfizer Inc found the Pfizer vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech reduces infection, including in asymptomatic cases, by 89.4% and in syptomatic cases by 93.7%. Findings of the pre-published study, not yet peer-reviewed, but based on a national database that is one of the world’s most advanced, were first reported by the Israeli news site Ynet late on Thursday and were obtained by Reuters on Friday. Pfizer declined to comment and the Israeli Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A separate study by Israel’s Sheba Medical Center published on Friday in The Lancet medical journal found that among 7,214 hospital staff who received their first dose in January, there was an 85% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 within 15 to 28 days with an overall reduction of infections, including asymptomatic cases detected by testing, of 75%. More research is needed to draw a definitive conclusion, but the studies are among the first to suggest a vaccine may stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and not just prevent people getting ill. Michal Linial, a professor of molecular biology and bioinformatics at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, said the findings were a big step towards answering one of the most important questions in combating the pandemic. “Whether it is 75 or 90 percent reduction doesn’t matter - it is a big drop in transmission,” Linial said. “It means that not only is the individual vaccinated protected, the inoculation also provides protection to his or her surroundings.” The researchers said further study was needed on asymptomatic transmission among people fully vaccinated because they are less likely to be tested for COVID-19. Vaccine developers have also said more research was needed on transmissibility. In December, Germany’s BioNTech said it would take three to six months more study. ‘DYNAMIC VIRUS’ Leading the world in its vaccination roll out, Israel’s universal healthcare and advanced data capabilities have provided a nationwide database that can offer insights into how effective the vaccines are outside controlled clinical trials. The Health Ministry/Pfizer study analysed data collected between Jan. 17 and Feb. 6, looking at individuals who had been fully vaccinated, after receiving their second Pfizer shot. To date more than 30%, or 2.8 million of Israel’s nine million population have received both doses. Sheba’s study found that just the first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine was 85% effective, potentially fuelling a debate over the recommended two-dose schedule. Canadian researchers in a letter published this week suggested that the second Pfizer dose be delayed given the high level of protection from the first shot to increase the number of people getting vaccinated. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in December data from those trials showed the vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients before they received the second shot, but more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single-dose shot. Pfizer has said alternative dosing regimens of the vaccine have yet to be evaluated and that the decision resided with the health authorities. Another caveat is that the cohort studied at the hospital were “mostly young and healthy,” Sheba epidemiologist Gili Regev-Yochay said. Unlike with Pfizer’s clinical trial, “we don’t have many (staff) here aged over 65,” she told reporters. But she also said the Sheba study took place during a surge in coronavirus infections in Israel, which flooded hospitals with new cases. Pfizer declined to comment on the data, saying in a statement it was doing its own analysis of “the vaccine’s real-world effectiveness in several locations worldwide, including Israel”. Both studies’ findings compared with overall efficacy of around 95% in a two-dose regimen 21 days apart. The Health Ministry/Pfizer researchers found the vaccine to be effective against the British coronavirus variant that makes up about 80% of Israel’s confirmed cases. Eran Kopel, an epidemiologist at Tel Aviv University said the Sheba study was important, but it focused on one hospital and a relatively small group of people, so “one could not draw clear-cut epidemiological conclusions from it”. The Health Ministry’s data was encouraging, he said, but further research and regular surveys were needed. “The vaccinations are a very good tool but this is hardly the end. This is a dynamic virus that has surprised the scientific world with its fast pace of change and variety,” he said."
16.789982768566947," Pfizer submits data showing COVID-19 vaccine's stability at higher temperatures Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have asked the U.S. health regulator to relax requirements for their COVID-19 vaccine to be stored at ultra-low temperatures, potentially allowing it to be kept in pharmacy freezers. Approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could send a strong signal to other regulators around the world that may ease distribution of the shot in lower-income countries. The companies have submitted new temperature data to the FDA to support an update to the current label that would allow vials to be stored at -25 to -15 degrees Celsius (-13°F to 5°F) for a total of two weeks. The current label requires the vaccine to be stored at temperatures between -80ºC and -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF), meaning it has to be shipped in specially designed containers. The shot's cold-storage requirements set off a scramble among U.S. states at the beginning of the rollout for dry ice, in which it can be stored temporarily when there are no specialized freezers available, for instance in rural areas. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the higher temepratures should ""greatly expand the ability to use this vaccine in many parts of the world (or even the U.S.) that do not have the capacity for deep freeze storage"". Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine, along with Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) two-dose shot, has already won U.S. emergency-use authorization and is being widely distributed as part of the country's mass vaccination efforts. The FDA confirmed that it had received Pfizer's request and said changes to the vaccine's authorization must be requested by a company and include data supporting the change. It said authorization would come either through a granting letter or a reissued letter of authorization, either of which would be posted on the regulator's web site. The update from the drugmakers comes as two studies from Israel found that the vaccine greatly reduced virus transmission, and the shot was backed by two of the South African government's top advisers. read more The new data also will be submitted to global regulatory agencies within the next few weeks, the two companies said. A BioNTech spokeswoman declined to provide more details on the timing and which agencies would be contacted. ""The data submitted may facilitate the handling of our vaccine in pharmacies and provide vaccination centres an even greater flexibility,"" BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said. Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), which has shipped COVID-19 vaccines to several European countries, Israel, Bahrain, Mexico and Singapore, among other states, said -25 degrees would provide some relief but transportation would still not be easy. A spokeswoman said air freight would likely no longer require dry ice on board, increasing storage capacity per plane. BioNTech has said it imposed long-term storage and transportation requirements of -70 degrees out of caution because it had started stability and durability tests on its vaccine relatively late. Even though it launched its COVID-19 vaccine development programme as early as January 2020, working on four compounds in parallel, it did not decide until July which of the four to proceed with, and only then started stability tests. If approved, the less onerous storage requirements would provide significant logistical relief. The World Health Organization's COVAX global vaccine-sharing programme has so far limited distribution of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to just a few countries, partly out of concern over a lack of infrastructure in developing nations. The WHO said it was hopeful that eased requirements could broaden its reach. ""We are aware of reports of this and look forward to seeing the data. If proven correct, this could make rollout of the vaccine easier in all countries, and particularly in low-income ones,"" it said. Moderna’s product, which like Pfizer’s is based on so-called messenger RNA molecules, is already cleared for storage at -25 to -15 degrees Celsius."
16.789982768566947," Shots bar: Israelis offered drinks on the house with their vaccine TEL AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli bar doubled as a COVID-19 vaccination clinic on Thursday, with free drinks given to those who got the shots. More than 43% percent of Israel’s 9 million population have received at least one dose of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, the Health Ministry says. But officials worry that turnout may wane and hold back Israeli plans to begin reopening the economy. With many bars forced to close because of the pandemic, Tel Aviv’s Jenia gastropub, in partnership with the municipality, opened its doors to an unusual type of patron: new vaccinees, drawn by the offer of drinks on the house. The drinks were non-alcoholic, as a medical precaution. “I thought it is a really good opportunity to come and get the vaccine, because I didn’t have either the time or the ability to go to other places,” said May Perez, among dozens of people who turned up for their first shots."

17.027289946528608," Pfizer, BioNTech start testing COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have started an international study with 4,000 volunteers to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of their COVID-19 vaccine in healthy pregnant women, the companies said on Thursday. Pregnant women are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and many public health officials have recommended some women in high-risk professions take coronavirus vaccines even without proof they are safe for them. Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, said in an interview the company could have results by the fourth quarter of 2021. Gruber said data so far suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 have higher rates of severe disease. They also have higher rates of pregnancy complications, such as premature birth, compared with pregnant women not infected by the coronavirus. That increased risk is why U.S. regulators and public health advisers “are interested in doing this in the first place - so people can be fully informed about the safety profile,” he said. Last week, the U.S. National Institutes of Health called for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in COVID-19 vaccine research. Bioethicists, vaccine and maternal health experts have argued for years that pregnant women should be included early in trials of pandemic vaccines so they would not need to wait until long after a successful one emerges. Nevertheless, pregnant women were excluded from the large U.S. trials used to obtain emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines. Drugmakers have said they first need to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective more generally. In the United States, regulators require drugmakers to conduct safety studies in pregnant animals before vaccines are tested in pregnant women to ensure they do not harm the fetus or lead to a miscarriage. The companies said those studies revealed no new risks. Pregnant women in the United States have already received their first doses, the companies said. The new study will test pregnant women aged 18 and older in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, South Africa, the UK and Spain. Women will receive the vaccine during weeks 24-34 of gestation, getting two shots 21 days apart - the same regimen used in the larger clinical trial. Shortly after giving birth, participants who got a placebo in the trial will be given an opportunity to get the actual vaccine, while remaining part of the study, the companies said. The trial will also assess whether vaccinated pregnant women transfer protective antibodies to their babies."

17.027289946528608," Pfizer plans to test COVID-19 vaccine booster targeting the South African variant NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top Pfizer Inc scientist said on Thursday the company is in intensive discussions with regulators to test a booster shot version of its coronavirus vaccine specifically targeted for a highly contagious variant that is spreading widely in South Africa and elsewhere. A laboratory study released on Wednesday suggested that the South African virus variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by two-thirds, but it is not clear how much that reduces the shot’s effectiveness against this version of the pathogen. Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists and a co-author of the study, said in an interview he believes the current vaccine is highly likely to still protect against the concerning variant first discovered in South Africa. “A level of neutralizing antibodies that may be on the order of between a third and a half the level of neutralizing antibodies you see against the original virus does not mean you have only a third to half of the protection level, you may well have full protection,” he said. University of Texas Medical Branch professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he also believes the lessened immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection. Shi said that in clinical trials, both the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and a similar shot from Moderna Inc conferred some protection after the first of two doses with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels seen in the laboratory study of the South African variant. Still, Dormitzer, chief scientific officer of viral vaccines at Pfizer Vaccines Research and Development, said the company was developing plans to test a redesigned booster for the vaccine. “We’re not doing that primarily because we think that means that we’re going to need to change that vaccine,” he said. “It’s primarily to learn how to change strain, both in terms of what we do at the manufacturing level, and especially what the clinical results are. “So if a variant comes along for which there is clinical evidence of escape, we’re ready to respond very quickly,” Dormitzer added. He said the company has already made a DNA template for a prototype vaccine targeting the variant and plans to manufacture a batch of it. The company is proposing to do a Phase I clinical trial of a booster shot of that prototype vaccine that it would test against a booster for the current vaccine. “This will be a immunogenicity study where you look at the immune response. And those studies are much, much smaller than the giant efficacy studies,” Dormitzer said. “In immunogenicity studies you can look at the immune response of every person in the study. It’s not as definitive as efficacy data, for sure. But it can be gathered much more quickly,” he explained. The company would likely conduct some animal testing in parallel as well, he said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet released a roadmap for how companies should design trials of coronavirus booster shots."

17.027289946528608," Pfizer study another worry for South Africa's vaccine rollout JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Scientists will meet on Thursday to advise South Africa’s government on its next steps after a study suggested the dominant local coronavirus variant may reduce protective antibodies from Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by two-thirds. The laboratory study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is another worry for the country hardest-hit by the pandemic on the African continent after it placed AstraZeneca vaccinations on hold earlier this month. Although its implications on the real-world efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine are not yet clear, the study comes after clinical trial data on the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novavax vaccines showed reduced efficacy against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, first identified late last year. South Africa has been counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering the first J&J doses on Wednesday. It is considering swapping or selling its AstraZeneca doses, after a small local trial, where participants were on average 31 years old, showed the vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the 501Y.V2 variant. Officials are more confident about the J&J shot because it was shown to be effective against severe illness in the local leg of a large global trial. The study published on Wednesday took into account all key mutations of the 501Y.V2 variant. A paper published in late January assessed the impact of only three key mutations of the variant. Scientists say that because the new study’s findings come from a laboratory, it is not easy to extrapolate what they might mean in the real world. Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, said it was “far from proven” that the Pfizer vaccine would be less effective against the 501Y.V2 variant. He said cellular immunity - as well as antibodies - was important in protecting against the virus and that scientists did not know the level of neutralising antibodies needed for immunity. “Our scientists will be meeting to discuss it (the study) and they will advise the minister,” health ministry spokesman Popo Maja said. Barry Schoub, chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, said the committee would discuss the study alongside information on other vaccines. Asked to comment on the findings, he said: “The Pfizer vaccine is enormously effective at 95%, so even if there is quite a significant reduction there still will be quite a bit of remnant efficacy left. “It is very likely that it will protect to a reasonable extent, certainly against severe illness and mild to moderate to some extent,” he said. “STRONG ENOUGH” Richard Mihigo, an immunisation official at the World Health Organization’s Africa office, told a news conference the antibody response to the variant in the Pfizer study was “strong enough”. Linda-Gail Bekker, co-lead investigator of the South African arm of J&J’s global trial, said she would recommend rolling out the Pfizer vaccine but monitoring it in the same way as the J&J shot, which is being administered in an “implementation study” targeting up to 500,000 health workers to further test it. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June. A spokesman for regulator SAHPRA said Pfizer’s registration application was under review and declined further comment. South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and about 48,500 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa. It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign. The government plans to vaccinate 40 million people - two-thirds of the population."

Nevertheless, pregnant women were excluded from the large U.S. trials used to obtain emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines. Drugmakers have said they first need to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective more generally. In the United States, regulators require drugmakers to conduct safety studies in pregnant animals before vaccines are tested in pregnant women to ensure they do not harm the fetus or lead to a miscarriage. The companies said those studies revealed no new risks. Pregnant women in the United States have already received their first doses, the companies said. The new study will test pregnant women aged 18 and older in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, South Africa, the UK and Spain. Women will receive the vaccine during weeks 24-34 of gestation, getting two shots 21 days apart - the same regimen used in the larger clinical trial. Shortly after giving birth, participants who got a placebo in the trial will be given an opportunity to get the actual vaccine, while remaining part of the study, the companies said. The trial will also assess whether vaccinated pregnant women transfer protective antibodies to their babies."
17.027289946528608," Pfizer plans to test COVID-19 vaccine booster engineered for South African variant A top Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) scientist said on Thursday the company is in intensive discussions with regulators to test a booster shot version of its coronavirus vaccine specifically targeted for a highly contagious variant that is spreading widely in South Africa and elsewhere. A laboratory study released on Wednesday suggested that the South African virus variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by two-thirds, but it is not clear how much that reduces the shot's effectiveness against this version of the pathogen. Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer's top viral vaccine scientists and a co-author of the study, said in an interview he believes the current vaccine is highly likely to still protect against the concerning variant first discovered in South Africa. ""A level of neutralizing antibodies that may be on the order of between a third and a half the level of neutralizing antibodies you see against the original virus does not mean you have only a third to half of the protection level, you may well have full protection,"" he said. University of Texas Medical Branch professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he also believes the lessened immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection. Shi said that in clinical trials, both the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and a similar shot from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) conferred some protection after the first of two doses with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels seen in the laboratory study of the South African variant. Still, Dormitzer, chief scientific officer of viral vaccines at Pfizer Vaccines Research and Development, said the company was developing plans to test a redesigned booster for the vaccine. ""We're not doing that primarily because we think that means that we're going to need to change that vaccine,"" he said. ""It's primarily to learn how to change strain, both in terms of what we do at the manufacturing level, and especially what the clinical results are. ""So if a variant comes along for which there is clinical evidence of escape, we're ready to respond very quickly,"" Dormitzer added. He said the company has already made a DNA template for a prototype vaccine targeting the variant and plans to manufacture a batch of it. The company is proposing to do a Phase I clinical trial of a booster shot of that prototype vaccine that it would test against a booster for the current vaccine. ""This will be a immunogenicity study where you look at the immune response. And those studies are much, much smaller than the giant efficacy studies,"" Dormitzer said. ""In immunogenicity studies you can look at the immune response of every person in the study. It's not as definitive as efficacy data, for sure. But it can be gathered much more quickly,"" he explained. The company would likely conduct some animal testing in parallel as well, he said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet released a roadmap for how companies should design trials of coronavirus booster shots."
17.027289946528608," Pfizer says South African variant could significantly reduce protective antibodies (This February 17 story corrects headline and first paragraph to show the reduction was in the protective antibodies elicited by the vaccine, not the protection of the vaccine overall) (Reuters) - A laboratory study suggests that the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE vaccine by two-thirds, and it is not clear if the shot will be effective against the mutation, the companies said on Wednesday. The study found the vaccine was still able to neutralize the virus and there is not yet evidence from trials in people that the variant reduces vaccine protection, the companies said. Still, they are making investments and talking to regulators about developing an updated version of their mRNA vaccine or a booster shot, if needed. For the study, scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) developed an engineered virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious coronavirus variant first discovered in South Africa, known as B.1.351. The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines. Researchers tested the engineered virus against blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine, and found a two- thirds reduction in the level of neutralizing antibodies compared with its effect on the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials. Their findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Because there is no established benchmark yet to determine what level of antibodies are needed to protect against the virus, it is unclear whether that two-thirds reduction will render the vaccine ineffective against the variant spreading around the world. However, UTMB professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he believes the Pfizer vaccine will likely be protective against the variant. “We don’t know what the minimum neutralizing number is. We don’t have that cutoff line,” he said, adding that he suspects the immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection. That is because in clinical trials, both the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and a similar shot from Moderna Inc conferred some protection after a single dose with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels caused by the South African variant in the laboratory study. Even if the concerning variant significantly reduces effectiveness, the vaccine should still help protect against severe disease and death, he noted. Health experts have said that is the most important factor in keeping stretched healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. More work is needed to understand whether the vaccine works against the South African variant, Shi said, including clinical trials and the development of correlates of protection - the benchmarks to determine what antibody levels are protective. Pfizer and BioNTech said they were doing similar lab work to understand whether their vaccine is effective against another variant first found in Brazil. Moderna published a correspondence in NEJM on Wednesday with similar data previously disclosed elsewhere that showed a sixfold drop antibody levels versus the South African variant. Moderna also said the actual efficacy of its vaccine against the South African variant is yet to be determined. The company has previously said it believes the vaccine will work against the variant."

The shortfall is another blow to the EU, which has also been hit by delays in vaccine deliveries from Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and U.S. biotech Moderna Inc (MRNA.O). It had also faced earlier delays with the shot from Pfizer. The situation raises questions about the rationale of an EU vaccine export control scheme set up in late January to ensure timely deliveries that has not yet been activated, despite the supply shortfalls. This week, Pfizer delivered to the EU 4.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech , according to an EU official who is directly involved in talks with the U.S. company. That takes the total to about 28 million doses of the two-shot vaccine, one of the EU officials and a source familiar with the matter said. That is still about 10 million doses less than Pfizer had promised to supply since the rollout began late last year, the EU official said. A second EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers confirmed the shortfall but said the companies had committed to delivering those doses by the end of March. Pfizer declined to comment, saying schedules of its deliveries were confidential. The executive European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on delivery shortfalls. EU officials have said Pfizer committed to delivering 3.5 million doses a week from the start of January. This week's larger delivery suggests the company is increasing supplies to make up for an earlier shortfall. About 5 million doses will be delivered next week and in the first week of March, one of the officials said. In mid-January, there was a temporary hiccup in supplies. EU officials said that was largely resolved last month. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the EU on Dec. 21. The following day, BioNTech said the companies would ship 12.5 million doses to the EU by the end of the month. Only a portion of those doses due in December have been delivered, the EU officials said. But the source familiar with the matter said that under the agreement with the EU, 12.5 million doses that BioNTech earmarked in December for the bloc were included in the delivery target for the first quarter of 2021. It was not immediately clear how the difference in schedules came about, but it highlights the complexity of supply deals as governments around the world scramble to secure shots to curb the pandemic. The EU has two contracts with Pfizer for the supply of 600 million vaccine doses. TRADE FLOWS Although the EU's own supplies have fallen short, the European Commission has approved all requests for export of COVID-19 vaccines - mostly from Pfizer/BioNTech - since it set up its mechanism to monitor flows. In the period between Jan. 30 and Feb. 16, the EU gave the green light to 57 requests for vaccine export to 24 countries, including Britain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a Commission spokeswoman said on Wednesday. Before the monitoring scheme was set up, the bloc had already exported millions of vaccine doses to Israel, Britain and Canada among others, according to customs data cited in a EU document seen by Reuters. Israel has inoculated more than 75% of its population, including first and second doses, figures from University of Oxford-based Our World in Data show. The UAE has administered vaccines to around 50% of its population and for Britain it is above 20%. EU countries on average stand at about 5%.

Israeli HMO Maccabi, which covers over a quarter of all Israelis, said in a statement that only 608 people had tested positive for COVID-19 more than a week after receiving the second of two required Pfizer doses. The comparison was against a group of 528,000 Israelis with similar backgrounds who did not receive the vaccine, Maccabi said. Of those, 20,621 tested positive. “By comparing the proportion of new cases between the vaccinated and yet-to-be vaccinated groups, efficacy of the vaccine in Israel is currently estimated at 95%, seven or more days after receiving the second dose,” Maccabi said. Most of the 608 infected vaccinees reported only mild symptoms, such as a headache or cough, Maccabi said. Some 21 required hospitalisation, seven of whom had severe symptoms, it added. The data by Maccabi reinforces efficacy findings by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, which following a late-stage trial also found their vaccine to be 95% effective. Nearly 44% of Israel’s 9.1 million citizens have received at least one shot of the Pfizer vaccine, making the country the largest real-world study of its efficacy.

Workers at Tokyo Medical Center were among the first of some 40,000 medical professionals targeted to receive the initial shipments of the vaccine. They will be followed by 3.7 million more medical personnel, then 36 million people aged 65 and over. “This is the first major step towards ending the coronavirus (pandemic),” Vice Health Minister Hiroshi Yamamoto told reporters at the hospital after the first vaccines were administered. Suga has said that vaccine deployment will be critical to holding a successful Olympics, delayed from last year and due to start in late July. The government is aiming to secure enough vaccines for its entire population of 126 million by mid-2021. A complete roll-out could take a year, vaccination programme chief Taro Kono said on Tuesday. There are also fears that millions of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine doses could be wasted due to a shortage of syringes required to maximise the number of shots from each vial. Tokyo Medical Center said it has enough supply for now of the low dead-space syringes needed to extract six doses from each vial. It plans to inoculate 60 people a day starting on Thursday to both minimise the amount of vaccine that could go to waste and monitor people who receive a dose. Hospital director Kazuhiro Araki said he wanted to set an example for others by receiving the first injection. “I don’t like getting shots very much,” Araki told reporters. “I’m glad it didn’t hurt. I feel relieved.” Japan has signed contracts to procure a combined total of 314 million vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc and BionTech, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc - enough for 157 million people. Japan has so far recorded about 415,000 COVID-19 cases, including 7,013 deaths. Although daily cases have been in decline in recent weeks after peaking in early January, Tokyo and nine other prefectures remain under a state of emergency to prevent further spread of the disease. Japan is the last member of the Group of Seven industrialised nations to launch a vaccination drive.

Japan’s vaccination programme chief Taro Kono announced the launch of the programme at a news conference on Tuesday after the government officially approved Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday, the first such approval in Japan. But fears are growing in Japan that millions of doses of Pfizer vaccine could be wasted due to a shortage of special syringes that maximise the number of shots used from each vial. The government has made urgent requests, but manufacturers are struggling to ramp up production fast enough, creating the latest headache for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who suffers from weak public support. “We are still trying to secure these special syringes,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said on Tuesday. Japan’s vaccination drive, the last to be launched among G7 industralised nations, will start with 40,000 medical workers. The government will then target people aged 65 or above, those with existing health conditions, and workers at elderly care facility workers. The vaccination drive would be completed within a year, Kono said. “Now that we are starting our inoculation drive - a crucial card to play in our fight against the coronavirus pandemic - I hope that many people get vaccinated while correctly understanding the benefits and risks,” he said. Inoculating Japan’s population swiftly is a top priority for Suga’s government as he is determined to hold the Tokyo Olympics this summer after the Games were postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan, with a population of 126 million, has so far signed contracts to procure 314 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc, enough for 157 million people. Japan last month signed a contract with Pfizer Inc to procure 144 million doses of its vaccine, or enough for 72 million people. One vial is meant for six shots, Pfizer says, but it takes special syringes that retain a low volume of solution after an injection to extract six doses, while only five shots can be taken with standard syringes that the government has stored up in preparation for the inoculation drive. When asked last week, Kato did not directly answer questions whether the shortage of the ideal syringe meant the number of shots Japan can administer would be reduced, but on Tuesday he conceded that without it there would be waste. “When it comes to what’s left in vials and syringes, what’s unused will be disposed of,” Kato said. Both a Pfizer Japan spokeswoman and a Japanese health ministry official declined to say whether the contract to supply Japan with 144 million doses of vaccine by the end of the year is based on six doses being taken from each vial. “I want to do everything I can to make sure that we can get six doses, considering that there are so many people around the world waiting to be vaccinated, and Japan can’t be the one country that is wasting its vaccines,” Kono said. In a bid to minimise the amount of vaccine left unused in syringes and vials, the government is asking medical equipment manufacturers to boost output of the low dead-space syringes, but there are doubts whether that can be done quickly enough. Although daily cases have been in decline in recent weeks in Japan after peaking in early January, Tokyo and nine other prefectures are still under the coronavirus state of emergency."

16.763405237678427," Israeli study finds 94% drop in symptomatic COVID-19 cases with Pfizer vaccine JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s largest healthcare provider on Sunday reported a 94% drop in symptomatic COVID-19 infections among 600,000 people who received two doses of the Pfizer’s vaccine in the country’s biggest study to date. Health maintenance organization (HMO) Clalit, which covers more than half of all Israelis, said the same group was also 92% less likely to develop severe illness from the virus. The comparison was against a group of the same size, with matching medical histories, who had not received the vaccine. “It shows unequivocally that Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine is extremely effective in the real world a week after the second dose, just as it was found to be in the clinical study,” said Ran Balicer, Clalit’s chief innovation officer. He added that the data indicates the Pfizer vaccine, which was developed in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech, is even more effective two weeks or more after the second shot. Researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science, who have been tabulating national data, said on Sunday that a sharp decline in hospitalisation and serious illness identified earlier among the first age group to be vaccinated - aged 60 or older - was seen for the first time in those aged 55 and older. Hospitalisations and serious illness were still rising in younger groups who began vaccinations weeks later. Israel has been conducting a rapid vaccine rollout and its database offers insights into vaccine effectiveness and at what point countries might attain herd immunity."

With nearly 43% of citizens having received at least one shot of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, Israel has pushed ahead with a gradual relaxing of lockdown measures imposed on Dec. 27. Malls, open-air markets, libraries and museums will be allowed to reopen on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Monday. Also on Sunday, Israelis in possession of a “Green Pass” - a certificate of presumed COVID-19 immunity, displayed on an Israeli Health Ministry app - will be allowed entry to leisure facilities such as gyms and hotels, the statement said. Officials had initially planned to launch the Green Pass leisure access on Feb. 23.

16.50140516356236," COVID-19 vaccines touch down in Australia, New Zealand, inoculations to start SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand have received their first COVID-19 vaccine deliveries and will begin rolling out inoculations in the coming week, while populous cities of Melbourne and Auckland remained locked down following the emergence of new cases. “The Eagle has landed,” Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Canberra on Monday as the first shipment of 142,000 doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech touched down. Vaccination in Australia will start from Feb. 22. In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the first batch of 60,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines had arrived and would undergo safety checks before border workers start receiving vaccinations from Saturday. “This will be the largest full-scale vaccination campaign in this country’s history,” Ardern said. “We have purchased enough vaccines to cover all New Zealanders and to do so for free. That includes all those in New Zealand regardless of their visa status,” Ardern said. Both countries have snap lockdowns in place in populous cities after a cluster emerged from a quarantine hotel in Melbourne and as New Zealand authorities investigate how a strain of a highly transmissible UK variant was found in three members of an Auckland family. Victoria, Australia’s second-most populous state, reported one new case on Monday, taking the total in the cluster linked to the quarantine hotel to 17. The most recent is the mother of a three-year-old child who tested positive a day earlier. The leader of Victoria said it was too early to say if the five-day lockdown would end as planned on Wednesday evening. Its over 6 million residents are required to stay home except for essential shopping and work, caregiving and outdoor exercise. The Australian Open tennis tournament, being held in the state capital of Melbourne until Feb. 21, has barred spectators until the end of the lockdown. Across the Tasman Sea, Auckland’s nearly 2 million residents were plunged into a new three-day lockdown on Sunday, prompting Australia to suspend a travel bubble with New Zealand. Auckland’s lockdown is the first in six months for New Zealand, after a hard shutdown early in the pandemic appeared to have largely eliminated local transmission. New Zealand was ranked the best performing nation among almost 100 in an index by Australia’s Lowy Institute based on containment of the coronavirus. Australia came in at number 10 as border closures and lockdowns in both countries successfully contained the spread. New Zealand has reported 2,330 confirmed and probable cases since the start of the pandemic, including 25 deaths. That compares to under 29,000 cases and 909 deaths in Australia."

Battling a sharp spike in infections in recent weeks which has overwhelmed its healthcare system, Lebanon took delivery of 28,500 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Saturday, the first batch of 2.1 million doses set to arrive in stages throughout the year. Delays in signing a deal to purchase a vaccine and the rollout of an inoculation programme have caused frustration in Lebanon. The World Bank, which helped fund the first batch of doses, has said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need. “I will not be receiving the vaccine today, for today is not my turn and the priority is for the medical sector that has done its duty and presented big sacrifices,” caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab told reporters at the Rafik Hariri hospital, where Lebanon’s first coronavirus case was quarantined about a year ago. Tizani, who is better known by his stage name Abou Salim, encouraged everyone to get the vaccine. “For those who are afraid to get vaccinated, I swear by God, it is protection for them,” he said. The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

16.633414992240247," Sanofi's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate not ready this year, CEO says PARIS (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi and U.S. group Translate Bio “will not be ready this year,” the French drugmaker’s chief executive told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Clinical trials of this vaccine, which will be based on a technology known as mRNA -- on which lean approved vaccines of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna --, are expected to start this quarter. In December last year, Sanofi had said it was targeting “earliest potential approval” of the shot in the second half of 2021, following positive preclinical data. “This vaccine will not be ready this year, but it could be of use at a later stage all the more if the fight against variants was to continue,” Paul Hudson was quoted as saying. The CEO gave no other details. Officials at Sanofi were not available for comment. The news could mark another blow for Sanofi, already embattled with a delay for another COVID-19 vaccine candidate it hopes to bring to patients and for which the company has teamed up with Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline. The two groups stunned investors last year by warning their traditional, protein-based COVID-19 jab showed an insufficient immune response in older people, delaying its launch towards the end of 2021. To appease critics, Sanofi said last month it had agreed to fill and pack millions of doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from July. Some 108 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and more than 2.4 million have died since first cases were identified in China in December 2019, according to a Reuters tally. Countries worldwide have since the beginning of the year embarked on mass vaccination programmes, with mixed results, and are now confronted with the emergence of several variant strains which forces them to move even more quickly."
16.633414992240247," First COVID-19 vaccines land in Lebanon under World Bank's watch BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines on Saturday with aid from the World Bank, which said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need. About 28,500 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine landed at Beirut airport, the first of 2.1 million doses set to arrive in stages throughout the year. Doctors hope this will ease the pressure on hospitals, battered over the past year by a financial crisis and a port explosion and now fighting some of the region’s highest infection rates. In its first operation funding the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, the World Bank reallocated $34 million from an existing health project in Lebanon to help launch the vaccination programme. “We will MONITOR fair and transparent distribution to PRIORITY groups,” Ferid Belhaj, its regional vice president, wrote in a tweet. He said health workers and the elderly would be first in line, warning against favoritism. Caretaker health minister Hamad Hassan told reporters it was a “dream come true” that the first vaccines had arrived nearly a year after Lebanon detected its first case of the virus. He pledged the vaccines would eventually reach everyone, seeking to dispel fears that politicians would try to jump the queue. “THE BEST GIFT” Firass Abiad, head of Rafik Hariri hospital, said its medical staff would get their shots within 24 hours. “The best gift one can ask for on Valentine’s day,” he said on Twitter on Saturday. The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The total number of doses ordered so far would cover about half of Lebanon’s population of more than six million, which includes at least a million Syrian refugees. Hassan has said Lebanon’s president, parliament speaker and premier would get some of the first vaccines to boost morale. Nearly a month into a strict lockdown that has cut off livelihoods and fuelled protests, the government began lifting some restrictions this week. Still, most businesses are closed and a 24-hour curfew remains in effect. Since January, a surge in infections has flooded Lebanon after lax measures during Christmas. The outbreak took the nation’s total death toll to almost 4,000. Many ICU wards have filled up, with shortages of dollars and medical supplies spawning a black market for oxygen tanks."
15.44090661572104," Vaccinated COVID-19 patients appear less contagious; arthritis drug in spotlight (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. COVID-19 post-vaccination may be less contagious People who get a COVID-19 vaccine can still become infected with the novel coronavirus, although they are likely to be protected against severe illness, and a new study suggests they also may be less contagious. At a large Israeli health maintenance organization where 650,000 members received the two-dose vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, researchers identified 2,897 patients who later tested positive for COVID-19. The amounts of virus on swab samples from the nose and throat were reduced four-fold for infections occurring at least 12 days after the first dose of vaccine compared to what is typically seen in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, the research team from Maccabi Health Services and the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology found. Viral loads are known to be linked with contagiousness and disease severity. But this study was not a randomized trial and it did not look at patients' viral loads over time, nor the rates at which their contacts became infected, which would be the most direct evidence of whether a vaccine reduces virus transmission. Still, the authors concluded in a paper posted on Monday on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review, ""These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread."" (bit.ly/2LK5HnE) Study shows range of COVID-19 benefits from arthritis drug A large study adds to evidence that Roche's arthritis drug tocilizumab, sold under the brand name Actemra, cuts the risk of death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, shortens their hospital stays and reduces their need for mechanical ventilation. The randomized trial involved more than 4,000 patients with varying degrees of illness. Some needed only simple oxygen therapy while others needed mechanical ventilation. Most also were receiving a steroid such as dexamethasone. The rate of death within 28 days was 29% for patients in the tocilizumab group and 33% in the control group, according to a report posted on Thursday on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review. After accounting for patients' age, sex and other risk factors, tocilizumab was associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of death. ""We now know that the benefits of tocilizumab extend to all COVID patients with low oxygen levels and significant inflammation,"" study co-leader Peter Horby of the University of Oxford said in a press statement. Used in combination with steroids, Horby added, ""the impact is substantial."" (bit.ly/3aUZhuy) Bone marrow cells travel to brain in some COVID-19 patients Very large bone-marrow cells are showing up in the brains of people who died of COVID-19, which may help explain some of the neurological problems associated with the disease, according to researchers. The cells, called megakaryocytes, normally reside in the bone marrow and make platelets for blood clotting. “We found that in some patients who died of COVID-19, the capillaries - the smallest blood vessels - contained very large cells called megakaryocytes,” study leader David Nauen of Johns Hopkins University told Reuters. “They are so large they could be occluding blood flow through the capillaries and limiting oxygen delivery to the brain, which could impair brain function.” As reported on Friday in the journal JAMA Neurology, his team studied brain tissue from 15 patients who died of COVID-19 and found megakaryocytes in five of their brains. “What signaled these cells to leave the bone marrow and travel to the brain is unknown, but COVID-19 causes disruptions of the clotting system, and it’s possible this is related,” Nauen said.

The government will aim to give final approval as early as Sunday, Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said vaccinations will begin from the middle of next week, starting with some 10,000 health workers. The government hopes to secure enough supplies for the whole populace by mid-year. About 400,000 doses arrived at Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, on Friday aboard a flight from Brussels, Kyodo reported. There had been concern that the European Union could block exports of the shots, prompting Japan’s vaccine chief to warn against growing nationalism over supplies. The European Commission, the EU executive, said on Thursday it had so far approved all requests for the export of COVID-19 vaccines, including to Japan, after setting up a mechanism to monitor vaccine flows on Jan. 30. A Japanese health ministry official declined to comment on reports of the vaccine’s arrival, citing security reasons. Japan has arranged to buy 144 million doses of the vaccine made by the U.S. drugmaker and German partner BioNTech, enough to inoculate 72 million people. It also has deals for vaccines developed by AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and Novavax Inc. So far, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have submitted applications for approval. Most of Japan is still under a state of emergency after its third and most deadly wave of the virus hit late last year. Cases and fatalities have trended lower in the past couple of weeks and Tokyo logged just over 300 cases on Friday. Japan has so far recorded about 410,000 coronavirus cases and 6,772 deaths.

Pressure has been mounting on Ardern to start vaccinations for the country’s 5 million people to take advantage of its rare position of having virtually eliminated the virus domestically. “Last year we indicated the vaccine would arrive in quarter two, and earlier this year we updated that to quarter one,” Ardern told reporters. “It’s pleasing to be receiving doses this early in quarter one.” Both New Zealand and neighbouring Australia have formally approved the vaccine jointly developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech. Australia has said it expects to begin inoculations by the end of this month, without giving a specific date. However, Ardern said the vaccination programs would have no immediate impact on a stalled trans-Tasman travel “bubble”. Australia and New Zealand had hoped to allow bilateral travel by the end of March, but fresh coronavirus outbreaks in Australia have stalled those plans. Ardern said border restrictions could be eased if there was evidence that vaccines reduce transmission. “That will be a significant step-change if we see that evidence emerge and I’m sure that will make a difference to travel in the world,” she said. “But at this stage, it won’t necessarily make a difference.” Ardern said New Zealand’s approximate 12,000 border workers would be the first to be vaccinated, followed by their household contacts.

15.416010210577774," South Africa to start vaccinating millions against local COVID-19 variant: Ramaphosa CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa has secured millions of doses of Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc vaccines to fight the highly infectious COVID-19 variant that is dominant in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday. During a televised annual state of the nation address, Ramaphosa said South Africa had secured 9 million doses of the J&J vaccine, with 500,000 expected to arrive over the next four weeks so authorities can start inoculating health workers. Another 20 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech were also on their way, he said. South Africa has been hit hard by a second wave of COVID-19, after the discovery of a new variant in the Eastern Cape, called 501Y.V2, believed to be 50% more contagious than earlier versions of the coronavirus. It has already spread to two dozen other countries. “Driven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave,” Ramaphosa said. “We must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections.” In addition, the COVAX facility co-led by the World Health Organization will provide 12 million vaccine doses, he said. COVID-19 has claimed more than 47,000 lives and infected nearly 1.5 million in South Africa since the pandemic began. Ramaphosa said the economy had shrunk by 6% between the third quarter of 2019 and that of 2020, while unemployment “now stands at a staggering 30.8%,” after 1.7 million jobs were lost. South Africa had been pinning its hopes on the cheaper AstraZeneca vaccine. Emerging scientific evidence that it is less effective against the local virus variant than other vaccines led it to switch.South Africa’s health minister on Wednesday suggested the government may sell doses of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine it may not need or swap them others. “While it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment,” Ramaphosa said, referring to the switch away from the AstraZeneca shot. The J&J vaccine requires just one shot, while the Pfizer/BioNTech option is a two-dose regimen. Ramaphosa outlined a plan to revive Africa’s most industrialised economy, with a massive programme of building or revamping ports, container terminals, energy generation and transmission, water, transport and telecoms. He also outlined plans to tackle South Africa’s dire energy shortages - which had plunged the economy into recession before the pandemic - by greatly expanding capacity, especially in renewable power. It was unclear how the government would fund the ambitious plans. South Africa is deeply in debt, and the Treasury expects a budget deficit of 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year ending March 2021. Ratings downgrades by Moody’s and Fitch late last year, putting its debt deeper into junk, will drive up borrowing costs. The government will seek bids for 2600 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind power to plug generation shortfall estimated by power utility Eskom in the coming weeks, he said. Another round of bids will be invited in August 2021, he said, adding that this will be over and above the power procurement plans already announced. Due to its reliance on coal power, South Africa is one of the world’s major CO2 emitters. Critics say it has been slow to transition to renewable energy, despite huge interest from foreign providers. “Eskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050,” Ramaphosa said."

15.868623239809276," Fact check: No evidence that the vaccine for COVID-19 caused fatalities in Israel A video shared on social media says the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19 has caused fatal reactions in recipients from Israel. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The clip, shared to Facebook on Feb. 7 (here), was originally posted to YouTube a week earlier by an Israel-based blogger (here) who records his opinions of domestic affairs and religion (here). In his footage, the video blogger makes numerous claims about the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine, such as it not being “so friendly” as “it has killed several people”. Other claims are outside the scope of this check. “What our government, the government of Israel, is doing, is quite evil,” he says. “In withholding this information from the citizens of this nation, there are people that are reacting negatively and dying after getting this vaccine, both the first and second dose. I’m not no medical expert, but I’ll tell you – to me, I see something extremely dangerous.” To make his point, the man plays a five-minute clip from an English-language radio show in which the host reads out a list of names – said to be those of people who died after getting vaccinated. According to the host (here), most of the names are taken from an unofficial website that aggregates reports of such deaths (here). This website uses personal Facebook testimonies from family members and friends of the deceased (bit.ly/3tGsgL1, bit.ly/3tGbewu), and in some cases, news reports (bit.ly/3jvQRxn). The testimonies do not offer evidence of a causal link between vaccination and death; they offer a personal timeline of a vaccination dose being given, and a death that occurred afterwards. In at least one case listed on the website, the death happened after a diagnosis of COVID-19 (bit.ly/3jvQRxn). In Israel, the Ministry of Health has an official form for anyone who experiences an adverse side-effect of the vaccine (here). As of Jan. 21, the Israeli Association of Allergy and Clinical Immunology said 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine had been administered worldwide, with just a few serious adverse reactions and “not a single case of mortality” (here). A Jan. 27 report from the health ministry detailed vaccine side-effects, and said most seen in Israel were “mild and transient” and were “similar in their frequency and character to the symptoms reported after other vaccines were given to the population” (bit.ly/3cWP2Zn). This included effects such as pain at the site of injection or a headache (here). One area of concern involved several cases of anaphylactic shock – a treatable, but severe allergic reaction. This sort of reaction is extremely rare, and no fatalities had been reported (here). Several other countries, including Norway, Germany and Belgium recently reported deaths occurring after a COVID-19 vaccine was administered, but none have been found to have a causal link (here, here, here). According to the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is safe and effective, although there are some populations for whom vaccination is not recommended (here, here). On Feb. 9, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said more than 97% of COVID-related deaths in Israel in the previous month were in people who had not been vaccinated against the disease (here).

15.868623239809276," Spain's recovering COVID-19 patients must wait six months for vaccine MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s health ministry said on Wednesday that people under the age of 55 without major health complications who have previously contracted coronavirus will have to wait six months from their diagnosis before receiving a vaccine. The provisional measure, which appears to be unique in Europe, will apply to the vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford University and AstraZeneca currently being distributed in Spain. Justifying the decision to prioritise those without a history of COVID-19, the ministry said reinfection within six months was “exceptional”. A major British study published last week found 99% of participants who previously tested positive retained antibodies for three months, while 88% still had them after six months. “If vaccine is in short supply and they are confident that they can reliably and confidently identify previously infected people, there is some rationale to this,” said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at Britain’s University of Edinburgh. People older than 55 or those with health risks that make them vulnerable to reinfection would be exempted from the delay, the ministry said. So far, healthcare professionals are the only people under 55 being inoculated, under Spain’s vaccine strategy. With its third wave receding, Spain’s 14-day infection rate dropped to 493 cases per 100,000 people on Tuesday, down from around 900 just two weeks ago. The death toll climbed by 643 to 63,704, while the health ministry reported 18,114 infections, bringing the overall tally to 3.02 million. As authorities begin to inoculate a broader section of society with the recently approved AstraZeneca shot, Madrid’s regional government said it would convert stadiums and other big venues into vaccination centres. Elsewhere in Europe, several Italian epidemiologists have said it is useless to vaccinate those who have already been infected, but Rome has not taken any decision on whether to administer jabs to recovering patients. France’s public health agency believes there is no need to inoculate people who developed a symptomatic form of the disease, although those patients can still take a shot three months after the onset of symptoms. And authorities in the Netherlands still recommend getting a jab after contracting the disease, a minimum four weeks after getting symptoms."
15.868623239809276," Vaccine vs variant: Promising data in Israel's race to defeat pandemic JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s swift vaccination rollout has made it the largest real-world study of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine. Results are trickling in, and they are promising. More than half of eligible Israelis - about 3.5 million people - have now been fully or partially vaccinated. Older and at-risk groups, the first to be inoculated, are seeing a dramatic drop in illnesses. Among the first fully-vaccinated group there was a 53% reduction in new cases, a 39% decline in hospitalizations and a 31% drop in severe illnesses from mid-January until Feb. 6, said Eran Segal, data scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. (Graphic: Trends in COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations in Israel following vaccination - ) In the same period, among people under age 60 who became eligible for shots later, new cases dropped 20% but hospitalizations and severe illness rose 15% and 29%, respectively. Reuters interviewed leading scientists in Israel and abroad, Israeli health officials, hospital heads and two of the country’s largest healthcare providers about what new data shows from the world’s most efficient vaccine rollout. The vaccine drive has provided a database offering insights into how effective the vaccines are outside of controlled clinical trials, and at what point countries might attain sought-after but elusive herd immunity. More will be known in two weeks, as teams analyse vaccine effectiveness in younger groups of Israelis, as well as targeted populations such as people with diabetes, cancer and pregnant women, among a patient base at least 10 times larger than those in clinical studies. “We need to have enough variety of people in that subgroup and enough follow-up time so you can make the right conclusions, and we are getting to that point,” said Ran Balicer, chief innovation officer of HMO Clalit, which covers more than half the Israeli population. Pfizer is monitoring the Israeli rollout on a weekly basis for insights that can be used around the world. As a small country with universal healthcare, advanced data capabilities and the promise of a swift rollout, Israel provided Pfizer with a unique opportunity to study the real-world impact of the vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech But the company said it remained “difficult to forecast the precise time when herd protection may start to manifest” because of many variables at play, including social distancing measures and the number of new infections generated by each case, known as the reproduction rate. Even Israel, in the vanguard of the global vaccine drive, has lowered expectations of emerging quickly from the pandemic because of soaring cases. A third national lockdown has struggled to contain transmission, attributed to the fast-spreading UK variant of the virus. On a positive note, the Pfizer/BioNTech shot appears to be effective against it. “We’ve so far identified the same 90% to 95% efficacy against the British strain,” said Hezi Levi, director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry. “It is still early though, because we have only now finished the first week after the second dose,” he said, adding: “It’s too early to say anything about the South African variant.” Israel began its vaccination programme Dec. 19 - the day after Hanukkah - after paying a premium for supplies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Four days later, the more contagious UK variant was detected in four people. While the vaccine is preventing illness in older people, the variant now makes up about 80% of new cases. Finding themselves in a race between the vaccine and the new variant, Israel began giving shots to those over 60 and gradually opened the programme to the rest of the population. Every detail was digitally tracked, down to in which arm the patient was jabbed and what vial it came from. One week after receiving the second Pfizer dose - the point at which full protection is expected to kick in - 254 out of 416,900 people were infected, according to Maccabi, a leading Israeli healthcare provider. (Graphic: COVID-19 infections among vaccinated people - ) Comparing this against an unvaccinated group revealed a vaccine efficacy of 91%, Maccabi said. By 22 days after full vaccination, no infections were recorded. Israeli experts are confident the vaccines rather than lockdown measures brought the numbers down, based on studying different cities, age groups and pre-vaccine lockdowns. The comparisons were “convincing in telling us this is the effect of the vaccination,” said Weizmann Institute’s Segal. With 80% of senior citizens partially or fully vaccinated, a more complete picture will begin to emerge as soon as this week. “And we do expect further decline in the overall cases and in the cases of severe morbidity,” said Balicer, of HMO Clalit. There may be early signs that vaccinations are tamping down virus transmission in addition to illness At Israel’s biggest COVID-19 testing centre, run by MyHeritage, researchers have tracked a significant decrease in the amount of virus infected people carry, known as cT value, among the most-vaccinated age groups. This suggests that even if vaccinated people get infected, they are less likely to infect others, said MyHeritage Chief Science Officer Yaniv Erlich. “The data so far is probably most clear from Israel. I do believe that these vaccines will reduce onward transmission,” said Stefan Baral, from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Maryland. It is unclear whether Israel will be able to keep up its world-leading vaccination pace. “When you vaccinate fast and a lot, you eventually get to the hardcore - those who are less willing or harder to reach,” said Boaz Lev, head of the Health Ministry’s advisory panel. The vaccination pace is seen even more crucial with the British variant’s rapid transmission. “In the race between the UK variant spreading and the vaccinations, the end result is that we are seeing a kind of plateau in terms of the severely ill,” said Segal. The big question is whether vaccines can eradicate the pandemic. Michal Linial, a professor of molecular biology and bioinformatics at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, said data from past decades suggests viruses become endemic and seasonal. She predicted this coronavirus would become far less aggressive, perhaps requiring a booster shot within three years. “The virus is not going anywhere,” she concluded."
15.868623239809276," Fact check: Pfizer and Moderna do call their COVID-19 shot a ‘vaccine’ Posts have been circulating on social media claiming that only governments are calling the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines “vaccines”, and that the companies themselves call them “biological agents” and an “Operating System designed to program Humans.” This claim is false: both Pfizer and Moderna refer to their COVID-19 vaccines as “vaccines”. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed safety data from clinical trials and granted emergency use authorizations for both vaccines. “Only Governments are calling it a vaccine. They think if they call it a vaccine long enough, people will think it is. Pfizer call it a ‘Biological Agent’. They stress is (sic) is not a vaccine it is in the ‘Investigative Stage’. They do not know what its effects will be until the trials are finished. They hope to have it passed as a vaccine in 2022. This is all on their site. REG 174 and ‘The Package’.

On its website, Moderna compares the mRNA science in its vaccine to an “operating system” (here) . however, the phrase is used in a metaphorical sense, not a literal one. It says, “Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the ‘program’ or ‘app’ is our mRNA drug - the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.” The social media posts also claim that the Pfizer vaccine is still in an “investigative stage” and its effects are as of yet unknown. In the United States the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but they are not fully FDA-approved. At the time of publication in Feb. 2021 there was no fully FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine (here   ,  here  ,  here). In the UK, the Pfizer vaccine was authorized under Regulation 174, which the social media posts mention (here). Regulation 174 says that medicinal products can be authorized by the licensing authority on a temporary basis in response to the confirmed spread of pathogenic agents that may cause harm to human beings, as laid out here  here  . The vaccines are not, however, untested and their effects unknown, as the posts claim.

15.868623239809276," Israel plans ""Green Pass"" to leisure for COVID-immune on Feb 23 JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel plans to open up some hotels, gyms and other leisure facilities in two weeks to those documented as being immune to COVID-19, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said on Wednesday, in a possible harbinger of a wider emergence from the pandemic. Having administered Pfizer Inc vaccines to almost 40% of its 9 million population, Israel saw first signs of managing to outpace highly contagious virus variants, he added. Israel has said it would issue an official app allowing users to link up to their Health Ministry files and show if they have been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19, with presumed immunity, in order to gain entry to leisure facilities. Those to whom neither applies would be able to get a COVID-19 test and, if the result is negative, display it on the app for up to 72 hours of similar access, officials have said. Initially dubbed “Green Passport”, the system has been renamed “Green Pass” in an apparent bid to head off speculation that it would also enable unfettered travel abroad. “The estimated date is the 23rd of the month,” Edelstein told Ynet TV. “We are talking about gyms, hotels, places like that, where using the Green Pass would be both appropriate and practicable.” “Today - finally, finally - there is an encouraging sign, a small reduction in morbidity,” he said. “If this vector continues, we will meet all of our commitments.” Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Kan radio that the app will be ready next week and predicted that 60% of adult Israelis would be eligible for the Green Pass by Feb. 23. After launching the vaccination drive and Israel’s third national lockdown in December, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu predicted the economy could begin reopening this month. He is up for reelection on March 23. With some kindergarten and elementary schools due to open on Thursday, Edelstein, speaking separately with reporters, said he would seek to require teachers who are not documented as being immune to COVID-19 to test negative every 48 hours. The health ministry says that around 50% of teachers have been vaccinated, and that Edelstein’s proposal would not be in effect by Thursday. Israel has logged 706,000 COVID-19 cases and 5,233 deaths. The Health Ministry gave a 5.9% infection rate on Wednesday, Israel’s lowest in a month. The “R” reproductive rate was at 0.93, having fallen steadily from the 1 threshold this week."
15.868623239809276," Pfizer could directly deliver COVID-19 shot to S.Africa vaccination points JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Pfizer said it could deliver its COVID-19 vaccine, which requires ultra-cold temperatures for storage and distribution, directly to points of vaccination in South Africa. South Africa is scrambling to secure supplies after the AstraZeneca vaccine it planned to use to kick off its immunisation campaign had greatly reduced efficacy against the COVID-19 virus variant now dominant in the country. Pfizer said it had allocated vaccine doses to South Africa and was currently in discussions with the government. “We are enabling direct shipment to the point of vaccination in a thermal shipper that will maintain the ultra-low temperature required for up to 10 days unopened,” Pfizer told Reuters in an e-mailed response to questions late on Tuesday. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine needs to be stored and distributed at around -70 degrees Celsius, requiring countries importing it to have ultra-cold chain capabilities. That is a potential impediment for countries including those in Africa with weak public health systems. “We have experience in distributing, storing and administering the vaccine in our Phase 3 trial sites around the world (including South Africa) so we already know that the processes we are using work, and patients are able to be dosed at the points of vaccination,” Pfizer said. South Africa says it has secured 20 million doses from Pfizer, with deliveries starting in the second quarter. It also expects to receive 117,000 Pfizer shots in the first quarter from the COVAX facility co-led by the World Health Organization. “The supply that will be sent to South Africa and to COVAX is manufactured at our site in Puurs, Belgium,” Pfizer said."
15.868623239809276," New Zealand to inoculate high-risk people first as COVID-19 vaccine gets full approval SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand will first administer COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine personnel, front line health workers and airline staff, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said, as the government formally approved its use on Wednesday. New Zealand’s medicines regulator last week provisionally approved the use of the COVID-19 vaccine jointly developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech. “Now we’ve reached the crucial stage of approval for the first vaccine, we are in a much better position to start having a conversation with New Zealanders about how we plan to proceed,” Hipkins said in a statement. Authorities expect the Pfizer vaccine to arrive in the country by end-March but they had expressed concerns about export curbs. Pressure has been mounting on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to start inoculations for the country’s 5 million people soon even though New Zealand has virtually eliminated the virus. With just under 2,000 confirmed cases and 25 deaths since the pandemic began, New Zealand largely escaped the high number of cases and deaths from the virus compared with many other developed countries thanks to border closures and lockdowns. But the emergence of highly contagious variants abroad and more overseas residents returning home has raised concerns of the virus spreading in the community again. Ardern’s critics have said New Zealand has fallen behind the rest of the world after promising in November that it would be first in the queue for COVID-19 vaccines. “When the first batch of vaccine arrives, we will be ready to go,” Hipkins said, adding information campaigns will begin next week. New Zealand will get 1.5 million vaccines from Pfizer, which will provide enough doses to vaccinate 750,000 people, while the medicines regulator is in talks with AstraZeneca, Janssen and Novavax regarding the approval of their COVID-19 vaccines."

Everyone arriving by air already has to prove they tested negative within the previous 72 hours and this rule is being expanded to land crossings starting on Feb. 15, Trudeau said. Although non-essential travel between the two nations is banned, hundreds of thousands of Canadians have second homes in the United States, and Ottawa is obliged to allow them to return if they wish. People who arrive without test results can be fined C$3,000 ($2,360). The measure only affects around 5% of returning Canadians because the majority arrive by air. ""We're using every tool in the toolbox to get us all through this crisis,"" Trudeau told reporters. Essential workers such as truck drivers are exempt from the new rules. Canada has recorded a total of 20,835 deaths and 808,120 cases of COVID-19. Many provinces reimposed restrictions to combat a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and as a result the number of new daily cases over the last week fell to around 3,500 from 8,000 in early January. ""This is gratifying progress,"" chief medical officer Theresa Tam told reporters. Trudeau also promised the supply of vaccines from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) would ramp up next week. His Liberal government has been attacked by critics over the slow pace of vaccinations, caused in part by a temporary reduction in supplies from Pfizer. Separately, officials said Canada would allow a sixth dose to be taken from each vial of Pfizer's vaccine rather than the originally intended five.

15.10654372310113," More than 97% of recent COVID deaths in Israel were people who weren't vaccinated, PM says JERUSALEM (Reuters) - More than 97% of COVID-19 deaths in Israel over the past month were people who had not been vaccinated, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday, as his government tries to increase turnout for the Pfizer Inc shots. Around 38% of Israel’s 9 million population have received at least one vaccine dose, the Health Ministry says. But government goals of achieving 50% coverage and reopening the economy next month have been challenged as the daily vaccination pace ebbs. “We are in a national emergency,” Netanyahu told reporters. “I want to give you a jarring fact: Over the last month - the last 30 days - 1,536 people have died (of COVID-19) in the State of Israel. More than 97% of them had not been vaccinated. Fewer than 3% had been vaccinated.” The vaccination drive began on Dec. 19 with a focus on Israelis over the age of 60 and other high-risk groups. Israel has since lowered the eligible age to 16, but sees less urgency among younger citizens who are less prone to dangerous coronavirus complications. Israeli officials also believe some people are swayed by rumours of potential lasting side-effects from the vaccines. Dismissing vaccine scepticism as “fake news”, Netanyahu added: “We are a vaccination nation. We have vaccines for every citizen, for everyone ... If you go and get vaccinated you are saving your lives.”"

14.790366785945594," South Africa puts AstraZeneca vaccinations on hold over variant data JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will put on hold use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot in its vaccination programme, after data showed it gave minimal protection against mild-to-moderate infection caused by the country’s dominant coronavirus variant. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Sunday that the government would await advice from scientists on how best to proceed, after a trial showed the AstraZeneca vaccine did not significantly reduce the risk of mild or moderate COVID-19 from the 501Y.V2 variant that caused a second wave of infections starting late last year. Prior to widespread circulation of the more contagious variant, the vaccine was showing efficacy of around 75%, researchers said. In a later analysis based mostly on infections by the new variant, there was only a 22% lower risk of developing mild-to-moderate COVID-19 versus those given a placebo. Although researchers said the figure was not statistically significant, due to trial design, it is well below the benchmark of at least 50% regulators have set for vaccines to be considered effective against the virus. The study did not assess whether the vaccine helped prevent severe COVID-19 because it involved mostly relatively young adults not considered to be at high risk for serious illness. AstraZeneca said on Saturday that it believed its vaccine could protect against severe disease and that it had already started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant. Still, professor Shabir Madhi, lead investigator on the AstraZeneca trial in South Africa, said data on the vaccine were a reality check and that it was time to “recalibrate our expectations of COVID-19 vaccines”. South Africa hopes to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population, to achieve some level of herd immunity but has yet to administer a single shot. It had hoped to roll out the AstraZeneca vaccine to healthcare workers soon after on Monday receiving 1 million doses produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Instead, it will offer health workers vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer/BioNTech in the coming weeks. “What does that mean for our vaccination programme which we said will start in February? The answer is it will proceed,” Mkhize told an online news briefing. “From next week for the next four weeks we expect that there will be J&J vaccines, there will be Pfizer vaccines.” Professor Salim Abdool Karim, an epidemiologist advising the government, said there needed to be a new approach to immunisations, given uncertainty about how effective current vaccines would be against the 501Y.V2 variant. First a vaccine should be used in a targeted group to assess hospitalisation rates, and then if it proves effective in reducing hospitalisations it could feature in a wide-scale rollout, he said. If it was not effective in reducing hospitalisations, individuals who had received it should be offered another effective vaccine, either a booster based on the variant or another vaccine, Abdool Karim added. It was probable that South Africa would experience a third wave of infections when winter starts in around four months’ time, Madhi said. He added that it would be “somewhat reckless” to discard the 1 million AstraZeneca doses the country had received when there was still a chance they could protect against severe COVID-19. Anban Pillay, health ministry deputy director-general, said the expiry date on the AstraZeneca doses was in April, but the government was speaking to the SII to seek an extension or exchange. Madhi said South Africa might want to reframe its target group for vaccination. “It really needs to be centred around the prevention of severe disease and death from what will likely be a resurgence sometime soon.”"

AstraZeneca Plc applied on Jan. 29 for full regulatory approval of the vaccine it developed with Oxford University, and will make it in Brazil in partnership with the federally funded Fiocruz biomedical center. Pfizer said it filed for registration on Friday for its vaccine called BNT162b2, backed up by late-stage trials on 44,000 volunteers in six countries - 2,900 of them in Brazil. The vaccine has an overall efficacy of 95%, and efficacy of 94% in people aged over 65, the U.S. drugmaker said in a statement. President Jair Bolsonaro, who says he will not take any COVID-19 shot, is under pressure after a slow and patchy vaccine roll-out in Brazil, which now faces a second wave of infections. Bolsonaro referred to the virus as a “little flu” but his government faces mounting criticism over its handling of the world’s second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak. For the past month, more than 1,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported daily in Brazil, and the total has passed 230,000, according to health ministry data. The AstraZeneca vaccine is the central pillar of the federal government’s vaccine plan, and the government has ordered material for Fiocruz to make up to 100 million shots. A first shipment from China of active ingredients needed to make the British vaccine locally was due to arrive later on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, where Fiocruz is based. The Fiocruz fill-and-finish production line was initially scheduled to start production in December, but has sat after delays getting the first shipment of supplies from China. To start inoculating its 210 million people, Brazil has relied on the Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd and 2 million ready-to-use AstraZeneca shots imported from India last month."

14.461637177855069," White House to invoke DPA to ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production The Biden administration is exploring every option for increasing manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, which is under regulatory review, and said on Friday that currently expected levels of early doses were less than hoped. The White House has invoked the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production and that ""every option"" was on the table to produce more Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine should it be authorized. It will also use the wartime powers to increase at-home COVID-19 tests, and make more surgical gloves in the United States, officials said at a Friday media briefing. ""As is the case with other vaccines, we have not found that the level of manufacturing allows us to have as much vaccine as we think we need coming out of the gate,"" said Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House’s COVID-19 response team, referring to the J&J vaccine. J&J applied on Thursday for U.S. emergency use authorization. It expects to have some vaccine ready for distribution as soon as authorized but has not said how much. Emergent Biosolutions' (EBS.N) Chief Executive Robert Kramer said in an interview on Friday that the company currently is making bulk drug substance for J&J ""at large scale."" Emergent is only producing bulk vaccine, which is then filled into syringes or vials and packaged for shipment by another contractor. Kramer said they were on track to make enough product for hundreds of millions of doses a year. It remains unclear what other supply bottlenecks may be. Kramer said his company had already benefited from the Defense Production Act under the Trump Administration, which helped the company get to the point where it's ready to go. Under the authority of the Defense Production Act, the government will give priority ratings to two components important to Pfizer’s vaccine production - filling pumps and tangential flow filtration units, the officials said. “We told you that when we heard of a bottleneck on needed equipment, supplies, or technology related to vaccine supply that we would step in and help, and we were doing just that,” said Tim Manning, the supply chain coordinator for the national COVID-19 response. The government will also invoke its powers under the Defense Production Act to increase at-home COVID-19 tests with six, unnamed manufacturers, aiming to produce 61 million tests by the summer, Manning said. It will also invoke its powers to increase the nation’s supply of surgical gloves, which are made almost exclusively overseas. Manning said the government will build factories that make the raw materials for surgical gloves and help build plants in the United States to make the gloves. By the end of the year, he said, the United States would be able to produce a billion gloves a month. Officials have said that once J&J's vaccine is authorized, it would mean that millions more doses would be available to states. The vaccine is one-shot, as opposed to Pfizer's and Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O) two-dose vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator. Officials have hoped that the ease of giving the J&J vaccine will mean that states will be able to more quickly immunize residents."

The decision means the vaccine will not be available for sale in the world’s two most populous countries, India and China, in the near future. Both countries are running their immunisation campaigns using other products. Unlike other companies conducting small studies in India for foreign-developed vaccines, Pfizer had sought an exception citing approvals it had received elsewhere based on trials done in countries such as the United States and Germany.

There are, however, provisions under India’s rules to waive such trials in certain conditions. The U.S. company, which was the first drugmaker to seek emergency approval in India for its vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech, made the withdrawal decision after a meeting with India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Wednesday. The drug regulator said on its website its experts did not recommend the vaccine because of side effects reported abroad were still being investigated. It also said Pfizer had not proposed any plan to generate safety and immunogenicity data in India. “Based on the deliberations at the meeting and our understanding of additional information that the regulator may need, the company has decided to withdraw its application at this time,” Pfizer said in a statement. “Pfizer will continue to engage with the authority and re-submit its approval request with additional information as it becomes available in the near future.” Reuters was the first to break the news.

14.461637177855069," Britain explores mixed COVID vaccine shots as variants threaten LONDON (Reuters) - British researchers are to explore mixing doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines in a world first trial aimed at finding new ways to swiftly reduce coronavirus infections as new mutated variants emerge. While thousands of individual changes have arisen as the virus mutates on replication and evolves into new variants, only a tiny minority are likely to be important or change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal. Among coronavirus variants currently most concerning for scientists and public health experts are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants, which appear to spread more swiftly than others. British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said current COVID-19 vaccines would probably still protect people against infection with the new variants, but this would need to be closely monitored. “Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won’t be effective on the variants ... especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalisation,” Zahawi told Sky News. “All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant - there are about 4,000 variants around the world of COVID now.” Ravi Gupta, a professor of microbiology at Cambridge University, said Zahawi had misspoken and was referring to individual mutations, not variants. “The number of mutations has little actual relevance as many mutations emerge and disappear continuously,” Gupta said. “Scientists are using ‘variants’ to describe viruses with mutations that are transmitting in the general population – there aren’t 4,000 of those.” The so-called British variant, known as VUI-202012/01 or B.1.1.7., has mutations including a change in the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor - meaning that it is probably easier to catch. “We have about 50% of the world’s genome sequencing industry, and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond - whether in the autumn or beyond - to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine,” Zahawi said. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to a Reuters tally. Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany. Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June. The trial will examine the responses to an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca’s, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks. The trial will be the first of its kind to combine a mRNA shot - the one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech - and a adenovirus viral vector vaccine of the type developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca’s shot is separately being trialled in combination with another viral vector vaccine, Russia’s Sputnik V. The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccine could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility, and might even increase immunity. Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said mixing different shots had proven effective in Ebola vaccine schedules, and though the new trial mixed vaccine technologies, it could also work. “Ultimately, it all comes down to the same target - cells making the spike protein - just using different platforms,” he told reporters. “For that reason we do anticipate that we’ll generate a good immune response with these combinations.” Public Health England’s head of immunisation, Mary Ramsay, said there was a lot of precedent for such work, as vaccines against Hepatitis A and B were interchangeable from two different manufacturers, and similar work has been undertaken for human papillomavirus (HPV)."

14.502735837708405," Canada to shrug off 'momentary disruptions' in vaccine supply, working closely with U.S. - Trudeau OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will succeed in inoculating its population despite “momentary disruptions” in the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and is working closely with the new U.S. administration to fight the disease, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday. Trudeau’s Liberal government is under pressure over the slow roll out of the vaccination program, caused in part by Pfizer Inc temporarily cutting its promised deliveries and a temporary slowdown of Moderna Inc doses. “Obviously with this global supply chain around new products and manufacturing scale-ups ... there are momentary disruptions week over week. But we’re still very much on track to get the commitments fulfilled and get many vaccines to Canadians as quickly as possible,” Trudeau said in an interview. Trudeau promised that tens of millions of doses would arrive in the months to come and reiterated that every Canadian seeking inoculation would be vaccinated by September. As part of a bid to contain the spread of the disease, Canada and the United States have closed their joint border to non-essential travel. Trudeau said he and new U.S. President Joe Biden agreed on a joint approach to fighting COVID-19. “We’re working very, very closely on all aspects of it from borders to scientific research to indeed vaccines,” he said. “Our conversations are going to continue with the U.S. on supply chains,” he said, without giving details. Last year, tensions arose between Canada and the administration of then President Donald Trump over delays in the supply of personal protective equipment. Last year Trump also signed an executive order aimed at keeping U.S.-produced vaccines in the United States. Trudeau did not give a direct answer when asked whether he would press Biden to scrap the order. Canada does not yet have a vaccine manufacturing facility of its own and is reliant on foreign suppliers. Separately, federal Procurement Minister Anita Anand said deliveries of AstraZeneca Plc’s COVID-19 vaccine could begin before the end of March, if Canada’s health regulator approves its use. AstraZeneca Canada filed a rolling application for its vaccine with Health Canada in October and is waiting for approval from the drug regulator. Health Canada is expected to complete its review soon. In a separate briefing, federal officials confirmed Canada’s most recent shipment of Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine contained 22% fewer doses than originally expected and said the next shipment, due in three weeks, would also be short. Fortin added Moderna was working in “good faith” to deliver those doses as quickly as possible to Canada and noted the obstacles would be temporary. Shipments of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, meanwhile, are expected to ramp up later this month. Trudeau’s government is also facing criticism over tapping into COVAX, a global vaccine-sharing initiative meant to help low-income countries buy doses. Canada will get 1.9 million AstraZeneca doses from the initiative. “Our government will never apologize for doing everything possible to get Canadians vaccinated as quickly as possible,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told lawmakers."

President Francisco Sagasti said that by April Peru would receive at least 500,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine co-developed with German partner BioNTech. The first 250,000 doses are slated for arrival in March, he said. Peru was initially slow to lock down supplies for its vaccination program, lagging behind wealthier neighbors in Latin America. But it has since raced to catch up, securing deals with Sinopharm and AstraZeneca earlier this year. The first lot of vaccines from Sinopharm are expected to arrive in the country on Feb. 13, Sagasti said. The South American country earlier this week approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for one year amid a recent spike in coronavirus cases that has brought local hospitals to the brink of collapse.

MIG said on Thursday that investors in its funds would now receive 340 million euros from the sale of an unspecified stake in BioNTech, following a payout of 260 million euros last year. MIG’s funds have provided funding to BioNTech, which developed the vaccine with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, since the German biotech company’s inception in 2008. BioNTech now has a market capitalisation of around $28.4 billion, more than eight times its valuation of $3.4 billion when it made its stock market debut on the Nasdaq exchange in October 2019. MIG AG general partner Kristian Schmidt-Garve said the investment firm was proud of BioNTech’s role in fighting the pandemic. “We are also very pleased that we could realise considerable returns for the shareholders in the involved funds, which amount to a multiple of the initial deposits,” he added. MIG did not say how many BioNTech shares were sold and how many it still holds in the company According to the prospectus of a $512 million BioNTech capital increase in July 2020, three MIG funds held a combined 3.9% in BioNTech after the capital raise, down from 4.4% before because they sold some shares.

14.502735837708405," Britain trial to test combining Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines in two-shot regimen LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are combined in a two-shot schedule. The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of coronavirus vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June. The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca’s, as well as vice versa, with intervals of 4 and 12 weeks. Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and Biontech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine. It is expected more vaccines will be added to the trial when they are approved and rolled out. Recruitment for the study starts on Thursday, with over 800 participants expected to take part, the researchers said. That makes it much smaller than the clinical trials that have been used to determine efficacy of the vaccines individually. The trial will not assess the overall efficacy of the shot combinations, but researchers will measure antibody and T-cell responses, as well as monitor for any unexpected side effects. Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said initial results could inform vaccine deployment in the second half of the year. “We will get some results through, we expect, by June or thereabouts that will inform the use of booster doses in the general population,” he told reporters.

14.3226301710319," South Korea holds vaccine shipping drill; approves import of Pfizer's COVID-19 shot SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in called on Wednesday for seamless preparations for coronavirus vaccinations, as regulators approved imports of Pfizer’s COVID-19 shot and the country prepared to begin inoculations later this month. Despite initial success in taming earlier outbreaks, South Korea is grappling with its third and largest wave of infections, which has fuelled criticism that the government was slow to secure vaccines for its population of 52 million. The special regulatory approval on Wednesday will allow South Korea to receive 117,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine via the COVAX global vaccine sharing scheme around mid-February, drug safety minister Kim Gang-lip told a news conference. The country has yet to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, but gave the regulatory clearance for emergency imports so it can kick off inoculation campaigns later this month, starting with about 50,000 frontline health workers. The government had said it will inoculate about 10 million high-risk people by July and aim to reach herd immunity levels by November. On Wednesday, officials conducted a vaccination preparedness drill at the Incheon international airport, west of Seoul, mobilising special freezers and running through scenarios such as a terror attack, theft and transport faults. “We need to accomplish our tasks in the actual process of transport, storage and distribution without any errors,” Moon said during the drill. “Repetitive exercises are important to ensure there won’t be any trials and errors that have occurred overseas, including missing vaccines and cold chain problems.” Vans carried containers specially made by Korean Air, the nation’s largest airline, for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which require ultra cold storage. One container can carry up to 60,000 doses at temperatures of minus 18 Celsius (minus 0.4 F) for about 100 hours, an airline official said. Vaccine centres designated in 250 indoor gyms and community halls nationwide have been fitted with cold storage equipment. South Korea reported 467 new COVID-19 cases by Tuesday, as numbers rebounded above 400 in recent days, boosted by continuing cluster infections. Health authorities said four of this month’s 27 locally transmitted cases were caused by the more transmissible variants. That takes to 39 the total infections by British and South African variants in South Korea. Authorities have extended by two weeks a requirement to observe social distancing, urging vigilance ahead of next week’s Lunar New Year holidays, when tens of millions of Koreans usually travel across the country. If the situation improves, however, the government might ease some measures this weekend, including a restaurant curfew, health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho told a briefing.

14.3226301710319," Singapore approves Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in Asia first SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has become the first country in Asia to approve Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine as it begins rolling out its immunisation programme to the wider population. The city-state expects to receive the first shipment of the Moderna shots around March, adding to its stock of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine approved in December. More than 175,000 people have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, including health workers and airline staff, while vaccination centres have been set up in recent weeks to start inoculating the elderly, authorities have said. Singapore expects to have vaccinated its entire population by the third quarter, although last month the government said it was expecting shipment delays of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines due to upgrades in Pfizer’s manufacturing plant. Singapore has signed advanced purchase agreements and made early downpayments on other promising vaccine candidates including Sinovac. Moderna’s vaccine, which can be stored and transported more easily than Pfizer’s, is approved in Europe, the United States and Canada among others. Vaccines in Singapore are voluntary and free. The country’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong was among the early recipients, hoping to boost confidence in vaccines that have stirred rare hesitancy in a country that had largely tamed the virus with strict rules, mask wearing and contact tracing. The island nation of about 5.7 million people has been reporting very few new local cases over the last few months. Since the start of the outbreak, Singapore recorded a total of more than 59,000 coronavirus cases, most of which occurred in crowded foreign worker dormitories. Only 29 people have died from the disease in Singapore, according to its health ministry."

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she still expected supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech product to arrive in the country by end-March, but expressed concern at any attempt to limit exports. “The world just can’t afford for that to happen. We won’t be safe until we have widespread rollout across the globe,” she told a news conference. “So it’s in everybody’s interest that we see vaccine programmes continuing to roll out in other countries.” Japan’s vaccine rollout chief said on Tuesday that export curbs on COVID-19 vaccines by the European Union were having an impact on supplies to the country. The World Health Organization has warned against “hoarding” as a growing number of countries agreed bilateral deals to buy millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. With vaccination drives underway in dozens of countries, pressure has been mounting on Ardern to start inoculations for the country’s 5 million people, even though New Zealand has virtually eliminated the virus. The provisional approval of the vaccine developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech meant the country could begin preparations for the first stage of its vaccination rollout, she said. People at highest risk would be vaccinated first, before the broader community from the second half of the year. “I have said 2021 is the year of the vaccine. It’s a full-year programme we have only just begun. We’re not in a race to be first, but to ensure safe and timely access to vaccines for all New Zealanders,” she said. Ardern’s critics have said New Zealand has fallen behind the rest of the world after promising in November that it would be first in the queue for COVID-19 vaccines. New Zealand’s Health Chief Ashley Bloomfield said Medsafe has placed 58 conditions on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine related to additional manufacturing data and ensuring information is provided on any safety concerns. Ardern urged New Zealanders to get inoculated as soon as vaccines were available. “I will absolutely be vaccinated, my family members will be vaccinated. But right now I am not the order of priority,” she said."

14.3226301710319," Pfizer sees about $15 billion in 2021 sales from COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Tuesday it expects to generate $15 billion, or about a quarter of its total revenue this year, from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine co-developed with German partner BioNTech SE . Sales from the vaccine - on track to be the drugmaker's top product this year - could top $15 billion if the company signs more supply contracts, it said. Pfizer aims to make two billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview that the company wanted to be conservative in its target and is working on numerous initiatives to exceed that output. ""We've increased the batches we run per week, we've doubled the output - the yield per batch - we've dramatically improved our success rates, we've made process improvements to the assembly lines,"" Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said in the interview. ""All these things are things we're continuing to examine to see what else we can do to try to produce more doses faster,"" he added. Pfizer also said it expects there could be a long-lasting need for COVID-19 vaccines, to combat new virus variants that emerge and to boost peoples' waning immune responses. The company is launching a study to determine whether a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, administered 6-to-12 months after the initial shots, can extend and improve efficacy with more contagious variants circulating in communities around the world. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently administered as two doses three weeks apart. Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said he believes mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's generate a strong enough immune response to repel the currently circulating variants, and that a booster, rather than a redesigned vaccine, is the right approach for now. Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he was optimistic that revenue contributions from the vaccine could be sustainable beyond 2021. Pfizer expects to supply 200 million doses to the U.S. government by the end of May. To achieve the goal, it will have to deliver an average of around 10 million doses per week, more than double the rate Pfizer and BioNTech delivered to the United States through the end of January, according to Reuters calculations. The vaccine, which uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to prompt an immune response against the virus, was the first shot to be authorized for emergency use in the United States, marking the first regulatory nod for the new technology. mRNA vaccines and COVID-19 could prove transformative for Pfizer, which is already one of the world's largest drugmakers, CEO Bourla said. A potential flu vaccine based on the technology could hit the market by 2025, executives said on a conference call. Pfizer forecast 2021 sales between $59.4 billion and $61.4 billion. The company raised both ends of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 10 cents and now expects to earn $3.10 to $3.20 per share."

13.832520880933853," Peru regulators approve Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19: filing LIMA (Reuters) - Peru has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for one year, according to a regulatory filing viewed by Reuters, amid a recent spike in coronavirus cases that has brought local hospitals to the brink of collapse. The one-year registration makes the Pfizer vaccine, co-developed with German partner BioNTech, the second to be approved this year by health authorities in Peru. Regulators last week authorized the “exceptional” import and use of one million doses of a vaccine produced by Chinese laboratory Sinopharm. That batch is due to arrive on Feb. 9. The announcements come amid a second wave of contagions that last week led interim President Francisco Sagasti to announce a total lockdown of the capital Lima and nine other regions. The General Directorate of Medicines, Supplies and Drugs (DIGEMID) said in a filing the registration of the Pfizer vaccine was temporary and expires on Jan. 29, 2022. Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete said last week the government was “very close” to sealing a deal with the Pfizer laboratory to purchase 9.9 million doses of its vaccine. The first 1.8 million would arrive in Peru during the first quarter, she said. Peru has also locked in agreements with AstraZeneca and has said it is in advanced negotiations with Johnson & Johnson to acquire five million vaccines later this year."

Guetta, 53, who said he has received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, has urged fans to get vaccinated but says he understands and respects that it is a personal decision. “I think it is absolutely fair. People have the right not to get vaccinated but they cannot impose on other people the risk of making them sick,” he told Reuters on Tuesday. He also said it would be fair for cities and countries to restrict entry to those vaccinated too. Globally, there have been at least 103,371,000 reported COVID-19 cases and 2,235,000 deaths caused by the disease so far. In Guetta’s native France, one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe and in the world, people are among the most sceptical about vaccines, with opinion polls showing less than half the population intends to get a COVID shot. Known for collaborations over nearly two decades with artists such as Snoop Dogg and Kid Cudi, Guetta said he was hoping for an end to the pandemic this year, which has been “terrible for our industry”, and for 2022 to be the “biggest party year” ever. “People have been frustrated for so long. When they are able to meet and party together, it’s going to be incredible.” As soon as concerts and festivals return, he said he would be on tour “non-stop.” “I have been missing my shows so much.” This Saturday, Guetta will stream a concert - without fans in attendance - from Dubai’s iconic sail-shaped Burj Al Arab hotel in support of UNICEF and local charity Dubai Cares as part of his “United at Home” charity initiative.

13.832520880933853," Study suggests Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine less effective against South African variant LONDON (Reuters) - The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine may be less able to protect against infection with a South African variant of the virus that has a worrying mutation, according to results of a British study released on Tuesday. The preliminary data, which have yet to be peer-reviewed and involve a small number of patients, also suggest a significant proportion of people aged over 80 may not be sufficiently protected against new variants of the virus until they have had two doses of the vaccine, researchers leading the study said. “Of particular concern ... is the emergence of the E484K mutation (found in the South African variant), which so far has only been seen in a relatively small number of individuals,” said Ravi Gupta, a professor at Cambridge University’s Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease, who co-led the study. “Our work suggests the vaccine is likely to be less effective when dealing with this mutation.” Britain and many other countries have begun rolling out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to try to stem the spread of the pandemic disease. While the highly effective vaccine is designed to be given in two doses around three weeks apart, Britain’s government has opted to extend that time gap to up to 12 weeks to try to swiftly reach as many people as possible with a first dose. The study released on Tuesday used blood samples from 26 people who had received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks previously to test whether the shot would protect against two variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - the UK variant, known as B1.1.7., and the South African variant, which has the E484K mutation. When testing the blood serum samples, all but seven of the participants had levels of antibodies sufficiently high to neutralise the virus – that is, to protect against infection, the researchers said. When the scientists added all the key mutations found in B1.1.7 variant, however, they found the efficacy of the vaccine was affected, with, on average, two-fold higher concentrations of antibody required to neutralise the virus. When the E484K mutation was added, even greater levels of antibody were required for the virus to be neutralised - with an average of a 10-fold increase needed, the researchers said. Dami Collier, who co-led the work, said the findings suggest “a significant proportion of people aged over 80 may not have developed protective neutralising antibodies against infection three weeks after their first dose of the vaccine.” Clinical trial data released last week on two other COVID-19 vaccines - from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson - also found the South African coronavirus reduced their ability to protect against the disease."
13.832520880933853," BioNTech 'confident' it will meet Japan's COVID-19 vaccine demand (Reuters) - Japan will receive all the COVID-19 vaccines it has purchased for this year from Pfizer and BioNTech, BioNTech’s head said on Tuesday, amid worries that delivery schedules may be disrupted by global wrangling over supplies. Japan’s vaccine chief said last week that export controls imposed by the European Union, where some vaccines are made, could delay the Asian nation’s inoculation effort. Japan is trailing most major economies in starting inoculations due to its reliance on overseas makers and a demand that vaccines go through domestic trials. It plans to start its campaign in mid-February with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. Pfizer and BioNTech have increased manufacturing capacity to more than 2 billion doses a year from 1.3 billion to meet demand, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said. “Therefore we are confident that we will deliver the doses that we have promised to Japan,” he told an online briefing. Japan has a deal to buy 144 million shots of Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine this year. Sahin did not give more details about the delivery schedule. State broadcaster NHK reported on Tuesday that Japanese approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could come on Feb. 12. The first doses may arrive on Feb. 14 from a Pfizer factory in Belgium, the Fuji News Network reported. It also has deals to buy shots from AstraZeneca, Moderna and Novavax. Taro Kono, Japan’s vaccine rollout chief, said on Friday that growing nationalism over supplies could lead to retaliation and disruptions to global supplies. BioNTech’s chief strategist, Ryan Richardson, said the company was working to supply vaccines to Japan as soon as it could, pending government approval. He said supplies would come from production facilities in Europe and the United States."

The Palestinian territories are expected to receive 37,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech starting in mid-February through COVAX, while Tunisia is due to receive 93,600 doses, said Rick Brennan, emergency director for the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended per person. The WHO set up COVAX along with the GAVI vaccine alliance to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccinations globally. However, there was a “very significant gap” between the planned vaccine rollout in wealthy countries and those that are lower-income or affected by conflict, Brennan said in an interview. The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states. “Until the pharmaceutical companies and the wealthier countries fully resource COVAX, which is the mechanism that we have set up to distribute the vaccines to the poorer countries, those countries are going to be left behind,” he said in an interview. “The availability and the finances aren’t at the level yet that they need to be. We’re well short,” he added. Lags in vaccine provision for poorer countries increased the risk of the spread of coronavirus variants that could be more easily transmissible and harder to treat, said Brennan. After approving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the WHO is working to assess other, cheaper vaccines that could be supplied through COVAX. It is hoping to start vaccinations in all countries globally by early April and vaccinate high risk populations by the middle of the year. “We expect that there will be a modest volume of Pfizer through COVAX because of its expense, but it’s kick-starting the process,” said Brennan."
7.960900729511944," BioNTech says back on schedule to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses to EU Feb 1 (Reuters) - BioNTech and Pfizer Inc are on-track to meet the delivery deadline for their coronavirus vaccine to the European Union, the Germany-based company said on Monday. European countries are grappling with broad vaccine delays, at least temporarily, as all Western vaccine makers with approved shots - Moderna, Pfizer and partner BioNTech and AstraZeneca - fall behind their initial delivery targets. BioNTech and Pfizer are working toward ramping up delivery to Europe beginning the week of Feb. 15, the German company said. Pfizer has successfully modified production processes at its manufacturing plant in Puurs, Belgium, putting the companies back on the original schedule of vaccine dose deliveries to the European Union, BioNTech said. BioNTech said its own manufacturing site in Marburg, Germany, will be able to start production for validation by the European Medicines Agency in February. The company also said its European manufacturing network has continued to expand, from three partners in December 2020 when the companies’ vaccine was first authorized, to 13 currently. The companies expect to make 2 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021. (Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)"

The additional Pfizer-BioNTech doses are part of a deal the EU announced on Jan. 8. BioNTech and Pfizer this month raised their supply goal for this year to 2 billion doses, up from a previous aim of 1.3 billion. The firm has said 500 million doses would be available to the EU by the end of this year, and an option for another 100 million could be taken up. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine needs two doses to develop maximum protection.

The batch will comprise 24,570 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and Moldova has received confirmation of the supply from COVAX, the ministry said in a statement. Vaccines will be delivered to the National Public Health Agency, which has the necessary conditions for its storage. The ministry said the first batches of another COVID-19 vaccine, from AstraZeneca, would be shipped to Moldova at the end of February and the country hoped to receive 264,000 doses of that vaccine in the first half of this year. Moldova registered 159,894 coronavirus cases and 3,438 deaths, as of Feb. 1. A small ex-Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, Moldova has said it plans to receive enough free vaccines through the COVAX scheme to vaccinate 20% of its 3.5 million population. Later, Chisinau plans to purchase vaccines through COVAX at a reduced price. In December, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said Bucharest would donate 200,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to Moldova, in a gesture of solidarity following the election of the pro-Western President Maia Sandu. Chisinau has said it can share vaccines with its breakaway region of Transdniestria, while Tiraspol authorities say the region will use Russia-made vaccines. Transdniestria nominally seceded from Moldova in 1990, one year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, fearing the country might shortly merge with Romania, whose language and culture it broadly shares. The separatist region fought a brief war with Moldova in 1992 and declared itself an independent state, though it remains unrecognised by any country, including Russia."

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said the Americas region needed to immunise about 500 million people to control the pandemic. It said WHO would complete its review in a few days of the AstraZeneca vaccine for emergency use listing (EUL). “The number of doses and delivery schedule are still subject to EUL and manufacturing production capacity,” PAHO said, adding that supply deals also had to be agreed with producers. Of the 36 nations receiving AstraZeneca’s shot, it said four countries, namely Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador and Peru, would also receive a total of 377,910 doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine from mid-February. The GAVI alliance, the group that co-leads COVAX with WHO, said last week it aimed to deliver 2.3 billion vaccines worldwide by the end of 2021, including 1.8 billion free doses to lower-income countries. Geneva-based GAVI was expected to publish details of its allocations by country on Monday.

7.520884908409814," Analysis: ""Russian roulette"" in Europe as needle shortages hamper COVID-19 shots PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Laurent Fignon, a geriatric doctor in the south of France, is having to improvise as he gives shots of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech to care home residents and health staff because supplies of the right needles and syringes are short. Getting the full six doses from vials of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot – as allowed this month by the European Union’s health regulator – requires needles that are both thin enough to minimize waste and long enough to deliver the jab, as required, into the recipient’s shoulder muscle. Fignon’s hospital in the Mediterranean resort of Cannes was sent needles from the French public health authority that were too short, he said, forcing it to hunt locally for supplies. Other nearby hospitals got the right needles and were generous enough to share some. “To us, it looks like Russian roulette,” Fignon told Reuters. “You do not know what you will be getting.” Similar shortages are cropping up elsewhere in Europe, complicating a stuttering start to vaccination efforts that have been compounded by warnings from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, its Anglo-Swedish peer, that they will not be able to meet vaccine supply commitments in the near term. Pfizer now forecasts it will produce 2 billion doses this year, but this assumes it will be possible to extract the full six from each vial. It charges by the dose, meaning the cost of a vial has gone up 20%. The European Commission is pressing Pfizer and German partner BioNTech to deliver more of the low-dead-space needles to extract the extra dose. BioNTech says it has procured 50 million needles that it can sell at cost to countries around the world, and is seeking to buy more. That compares with the EU’s order of up to 600 million doses of its vaccine. Industry executives say that, while output of needles and syringes is sufficient to meet current demand, chaotic ordering means that they often do not get to where they are most urgently needed. Work is under way to assess future demand and find ways to meet it, they say. In Germany, vaccine distribution is handled by the central government but its 16 federal states are responsible for obtaining the needles and syringes needed to inject them - with mixed results. Some, like Baden-Wuerttemberg and Thuringia, had the good fortune to order the right kind of needles and syringes early on. But others, including Bavaria, Saarland and Lower Saxony, didn’t and are having to place follow-on orders, say officials. Saxony, on the Czech border, is also having to shop around as scarce supply forces up prices, said Lars Werthmann, regional head of vaccine logistics at the German Red Cross. “We can’t afford to forfeit a single dose at the moment. And we can’t justify failing because of a 5-cent syringe,” Werthmann told Reuters. Europe’s leading maker of injection equipment, a privately owned German company called B.Braun, says it faces increased demand for syringes and other products needed for vaccinations. “With our competitors, we are currently able to cover all demands in connection with products needed for the vaccinations,” said spokeswoman Christine Bossek. “We are working in parallel on solutions to ensure that this will also be the case in the future.” German medical technology industry association BVMed said there were no production bottlenecks and that supplies of syringes and needles were adequate. But muddled orders were complicating distribution, it added, calling for better coordination. Switzerland had placed orders for so-called “shot utensils” to deliver five doses per vial. With six now allowed, it is in talks with Pfizer to supply equipment needed to draw that number of doses, the Federal Office of Public Health said. Officials in Britain, which has made a faster start to its vaccination drive, say that health teams are well supplied with the right injection kit. Back in Cannes, Fignon says he and his colleagues have managed to extract six doses from the Pfizer vials but this will not last unless doctors get the equipment they need. “Some countries had the right equipment from the very start; we did not here in France,” he said.The French health ministry has acknowledged that extracting the sixth dose was challenging and required specific equipment. It said it was in the process of ensuring the right needles and syringes reached doctors. In addition to BioNTech’s pledge to supply needles at cost, Pfizer said it was in close discussions with the European Commission and EU governments on their vaccination plans, including “supporting governments in securing supply of low-dead-space syringes should they need”."

The government has said it expects to receive 100,000 to 200,000 doses of the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.DE under the global COVAX scheme in February. No vaccine has yet been approved in Ukraine but authorities have repeatedly said Kyiv will not approve or use vaccines from Russia, with which Ukraine’s ties are strained. “One political force just created some hysteria over the registration of the Russian vaccine,” Ukraine’s Health Minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing. “I can say at once: You can be hysterical for a very long time, no one will register the Russian vaccine in the country.” Biolik, a Ukrainian pharmaceutical company backed by Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent Russia-leaning opposition figure, said earlier this month it had applied for state approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, a sensitive move given the poor relations between Kyiv and Moscow. The two countries have been at loggerheads since Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and involvement in a conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people."

8.226445202169378," Canada expects further Pfizer vaccine delay, prompting protests OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Thursday it expects a further delay in Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine deliveries in coming weeks, prompting protests from provincial leaders in charge of administering inoculations. Ottawa, which had initially said Pfizer would deliver 4 million doses by the end of March, told the provinces on Thursday it would now be 3.5 million doses. Tensions have been growing over the slow rollout of Canada’s vaccination program, caused in part by Pfizer cutting its promised deliveries for January and February. Canada has made deals to buy more doses per capita than any other nation, but only two vaccines have so far been approved by the regulator - Pfizer’s and Moderna Inc’s. “The federal government is failing Canadians. This is a grim situation that seems to be getting worse every week,” said Tyler Shandro, Alberta’s health minister. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Pfizer “has let us down tremendously” and called for “a loud voice to make sure we get our fair share of vaccines.” Federal officials told reporters the vaccine dose figures had been given to the provinces for planning purposes. “(Pfizer) have assured us we will receive four million doses ... the rub is the numbers don’t add up to four million at this time,” said Major General Dany Fortin, who is helping lead the inoculation campaign. The reason for the discrepancy is Pfizer’s assumption that six doses can be extracted from each vial rather than the usual five, an alteration Canadian regulators may not approve. “Pfizer is very much aware of that and will ... scale up their number (of deliveries) if that is what is required,” Fortin said. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government is still on track to inoculate every Canadian by the end of September, and that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been speaking directly with vaccine manufacturers. “The prime minister himself just spoke with the heads of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. We will keep on working,” Freeland said during question period in the House of Commons. A special type of syringe is needed to retrieve that sixth dose, which would otherwise be wasted. Canada has ordered 40 million of them, with two million expected to arrive next week, federal officials said. In a statement, Pfizer said it remained on track to meet first-quarter shipment objectives. Canada is also due to receive two million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine by March 31 and said the entire country should have been inoculated at some point in September. Canada has recorded a total of 19,533 COVID-19 deaths and 761,226 infections so far. Pressure on hospitals in some hot spots is receding, experts advising Ontario said in briefing materials published on Thursday, but new, more contagious variants are a growing concern. The B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain is spreading in Ontario and is “a significant threat to control of the pandemic”, the experts said."
8.226445202169378," Switzerland says Moderna COVID-19 vaccine deliveries will be delayed ZURICH (Reuters) - Moderna has warned Switzerland that its COVID-19 vaccine deliveries would be delayed, the Swiss health ministry said on Thursday, leading to February shortfalls that the country expects the U.S. company to make up in March. The delays follow European supply issues with vaccine maker AstraZeneca, as well as Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, as demand for COVID-19 shots is sky high but supplies remain tight and production limited. Switzerland, which has received a combined 531,600 vaccines so far from Moderna and from Pfizer and BioNTech, said it still expects first-quarter vaccine deliveries to meet their contractual requirements. It had hoped to get 1 million doses in February, though with Moderna’s delay it could miss that target. The Swiss Federal Health Ministry did not give a reason for the delays, referring questions to Moderna. Moderna did not return messages seeking comment. The delay to Moderna’s shipments was first reported by Swiss newspaper Blick, which said a planned 300,000-dose shipment due Feb. 1 would likely fall short. Some of Switzerland’s 26 cantons, like European countries, have already received fewer Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine doses than they had planned, leading them to alter vaccination schedules. “The next shipments from Pfizer and Moderna arrive in the first week of February,” a Swiss Federal Health Ministry spokeswoman told Reuters. “The cantons will be informed soon so they can plan their vaccination activities.” Switzerland, with 8.6 million people, hopes to vaccinate everyone who wants a COVID-19 shot by summer. Swiss contract drugmaker Lonza, which manufactures ingredients for Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, said on Wednesday it may be “a couple of months” before new Swiss plants dedicated to producing the shots will be at “cruising speed”. Moderna’s Europe-bound vaccine must make a winding journey from Lonza in Switzerland to fill-and-finish facilities in Spain, before being trucked to a Belgian logistics center, from where it is distributed to individual countries."

8.226445202169378," Racing the virus: Why tweaking vaccines to fight variants won't be simple CHICAGO (Reuters) - After developing and rolling out COVID-19 vaccines at record speed, drugmakers are already facing variants of the rapidly-evolving coronavirus that may render them ineffective, a challenge that will require months of research and a massive financial investment, according to disease experts. Executives from Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE are considering new versions of their vaccines to respond to the most concerning variants identified so far. That is just one piece of the work needed to stay ahead of the virus, nearly a dozen experts told Reuters. A global surveillance network to assess emerging variants must be built. Scientists need to establish what level of antibodies will be required to protect people from COVID-19 and determine when vaccines need to be altered. And regulators must convey what is needed to demonstrate updated vaccines are still safe and effective. “At this point, there is no evidence that these variants have changed the equation in terms of protection from the vaccine,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. “But we have to be prepared for that.” Johnson & Johnson told Reuters the concerning variant first identified in South Africa has got its attention and will tweak its vaccine accordingly if needed. Pfizer said it could produce a new vaccine relatively quickly, but a top vaccine executive said manufacturing it presents additional challenges. The urgency of this effort is clear. State health officials in South Carolina on Thursday reported the first two cases of the South African variant in the United States. Moderna on Monday said lab studies showed antibodies made in response to its vaccine were six times less effective at neutralizing a lab-created version of a South African variant than prior versions of the virus. A study released on Wednesday ahead of peer review found the South African variant reduced neutralizing antibodies 8.6-fold for the Moderna vaccine and by 6.5-fold for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, although a separate Pfizer-backed study released on Wednesday suggests its vaccine may be more hardy. Moderna said this week it is starting work on a potential booster shot. Just how far protection can drop before a COVID-19 vaccine needs to be altered is not yet known. With influenza, an eightfold drop in vaccine-induced antibody protection means time to update. That does not necessarily apply to this coronavirus. “The problem is we don’t know what the cut point is for coronavirus,” said Dr. John Mascola, director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), whose scientists helped develop Moderna’s vaccine. Mascola said both studies testing the Moderna vaccine against the South African variant are roughly in the “same ballpark.” It could be that antibody protection is high enough from the vaccine that it will still be effective, he said. NIAID scientists are analyzing data from Moderna’s late-stage trial to see what level of neutralizing antibodies is required for protection. They are comparing individuals who were vaccinated but got sick anyway to vaccinated people who remained healthy. It could take two months to complete this work, Mascola said. They hope to produce a benchmark for the minimum level of vaccine-induced antibodies needed to protect against COVID-19. A global surveillance network is also needed to identify troubling new variants as they emerge, similar to one used to track fast-mutating flu viruses. That could cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in the United States alone. Richard Webby, a flu surveillance expert from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, said the United States could probably build a system to identify variants fairly quickly. Developing the capability to determine whether they evade current vaccines will take more time. The United States is currently conducting genetic sequencing to look for changes in the virus in just 0.3% of positive coronavirus tests. That pales compared with 10% in the UK, which was first to discover a major mutation in the virus that increases transmission by at least 50%. Experts said countries should sequence at least 5% of positive cases to detect significant changes in the virus. Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to relay what testing will be needed for altered vaccines, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists. With influenza vaccines, companies can make changes without new trials. “But that’s after doing it for 50 years,” he said. Peter Marks, who oversees the FDA’s vaccine approval process, has said small trials testing updated vaccines in around 400 participants may be needed at first. Even that could add months to the process. Norman Baylor, chief executive of Biologics Consulting and a former FDA vaccines official, said the agency will lay out the regulatory road. But public health agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization would decide when vaccines should be updated, as with flu. Altering Pfizer’s vaccine would require “a very minor change,” Dormitzer said. Like Moderna’s, it uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks. He estimates the company could make a prototype version in a week or so, and take another two months to scale up and update their lab tests. J&J, which is expected to release late-stage trial data on its vaccine within days, has laid the groundwork to address troubling virus changes, Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters. Its trial included sites in South Africa, which should give the company insight on that variant. If a change is necessary, Stoffels said J&J likely would add a second strain into its existing vaccine. “We are looking at this with a lot of attention,” he said."

8.226445202169378," Canada to receive fewer Pfizer vaccine doses than expected in Q1 - media report Canada said on Thursday itexpects a further delay in Pfizer Inc's(PFE.N)COVID-19 vaccine deliveries in coming weeks, prompting protests from provincial leaders in charge of administering inoculations. Ottawa, which had initially said Pfizer would deliver 4 million doses by the end of March, told the provinces on Thursday it would now be 3.5 million doses. Tensions have been growing over the slow rollout of Canada's vaccination program, caused in part by Pfizer cutting its promised deliveries for January and February. Canada has made deals to buy more doses per capita than any other nation, but only two vaccines have so far been approved by the regulator - Pfizer's and Moderna Inc's (MRNA.O). read more ""The federal government is failing Canadians. This is a grim situation that seems to be getting worse every week,"" said Tyler Shandro, Alberta's health minister. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Pfizer ""has let us down tremendously"" and called for ""a loud voice to make sure we get our fair share of vaccines."" Federal officials told reporters the vaccine dose figures had been given to the provinces for planning purposes. ""(Pfizer) have assured us we will receive four million doses ... the rub is the numbers don't add up to four million at this time,"" said Major General Dany Fortin, who is helping lead the inoculation campaign. The reason for the discrepancy is Pfizer's assumption that six doses can be extracted from each vial rather than the usual five, an alteration Canadian regulators may not approve. ""Pfizer is very much aware of that and will ... scale up their number (of deliveries) if that is what is required,"" Fortin said. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government is still on track to inoculate every Canadian by the end of September, and that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been speaking directly with vaccine manufacturers. ""The prime minister himself just spoke with the heads of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. We will keep on working,"" Freeland said during question period in the House of Commons. A special type of syringe is needed to retrieve that sixth dose, which would otherwise be wasted. Canada has ordered 40 million of them, with two million expected to arrive next week, federal officials said. In a statement, Pfizer said it remained on track to meet first-quarter shipment objectives. Canada is also due to receive two million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine by March 31 and said the entire country should have been inoculated at some point in September. Canada has recorded a total of 19,533 COVID-19 deaths and 761,226 infections so far. Pressure on hospitals in some hot spots is receding, experts advising Ontario said in briefing materials published on Thursday, but new, more contagious variants are a growing concern. The B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain is spreading in Ontario and is ""a significant threat to control of the pandemic"", the experts said."

8.226445202169378," EU could block vaccine exports in some cases - EU officials BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union will shortly begin monitoring exports of COVID-19 vaccines in the 27-nation bloc and could block exports if the vaccine maker has not fulfilled its commitments to the bloc, EU officials said on Thursday. The European Commission is to give full details on Friday of its monitoring and authorisation system, brought in following shortfalls of vaccine deliveries announced by AstraZeneca and by Pfizer and BioNTech. “We are now in a situation where we have lack of clarity on vaccine deliveries which creates concerns for all of us and most of all for our citizens. We are obliged to look for a solution to this situation,” an EU official said. Under the system, any producer planning to export vaccines from the European Union would have to send its plans to the authorities of one of the 27 EU countries. “It’s not an export ban.. but we want to know whether it goes in the right direction and that, according to the criteria, could end in a refusal,” a second EU official said. This could, for example, impact supplies of the Pfizer vaccine to Britain or Canada, which receive their doses from Pfizer’s plant in Belgium. The system, which could be operational within days, is designed to last until the end of the first quarter, although it could be extended. Exports for humanitarian purposes or to the global COVAX facility, designed to deliver doses to lower income countries. From mid-March to mid-May, the European Union required exporters of protective equipment such as masks to secure authorisation from the EU country where they were located.

Kerkola said that the group’s supply of vaccine to Italy would be back to “regular” this week. On Tuesday, Italy asked the European Commission to take action against Pfizer over cuts to its COVID-19 vaccine deliveries, a day after Rome had sent a formal warning letter to the U.S drug company calling on it to respect its contractual commitments after a slowdown in deliveries. Last week Pfizer said it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output. Kerkola said she believed that the group would be able to supply about 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of the year and that increases in production volume would be seen from mid-February. Asked about the difference in vaccine prices Pfizer applied to different countries, the executive said prices remained confidential but the company used a “fair access” principle, with higher-income countries spending more and lower-income countries less."

7.252440422733359," Fact check: Helsinki Committee for Human Rights is not planning to say Pfizer is carrying out an ‘unauthorised human experiment’ with its COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer is not unlawfully trialling its coronavirus vaccine on people in Israel and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights has no plan to announce this, despite claims from Facebook users to the contrary. Several Facebook posts have shared a screenshot from an unidentified website purportedly quoting an Israeli newspaper about the alleged announcement (here, here). The headline on the screenshot reads: “Helsinki to declare Pfizer performing unauthorised human experiment,” and is followed by further text reading: “Calcalist reports the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights is expected to announce that Pfizer is conducting unauthorised human experiments. The committee in charge of supervising human trials is expected to submit an opinion to the Health Ministry stating that the immunisation process led by the state with Pfizer is a clinical study and therefore needed to be improved in advance. The committee can also determine that the Israeli government must stop transferring information to Pfizer; Dr. Tehila Schwartz-Altshuler: ‘To say this is not an experiment is a lie.’” Firstly, the headline does not refer to Helsinki, Finland, but to the Helsinki Committee in Israel, which authorises clinical trials on humans (here). There are many countries with Helsinki Committees, which are named after the Helsinki Accords – a diplomatic agreement affirming national borders since the Second World War, which lists 10 fundamental commitments including for human rights. It was signed in 1975 at the end of the first conference of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE – now known as OSCE). Israel is a member of the OSCE’s Mediterranean Partners (www.csce.gov/country/israel). Secondly, the Israeli newspaper Calcalist published a piece on Jan. 18 suggesting Pfizer had not received the committee’s approval before its COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out to Israeli citizens. However, the article has since been updated with the committee’s comments clarifying the matter (here). The Calcalist article quoted Professor Eitan Friedman, the head of Israel’s Helsinki Committee, who initially responded to the claims on Facebook here . He said the vaccinations themselves did not constitute a clinical trial but confirmed the committee had been investigating the types of data being sent to Pfizer about vaccinated citizens. This was said to be for the purposes of future research. An English translation of his remarks was provided by Israel’s business newspaper Globes. In a report here the newspaper translates Friedman’s remarks as follows: “We are currently checking if the agreement is according to regulations protecting privacy in clinical trials and we will issue an official announcement on our conclusions. “We are responsible for protecting the medical privacy of Israel’s citizens and as part of this work we are examining the agreement and if it protects the rights of citizens. We have no doubt that the Ministry of Health is behaving with transparency and is planning to protect these rights, but still our role is to ensure that the rules are being kept. “The vaccination itself has passed all the approvals. The vaccine is not a clinical trial and we call on everyone that doesn’t have a contraindication to go and get vaccinated. We want to make sure as the Helsinki Committee that the rights and privacy of the State of Israel are being protected even if clinical research is being conducted, then it should be appropriate research.” The Israeli Ministry of Health also commented on the issue to the newspaper (here). It said in a statement: “We are talking about a vaccine that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EU's European Medicines Agency (EMA) and from that point of view there is no clinical trial here which requires the Helsinki Committee. The trial ended after Phase III by Pfizer and the results were published."" (here). False. The Helsinki Committee in Israel is not planning to say Pfizer is conducting unauthorised human trials with its COVID-19 vaccine. The committee is looking into the type of data being shared with Pfizer for privacy purposes, but this is not related to administering the vaccine.

7.252440422733359," Biden administration aims to have enough vaccine for most Americans by summertime WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States aims to acquire an additional 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, enough to inoculate most Americans by summertime, as he races to curb a pandemic he warned could still get worse. Biden’s administration will purchase 100 million doses each of the vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, and Moderna Inc, increasing the overall total doses to 600 million, with delivery expected by summer. The previous purchase target was 400 million doses. Each vaccine requires two doses per person to be fully effective, suggesting the new purchases would build up enough of a stockpile to inoculate most of the country’s 331 million people. The vaccines are not approved for use by most children. “This is a wartime effort,” Biden said in the White House State Dining Room under a painting of President Abraham Lincoln, who led the Union to victory in the U.S. Civil War. Pfizer is confident it can deliver the extra doses in the time frame specified by Biden, spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said. Moderna declined to comment. The new purchase target, along with promises to get more vaccine to local authorities, raises the bar for a Democratic president who took office last week with vows to repair what he said was a disastrous emergency response by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. Biden said he would hike the amount of the vaccine going to local governments to 10 million doses per week for the next three weeks, up from 8.6 million currently. The news was welcomed by governors, who said they needed even more doses. “We appreciate the administration stating that it will provide states with slightly higher allocations for the next few weeks, but we are going to need much more supply,” Republican Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said in a statement after being briefed on a call by Jeff Zients, the administration’s COVID-19 response coordinator. “I urge President Biden to take every imaginable step within his power to ramp up production without delay.” Considerable challenges remain, ranging from faster-spreading virus variants, supply shortages and public fears about taking the vaccine. Biden’s administration has tried to address the latter problem by getting senior officials vaccinated in public. Vice President Kamala Harris took her second and final Moderna-manufactured shot on Tuesday at the National Institutes of Health. Biden has asked Congress for a $1.9 trillion relief package to increase testing and vaccine distribution, but the proposal has been met with Republican resistance over the price tag and the inclusion of some measures not directly related to virus control. Senate Democrats will approve the stimulus even without the support of Republicans, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday. The administration has also faced extensive questions after sending mixed messages on issues such as when the population would be fully vaccinated. On Monday, Biden said he believed it was possible to have 150 million doses of the vaccine administered in his first 100 days in office, an aspiration his press secretary, Jen Psaki, said was not an official adjustment of the current target of 100 million doses over that same time period. The pandemic, which has killed over 420,000 Americans, is currently infecting more than 173,000 people daily and has left millions out of work. “Cases will continue to mount,” Biden warned. “We didn’t get in this mess overnight. It’s going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be equally clear: We’re going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic.”"

4.799753641442952," Johnson & Johnson expects COVID-19 vaccine data next week (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday said it expected to report eagerly-awaited data on its COVID-19 vaccine early next week, and that it would be able to meet the delivery target for doses to countries with which it had signed supply agreements. Public health officials are increasingly counting on single-dose options like the one being tested by J&J to simplify and boost inoculations given the complications and slower-than-hoped rollout of authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which require second shots weeks after the first. The company forecast 2021 profit well above Wall Street estimates, and its shares rose 3.4% to $171.55. The outlook does not include any contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said. Wolk added that pricing of the vaccine would depend on the number of doses secured by countries and organizations. “We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates as warranted,” he said on a conference call. The U.S. healthcare conglomerate said its medical device unit continued to recover despite the recent surge in COVID-19. The division was hit hard earlier in the pandemic by a decrease in elective and non-urgent procedures like hip and knee replacement as people avoided care or hospitals were forced to suspend such procedures. Fourth-quarter sales in the unit fell marginally to $6.59 billion. Adjusted profit of $1.86 per share beat estimates of $1.82 per share, helped by double-digit sales growth of Crohn’s disease drug Stelara and cancer treatment Darzalex. Stelara sales grew 32% to $2.44 billion, while sales of Darzalex jumped nearly 60% to $1.25 billion. J&J forecast 2021 adjusted profit of between $9.40 and $9.60 per share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $8.99 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

4.884089410305593," Exclusive: Scarce niche syringes complicate U.S. plan to squeeze more COVID shots from Pfizer vials (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s effort to squeeze more doses from Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine vials is spurring unanticipated demand for specialized syringes that the world’s largest syringe supplier says exceeds existing capacity. Becton Dickinson and Co began scaling up syringe production months in advance of the vaccine rollout, before the U.S. government or its partners knew that a niche type of syringe, known as low dead space, would be needed for getting more shots out of Pfizer’s vaccine vials, an executive told Reuters in an interview. Becton Dickinson’s government contract includes only limited supply of the niche product, and a new factory that it is developing is focused on other types of syringes, the executive said. The vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech , one of two authorized for U.S. emergency use, is shipped in vials initially indicated to hold five doses. Six doses can be drawn with low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use. If healthcare providers can reliably extract the sixth dose it would allow supplies to be stretched 20% further and could be a financial boost for Pfizer, which is paid per dose. The U.S. government has begun giving healthcare providers new syringe kits to extract six shots from each vial. It said that three of the low dead space syringes in each six-needle kit would allow extraction, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. A CDC spokeswoman said the new kits would contain a “majority” of low dead space syringes. Syringe maker Becton Dickinson has contracted with the U.S. government to provide 286 million syringes for use with COVID-19 vaccines, including around 40 million low dead space syringes, and is fully prepared to deliver on that agreement, said Troy Kirkpatrick, the company’s senior director of public relations. Low dead space syringes are a niche product and Becton Dickinson had not discussed plans with the U.S. government to substantially boost their output when they began preparing for the vaccine rollout last year, he said. “We are ready to support the U.S. government but we are trying to make sure everyone understands that those devices are not something we have infinite capacity to produce and bringing up new lines does take time,” Kirkpatrick said. The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company is the largest syringe and needle maker in the world, according to 360iResearch, and Kirkpatrick said it has boosted overall production capacity by about 1 billion syringes for 2021, with most of the capacity allocated. A new production line for syringes will be functional by July but was not designed to produce additional low dead space syringes, he said. Kirkpatrick said Becton Dickinson is also discussing plans with the U.S. government to deploy pre-filled syringes, which negate the need for vials and can help get more out of existing vaccine supplies. The federal government has contracts with other manufacturers, and it was not immediately clear whether they could supply more of the specialty syringes. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a federal organizer of the vaccination drive, told providers in an email reviewed by Reuters it has started giving healthcare providers packages including both types of needles. The email said early testing showed that three low dead space syringes used in combination with three standard syringes may yield the sixth dose. “Every effort is being made to reconfigure the ancillary kits with syringes that enable the six-dose draw without impacting the availability or slowing the delivery of supplies to jurisdictions,” the email said. President Joe Biden has described the vaccine rollout so far as a “dismal failure” and said he will use wartime powers to secure more supplies for the campaign, including low dead space syringes, but experts say that such efforts will still run up against production constraints. Healthcare distributor McKesson Corp is responsible for assembling the accompanying kits of vaccination supplies, including syringes, that are paired with each tray of Pfizer vaccines. The supplies themselves are procured by the U.S. government. Moderna Inc, which makes the other vaccine authorized for use in the United States, says it puts 10 doses in each of its vials, but New York State public health officials have said providers can extract 11 doses."
4.884089410305593," Russia to supply Mexico with 24 million COVID-19 vaccines, president says MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Russia will supply Mexico with 24 million doses of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine over the next two months, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said after a phone call on Monday with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Putin’s pledge marks a sharp increase from a previous target from last week of 7.4 million doses through March, though some doubts over Russia’s production capacity persist. Russia’s vaccine diplomacy has developed goodwill in Latin America after other pharmaceutical companies including U.S.-based Pfizer Inc announced shortfalls in distribution plans. Lopez Obrador held the call with Putin despite announcing on Sunday that he was himself infected with COVID-19 and was being treated for mild symptoms. The Mexican leader added in a post on Twitter that he had invited the Russian head of state to visit Mexico. Lopez Obrador and Putin also discussed training for Mexican medical specialists in Russia, according to a news release from the Russian government. Mexico has warned about a lack of doctors to accommodate the country’s high infection rate throughout the pandemic, particularly medical specialists. The country has among the lowest number of medical personnel relative to population among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the government has said. During the first three months of this year, tens of millions of doses are expected in Mexico from the Gamaleya Center, Sputnik V’s developer, as well as China’s CanSino Biologics Inc, Britain’s AstraZeneca and Pfizer. But with Monday’s announcement, Sputnik V would be by far Mexico’s most-used vaccine over that time, in part because Pfizer cut back on what it had originally committed to Mexico. Mexico’s health regulator has not yet approved Sputnik V, despite promising a quick process after a senior health official received clinical data during a visit to Argentina. Argentina has spearheaded Sputnik V’s arrival in Latin America, adopting the vaccine early and administering hundreds of thousands of doses since late last year. Global vaccine bottlenecks have been exacerbated by many wealthier nations refusal to participate in COVAX, a global vaccine program co-led by the World Health Organization. The global body seeks to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 doses worldwide this year, with at least 1.3 billion for poorer countries. But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while richer countries have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves."
4.884089410305593," Early results on Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine encouraging, says Israeli HMO JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Fewer than 0.01% of people who received Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine have contracted the virus more than a week after receiving the second dose, a leading Israeli healthcare provider said on Monday. The preliminary results shared by Israeli HMO Maccabi showed that only 20 people out of some 128,600 who received both shots have since been infected with the COVID-19 virus. Israel is a world leader with its rapid vaccine rollout, though the data also comes during a nationwide lockdown that has been helping to stem contagion. Israelis began receiving first shots of Pfizer’s vaccine on Dec. 19. The country is providing Pfizer with weekly data updates on its vaccine campaign under a collaboration agreement that may help other countries fine-tune their own inoculation drives. “According to Maccabi’s experts this is preliminary data but the numbers are very encouraging,” Maccabi said in a statement. “Maccabi reports that out of the 20 people infected, 50% suffer from chronic illnesses. All patients experienced a mild illness with symptoms including headaches, cough, weakness or fatigue. No-one was hospitalized or suffered from a fever above 38.5C. Most patients tested for COVID-19 due to exposure to a verified patient,” it said. Anat Ekka Zohar, Maccabi’s Information and Digital Health Division director, said “the fact that the infected patients came from different profiles is consistent with Pfizer’s trial results.” “We will monitor these patients closely in order to examine if they continue to suffer from mild symptoms only and do not develop complications as a result of the virus,” she said. More than 2.6 million Israelis have received a single dose of the vaccine and about 1.2 million have been given both shots, out of a population of about 9 million. Israel has reported about 600,000 virus infections and 4,478 deaths during the pandemic."

4.884089410305593," Exclusive: Pfizer wants India to order COVID-19 vaccine before pursuing approval NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will pursue its request for India to approve its COVID-19 vaccine if the government commits to buying shots, the U.S. drugmaker told Reuters on Monday, even as global supplies tighten. Pfizer was the first company to seek emergency-use authorisation (EUA) for a COVID-19 vaccine in India, but the government this month approved two much cheaper shots - one from Oxford University/AstraZeneca and another developed at home by Bharat Biotech with the Indian Council of Medical Research. India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) says Pfizer officials failed to turn up to meetings after the company’s application was made in early December. The regulator has also declined to accept the company’s request for approval without a small local trial on the vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity for Indians, Reuters has reported. Pfizer says its application is supported by data from a global study that shows an overall efficacy rate of 95% with no vaccine-related, serious safety concerns. It also says that, based on the same data, the vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech has been approved in Britain, the United States, the European Union and Canada. “The data collected has been endorsed by various regulatory agencies (including the most evolved) and they have given EUA [based on] ... that data,” the firm said in an emailed response to questions, including on India’s demand for a local trial. “Given our exclusive priority to government supply, we look forward to a confirmation from the government on necessary supplies, [on the] basis [of] which we will take the regulatory process forward, as we have done across the world,” it added. Last week, government officials in some EU countries said Pfizer had slashed in half deliveries to them, causing frustration and hampering vaccination drives. Indian officials have had discussions with both Pfizer and its U.S. rival Moderna Inc about making their shots in India, given its large pharmaceutical capacity. However, India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, says it is mainly relying on shots already approved or tested at home to run its massive immunisation campaign that began on Jan. 16. Pfizer said its current focus was on distributing the vaccine around the world using manufacturing capacity in the United States and Europe. “Once the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will evaluate all additional opportunities available,” it said. Asked why it did not attend meetings called by the CDSCO, Pfizer said its officials had not been given enough notice. “The company representatives have been unable to participate in previous meetings due to extremely short notices of a few hours or less and time-zone limitations,” the company said. “We remain committed to engaging with the Government of India to make this vaccine available for use by the government in the country.”"

4.884089410305593," Australia approves Pfizer vaccine, warns of limited global AstraZeneca supply SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Monday approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use but warned AstraZeneca’s international production problems mean the country would need to distribute a locally manufactured shot earlier than planned. The country’s medical regulator was one of the first in the world to complete a comprehensive approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, noting it was a year since the first local coronavirus case was detected. Vaccination of priority groups with the Pfizer vaccine is expected to begin in late February at 80,000 doses per week, Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters. Pfizer had told the Australian government it anticipated continuous supply but would provide global production guidance “in mid-February for March and beyond on a weekly basis,” he said. The Australian rollout update comes after AstraZeneca Plc told European Union officials on Friday it would cut deliveries of its vaccine to the bloc by 60% in the first quarter due to production problems. Hunt said AstraZeneca had advised Australia the company has “had a significant supply shock and so that means we won’t have as much of that AstraZeneca international in March as they had previously promised”. The AstraZeneca vaccine is yet to be approved by Australia, which expects to start CSL’s domestic supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March, earlier than planned, at 1 million doses a week, he said. “The decision to pay a premium for an onshore, secure, sovereign vaccine manufacturing capacity via CSL, that puts Australia in a vastly more secure position than almost any other country in the world,” Hunt said. Australia has set a target of 4 million vaccine doses by April. It has also committed to supplying vaccines to Pacific Island nations on a later timetable. The Pfizer vaccine has been provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s (TGA) for Australians aged 16 years and over. Australia will administer the two doses of the vaccine to each recipient at the recommended time. Quarantine and border personnel, frontline health workers and aged care and disability staff and residents will be the first group to receive vaccines. There have been no new cases of community transmission in Australia in the past seven days, and there are no Australians with coronavirus in hospital intensive care units. Hunt contrasted this with six million cases globally in the last 10 days and 125,000 lives lost. “That comparison is almost unbelievable, the difference between where we are in Australia and overseas,” he said. To ensure that remained the case, Australia on Monday suddenly suspended its travel bubble with New Zealand for 72 hours and ordered all those who had arrived since Jan. 14 to isolate and be tested, after New Zealand confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in the community in months. “This will be done out of an abundance of caution whilst more is learned about the event and the case,” Hunt told reporters later in the day. Australia has had just under 28,800 cases in the past year, the overwhelming majority in Victoria state, and 909 deaths."
4.884089410305593," Pfizer requests South Korea approval COVID-19 vaccines ahead of February rollout SEOUL (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc has filed an application seeking approval of its coronavirus vaccines to be used in South Korea as the country gears up to begin inoculations next month, authorities said on Monday. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said it aims to reach a decision within 40 days after cutting its previous deliberation period of up to 180 days to fast-track the approval and speed up the vaccination process. “Pfizer submitted the request today for its vaccines produced in Belgium,” the ministry said in a statement. “We will thoroughly review their safety and effectiveness in cooperation with professional examiners and outside experts so that our people can access safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.” South Korea has said its first batch of vaccines consisting of 100,000 doses of Pfizer products for 50,000 people could arrive before the Lunar New Year holidays, which begin on Feb. 11, via global distribution scheme COVAX. Authorities have started setting up vaccination centres, designating some 250 indoor gyms and theatres nationwide, with the goal of vaccinating up to 70% of its 52 million population until September. The country has secured 106 million doses of coronavirus vaccines from COVAX, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, and is also in talks to buy 40 million doses of products from Novavax."
4.884089410305593," Factbox: What Australia's first vaccine nod means for national rollout SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has taken a cautious approach to approving coronavirus vaccines, a sharp contrast to the rapid, emergency rollouts seen in nations harder hit by the pandemic. On Monday, the country’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) gave provisional approval for the vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE with the first shots expected in late February. Here’s what the approval means for Australia’s vaccination plan: Australia has taken a diversified approach to COVID-19 vaccines, with 140 million shots initially on order -- enough for several times the population -- to ensure flexibility. The country has 53 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Oxford vaccine on order, of which 50 million will be made domestically by CSL. It also has 10 million doses ordered from Pfizer-BioNTech, enough for five million people since it requires two shots. Australia has an arrangement for 51 million doses of an offshore-manufactured vaccine still being trialled by Novavax Inc. An earlier order for 51 million doses of a vaccine developed by Australia’s University of Queensland, which was to be produced by CSL, was scrapped in December after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis. Australian authorities say most vaccine approvals globally have been on an emergency basis, meaning manufacturers must still commit to handing over safety and efficacy data to regulators once rolled out. While other countries began issuing emergency approvals in December, Australian officials argue very low local community transmissions mean it can afford to wait until it has enough trial data before approving any vaccines for domestic use. The Pfizer-BioNTech product is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive approval for use in Australia. The provisional nod is a more comprehensive approval than those issued for emergency use and means the product can be sold for two years. The TGA says the approval means Australians can be confident that the review process “was rigorous and of the highest standard.” The Australian government expects the TGA to give approval for the AstraZeneca vaccine in the next few weeks, ahead of a rollout that’s expected to start in March. The Pfizer approval means a rescheduling of Australia’s original vaccine plan. The country initially committed to underwriting a domestic manufacturing plant for biopharmaceutical giant CSL Ltd to make tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca’s “Oxford” vaccine. But that vaccine hasn’t received domestic approval yet, leaving a limited order of the Pfizer product, enough for a fifth of the country’s 25 million people, to get the programme started. *WHAT IS AUSTRALIA’S EXPOSURE TO GLOBAL SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND SHIPPING DELAYS? Australia says it has been assured delivery of its Pfizer vaccines before rollout begins in late February. Health Minister Greg Hunt says the government has been notified by AstraZeneca that it is managing a “supply shock” globally, and this will delay delivery of its 3 million offshore-produced doses. He says Australia will bring forward delivery of its 50 million domestically manufactured AstraZeneca doses, ensuring the programme is unaffected. The government has said it wants 80,000 people vaccinated per week. The vaccine is approved for everyone over the age of 16 although a final priority list is still being drawn up and authorities expect to work with hospitals and general practitioners to co-ordinate a rollout. Health Secretary Brendan Murphy says there is not enough data available to determine the vaccine’s safety for pregnant women so authorities will use a “best guess” about whether to administer it to them. For elderly and frail patients, “very careful clinical” decisions would be needed, Murphy said."

4.8298545794025305," Italy to take legal action on COVID vaccine delays to get doses MILAN (Reuters) - Italy will take legal action and step up pressure in Brussels against Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca over delays in deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines with a view to securing agreed supplies, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Sunday. The aim was to get the companies to meet the vaccine volumes they had promised and not to seek compensation, Di Maio said on RAI state television. “This is a European contract that Pfizer and AstraZeneca are not respecting and so for this reason we will take legal action... We are working so our vaccine plan programme does not change,” he said. Pfizer said last week it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output. On Friday, AstraZeneca said initial deliveries to the region will fall short because of a production problem. Asked why he thought the pharmaceutical companies had been forced to announce reductions, Di Maio said he believed they had simply bitten off more than they could chew. “We are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make these gentlemen respect their contracts,” he said. No one was immediately available to comment at Pfizer in Italy. AstraZeneca did not immediately reply to an email and voice message. Also on Sunday European Council President Charles Michel said the EU would use legal means to ensure pharmaceutical companies respect supply contracts for COVID-19 vaccines. “We plan to make the pharmaceutical companies respect the contracts they have signed ... by using the legal means at our disposal,” Michel said on Europe 1 radio. Sky Italia TV cited Pfizer on Sunday as saying the cuts, to the number of vials delivered and not the number of doses, had been due to work to increase capacity at a Belgian plant. Supplies would return to normal as of next week, Sky cited Pfizer as saying. On Saturday Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the delays in vaccine supplies were “unacceptable” and amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations, adding that Italy would use all available legal tools. Speaking on Italian TV on Sunday Italy’s Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri said the cut in supplies announced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca would put back vaccination of the over-80s in Italy by about four weeks and the rest of the population by about 6-8 weeks. “This kind of delay affects the whole of Europe and a good part of the world but I am confident the delay can be made up for further down the road,” he said. Italy was the first Western country to be hit by the virus last March and has registered 85,461 deaths so far, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth-highest in the world."

4.8298545794025305," Australia has eye on vaccination drive even though coronavirus under control MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia recorded no new local coronavirus cases on Sunday, maintaining a recent run of success in keeping the virus at bay, but nevertheless is keen to press on with its vaccination campaign from next month, government officials said. Australia’s first batch of the Pfizer vaccine is due to arrive in February and its campaign will then begin with people over 70, adults with underlying medical conditions and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the front of the queue. “We have the virus under control here in Australia but we want to roll out the vaccine,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told a news conference. The campaign was on track despite the low transmission numbers and shortage of supply of the Pfizer vaccine seen in some other countries, he said. People can apply to get the vaccine from Monday. Recent government figures showed an overall 95.09% rate for regular vaccinations for five-year-olds in the December quarter, suggesting a positive attitude towards vaccinations among the public. “This will help save lives and protect lives - it is also a very important sign of confidence as we prepare for the COVID vaccine roll out,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Twitter. Hunt said Australia has had no community cases anywhere for nine of the last 10 days. Australia has fared better than most other developed economies in the pandemic through swift border closures, lockdowns, strict hotel quarantine for travellers and widespread testing and social distancing. It has had just under 28,800 cases in all, the overwhelming majority in Victoria state, and 909 deaths. Victoria saw its 18th straight day of no local transmissions and there were no new community cases in New South Wales and Queensland, which had outbreaks in recent weeks, health data showed."

6.923590125055503," UK vaccine roll-out speeds up but doctors want quicker second dose LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s COVID-19 vaccination push gathered pace on Saturday, with 5.9 million people now having had a first dose, but doctors challenged the government over its policy of delaying a second shot of the Pfizer vaccine for up to 12 weeks. The British government is stretching out the gap between first and second shots as it seeks to ensure as many people as possible can be given some protection from an initial vaccine dose. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Friday that the new UK variant of COVID-19 may be associated with a higher level of mortality as the country’s death tally from COVID-19 nears the 100,000 mark - hitting 97,329 on Saturday. But in a letter to Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for England Chris Whitty, the British Medical Association said leaving the 12-week interval for the Pfizer vaccine went against World Health Organization guidance. They urged the government to reduce the gap between Pfizer doses to a maximum of six weeks. The makers of the vaccine, Pfizer and BioNTech, have warned that they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose is given more than three weeks after the first. Leaving a 12-week gap is allowing Britain’s vaccine programme to proceed quickly. Government data published on Saturday showed 5.86 million people have now received a first dose of the vaccine, after a record 478,248 people had the jab in the last 24 hours. Whitty said on Friday that the longer wait between doses was a “public health decision” aimed at vaccinating many more people and based on the fact that the great majority of protection comes from the first jab. The Department of Health and Social Care said the decision on the 12-week gap was made after “a thorough review of the data” and was in line with the recommendations of the UK’s four chief medical officers. Britain is using the Pfizer vaccine and another from AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca has supported the gap between its jabs, saying data showed an 8- to 12-week gap was a “sweet spot” for efficacy. Following Johnson’s warnings about the more deadly nature of the new variant, some scientists said on Saturday it was too soon to be clear about what the evidence was showing. “The question about whether it’s more dangerous in terms of mortality I think is still open,” Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC."
6.923590125055503," Italy says delays in vaccine supplies unacceptable MILAN (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte lashed out at suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines on Saturday, saying delays in deliveries amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations. Italy will have to rethink its whole vaccination programme if supply problems persist, a senior health official warned on Saturday, after Rome was forced to cut its daily rollout of COVID-19 shots by more than two thirds. Pfizer Inc last week said it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output. On Friday, a senior official told Reuters AstraZeneca Plc had also informed the European Union it would cut deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc by 60% because of production problems. “This is unacceptable,” Conte said in a Facebook post. “Our vaccination plan ... has been drawn up on the basis of contractual pledges freely undertaken by pharmaceutical companies with the European Commission.” Italy, which is using vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna Inc as AstraZeneca awaits clearance for use of its vaccines across the EU, says Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week and would be down 20% next week. The head of Italy’s higher health council, Franco Locatelli, told a press conference they were expected to return to agreed levels from Feb. 1. In the meantime, vaccinations in Italy have slowed to 20,000-25,000 a day from peaks of more than 90,000 around two weeks ago, Locatelli said. Rome has threatened to sue Pfizer. Conte said expected delays in the vaccine by AstraZeneca were even more worrying, adding Italy would receive 3.4 million doses instead of 8 million in the first quarter if the 60% reduction were confirmed. He added the heads of AstraZeneca Italy had confirmed the reduction in production capacity at a meeting on Saturday with Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza and COVID-19 Special Commissioner Domenico Arcuri. “Such delays in deliveries represent serious contractual violations, which cause enormous damage to Italy and other countries,” Conte said. “We’ll use all available legal tools as we’re already doing with Pfizer-BioNTech,” he added. The European Medicines Agency will rule on the AstraZeneca vaccine on Jan. 29 and Locatelli said Rome would have to reassess immunisation plans after that. So far 1.31 million doses of vaccine have been injected in Italy, corresponding to around 70% of deliveries, placing Italy second in the EU after Germany. Nearly 40,300 people have completed the vaccination cycle after receiving the second dose. Italy reported 13,331 new coronavirus cases on Saturday and 488 deaths."

Pfizer, which is retooling a European manufacturing plant, told Canada on Tuesday it would receive no vaccine next week, promising more pain for provinces already complaining about a shortage of supplies. Pfizer also said it would cut supplies to the European Union. Trudeau, under pressure from political opponents to do more to address the shortage, said that, though the coming weeks would be challenging, the company’s Chief Executive Albert Bourla had reassured him it would supply 4 million vaccine doses as scheduled by March 31. Expressing irritation that Canadians were still taking vacations despite the worsening second wave, Trudeau also indicated Ottawa would bring in measures designed to make it harder and more expensive to travel. He spoke on Thursday to the premiers of the 10 provinces, some of whom want Ottawa to clamp down on non-essential travel. He reiterated that people should stay home. “We could be bringing in new measures that significantly impede your ability to return to Canada at any given moment, without warning,” said Trudeau, promising more details in coming days. Canada, which has so far reported 18,622 coronavirus deaths from a total of 731,450 cases, already requires all arrivals by air to go into self-administered quarantine for 14 days.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Friday it had reached an agreement with Pfizer/BioNTech for 40 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine and should be able to start delivering vaccines to poor and lower-middle income countries next month under its COVAX programme. The COVAX scheme, led by the WHO and the GAVI vaccine alliance, signed deals for hundreds of millions of doses to vaccinate people in poor and lower-middle income countries, but vaccinations have yet to start. Pfizer’s vaccine is so far the only one that has WHO emergency approval. “In this world we are as protected as our neighbour,” said Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla, officially announcing the deal which Reuters reported on Thursday. Bourla said the 40 million doses, a fraction of the company’s total 2021 production estimate of 2 billion, would be sold on a non-profit basis. He described it as an initial agreement, and said more doses could be provided through the COVAX programme in future. The deal comes amid growing criticism of vaccine inequity from both the WHO and others as wealthy countries inoculate millions of people using shots procured through bilateral deals. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the new agreement with Pfizer should allow vaccinations to begin in February for health workers, although details of supply arrangements are still being finalised. He said he hoped the agreement would also encourage other countries to donate more of their Pfizer shots to support rapid roll-out, like Norway has. “The commitment of the (United States) to join COVAX, together with this new agreement with Pfizer/BioNTech, mean that we are closer to fulfilling the promise of COVAX,” he said. U.S. President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Thursday the United States intended to join the facility.

Pfizer did announce on January 15 that, as part of a plan to increase production, its facility in Puurs, Belgium, would deliver fewer doses the following week. Pfizer said in an email to Reuters that production would be “back to the original schedule of deliveries to the European Union beginning the week of January 25, with increased delivery beginning week of February 15” and it would be able to “deliver the fully committed quantity of vaccine doses in the first quarter and significantly more in the second quarter.” It also said that there had been no delays in the U.S. production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.

6.868283249962917," Mexico may delay second doses of COVID-19 vaccine, allows private orders MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s government said on Friday the second round of doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could be delayed and private companies will be allowed to purchase the drugs directly as the country struggles to keep rampant infections in check. Mexico set two daily coronavirus death records this week, with hospitals overwhelmed by a surge in cases and patients faced with paying a fourfold increase in prices for scarce oxygen tanks. Hugo Lopez-Gatell, the deputy health minister, said Mexico was considering delaying the administration of the second dose of the two-shot Pfizer Inc./BioNTech vaccine to patients to help get the first dose to those in need more quickly. “We’re seeing if we need to expand the time period to 35 days,” said Lopez-Gatell, who added that there would be “no need” to delay the administration of the second doses if enough new vaccine arrives in the coming weeks. The Pfizer vaccine is currently the only one being administered in Mexico, which has reported the fourth-highest death toll from the pandemic worldwide. Mexico had been expecting weekly deliveries of some 400,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but as a result of the U.S. drugmaker’s agreements with the World Health Organization (WHO), it is now expecting to only receive half of that total. The WHO said on Monday it was in advanced talks with Pfizer about including its vaccine in the agency’s portfolio of shots to be shared with poorer countries. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador added that his administration will issue authorization for any company or local government that wants to acquire vaccines to administer them in Mexico. Mexico’s Business Coordinating Council (CCE), one of the country’s top business lobbies, said the announcement was “positive” but added that laboratories around the world had committed their current allotments to national governments. CCE said it is in touch with laboratories “with a view to the future.”"

The study, which was announced in October, had enrolled over 2,000 participants, a Pfizer spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. Vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna Inc, which are being rolled out in the United States, are not yet available for use in children due to a lack of study data. Children rarely experience severe COVID-19 symptoms but they could still spread the virus.

6.868283249962917," French Indian Ocean territory to keep COVID-19 shots at secret location PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte will store its first vials of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at a secret and secure location when they arrive on Sunday to deter would-be thieves, the local health authority chief said. A military plane will deliver the initial 975 doses to France’s poorest territory as concerns grow about a new variant of COVID-19 detected in nearby South Africa and almost a month after the first shots were given in metropolitan France. The strenuous efforts to safeguard the vaccine in Mayotte, located between Mozambique and Madagascar, come after surgical face masks were stolen from the island’s main hospital last spring and sold in the neighbouring Comoros archipelago. “The Foreign Legion will take the vials to an undisclosed location,” Dominique Voynet, head of the local heath authority, told Reuters. Voynet and the army said the police would then be responsible for protecting the vials. Paris will also provide a super freezer but it will not be ready for use for several days. The Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at very low temperatures. Voynet said Mayotte had not been considered a high priority to receive the vaccine because its population was young and there were very few coronavirus patients in the island’s only intensive care unit (ICU). There was more of an imperative now, she said, after four cases of the South African variant had been confirmed in Mayotte and the number in the ICU had started rising. Official statistics showed the rate of excess mortality jumped 24% in 2020, higher than any other region in France. At least one opposition lawmaker said the distribution was coming too late and accused the government of an unequal rollout of the vaccine. A spokesman for the health ministry declined to comment and referred questions to the ministry’s DGS office. The DGS did not respond to emailed questions. The lawmaker, Mansour Kamardine of the centre-right Les Republicains party, said the initial plan had been for the vaccine to be stored in Reunion, some 1,700 kilometres (1,056 miles) away. “We have to beg each time just to get crumbs,” the lawmaker said."

Expressing irritation that Canadians were still taking vacations despite the worsening second wave, Trudeau also indicated Ottawa would bring in measures designed to make it harder and more expensive to travel. He spoke on Thursday to the premiers of the 10 provinces, some of whom want Ottawa to clamp down on non-essential travel. He reiterated that people should stay home. ""We could be bringing in new measures that significantly impede your ability to return to Canada at any given moment, without warning,"" said Trudeau, promising more details in coming days. Canada, which has so far reported 18,622 coronavirus deaths from a total of 731,450 cases, already requires all arrivals by air to go into self-administered quarantine for 14 days. Trudeau said one option was to force people to spend the time in hotel rooms they would have to pay for."

6.868283249962917," BioNTech to provide 50 million needles to extract more vaccine doses FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - BioNTech is to supply 50 million specialty needles at no profit to countries struggling to extract a sixth dose from vials of its COVID-19 vaccine, while Europe’s immunisation campaign is hampered by a temporary supply shortfall. European Union countries have been rushing to secure supplies of special syringes with so-called low dead space that are needed to stop any vaccine being wasted when shots are administered. “BioNTech purchased low dead space needles which work with multiple syringes and is offering a supply with the low dead space needles to countries around the world on a cost-covering basis,” it said in a written statement to Reuters. The vaccine from BioNTech and U.S. partner Pfizer was initially sold in the EU in vials meant to deliver five doses, but a global shortage of shots and a viability assessment on dosage convinced the EU drugs regulator to approve on Jan. 8 the extraction of six doses from the same vials. The decision increased availability, prompting Pfizer to raise its output targets for this year to 2 billion vaccines from 1.3 billion initially envisaged. Yet some European countries have been drawing fewer than the approved six doses because they lack the right injection equipment. Officials and healthcare professionals in France, Germany and Switzerland this week all pointed to lower yields, adding to frustrations in countries already lagging vaccination campaigns in countries such as Britain and the United States. Pfizer, in a separate statement, said it was in talks with the European Commission and EU member states “on how we can best support vaccinations plans - this includes supporting governments in securing supply of (low-dead-space) syringes should they need it.” BioNTech, headquartered in Mainz, Germany, said it had taken delivery of around 50 million such needles, which it could provide to countries around the world, and was in talks to procure more."
6.868283249962917," Gap between COVID-19 shots may be stretched past recommended range in some cases: U.S. CDC (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said a second COVID-19 shot could be administered as much as six weeks apart from the first one in situations where it was not possible to get a booster dose immediately. In most cases, the recommended dosing interval of three weeks for Pfizer Inc’s vaccine and four weeks for Moderna Inc’s vaccine should be followed, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in its guidance on Thursday. However, “sometimes the situation is stressed where it’s very difficult to be exactly on time”, U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Friday. “I don’t see a big problem with that (six weeks recommendation) if the situation on the ground means the stress is such that you can’t precisely do 28 days or 21 days,” Fauci added. Moderna said there was no data to give an informed perspective on the CDC’s recommendation, while Pfizer did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Britain has begun spacing doses of the vaccines by up to 12 weeks despite little data, saying the move could help more people get initial protection."

Pfizer and the Commission had earlier said that there would be no more slowdowns next week, after supplies were held up this week due to works at a Pfizer plant meant to ramp up production. Italy is threatening legal action against Pfizer for the delays. On Thursday, COVID-19 special commissioner Domenico Arcuri said the country was been told to expect a 20% cut next week after a reduction in this week’s supply of almost 30%.

6.868283249962917," Lithuania says expects enough COVID-19 vaccines for herd immunity by July VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania’s president said on Friday the country would receive enough COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate 70% of its population by early July, and that this would achieve herd immunity. The ambitious supply schedule hinges on vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson being approved for use in the European Union, in addition to the Pfizer shot already being administered, President Gitanas Nauseda said. “We received assurances from the European Commission president that Lithuania will be able to vaccinate 70% of population by early summer, because we will receive 4 million vaccines during the first and second quarters,” Nauseda said. “The challenge is about to change from vaccine shortages to setting up mass vaccinations, so that we use the time optimally and can fully reach collective immunity (by early July). This is the goal we can set for ourselves,” he told reporters. The World Health Organization has estimated that 60-70% of a population needs to be vaccinated to break transmission. However, the concept of herd immunity comes with caveats and big demands of what vaccines might be capable of preventing, and some experts say such expectations are misplaced. Experts point to various still unresolved factors - such as the rate of the spread of the COVID-19-causing virus, whether vaccines can stop transmission or just stop people getting ill, how many people in a population will accept a vaccine, and whether vaccines offer the same protection to everyone. Nauseda said Lithuania, a Baltic republic of 2.8 million people, will need to vaccinate 10,000 per day by February and up to 35,000 people per day by April to reach the July target. Between 1,000 and 4,000 people have received the vaccine daily this week, according to government data."

6.868283249962917," Exclusive: Pfizer-BioNTech agree to supply WHO co-led COVID-19 vaccine scheme - sources LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pfizer and BioNTech have agreed to supply their COVID-19 vaccine to the World Health Organization co-led COVAX vaccine access scheme, two sources familiar with the deal said, the latest in a series of shots to be included in the project aimed at lower-income countries. The deal is expected to be announced on Friday, according to the sources, who declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the agreement. Details on the size of the deal or the price per dose COVAX would pay were not immediately clear, but the sources said the allotment would likely be relatively small. One source said the reason for the limited volume was that the doses were primarily meant for healthcare workers in the countries that COVAX serves. BioNTech declined to comment while Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for the WHO and the GAVI vaccine alliance, which co-leads the COVAX scheme, also declined to comment. Senior WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said on Monday the COVAX scheme was in “very detailed discussions” with Pfizer, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations, and expected to be able to include the vaccine in COVAX “very soon”. The COVAX scheme is set to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines to poor and middle income countries in February. Ukraine said earlier on Thursday that its first delievery of COVID-19 vaccine under the COVAX scheme could arrive in the first half on February - with 210,000 doses of either the Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines. COVAX has said it hopes to deliver more than 2 billion COVID-19 doses across the world this year. In an updated forecast published on Thursday, it said it planned to deliver around 1.8 billion doses in 2021 to 92 poorer countries, covering around 27% of their populations. The scheme - led by the WHO, the GAVI vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)- was set up last year amid concerns that poorer nations would lose out while rich countries scrambled to procure COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations. COVAX has so far secured future vaccine suplies from AstraZeneca, working with Oxford University; the Serum Institute of India (SII) as well as with Sanofi and its partner GSK. It also has a memorandum of understanding over deliveries from Johnson & Johnson. The Pfizer deal would be COVAX’s second, after the one with AstraZeneca, that covers a product with regulatory approval in some countries. The additional commitment by Pfizer comes as frustration grows in European countries over the U.S. drugmaker’s unexpected cut in supplies. Pfizer said last week it would reduce deliveries until early February to upgrade production capacity for a later output boost. The Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is the only shot so far to have WHO emergency use listing approval. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the WHO plans to approve several COVID-19 vaccines from Western and Chinese manufacturers in the coming weeks and months as it aims for rapid rollouts in poorer countries. BioNTech and Pfizer said this month they were aiming to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses this year, up from a previous goal of 1.3 billion. Their shot is more complicated to transport and store, requiring ultra-cold freezers, which may not be practical for poorer countries with hot climates."

Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with its German partner BioNTech, has reduced the volume of the vaccine it will deliver to European Union countries this week. Pfizer and BioNTech have declined to comment on the cuts beyond a statement last week which announced cuts to deliveries as they ramp up manufacturing in Europe. Italy has said it is considering legal action, amid mounting frustration over the impact the cut in supplies has on vaccination programmes. “I think that such a decision (on legal action) could be made next month if these supplies are not completed in accordance with the manufacturer’s declaration,” Piotr Muller told public broadcaster Polskie Radio Program 1. On Monday, Poland received 176,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a drop of around 50% from what was expected, authorities said. On Thursday, Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said the missing doses would be delivered from mid-February. “At the moment, we have a situation where the manufacturer declares... that these differences will be covered,” Muller said. “But if this is not the case then of course legal measures will have to be considered.”"

Romania got only 50% of its planned volume for this week, the other half being allocated gradually by the end of March, with deliveries returning to normal starting next week, Deputy Health Minister Andrei Baciu told Reuters.

9.539555591274997," EU scrambles for syringes to avoid wasting Pfizer vaccines and extra cost BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries are rushing to secure special syringes needed to extract six doses from each vial of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in an attempt to inoculate more people and avoid paying extra. The vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech was the first to get EU approval in December. It was initially sold in the EU in vials meant to deliver five doses, but a global shortage of shots and a viability assessment on dosage convinced the EU drugs regulator to approve on Jan. 8 the extraction of six doses from the same vials. The decision increased availability, prompting Pfizer to raise its output targets for this year to 2 billion vaccines from 1.3 billion initially envisaged. For buyers of the vaccine, however, there was a drawback because EU states face the prospect of paying the price of six doses for each vial, regardless of their ability to extract a sixth shot. “We will fulfil our supply commitments in line with our existing agreements – which are based on delivery of doses, not vials – and in accordance with locally approved labelling,” Pfizer said after the EU drugs regulator’s decision to shift to a six-dose label. The European Commission has repeatedly declined to comment on the pricing arrangements after the regulatory change. Officials and healthcare professionals in Germany and France, the bloc’s largest states, have pointed to yields short of six doses because of technical difficulties and warned of a lack of the special syringes, known as Low Dead Space Syringes, needed to extract the sixth dose.. At a meeting of EU health ministers last week, Belgium said bottlenecks in the supply of these syringes were likely when Pfizer begins to deliver bigger volumes of its shots, of which the EU has secured 600 million doses, an official who attended the meeting told Reuters. A Belgian diplomat said the country had urged the EU executive commission to speed up joint procurement for syringes to avoid “unnecessary delays”. While there is no immediate shortage, there are not enough syringes for mass vaccination, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian health ministry told Reuters on Thursday, saying the Baltic country had joined the EU procurement scheme. “What is now not a problem, can easily become a very big problem tomorrow,” she said. A spokesman for the EU Commission said the EU had negotiated contracts with several firms for the delivery of hundreds of millions of these special syringes and needles, but could not say when deliveries would begin. The EU is the main buyer of the shot worldwide and Pfizer-BioNTech are the main suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to the EU. The two companies were heavily criticised when they announced last week a temporary slowdown in deliveries to EU countries while they improve production capacity."

Some countries were believed to be withholding some vaccines for fear of a shortage for the required second dose, meant to be administered three weeks after the first vaccination. Pfizer said last week it would have to reduce deliveries of the shots to Europe until early February in order to upgrade production capacity for a later output boost. Speaking in an interview with monthly Manager Magazin, the managing director of the investment vehicle of biotech investors Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who hold about half the shares in BioNTech, said Denmark was taking the delivery cuts in its stride and was not withholding any volumes for the second booster dose of the two-shot regimen. “Denmark, for example, is being a role model,” said Helmut Jeggle, head of the Struengmann brothers’ holding company Athos, told the magazine, when asked why Europe was falling behind in its vaccination campaign. He said in parts of Germany, half of the apportioned vaccine doses were stored to reserve a booster shot for every recipient of the first shot within the prescribed three-week interval. “That degree of stock keeping is not necessary because we will do everything to really deliver the committed volumes in the first quarter, irrespective of some hiccups at the Belgian site in Puurs for one or two week,” Jeggle was quoted as saying.

Inoculations in the Western Balkans have begun in Serbia, which has directly ordered Pfizer/BioNTech, Russian Sputnik V and Chinese Sinopharm vaccines. But Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo have not received any vaccines as yet. Albania has received some. Bosnia has ordered 1.2 million vaccines under the COVAX scheme and nearly 900,000 vaccines from the EU for its two autonomous regions, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, and expects the first batch to arrive soon, Prime Minister Zoran Tegeltija said. Bosna applied for EU membership in 2016. The COVAX scheme, led by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance, is due to start rolling out vaccines to poor and middle-income countries in February, with 2 of 3 billion doses expected to be delivered this year. But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while wealthy nations have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves. Europe has also suffered delays in deliveries from Pfizer. Bosnia’s central government, over which Tegeltija presides, does not have the authority to order vaccines directly from producers. The two regions also can only make orders through authorised agencies. Under strong public pressure, the two otherwise rival regions and the central government agreed on Thursday to work together to order directly from Pfizer and the Russian and Chinese producers, Tegeltija told a news conference. “Bearing in mind the delays in deliveries, we have decided to start this very complicated procurement system,” he said. Bosnia, with a population of about 3.5 million, on Thursday recorded a total of 119,206 coronavirus infections, with 18,123 active cases and 4,536 deaths."

9.539555591274997," Ivory Coast says delivery of its first doses of Pfizer vaccine delayed to mid-Feb ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast’s government said it will receive a first batch of around 100,000 doses of the Pfizer BioNTech coronavirus vaccine in mid February, around two weeks later than initially planned, due to delays in availability of the shots. Government spokesman Sidi Tiemoko Toure said on Wednesday the country plans to roll out its inoculation programme in the first quarter and would authorise vaccines from AstraZeneca, China’s Sinopharm and Russia this week. While richer nations have secured and launched mass vaccination campaigns, countries in Africa are still scrambling to secure supplies as most grapple with a second wave of infections. “The first deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine of around 100,000 doses initially scheduled for the end of January 2021, have been postponed to mid February due to delays in the availability of vaccines,” Toure said. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa, some among the world’s poorest, are relying on the World Health Organization-backed global COVAX scheme which has secured nearly 2 billion doses, and aims to deliver 1.3 billion of these in 2021 to 92 eligible low- and middle-income nations. Toure said the 100,000 doses Ivory Coast secured are separate from the COVAX alliance scheme. The government has previously said frontline health workers and the vulnerable section of the population would be first to be vaccinated.

8.09478088171994," Chile regulator greenlights Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s health regulator approved the emergency roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd on Wednesday but stipulated that it should not be used for the higher-risk over-60s group. The decision clears the way for over 10 million doses of CoronaVac approved on Wednesday for emergency use to be given to Chileans between the ages of 18 and 59. Heriberto Garcia, director of the Public Health Institute (ISP), said “very encouraging” data from late-stage trials and the ISP’s own investigations suggested CoronaVac was a “safe and effective vaccine to fight the pandemic.” Ten members of the ISP advisory board approved the vaccine roll-out, while two voted against it and one abstained. The two medical experts who voted against said they wanted to see more data on the vaccine trials. The Sinovac vaccine has also been approved and is being rolled out in Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia, but there are some concerns over its efficacy. Chile’s health minister, Enrique Paris, hailed the approval but said the Sinovac vaccine would not initially be given to the over-60s on the recommendation of the regulator’s committee of experts, who said they first wanted to see more late stage trial data on the safety and efficacy of the shot for the over-60s. Instead, the minister said that the vulnerable older population would be vaccinated with the shot made by Pfizer and BioNTech, which has had an efficacy rate of over 90% in trials. The minister said Chile would use 10 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine it has ordered to inoculate the around 1.8 million Chileans over the age of 60. Previously, it has used the Pfizer vaccine largely for healthcare workers. “For now we will stick with the recommendation of that expert group,” he said. “We will use all the Pfizer doses we can for the elderly so as not to leave them without vaccines. I hope that our vaccination timeline will not change.” Chile is hosting a late-stage clinical trial of the Sinovac vaccine and had ordered 60 million doses to be administered to its population of 18 million over three years. A delivery of around 2 million Sinovac doses is expected as early as Monday, the science ministry told Reuters. Data from the Sinovac vaccine’s late-stage clinical trial in Brazil earlier this month sparked concern among some other potential buyers after it showed the vaccine was 50.4% effective at preventing symptomatic infections, including “very mild” cases. Previously released data said CoronaVac showed 78% efficacy against “mild-to-severe” cases. The ISP said data from Chile’s own CoronaVac trial was not yet available, but it had examined data from trials in other countries. The regulator sent two inspectors to the Sinovac factory in Beijing in November. Chile became the first country in South America to start vaccinating against COVID-19 with the arrival of 10,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Christmas Eve. Since then, the country has taken delivery of a total of 154,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, inoculating 45,000 health workers and lately some older Chileans with one dose and at least 8,360 with a second, according to health ministry figures. The ISP is also weighing approval of AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use - Chile has already ordered 14.4 million doses."
8.09478088171994," South African virus variant may resist antibody drugs; Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine seems to work vs UK variant (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. South African variant may resist current antibody treatments The variant of the new coronavirus identified in South Africa can resist, or ""escape,"" antibodies that neutralize earlier versions of the virus, scientists have found. It ""exhibits complete escape"" from three classes of monoclonal antibodies manufactured for treating COVID-19 patients, and it shows ""substantial or complete"" resistance to neutralizing antibodies in blood donated by COVID-19 survivors, the scientists reported on Tuesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Similarities between the South Africa variant and another variant identified in Brazil suggest the Brazilian variant will show similar resistance, they added. Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study, noted that these were laboratory tests, and it would be unwise to extrapolate the findings to humans at this point. ""The data do raise the possibility that the protection gained from past infection with COVID-19 may be lower for re-infection with the South African variant,"" he said. ""The data also suggest that the existing vaccines could be less effective against the South African variant."" He called for large studies among populations where the variant is common. (bit.ly/3sLeIgP) Pfizer/BioNTech shot likely protects against UK variant The COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE is likely to protect against the more infectious variant of the virus discovered in Britain and now spreading around the world, according to laboratory tests. Researchers took blood samples from 16 people who had received the vaccine and exposed the blood to a synthetic virus, or pseudovirus, that was engineered to have 10 mutations found in the UK variant. The antibodies that had developed in response to the vaccine effectively neutralized the pseudovirus, according to a report posted on Tuesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. ""This makes it very unlikely that the UK variant will escape from the protection provided by the vaccine,"" said Jonathan Stoye, a virus scientist at Britain's Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. Similar experiments are needed with the more concerning variant first found in South Africa, he suggested. AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and CureVac NV are also testing whether their respective vaccines will protect against the fast-spreading variants. (bit.ly/35X6Wa4; reut.rs/3p1TCZz) Immune system will remember how to make COVID-19 antibodies People who have recovered from COVID-19 can likely mount a fast and effective response to the virus if they encounter it again because their immune system's ""B cells"" will remember how to make the antibodies needed to fight it, a new study shows. Researchers tracked 87 COVID-19 survivors for six months and found that while levels of antibodies to the virus may decline over time, the number of memory B cells remains unchanged. The antibodies produced by these cells are more potent than the patients' original antibodies and may be more resistant to mutations in the spike protein the virus uses to break into cells, they said. For example, they found, the antibodies could recognize and neutralize at least one of the mutations in the South African variant of the virus that has caused concern among health experts. Even if antibody levels fall, B cells will remember how to make them when necessary, according to study leader Michel Nussenzweig of Rockefeller University, whose findings were reported on Monday in Nature. If this is true at six months, as in this study, it is safe to assume it is probably still true for longer periods, he added. People who have recovered from COVID-19 ""may become infected but the immune system will be prepped to fight off the infection,"" Nussenzweig said. (go.nature.com/3nWtwWo) Mortality higher when ICUs are packed with COVID-19 patients The more full an intensive care unit (ICU) is with COVID-19 patients, the higher the mortality rate among those patients, new data suggest. When researchers tracked outcomes of 8,515 COVID-19 patients admitted to 88 U.S. Veterans Affairs hospitals in 2020, they found that survival rates improved between March and August. Throughout the study period, however, the risk of death was nearly double when at least 75% of ICU beds were filled with COVID-19 patients, compared to when they accounted for no more than 25% of ICU beds. COVID-19 mortality ""increases during periods of peak demand,"" said Dr. Dawn Bravata of the Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis who co-led the study published on Tuesday in JAMA Network Open. ""The more the public can do to avoid infections, the better,"" she added. In addition, Bravata said, ""facilities within a healthcare system or within a geographic region should collaborate to triage critically ill patients with COVID-19 to sites with greater ICU capacity to reduce strain on any one facility.""

8.09478088171994," German COVID-19 fight hit by delay to Pfizer vaccine BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia said on Wednesday it will delay the opening of new vaccination centres to Feb. 8 due to a temporary slowdown of deliveries of vaccines from Pfizer and its German partner Biotech. Pfizer started delivering shots in the European Union at the end of December but announced on Friday there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost output. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said he was annoyed by the short notice of the delays: “It is not easy for us... We can only vaccinate with that which has been delivered.” Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of Germany’s 16 states agreed on Tuesday to extend for another two weeks a lockdown for most shops and schools until Feb. 14. A Forsa poll for broadcasters RTL and ntv showed 49% of more than 1,000 Germans surveyed found the measures agreed on Tuesday “all in all appropriate”, with 25% finding they went too far and 24% believing they did not go far enough. The North-Rhine Westphalia health ministry said the delays were forcing it to push back by a week the opening of 53 vaccination centres which will start offering shots to the over 80s, with no more first shots possible for the coming week. The region has already vaccinated around 350,000 people and will add another 30,000 by the end of the week, the ministry said. Hospitals and care homes will resume vaccinations on Feb. 1 with 80,000 doses planned for that week. The spread of the virus has slowed in Germany recently, with rise in new cases up by 15,974 to 2,068,002, but down from the 19,600 reported a week ago. However, the death toll rose by 1,148 to 48,770, above the week ago increase. Spahn said the figures were going in the right direction, noting there were 800 fewer patients in intensive care than a week or two ago, but this was not the time to relax controls. “The goal is to get the figures down enough so they are manageable in the longer-term and in parallel ramp up vaccination,” he said. The health minister in North Rhine-Westphalia, Karl-Josef Laumann, said three cases had been confirmed in his region of a fast-spreading variant of the virus first detected in Britain."

On Tuesday, it said it was not in the position to make up the 29% shortfall next week and that it was planning a further ""slight reduction"" in deliveries, Arcuri said. ""As a result, we discussed what action to take to protect Italian citizens and their health in all civil and criminal venues,"" Arcuri said in a statement late on Tuesday. ""It was unanimously decided that these actions will be taken starting in the next few days."" He did not elaborate. The Pfizer vaccine requires two injections, given around 21 days apart, to prime the immune system well enough to fight off the coronavirus. Pfizer's move was having a serious impact on vaccination plans drawn up by local authorities, the governor of the northern Emilia Romagna region said. ""Due to the reduction in doses, many regions have been forced to slow down or even suspend new vaccinations to ensure administration of the second dose to those who had already received the first,"" Stefano Bonaccini told Reuters in an email. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment on Wednesday over Italy's legal threat and criticism regarding delivery delays beyond its statement on Friday about supply cuts. The drugmaker said last week it was temporarily slowing supplies of its coronavirus vaccine to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output. Pfizer, which is trying to deliver millions of doses at a breakneck pace to curb a pandemic that has already killed more than 2 million people worldwide, said the changes would ""provide a significant increase in doses in late February and March"". read more According to an Italian source, Rome is now trying to assess whether Pfizer is acting under force majeure, or circumstances beyond its control. If not, the drug group could be accused of breaching the contract it has signed with the European Union on state members' behalf, the source said.

8.09478088171994," Europe's COVID shot party gives way to Pfizer vaccine delay headache ZURICH (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is facing criticism, and potential legal action, over its surprise move to temporarily delay COVID-19 vaccine shipments to European countries that fear disruptions could throw their inoculation campaigns into disarray. British, then U.S. and European approvals of Pfizer and BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine late last year prompted celebrations, only to be followed by early-2021 anxiety as the reality sets in that vaccinating billions across the world will be fraught with unforeseen hurdles. In Italy, the COVID-19 special commissioner is considering legal action against Pfizer Inc after the U.S. drugmaker and its German partner told the country it was cutting its deliveries by 29%. German Health Minister Jens Spahn was annoyed at the hiccup, as at least one state pushes back vaccination centre openings as a consequence. And Switzerland, where ski resort St Moritz has been broadsided by quarantines at luxury hotels for hundreds of workers and guests after infections with a fast-spreading virus variant, lamented its latest Pfizer/BioNTech delivery this week was skimpier than it had hoped. Pfizer and BioNTech announced last week that to scale up manufacturing in Europe to deliver many more doses in the second quarter they must first trim production at a Puurs, Belgium, vaccine-making plant. They aim to be back on schedule by Jan. 25, the companies said. The reassurances, however, seem to be providing little comfort for countries that want shots sooner rather than later. “We discussed what (legal) action to take to protect Italian citizens and their health in all civil and criminal venues,” Italy’s COVID-19 commissioner, Domenico Arcuri, said. “These actions will be taken starting in the next few days.” BioNTech declined comment on Wednesday on growing dissent among countries it is helping supply and referred to its statement on Friday about supply cuts. The pain is being felt further afield than Europe. On Tuesday, Canada said it would not receive any Pfizer vaccines next week, adding more pain for provinces already complaining about a shortage of supplies. Providing some hope, as the world struggles to tame a pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people, a study whose authors include BioNTech founders Ugur Sahin and Oezlem Tuereci concluded their vaccine is likely to protect against the more-infection British virus variant spreading worldwide. Chinese state media have also targeted Pfizer/BioNTech, and other vaccine makers, in articles questioning their shots’ safety after reports of elderly deaths. The reports came after Western scientists criticised the insufficient data disclosure in China’s vaccine trials. Much of Europe’s focus was on disruption in deliveries though. Adding to those concerns, some nations are failing to regularly get six doses from each vial, as approved by regulators, reducing the number of shots available. Swiss Federal Ministry of Health vice director Nora Kronig told reporters at a press briefing in Bern delays were due to Pfizer’s temporary closure of a small production line in Belgium as part of measures that would result in boosting total vaccine production volumes at the facility. “The delivery that arrived yesterday was reduced,” Kronig said, adding she’s optimistic things will be back on track soon. “We’ve had reassurances that we’ll receive (planned deliveries)... during the first quarter.” Even so, North-Rhine Westphalia, the most populous of Germany’s 16 states with 18 million people, is delaying the opening of new vaccination centres to Feb. 8. In Britain, the first nation to approve the vaccine, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country’s vaccine programme was on track to hit mid-February targets. Still he acknowledged “constraints on supply”."

8.09478088171994," Chinese media criticise Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, tout local shots BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media outlets have run a series of articles criticising Western COVID-19 vaccines in the past week, including Pfizer’s, while touting China-made vaccines as safer and more accessible. The reports have come as China’s vaccines, which are being rolled out to countries including Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey, have faced criticism in the West for insufficient data disclosure. The Global Times, a tabloid published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, has published more than ten reports in the past week critical of vaccines and inoculation schemes in the West. About half of them have referred to reported deaths of some highly frail patients in Norway after being inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine developed Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. In a Jan. 15 editorial, the Global Times accused mainstream U.S. and British news outlets of “deliberately downplaying the deaths” and “using propaganda power to promote the Pfizer vaccine and smearing Chinese vaccines.” “Those major Western media will immediately hype any unfavourable information about Chinese vaccines and try to amplify their impact on public psychology,” it said. Norwegian authorities have not established a causal link between the deaths and vaccination and said on Jan. 18 they were not changing their policy on using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Liu Xin, an anchor with CGTN, China’s English-language state TV channel, on Jan. 16 tweeted screenshots of an unverified report of 10 deaths after vaccinations in Germany. “Can’t independently verify but it’s concerning,” she tweeted. “What about following it up? Hello??? @BBCWorld @CNN @AP @Reuters.” A Global Times report on Tuesday cited Chinese experts saying Australia should consider halting regulatory procedures for Pfizer’s vaccine until the investigation of the deaths is over. It also said Australia should purchase Chinese-developed vaccines, “which are relatively safer due to their mature technology”. The Global Times has also argued that Chinese vaccines are cheaper and easier to transport, and portrayed Pfizer as an unreliable supplier, sacrificing need in other countries to prioritise supply for the United States. “Reports of adverse events outside of clinical studies are a very important component to our pharmacovigilance activities,” a Pfizer representative said in an email.

8.09478088171994," Pfizer vaccine appears effective against coronavirus variant found in Britain - study FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is likely to protect against a more infectious variant of the virus discovered in Britain which has spread around the world, according to results of further lab tests released on Wednesday. The encouraging results from an analysis of blood of participants in trials are based on more extensive analysis than those released by the U.S. drugmaker last week. Last week, Pfizer said a similar laboratory study showed the vaccine was effective against one key mutation, called N501Y, found in two highly transmissible new variants spreading in Britain and South Africa. The latest study, posted on bioRxiv.org but not yet peer reviewed, was conducted on a synthetic virus with 10 mutations that are characteristic of the variant known as B117 identified in Britain. Among the 11 authors of the study are Ugur Sahin and Oezlem Tuereci, co-founders of BioNTech. Sahin is chief executive and his wife Tuereci is chief medical officer. It provides further hope as record numbers of daily deaths from COVID-19 are reported in Britain, which is believed to be driven by the more transmissible variant. It also means vaccine development would for now not have to start all over again. But the virus needs to be continuously monitored to check that changes maintain protection by vaccines, the study said. For the test, blood samples drawn from 16 vaccinated participants in prior clinical trials were exposed to a synthetic virus called pseudovirus which was engineered to have the same surface proteins as B117, as characterised by 10 hallmark mutations. The antibodies in the blood of the volunteers given the vaccine, known as Comirnaty, or BNT162b2, neutralised the pseudovirus as effectively as the older coronavirus version that the product was initially designed for. Experts said the findings were reassuring and not surprising and results from similar studies on the South African variant would be keenly watched. “This makes it very unlikely that the UK variant will escape from the protection provided by the vaccine,” said Jonathan Stoye, a specialist in virus science at Britain’s Francis Crick Institute. “It will be interesting to carry out the same experiments with the South African variant.” BioNTech has said it plans to publish a more detailed analysis of the likely effect of its vaccine on the South African variant within a few days. The world is pinning its hopes on vaccines to rein in the coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, as many countries impose tighter and longer lockdowns to try to bring the pandemic under control. The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness. “The South African strain has been detected in the UK - albeit currently in small numbers - but does seem to be increasing in recent weeks,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia. “Variants with this mutation could reduce vaccine efficacy, though most likely all current vaccines would still be highly effective.” Experts have called for continued testing to establish whether vaccines will protect people as the virus mutates. COVID-19 has killed more than 2 million people worldwide. Preparation for potential COVID-19 vaccine strain changes would be “prudent”, the study said on Wednesday. The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc, which both use synthetic messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, can be quickly adapted to address new mutations in the coronavirus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks. AstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their respective shots will protect against the fast-spreading variants. They have not released the results of those tests."

During the past three weeks, U.S. coronavirus fatalities have totaled 63,793 compared with 52,715 deaths in the three weeks prior to Christmas, an increase of 21%, according to a Reuters analysis. The daily COVID-19 death numbers crossed 4,000 for the first time on Jan. 6. Eighteen U.S. states, including California, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington reported their highest daily death numbers in January, according to the Reuters tally. The number of coronavirus cases has risen across all U.S. regions and on Tuesday crossed 24 million since the pandemic started. While seriously ill patients are straining healthcare systems in parts of the country, especially in California, the national rate of hospitalizations has leveled off in the past two weeks and was near 124,000 on Tuesday. President-elect Joe Biden, due to be sworn in on Wednesday, has proposed a $1.9 trillion aid package that includes $415 billion to bolster the response to the virus and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, some $1 trillion in direct relief to households, and roughly $440 billion for small businesses and communities hardest hit by the pandemic.

7.142690781489403," Cut in supplies of Pfizer coronavirus vaccines to hit Canada, Europe too OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc told Canada on Tuesday it will receive no coronavirus vaccines next week, officials said, an unexpected development that promises more pain for provinces already complaining about a shortage of supplies. Pfizer said last week it would slow production in late January and early February because of changes in manufacturing processes, resulting in a supply cut for Canada and European Union nations. Canada had already predicted last week that Pfizer shipments would be cut in half over the next month. But Major-General Deny Fortin, who is helping organize the inoculation campaign, said Pfizer had now announced all Canadian deliveries promised for the week starting Jan. 25 would be pushed back into February. “The effect next week will be severe, more severe than we had initially expected,” he told reporters, predicting “a considerable impact” in all 10 provinces. Pfizer still planned to meet commitments to supply up to 4 million doses of the vaccine by the end of March, he said. Canada, struggling to deal with a rapidly spreading second wave of the coronavirus, has reported a total of 18,120 deaths and 715,072 cases so far. European governments last week said the Pfizer supply problems were unacceptable and meant the credibility of their vaccination programs was at risk. Canadian Procurement Minister Anita Anand said the delay was “very disappointing”, adding she had insisted to Pfizer over the weekend that Canada be treated fairly and not be forced to wait longer than other nations for vaccines. “Pfizer assured me and Canada of equitable treatment,” she told reporters. “Pfizer Canada has assured us that we will have our full allotment and I believe Europe will also receive its full allotment.” The premier of Alberta said on Monday his province would run out of doses within a day. The premier of Ontario, the most populous province, said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should be doing more to pressure the head of Pfizer. “We’ve got to be on these guys like a blanket. I’d be outside that guy’s house - every time he moved, I’d say ‘Where’s our vaccines’?” Doug Ford told reporters. Quebec Premier Francois Legault urged Ottawa to ban non-essential international travel and better enforce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for arriving passengers. Trudeau, in a separate briefing, told Canadians not to travel abroad and said Ottawa could if necessary “introduce new measures without warning”. He did not give details."
7.142690781489403," Peru says Sinopharm, Pfizer seek approval for their COVID-19 vaccines LIMA (Reuters) - China’s Sinopharm Group and Pfizer Inc have requested approval for use of their COVID-19 vaccines in Peru as the Andean country grapples with a second wave of the coronavirus, a health official said on Tuesday. Carmen Ponce, general director of state drug regulator Digemid, said both drugmakers requested the registration last week after presenting “preliminary information” from their Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials. Ponce added that authorization requests from other vaccine makers, such as AstraZeneca Plc and Russia’s Gamaleya, are expected in the next few days. Coronavirus infections in Peru have climbed since the start of the year, forcing the government to tighten some restrictions including extending a nighttime curfew and restricting the transit of people on Sundays. The Peruvian government recently announced agreements with Sinopharm to secure 38 million doses of its vaccine and with AstraZeneca for 14 million doses. The arrival of a first batch of Sinopharm vaccine is expected by the end of January or early February, the government said. There is no delivery date yet for the other vaccines. Peru reported 3,893 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, taking its total to 1,068,802 with 38,931 coronavirus-related deaths."

7.142690781489403," European countries struggle to make most of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses ZURICH/PARIS (Reuters) - Some European countries are drawing fewer than the approved six doses from Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine vials, meaning shots are likely going to waste even as nations plead for more. Officials and healthcare professionals in France, Germany and Switzerland all pointed to yields short of six doses, adding to frustrations in countries already lagging vaccination campaigns in nations such as Britain and the United States. The losses add up: For 200,000 vials of the two-shot vaccine, 600,000 people can be inoculated at six doses per vial, compared with 500,000 at just five. The difficulties could also hinder Pfizer and BioNTech’s new production target of 2 billion COVID-19 shots in 2021, up from 1.3 billion previously. The higher production forecast assumes health teams can draw that sixth dose from vials where this is permitted, thus stretching supplies. In France, authorities acknowledge vials contain more than five doses, but early on advised health workers to aim for five. Some French experts said dose-maximising syringes were lacking. In Switzerland, some officials said five doses had emerged as standard, given the challenges of yielding more of a vaccine they describe as thick and hard to handle. “Five doses from a vial has proven itself a reliable method,” said Rolf Wirz, spokesman for the cantonal crisis management team in Basel-Land, in northwestern Switzerland. Confusion over Pfizer/BioNTech vial volumes emerged in December, when U.S. hospital pharmacists realised that preparing the vaccine, by mixing it with saline solution, yielded enough liquid for at least six 0.30 ml doses. They initially threw the extra dose away, since vials were labeled for five. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration quickly updated its doses per vial guidance, with the European Medicine Agency following suit on Jan. 8. BioNTech has said its 2 billion dose target was in part supported by an updated 6-dose label on the product. France’s health ministry originally aimed for five doses, but recently boosted its target to six per vial. Even so, one French expert raised fears of shortages of small 1 ml syringes - designed to maximise vaccine extraction - as an obstacle. “This is essential if we want to reach immunity targets quickly and before the new variants hit Europe even more,” said Eric Billy, an immuno-oncology researcher. “We may have syringes, but we do not have the right ones.” The health ministry said, in response to those concerns, that it aimed “to ensure that medical equipment is delivered that can allow for such extraction”. Germany offers a mixed picture: In the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, officials ordered 20.5 million 1 ml syringes and said they had enough to extract six doses. In eastern Thuringia, however, Health Minister Heike Werner said doctors were finding that obtaining the sixth dose was only possible with about half the Pfizer/BioNTech vials delivered. Other nations are having greater success. In Britain, officials forecast wastage of 10%, but said less was actually being discarded, helped by early recognition that extra doses were possible. “We discovered we’re able to get more out of the vials,” said Mary Ramsay, Public Health England’s immunisation head. Danish authorities are even drawing a seventh dose, boosting optimism they’ll exceed a two-month, 250,000-person inoculation goal. In the Netherlands, pharmacists initially predicted first-round vaccinations would cover 33,000 doctors and nurses. “It turned out to be 39,000 because they could get a sixth dose,” said Kirstin Schimmel, a hospital pharmacist in Leiden, adding some hospitals using special syringes got seven doses. Swiss regulator Swissmedic also advises a sixth Pfizer/BioNTech dose is possible with “appropriate syringes and careful handling”. Still, several Swiss cantons told Reuters they averaged less than six doses per vial. “When possible, we draw six,” said a cantonal health department spokeswoman in Zurich. “Five remains the standard. The vaccine is thick and very challenging to handle.” Aargau initially was yielding five doses, but cantonal officials said careful preparation and growing experience mean six are now increasingly possible. “This helps compensate for losses resulting from false preparation, ill-fitting needles and broken and empty vials,” said Michel Hassler, an Aargau spokesman."
7.142690781489403," New York governor asks Pfizer to directly sell COVID-19 vaccine doses (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla on Monday if the state could buy COVID-19 vaccine doses directly from the U.S. drugmaker, a move that raised ethical questions by the U.S. health department. Pfizer told Reuters that such a proposal would first require approval by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An HHS spokesman said that Cuomo was trying to circumvent the system in which the federal government, which has paid Pfizer for the United States’ allotment of vaccines already, allocates doses to each state. New York is asking to “cut to the front of the line at the expense of fellow jurisdictions,” the spokesman said in an emailed statement. “After myself and seven other governors called on the Trump Administration to release more doses, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said that relief was on the way. To date, however, the federal government has not acted on that promise,” Cuomo wrote. Cuomo said he was appealing to Pfizer directly as the company was “not bound by commitments” that Moderna Inc made as part of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s program to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. No state has purchased vaccines directly from the producer and Cuomo’s letter did not state how many doses he was seeking or how he would pay for it. Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration had promised to administer 20 million vaccinations by the end of 2020 but only about 10.6 million people had received one or more doses as of last Friday. Pfizer said it was open to collaborating with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in a way that would ensure quick vaccine distribution to as many Americans as possible."

7.142690781489403," Spain to send 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine to Andorra MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will sell 30,000 doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer coronavirus vaccine to microstate Andorra, as part of its plan to redistribute excess vaccines, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday. With less than 80,000 inhabitants, Andorra, a small country wedged between France and Spain, has reported 9,145 infections and 92 deaths since the COVID-19 pandemic started, official data shows. As part of the European Union purchase agreements, Spain will receive 140 million of doses of the different vaccines that were developed, enough to immunise more people than its population of 47 million. Some EU countries were made responsible for getting medicines to the states of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City, which depend on bigger neighbours for access. “This is an exercise in responsibility and solidarity, as small countries are unable to sign contracts with pharmaceutical companies,” Spain’s Health minister Salvador Illa said on his Twitter account. Spanish authorities said they will sell the vaccines at the same price they paid. The price has not been disclosed. In common with other countries, Spain is racing to vaccinate residents of nursing homes, which were ravaged by the virus during in the first months of the pandemic.

7.142690781489403," Mexico aims to make up for Pfizer vaccine shortfall with others MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday the government aimed to compensate for a reduction in deliveries of COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc with those from other providers. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday it was in advanced talks with Pfizer about including its vaccine in the agency’s portfolio of shots to be shared with poorer countries. Mexico had been expecting weekly deliveries of some 400,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech SE.

7.142690781489403," WHO hopes poorer nations can access Pfizer vaccine 'very soon' GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization is in advanced negotiations with Pfizer about including the company’s COVID-19 vaccine in the agency’s portfolio of shots to be shared with poorer countries, a senior WHO official said on Monday. “We are in ... detailed discussions with Pfizer. We believe very soon we will have access to that product,” Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser, said at the WHO’s executive board meeting, adding that it would then look to add other vaccines. The WHO’s vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX is set to start rolling out vaccines to poor and middle income countries in February with 2 of 3 billion targeted doses expected to be delivered this year. WHO already has deals with several suppliers, including AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. However, critics say the absence of Pfizer’s shot is an important gap and one of the reasons that poorer countries are lagging behind wealthier ones in administering vaccines. So far, 44 countries out of the 50 that have already begun vaccinations have used the Pfizer shot, WHO data showed. The vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below which the WHO has said creates difficulties for some developing countries. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday blamed vaccine nationalism for the inequity, saying the world was on the brink of “catastrophic moral failure” and has urged countries and manufacturers to spread doses more fairly."
7.142690781489403," Duterte says Filipinos can use Pfizer vaccine, but touts Sinovac deal MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Monday he would not stop Filipinos from getting shots of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech, despite reports in Norway of deaths among frail elderly people after being inoculated. “Almost everybody that I know (is) scrambling to buy this Pfizer (vaccine). To me I think it’s a good one,” he said in a late-night televised address. “If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead. Nobody would stop you.” Norway said on Monday it was not changing its policy on the use of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine following reports of deaths among very frail recipients after the inoculation was given. In his address, Duterte also reiterated his defense of the government’s supply deals involving CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech. The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the emergency use of Pfizer’s vaccine, the first to be approved in the Southeast Asian country, which has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in Asia. The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of its population, this year. Duterte said Sinovac’s vaccine is now being used in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, and Brazil, and there have been no deaths reported so far. The Philippines has also firmed up supply deals with Novavax, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, according to Carlito Galvez, a former military chief who handles the government’s vaccine procurement. Duterte assured the public of corruption-free vaccine supply deals, after the Senate launched an inquiry into government transactions amid questions about pricing transparency and efficacy. “I’m telling now General Galvez to proceed with his game plan, with or without the investigation”, which he said could derail the government’s vaccination plan."
7.142690781489403," Israel sharing COVID-19 data with Pfizer to help fine-tune vaccine rollout JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel is giving weekly data updates on its COVID-19 outbreak to vaccine maker Pfizer under a collaboration agreement that may help other countries fine-tune their inoculation campaigns and achieve “herd immunity”, officials said. Israelis began receiving first shots of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Dec. 19 in one of the world’s fastest vaccination rollouts. Israel’s Health Ministry made public most of a 20-page collaboration agreement it signed with Pfizer, which said the aim was “to determine whether herd immunity is achieved after reaching a certain percentage of vaccination coverage in Israel”. Commercial details such as price and quantity of vaccine shots supplied were not made public, but the agreement said that Israel was relying on Pfizer to deliver enough doses at a fast enough rate to allow it to achieve “herd immunity”, meaning a sufficient portion of the population is immune to the virus. “While this project is conducted in Israel, the insights gained will be applicable around the world and we anticipate will allow governments to maximize the public health impact of their vaccination campaigns,” BioNTech said on Monday in a statement. This includes determining potential immunization rates needed to stop the virus from spreading, it said. The goal, BioNTech said, was “to monitor the evolution of the epidemic over time and at different vaccination rates”. “This will help us understand whether a potential decrease in cases and deaths can be attributed solely to direct vaccine protection or to both direct and indirect (or ‘herd’) protection,” it said. Asked whether Pfizer was offering anything in return for the Israeli health data, a Pfizer spokeswoman in Israel said: “Pfizer does not offer anything in return. The agreement is public so you can read it. Besides that, we do not have any other comments.” During weekly status reports, Israel will provide Pfizer with epidemiological data such as: the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, how many patients were on ventilators, how many died, as well as an age and other demographic breakdown. Such data was available to the public and keeps patients anonymous, Israeli officials said. About a quarter of Israelis have received their first vaccine shot and 3.5% already got their second dose. Still, the country is in its third lockdown with infection rates remaining high. More than half a million cases have been reported and 4,005 people have died in Israel since the pandemic began."
7.142690781489403," Norway says advice on use of Pfizer vaccine is unchanged FRANKFURT/OSLO (Reuters) - Norway said on Monday it was not changing its policy on the use of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine following reports of deaths in highly frail recipients after the inoculation was given. BioNTech had earlier say that “Norwegian Health Authorities have now changed (their) recommendation in relation to vaccination of the terminally ill”. But the company later retracted the statement following clarification from Norway. The Nordic country is currently vaccinating residents of care homes, including those with serious underlying diseases. As of Jan. 14, 23 reports of suspected deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccines have been submitted to the Norwegian health registry. Of these 23 reports, 13 have been looked into by Norwegian health authorities. These concerned individuals who were described as old, frail and with serious diseases. But the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) said its guidelines remained the same. “The FHI has specified the advice that has been valid all the time, that one should have an assessment of each and every one before offering the vaccine,” Camilla Stoltenberg, the head of the agency, told a news conference. “These are people who are very old, are frail and have serious diseases,” she said “When it comes to the cause (of death), no analysis has been done.” “It is not a given that this represents an overmortality or a causality,” she said. In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Pfizer did not have any immediate comment. Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn said at a news briefing on Monday that the country’s vaccine regulator also saw no need to revise guidelines and that it was in contact with Norwegian counterparts."

Aylward justified the WHO stance saying they were expensive and that its cold-chain requirements were difficult for many countries to manage. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius before being shipped to distribution centres in cool boxes filled with dry ice. So far, 44 countries out of the 50 that have already begun vaccinations have used the shot, WHO data shows. The WHO also hopes to procure Pfizer shots via donations, rather than some countries being ""double-served"", Aylward said. ""We would be very keen to try and translate a lot of the commitments and interest in dose-sharing into actual deals, particularly with countries that have large bilateral deals on key products,"" he said, without naming countries."

The Clinical Frailty Scale, a widely used system of classification in elderly care, defines degree 8 patients as approaching end of life and typically unable to ""recover even from a minor illness"". The Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a statement posted on Friday and updated on Monday that ""common adverse reactions may have contributed to a severe course in elderly people who are frail"". As of Jan. 14, 23 reports of suspected deaths have been submitted to the Norwegian health registry, it said. ""An evaluation should be carried for each individual patient as to whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of eventual side effects,"" the Norwegian agency said. In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, the medicines agency said. Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said at a news briefing on Monday that the country's vaccine regulator saw no need to revise guidelines and that it was in contact with their Norwegian counterparts. The safety of vaccines is garnering global public attention after drugmakers developed the shots breakneck speed to curb a pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people. U.S. and European vaccine developers have pledged to uphold the scientific standards their immunisations will be held against in the race to contain the virus. Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there was no evidence so far of a causal link between the deaths of vulnerable patients in Norway and vaccination. ""We do not yet know, but it would seem that the observed numbers of deaths is not notably above the numbers expected, but this will need to be examined continually in all countries where it can be done,"" he said."
7.142690781489403," UK says vaccine manufacturing is 'lumpy' but still on course for targets LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s vaccine rollout is limited by a “lumpy” manufacturing process affecting supplies of both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, but is on track to hit its targets, Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Monday. The United Kingdom, which has the world’s fifth worst official death toll from COVID-19, is racing to be among the first major countries to vaccinate its population - seen as the best way to exit the pandemic and get the economy going again. Britain has inoculated 3,857,266 people with a first dose and 449,736 with a second dose. On vaccines administered per 100 people, the United Kingdom is fourth in the world after Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Pfizer said on Friday it would temporarily reduce its deliveries to Europe of its vaccine against coronavirus infections while it upgrades its production capacity. “There’s bound to be delays. Any new manufacturing process has challenges at the outset. It is lumpy, it begins to stabilise and get better and better week in, week out,” Zahawi told the BBC, adding that Pfizer was doing “really well”. “They want to do more, which is why they’re reconfiguring to add volume to the whole world...That could delay supply but I’m confident we can meet our target.” Britain aims to administer first doses of vaccine to 15 million people in the highest priority cohorts by mid-February. Pfizer said it was coordinating with the government to “work through the short-term impact of these changes to our January deliveries”. “We understand a change to deliveries has the potential to create uncertainty,” a Pfizer spokeswoman said. “However, we can confirm the overall projected volumes of delivery to the UK remain the same for quarter one (January to March).” Zahawi told LBC radio that Britain was hoping for 2 million vaccines a week from AstraZeneca by the end of January but that those numbers would not be reached until mid February. Last Wednesday, AstraZeneca’s UK president said the firm would scale up to 2 million doses a week on or before the middle of February. A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment further on Zahawi’s latest guidance. Mass COVID-19 vaccines are seen as the best way to exit the pandemic, which has killed more than 2 million people worldwide, wiped out trillions of dollars in economic output and upended normal life for countless people. The United Kingdom is vaccinating 140 people per minute against COVID-19 on average. “It is going well, we’re vaccinating on average 140 people, that’s first jab, literally a minute. That’s the average so some areas are doing better,” Zahawi told Sky. Britain is currently rolling out the vaccine to the most vulnerable first, starting with those who are in care homes or over 80 years of age. In areas where a majority of over 80s have been offered a vaccine, letters are going out to the over 70s and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Zahawi said a 24-hour vaccine offering would begin to be piloted in London by the end of the month. Essential workers such as teachers, the police and shop assistants could move to the top of the list for a vaccine once all those over 50 have been offered a shot, Zahawi said. “Teachers, police officers, shop workers, those who through no fault of their own other than the work that they do may come into contact with the virus in much greater volume, should be top of the list,” Zahawi told Times Radio."
7.142690781489403," Tennis causes tensions with Australians stranded by COVID-19 SYDNEY (Reuters) - As top tennis stars descended on Melbourne for the upcoming grand slam, many Australians questioned the decision to host the tournament when thousands of citizens are stranded overseas due to the coronavirus pandemic. Australia has halved the number of people who can return to the country each week as positive coronavirus cases in hotel quarantine rise, prompting airline Emirates to indefinitely suspend flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Australians questioned how the government could make room for 1,200 tennis players and their entourages for next month’s Australian Open, but not its own citizens. “If you want to come to Australia during a pandemic you have to be a sports star, movie celebrity or a billionaire media tycoon,” said user Daniel Bleakley on Twitter, using the hashtag #strandedAussies. “Citizenship and an Australian passport alone are not enough.” Others said the funds used to host the tournament could have been diverted to boost hotel quarantine facilities and healthcare systems to help bring back stranded Aussies. The tensions highlight the challenges facing Olympic Games host Japan, with public opinion largely against the event scheduled from July 23-Aug. 8 in Tokyo. A survey this month found 80% of Japanese want the games either cancelled or delayed as worries mount about a record surge in coronavirus cases across the country. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga however vowed on Monday to forge ahead with Olympic preparations. “TIME TO BE SELFISH” Officials in Australia’s Victoria state, home to the Open, said hosting the tournament did not disadvantage about 40,000 stranded Australians. “No-one has been set aside coming from other jurisdictions into Victoria by virtue of the Australian Open going ahead,” said Brett Sutton, Victoria’s chief medical officer. “They are separate decisions that are made upon their own merits.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a radio interviewer that no Australian was being prevented from coming home because of the Grand Slam. The comments come amid calls to cancel the tournament. “It’s time to be selfish, time for Victoria to put ourselves first,” 3AW radio broadcaster Neil Mitchell said. “Call off the Australian Open. It’s not worth the risk.” An opposition leader in Victoria’s state parliament, Tim Smith, accused Premier Daniel Andrews of double standards, urging him to “bring the Victorians home or cancel the Open”. Australia, which has managed the coronavirus better than many other nations through targeted lockdowns and high rates of testing and contact tracing, reported zero local COVID-19 cases on Monday. But the head of the health department warned Australia may not fully reopen its international borders this year. “Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don’t know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus,” Brendan Murphy told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Australia has reported nine positive COVID-19 results associated with tennis, prompting authorities to send three Australian Open charter flights into hard quarantine and forcing more than 70 players into 14-day hotel room isolation. The country has recorded more than 22,000 local COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg reiterated on Monday the government was committed to bringing back its citizens. “We, as the federal government, are working to help more Australians get back home,” he told reporters, adding that 446,000 had returned since the pandemic began in March. The government on Saturday announced an additional 20 flights to bring back stranded Aussies, saying they would not be counted within existing traveller caps."

6.15190401697112," Lebanon inks final deal for 2.1 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s caretaker health minister signed a final deal on Sunday to secure 2.1 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine as the country battles a steep rise in infections. The vaccines are expected to arrive in batches starting February, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry is also cooperating with the private sector to secure 2 million vaccine doses from Astrazenca and Sinopharm, it added. Lebanon is under a three-week lockdown that ends on Feb. 1 and a strict 24-hour curfew until Jan. 25 after lax measures over the Christmas and New Year’s holiday period led to a spike in cases. In addition to these deals, Lebanon has also signed up for 2.7 million doses to be delivered through COVAX, the global scheme backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to poorer countries."

The small island state of Bahrain has the third highest rate of vaccinations per capita in the world so far, according to the Our World in Data website, which is run by an Oxford University research programme. “The delay ... will not affect citizens and residents receiving the second dose of the vaccine over the upcoming period, according to current scheduled dates and the availability of the needed quantity for them,” the health ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency BNA. Bahrain offers its citizens free of charge either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or one manufactured by Chinese state-backed pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm. Other Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and the emirate of Dubai have also purchased the Pfizer jabs. U.S. pharmaceutical firm Pfizer this week said there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost production."

Pfizer’s comments run counter to a report in the Washington Post that the federal government ran down its vaccine reserve in late December and has no remaining reserves of doses on hand. “Operation Warp Speed has asked us to start shipping second doses only recently,” the spokeswoman said. “As a result, we have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US.” The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment.

3.5668599279643387," Canada keeps end-September COVID vaccination target despite Pfizer delay OTTAWA (Reuters) - Pfizer’s reduction of its COVID-19 vaccine shipments will not delay Canada’s goal of getting most people inoculated by the end of September, the country’s procurement minister said on Friday as the country battled a second surge in infections. “This is a temporary delay and we remain on track to have enough approved vaccines for everyone who wishes to get vaccinated by the end of September 2021,” Procurement Minister Anita Anand said. Pfizer said it would slow production in late January and early February due to changes to manufacturing processes aimed at boosting production, but would provide a “significant increase” in doses in late February and March. Canada’s Major-General Dany Fortin, who is in charge of coordinating the country’s vaccine rollout, told reporters Canada will receive about half the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine over the next four weeks than had been previously expected. However, Pfizer/BioNTech will “offset” the shortfall and still deliver - as had been planned - some 4 million by the end of March, he said. “I understand the disappointment. I share the disappointment,” Fortin said, echoing the frustration expressed by many Canadians about the slow pace of inoculations, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this month. Canada is struggling to contain a second wave of the novel coronavirus. On Friday, the health ministry said there could be a spike of more than 100,000 new cases in just the next nine days. That means almost 12,000 new cases per day, compared with the 7,565 new cases reported on Thursday. The spike in cases is being driven mainly by the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, health officials said, both of which have imposed health restrictions in recent weeks to try to slow the spread."
3.5668599279643387," EU states warn of risks to vaccination credibility as Pfizer slows supplies BRUSSELS/VILNIUS (Reuters) - European governments said the credibility of their COVID-19 vaccination programmes was at risk on Friday after U.S. pharmaceutical firm Pfizer announced a temporary slowdown of deliveries of its vaccines. Shots developed by Pfizer with its German partner BioNTech began being delivered in the European Union at the end of December, but around nine of the 27 EU governments complained of “insufficient” doses at a meeting this week, a participant said. Pfizer initially said deliveries were proceeding on schedule, but then on Friday announced there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost output. BioNTech said on Friday a facility in Puurs, Belgium, will temporarily see a drop in the number of doses delivered in the coming week, as changes to some production processes were needed to scale up capacity. The companies will inform the European Commission, EU member states and other countries impacted by the changes about the updated delivery schedules, BioNTech said. “This situation is unacceptable,” the health and social affairs ministers of six EU states said in a letter to the EU commission about the Pfizer delays. “Not only does it impact the planned vaccination schedules, it also decreases the credibility of the vaccination process,” the ministers from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said. “What we want is for Pfizer-BioNTech to restore their deliveries to the agreed schedule,” Lithuanian health minister Arunas Dulkys told Reuters. Germany, Europe’s largest purchaser of the Pfizer vaccine, called the decision surprising and regrettable, while Canada said it was also affected, because its supplies come from the Belgium factory. Italy’s COVID-19 special commissioner, Domenico Arcuri, said Pfizer would from Monday cut by 29% deliveries of vaccine shots to the country. The company had not been able to say for how long it would be curtailing its supplies, said Arcuri. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Pfizer had reassured her that deliveries planned to the EU in the first quarter would not be delayed. Pfizer, which is trying to deliver millions of doses at a breakneck pace to curb a pandemic that has already killed over 2 million people worldwide, said its changes would “provide a significant increase in doses in late February and March”. “We will be back to the original schedule of deliveries to the European Union beginning the week of Jan. 25, with increased delivery beginning the week of Feb. 15,” BioNTech said in a statement. The changes will help the companies deliver the fully committed quantity of doses in the first quarter and more in the second quarter, the company said. A second EU source told Reuters that in a meeting with diplomats on Wednesday an EU Commission official said deliveries would be limited at least until March, with production set to be ramped up in earnest only by September. Pfizer and BioNTech have contracts with the EU to supply up to 600 million doses this year. They have agreed to deliver 75 million shots in the second quarter and more later in the year. Neither the companies nor the EU have said how many doses are expected in the first quarter. The EU has also approved the vaccine developed by U.S. biotech firm Moderna, which began deliveries this week. Moderna has committed to delivering 10 million doses by the end of March and 35 million each in the second and third quarter. Another 80 million doses are also to be delivered this year but without a clear timetable yet. Pfizer and Moderna have not published detailed calendars of deliveries for each EU country. Pfizer said the information was confidential, while Moderna said: “At this stage we can only confirm that the doses will be distributed on a pro-rata basis between EU countries.” But deliveries do not seem to be proceeding evenly. The German Health Ministry website says the country, with a population of 83 million, will receive nearly 4 million Pfizer doses by the end of January. By contrast, Bulgaria, with a population of roughly 7 million, expects to receive only about 60,000 Pfizer shots in January. A spokesman for the EU Commission said national timetables partly depended on contracts signed by each state. It is not clear whether all EU governments ordered their full allocation of vaccines, as this information is confidential. The EU has secured nearly 2.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines and candidates from six firms, but most are yet to be approved. Decisions on AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are expected in late January and in February respectively."

Arcuri said Pfizer had informed Rome it was not able to foresee for how long it would be curtailing its supplies compared to what had been planned and by how much. Arcuri said he had complained to Pfizer given the “seriousness and the unbelievable timing” of the communication received, and would evaluate all possible courses of action in the absence of a reply from the company."
3.5668599279643387," Vaccine shipments to EU slow as Turkey, China ramp up inoculations BRUSSELS/VILNIUS (Reuters) - Some EU nations are receiving fewer than expected doses of coronavirus vaccines as U.S. pharmaceutical firm Pfizer slows shipments, while Turkey and China race ahead with inoculations amid surging infections worldwide. Six EU countries described the delay as unacceptable and said it impacted the credibility of the whole vaccination process. Spooked by a fast-spreading variant first detected in Britain, governments in Europe have imposed tighter and longer lockdowns and curbs. They are pinning hopes on vaccines being rolled out across the continent. But even when inoculations start en masse, pressure on health systems is not expected to lift for months, or until most people within a population get the shot. The vaccine developed by Pfizer with German partner BioNTech started being delivered in the EU at the end of December. U.S. biotech firm Moderna began delivering its shot this week. Yet about one third of the 27 EU governments cited “insufficient” doses at a video conference of health ministers on Wednesday, a person who attended the virtual meeting told Reuters. In a letter sent on Friday, six EU governments asked the European Commission to pressure Pfizer-BioNTech “to ensure stability and transparency of timely (vaccine) deliveries”. “This situation is unacceptable,” said the letter, seen by Reuters, signed by the health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. “Not only does it impact the planned vaccination schedules, it also decreases the credibility of the vaccination process.” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken to Pfizer and been reassured that scheduled deliveries will be made in the first quarter of 2021. Pfizer said there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost production. “Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,” Pfizer said in a statement. The German health ministry said Pfizer has informed the European Union that it would temporarily reduce deliveries due to construction work at its plant in the Belgian town of Puurs. Belgium said it expected to receive only around half of the planned doses of the Pfizer vaccine in January. Lithuania said it was told this week its supplies would be halved until mid-February. Pfizer and BioNTech have two contracts with the EU for the supply of up to 600 million doses this year. They have agreed to deliver 75 million doses in the second quarter and more later in the year. Moderna has committed to delivering 10 million doses by the end of March and 35 million each in the second and third quarter. Another 80 million doses are also to be delivered this year but without a clear timetable yet. Turkey, not an EU member, said it had vaccinated more than 600,000 people in the first two days of administering shots developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech, among the fastest rollouts in the world. “We are an experienced country in implementing nationwide inoculation programmes ... We will win the battle with the pandemic together,” Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted. Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its programme on Thursday than France had in nearly its first three weeks. Rising infections are turning up the heat on China to strengthen its own pace of vaccination at home, even as it has been exporting millions of doses of vaccines to countries including Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil. In the first nine days of January, about 4.5 million doses were given nationwide in China, triple the number given from July to November, Reuters calculations based on official data show. By Jan. 13, more than 10 million doses were given. Two Chinese firms, Sinovac and Sinopharm, have developed vaccines. Sinopharm shipped more than 10 million doses domestically by Jan 4, while Sinovac delivered more than 7 million doses by Jan 10. Scattered vaccine shortages cropped up on the front lines of the U.S. battle against the pandemic on Friday, prompting at least one large healthcare system to cancel appointments of people hoping to be inoculated. President-elect Joe Biden will on Friday outline his plan to ramp up vaccinations after an early rollout by the Trump administration which he called “a dismal failure”. The United States leads the world with the highest number of infections and deaths. Biden has promised to get 100 million vaccine shots into the arms of Americans during his first 100 days in office."
3.5668599279643387," Lebanese parliament passes law to pave way for coronavirus vaccine deals BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s parliament on Friday approved a law that paves the way for the government to sign deals for coronavirus vaccines as it battles a steep increase in infections. Lebanon said in mid-December it was expecting to sign a deal for supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine and hoped to receive the first batch eight weeks after that. But the country, now struggling with a severe spike in infections that has overwhelmed hospitals, hit a legal stumbling block that has so far prevented it from finalising the agreement. The new law would give Pfizer-BioNtech, and other companies that provide vaccines to Lebanon, protection from any future liability claims for two years. It includes a clause that points to the Lebanese health ministry as the only entity responsible for compensation. Lebanon is under a three-week lockdown that ends on Feb. 1 and a strict 24-hour curfew until Jan. 25 after lax measures over the Christmas and New Year’s holiday period led to a spike in cases. Hamad Hasan, the country’s caretaker health minister, has previously said the ministry had secured about 2 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, to cover 20% of Lebanese nationals, but the government has yet to announce a starting date for a national vaccination programme. Hasan on Friday tweeted his thanks to the parliament for approving the law. He has been hospitalised since Wednesday with coronavirus but is in stable condition and continuing to work from his hospital bed. Apart from the anticipated Pfizer-BioNtech deal, Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun approved on Friday the transfer of 26.4 billion Lebanese pounds ($17.53 million) to COVAX to book 2.73 million vaccines, his official twitter account said. The country had previously signed up for COVAX, the global scheme backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to poorer countries. As of Thursday, Lebanon had recorded 237,132 cases of coronavirus and 1,781 deaths since the start of the pandemic. The latest spike in infections has hit the country hard as its medical system was already reeling from a severe financial crisis that led to supply shortages, and a port explosion in August that damaged major hospitals in Beirut.

3.5668599279643387," Pfizer temporarily reduces COVID vaccine deliveries to Europe OSLO (Reuters) - Pfizer will temporarily reduce its deliveries to Europe of its vaccine against COVID-19 while it upgrades its production capacity, the company and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) said on Friday. “We received this message today a little before 10am (0900 GMT). We had expected 43,875 vaccines doses from Pfizer in week 3 (next week). Now it appears that we will get 36,075 doses,” the FHI said in a statement. The reduction in deliveries is due to Pfizer limiting output so that it can upgrade production capacity to 2 billion vaccine doses per year from 1.3 billion currently, the FHI said. “This temporary reduction will affect all European countries,” said the FHI. “It is as yet not precisely clear how long time it will take before Pfizer is up to maximum production capacity again.” Pfizer said it had to make modifications to the process and facility that will require additional regulatory approvals. “Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,” Pfizer said in a statement. Non-EU Norway is getting access to the vaccines obtained by the European bloc thanks to Sweden, an EU member that will buy more than it needs and sell them to Norway. The institute said there would be no delays in the rollout of the vaccines to Norwegians as it had built reserves of vaccines in Norway since it had begun receiving deliveries. Many EU nations say they are receiving lower-than-expected supplies of COVID-19 vaccines and complain of uncertainty over future deliveries, EU officials told Reuters."

1.9106175607643245," Exclusive: India wants Pfizer to do local study before approval - official NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Any vaccine maker, including Pfizer Inc that has sought emergency-use authorisation for its COVID-19 shot in India, must conduct an additional local study to be considered for the country’s immunisation programme, a senior government official told Reuters. Serum Institute of India, the local manufacturer of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, did a months long local study on more than 1,500 people before seeking and receiving emergency approval on Jan. 3. India, which has reached 10.5 million coronavirus infections - the second highest in the world after the United States - has also approved a homegrown vaccine made by Bharat Biotech ahead of its inoculation campaign which starts on Saturday. Local media have reported that Pfizer had sought to import and distribute its vaccine in India without doing local trials. In early December, it was the first company to seek emergency-use approval in the world's second-most populous country but has not attended subsequent meetings called by India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, according to minutes here of the deliberations released on the drugs regulator's website. “As of now, the pre-condition for any vaccine to be implemented in India is that you have to do a bridging trial,” Vinod K. Paul, who heads a government panel on vaccine strategy, said in an interview in his office near the parliament building. The government has already distributed 16.5 million doses of the two approved vaccines to states, with a plan to deliver 600 million jabs to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months. Serum Institute has stockpiled 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and says it will raise its monthly output to much more than that now the approval has come. Indian health officials say they generally ask for so-called bridging trials to determine if a vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in its citizens whose genetic makeup can be different from people in western nations. There are, however, provisions here under India's New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, to waive such trials in certain conditions. A Pfizer spokeswomen had no immediate comment. The Pfizer vaccine, developed in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech SE, is already being administered to people in countries such as the United States and Britain. It was not immediately clear if any other countries had asked for similar smaller local trials before approving vaccines developed and tested abroad. Paul said Indian officials have had discussions with Pfizer and Moderna Inc - both U.S. companies have reported more than 90% efficacy for their vaccines - to make the shots in India given its large pharmaceutical capacity. India is the world’s biggest vaccine maker. Paul, a paediatrician who had taught at the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences, also said Russia’s Sputnik V, which is now undergoing last-stage trials in India after completing a Phase 2 study there, will soon apply for emergency-use approval in the country. No vaccine maker will be given indemnity by the government should something go wrong, Paul said. Serum Institute had written to the government seeking indemnity. AstraZeneca has said it has received such indemnity in many other countries."

The Swiss drug regulator Swissmedic’s decision comes days after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave the green light to Moderna’s vaccine. The messenger RNA vaccine, relying on similar technology as that used by Pfizer-BioNTech, is a two-dose shot that in trials showed 95% efficacy. Switzerland has been a second-wave coronavirus hotspot, with infections totalling some 500,000 and deaths rising by dozens daily to more than 7,500. The country, which has been vaccinating with Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots since before Christmas, this week canceled the famed Lauberhorn World Cup ski race, due to COVID-19 fears. Health ministry officials have predicted the country will get a total of 500,000 doses in January, and another one million doses in February, with Moderna’s shot adding to totals. “Following a thorough review of all the submitted data on safety, efficacy and quality, Swissmedic has today temporarily authorised the Moderna vaccine,” the regulator said. The vaccine comes with a “Made in Switzerland” label, as contract drug manufacturer Lonza makes its active ingredients at its factories in Visp, near the Matterhorn mountain. Lonza said on Monday production at the first of three new Visp manufacturing lines has started, with the first batch due before the end of the month. Switzerland has ordered some 15 million vaccine doses, including from AstraZeneca whose products have yet to be approved, after setting aside 400 million Swiss francs ($455 million) for shots. High global demand from everywhere, combined with limited production, means there is too little vaccine to go around. Still, the country has told its 8.6 million residents that everybody who wants to will likely be able to get vaccinated by next summer."
0.5169077001683264," Sweden vaccinated 80,000 against COVID-19 through Jan 10 - health agency STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden has vaccinated around 80,000 people against COVID-19 since it began with its programme last month, the Public Health Agency said on Tuesday. Sweden had received around 160,000 doses of Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s vaccine by January 10, with around half having been administered by that date, Health Agency data showed. “No region has reported problems with carrying out vaccinations,” the Agency said in a statement. Several regions, however, have been saving vaccine in order to be able to give a second dose, which the agency now recommends against as further deliveries of vaccine were expected to proceed as planned.

The German company, which developed the vaccine with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, said in a statement it would also offer the shot to its suppliers and distributors in Austria. “To maintain the integrity of our supply chain, including the development, production, approval, supply and distribution of the vaccine, BioNTech has decided to offer a voluntary COVID-19 vaccination to its employees in Germany,” it said. The company is under pressure to ramp up production of the shot that many hope will help the world defeat the pandemic. “The additional small quantities of vaccine used for this purpose are separate and distinct from those committed under the supply agreements entered into with the European Commission and other governments, and will not impact BioNTech’s ability to meet its commitments under these supply agreements,” it added."

Along with other European countries, Greece began vaccinating frontline health care staff and elderly and vulnerable residents of nursing homes last month following EU approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Starting with those over 85, the rest of the population will start being vaccinated from Jan. 20. “The vaccination train has set off, it’s rolling down the track steadily and speeding up,” the head of Greece’s National Vaccination Committee, Maria Theodoridou said in a briefing. Some 49,661 people, or 0.46% of Greece’s population, have been vaccinated so far and the government aims to get some 220,000 covered by the end of the month, building to 70% of the population of 11 million by June. Additional vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca and Johnson & Johnson are expected in the coming months, health ministry official Marios Themistocleous told reporters. Monday’s launch of the platform came as authorities allowed kindergartens and primary schools to reopen after two months of distance learning but said the situation would be reviewed every week. Last week authorities extended some COVID lockdown curbs until Jan. 18, including the temporary closure of hospitality venues and non-essential retailers. Greece weathered the first wave of the pandemic relatively well but a surge in cases since October has badly strained its health system, weakened by a decade-long financial crisis, prompting authorities to order a second lockdown in November. It has so far confirmed 145,179 cases of COVID and 5,302 related deaths."

-1.0532564612751765," Scarce doses and empty vaccination centres: Germany's vaccine rollout headache (This Jan. 10 story corrects paragraph 16 to say Pfizer and BioNTech halved 2020 output forecast in November, not December) BERLIN/DILLENBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Proud of their national reputation for efficiency, Germans are growing increasingly frustrated by the slow rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine its scientists helped develop. Scarce vaccine supply, cumbersome paperwork, a lack of healthcare staff and an aged and immobile population are hampering efforts to get early doses of a vaccine made by U.S.-based Pfizer and German partner BioNTech into the arms of the people. Germany has set up hundreds of vaccination centres in sports halls and concert arenas and has the infrastructure to administer up to 300,000 shots a day, Health Minister Jens Spahn said. But the majority are standing empty, with most states not planning to open centres until mid-January as they prioritise sending mobile teams into care homes. A day spent with a vaccination team in the small town of Dillenburg, 100 km (60 miles) to the north of Germany’s financial capital Frankfurt, shows just how painstaking the task is. The team starts out by loading a cool-box containing 84 doses of the Pfizer vaccine defrosted overnight into a waiting ambulance, and setting out for the Elisabeth residential care home. There they are met by manager Peter Bittermann, who has already dealt with the forms needed to vaccinate residents and staff, and provided space for the shots to be administered and recipients monitored post-vaccination. The four-member immunisation team, plus two trainees, has just a few hours to dispense the temperature-sensitive Pfizer vaccine before it is no longer fit for use. The German Red Cross needs an extra 350 people to run its local vaccination campaign, said Nicole Fey, spokeswoman of the local district administration. “We’ve been able to recruit some, but there can never be enough,” she told Reuters TV. In the first two weeks of its vaccination drive Germany has given 533,000 shots, just two-fifths of the 1.3 million doses received. Britain, by contrast, has reached the 2 million mark. Israel, the world leader in terms of the share of population covered, is inoculating 150,000 people daily, with its universal and digitally enabled healthcare system making it easier to schedule appointments. Germany’s larger size and federal set-up are complicating operations, a problem also faced in the United States. Elsewhere in Europe, the decentralisation of Spain’s vaccination operation has exposed differences between regions and led to tensions with the central government. Graphic: COVID-19 vaccine doses administered - Germany’s 16 states blame the federal government for not securing enough doses. Doctors in some centres say shifts have been cancelled. In Berlin, one vaccination centre was opened, only to be closed over New Year due to a lack of shots. Spahn says manufacturing problems rather than too few orders are to blame for the limited supply, after Pfizer and BioNTech in December halved their production forecast to 50 million doses by year-end. Each recipient requires two shots.. The government is working with BioNTech to open a new production site in the western town of Marburg, he said. BioNTech’s chief executive said last week the Marburg plant may enter service in February, ahead of schedule. “With the capacity we have already created in Germany, we will be able to carry out between 250,000 and 300,000 vaccinations per day - when we have the vaccine doses,” Spahn said this week. Germany expects to receive 5.3 million shots from Pfizer/BioNTech by mid-February and another 2 million doses of a second vaccine from Moderna, just approved by the European Union, by the end of March.

-1.0532564612751765," CORRECTED-Scarce doses and empty vaccination centres: Germany's vaccine rollout headache Proud of their national reputation for efficiency, Germans are growing increasingly frustrated by the slow rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine its scientists helped develop. Scarce vaccine supply, cumbersome paperwork, a lack of healthcare staff and an aged and immobile population are hampering efforts to get early doses of a vaccine made by U.S.-based Pfizer (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech into the arms of the people. Germany has set up hundreds of vaccination centres in sports halls and concert arenas and has the infrastructure to administer up to 300,000 shots a day, Health Minister Jens Spahn said. But the majority are standing empty, with most states not planning to open centres until mid-January as they prioritise sending mobile teams into care homes. A day spent with a vaccination team in the small town of Dillenburg, 100 km (60 miles) to the north of Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, shows just how painstaking the task is. The team starts out by loading a cool-box containing 84 doses of the Pfizer vaccine defrosted overnight into a waiting ambulance, and setting out for the Elisabeth residential care home. There they are met by manager Peter Bittermann, who has already dealt with the forms needed to vaccinate residents and staff, and provided space for the shots to be administered and recipients monitored post-vaccination. The four-member immunisation team, plus two trainees, has just a few hours to dispense the temperature-sensitive Pfizer vaccine before it is no longer fit for use. The German Red Cross needs an extra 350 people to run its local vaccination campaign, said Nicole Fey, spokeswoman of the local district administration. ""We've been able to recruit some, but there can never be enough,"" she told Reuters TV.

Pfizer and BioNTech in November halved their production forecast to 50 million doses by year-end. Each recipient requires two shots. . The government is working with BioNTech to open a new production site in the western town of Marburg, he said.

The country, which was the first to approve vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and by Oxford-AstraZeneca, is currently immunising about 200,000 people a day, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday. It needs to boost that rate to 2 million a week to meet its target of vaccinating those in care homes, the over-70s, the clinically vulnerable with pre-existing conditions and health and social-care workers by February 15. Britain is battling surging infections but is pinning its hopes on rapid immunisation to enable life to start returning to some degree of normality by the spring. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out his COVID-19 immunisation plan - the biggest vaccination programme in British history - later on Monday. “The UK vaccine delivery plan will be the keystone of our exit out of the pandemic, but we all must continue to play our part by staying at home, following the rules and keeping hands, face, space at the forefront of our minds when out and about,” he said in a statement. More than 81,000 people in Britain have died within 28 days of receiving a positive COVID-19 test, the fifth-highest official death toll globally, and over 3 million people have tested positive. The centres include London’s Nightingale field hospital, a soccer stadium in Bristol in the west, Epsom racecourse in the southeast and a tennis club in Manchester in the north, the government said. Hundreds of additional doctors’ surgeries and hospitals and some pharmacies will also start delivering shots this week, taking the total number of sites to 1,200, the government said."

Israel rolls out COVID booster shots TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s coronavirus vaccination campaign, the world’s fastest per capita, shifted to booster shots on Sunday in a bid to protect the most vulnerable citizens by next month and ease curbs on the economy. Israelis over the age of 60, those with health problems and medical personnel have been receiving first injections of Pfizer Inc. vaccines since Dec 19. As three weeks have passed, they are beginning to be due for follow-up, final doses. “It changes everything,” said Guy Choshen, a director of the COVID-19 ward at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, who got his second injection. “I’m really happy that I’m over that (and) looking forward for all this epidemic to be finished.” The Health Ministry said 19.5% of the population have been vaccinated, including more than 72% of the over-60s. Latecomer elderly will be admitted for first shots, officials say, but otherwise vaccines will be reserved for boosters. By mid-March roughly 5 million of the country’s 9 million citizens are expected to receive the vaccine. Israel’s vaccination rate is by far the fastest compared to the rest of the world, according to the Our World in Data website, which is run by research organisation Oxford Martin School. In second place is the United Arab Emirates, which as of Sunday had inoculated 10% of its population, followed by Bahrain and the United States at 5% and 2%, respectively. At Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu watched as crates of Pfizer vaccines were unloaded from a plane that arrived from Belgium. One official said the shipment contained 700,000-800,000 doses. Netanyahu, who is up for re-election in March, said another large consignment would arrive a week later and that in the meantime Israel would accelerate its vaccination rate to 170,000 a day from the current 150,000. He says the vaccination campaign will allow Israel to emerge from the pandemic in February. Israel has in parallel tightened a lockdown to rein in a surge in coronavirus cases. Officials say public over-confidence in the vaccines may have led to laxity in other precautions and stoked fresh contagions."

The state news agency cited Nathir Obeidat as saying the rollout would start on Wednesday following the expected arrival of the first batches of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Monday. Supplies of the vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) would also arrive Saturday night. Jordan had said on Jan. 3 it had struck a deal with Pfizer and partner BioNTech to buy 1 million doses of their vaccine and another 2 million doses from the World Health Organization’s COVAX programme, which aims to vaccinate people in poor and middle income countries. Obeidat has previously said the government intends to rollout a free inoculation programme for more than 20 percent of the country’s 10 million population. The vaccination programme will prioritise the elderly, those with underlying conditions and health sector workers, the minister said on Saturday. The government had reached initial understandings with AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson for their vaccines, he added. Jordan, which has seen a sharp drop in infections since a second wave peaked in November when there was around 60 deaths per day, had recorded a total of 305,959 cases as of Saturday, with 4,009 deaths."

-2.0975044781660714," Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine works against virus variants in lab; arthritis drugs improve COVID-19 survival (Reuters) -The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine protects against virus variants The COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE appears to protect against highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa, a laboratory study suggests. In blood samples from vaccine recipients, scientists found the vaccine appears effective against the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein on the virus, according to a report posted on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Pfizer scientist Phil Dormitzer said the vaccine has been tested against 16 mutations, and none have really had any significant impact. ""That's the good news,"" he said, before adding a note of caution. ""That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."" Ongoing testing will be needed, experts said, to allay concerns about whether the vaccines will be protective as the virus mutates. The vaccine is based on synthetic messenger RNA technology (mRNA), as is the one from Moderna Inc. ""The evidence is not conclusive but there is a lot to indicate that the existing mRNA vaccines do cover the new variants,"" said Andreas Bergthaler of the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. AstraZeneca Plc,, Moderna and CureVac NV are also testing their shots against the fast-spreading coronavirus variants. (bit.ly/35oPcE9) Arthritis drugs aid survival of sickest COVID-19 patients Treating critically ill COVID-19 patients with either of two rheumatoid arthritis drugs significantly improves survival rates and shortens the time patients need intensive care, trial results show. The drugs - tocilizumab, sold as Actemra by Roche, and Kevzara (sarilumab) from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi - reduced death rates by 8.5 percentage points among critically ill patients. That means that for every 12 patients treated with one of the drugs, one life would be saved, said Dr. Anthony Gordon of Imperial College London, coauthor of a report posted on Thursday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The data, from 803 severely ill patients, showed that the drugs, which suppress the body's immune response, reduced mortality rates from 35.8% in a control group to 27.3% among patients receiving either drug. Previous studies had found no clear benefit from these drugs, but they included less severely ill patients treated at different stages in the disease. ""A crucial difference,"" Gordon said, ""may be that in our study, critically ill patients were enrolled within 24 hours"" of when their organs started to fail, which suggests the sickest patients may gain the most benefit from these drugs.

Monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System jointly run by the two agencies detected only 21 cases of the life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis among the nearly 1.9 million first doses of the vaccine administered between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23. Most people with anaphylaxis had a history of allergies or allergic reactions, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. For 71% of those with anaphylaxis, the allergic reactions occurred within 15 minutes. The agencies also received reports of 83 cases of less serious allergic reactions, including rashes, itchy skin, scratchy sensations in the throat, and mild respiratory symptoms. The CDC and FDA say they will continue to work together ""to monitor for adverse events ... after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines and will regularly assess the benefits and risks of vaccination.""

-2.0975044781660714," Britain approves Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, eyes spring rollout LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s medical regulator on Friday approved Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for use, the health ministry said, adding that it had agreed to purchase an additional 10 million doses as it eyed a spring rollout of the shot. Three COVID-19 vaccines have now been approved for use in Britain, with Pfizer/BioNTech’s shot and one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca already being administered. The Moderna shot is not expected to play a part in the first stage of Britain’s vaccine rollout, which needs to see 2 million vaccinations a week being given for the next six weeks in order to hit a target of inoculating high priority groups by mid-February. Instead, supplies will begin to be delivered to the UK from the spring once Moderna expands its production capability. “We have already vaccinated nearly 1.5 million people across the UK and Moderna’s vaccine will allow us to accelerate our vaccination programme even further once doses become available from the spring,” health minister Matt Hancock said. Britain now has 17 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine on order, after waiting for trial data before making a commitment, putting it behind the United States and the European Union in the queue for the shot. Moderna’s vaccine was 94% effective in preventing disease in late-stage clinical trials, and it has already been given regulatory approval for use in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Israel. The United States began rolling out the Moderna vaccine in late December, while the company has said the process will get underway in the EU next week. “We appreciate the confidence shown by the UK MHRA in COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna with this decision,” said Stephane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, referring to the medicines regulator. Britain initially prioritised securing doses from Pfizer and AstraZeneca and was the first country to approve those vaccines, but has spread its bets and secured doses of 7 different vaccine candidates in all. Britain is attempting to vaccinate the elderly, the vulnerable and frontline workers - around 15 million people - by mid-February, to ease a new strict lockdown imposed after a spike in cases to daily records. Although Moderna’s vaccine will not help meet that initial target, it will help ease supply constraints that Hancock has cited as being a limiting factor in the rollout. “This is excellent news and a further crumb of comfort amid the huge levels of COVID-19 currently circulating around the UK,” said Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health at the University of Southampton. “When these Moderna vaccines arrive, they will help to ease any bottlenecks or delays in the administration programme.”"
-2.0975044781660714," Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears effective against mutation in new coronavirus variants -study NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine appears able to protect against a key mutation in the highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker. The study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralizing variants with the so-called N501Y mutation, situated on a portion of the virus that it uses to enter and infect cells. All of the vaccines already approved or in development use this outer portion of the virus, known as the spike protein, to train the body to recognize the virus and make virus-neutralizing antibodies. The N501Y mutation is linked to greater transmissibility, and scientists have expressed concerns it could also allow the virus to escape the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists. The first results of tests on some of the key variants of concern offer some hope as Britain and other countries try to tame the more infectious variants, which authorities believe are driving a surge in infections that could overwhelm healthcare systems. Although all viruses mutate constantly, scientists are concerned about the mutations first discovered in Britain and South Africa because they are believed to be capable of altering key functions of the virus. The Pfizer study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus. Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as against 15 other mutations the company has previously tested. “So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.” The study still does not address a worrisome mutation in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation. The U.S. researchers plan to run similar tests to see whether the vaccine protects against other mutations from the variants from Britain and South Africa. They hope to have data within weeks. The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness. Independent experts gave a cautious welcome to the Pfizer study findings, but said the situation needs constant vigilance. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia, said “the jury is still out on the impact of the South African variant on vaccine efficacy.” Deborah Dunn-Walters, a professor of immunology at Surrey University in Britain, said it was “reassuring” that Pfizer is closely monitoring variants. Ongoing testing will be needed, experts said, to allay concerns about whether vaccines being given to millions of people in the fight against the pandemic will protect them as the virus mutates. COVID-19 has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide. “The evidence is not conclusive but there is a lot to indicate that the existing mRNA vaccines do cover the new variants. That is the good news,” said Andreas Bergthaler, principal investigator at the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. AstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their shots will protect against the fast-spreading coronavirus variants. They have said they expect them to be effective, but have not said when study results will be published. The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc, which both use synthetic messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, can be quickly adapted to address new mutations in the coronavirus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks. Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University, said similar studies would need to be repeated as new mutations appear. “It may be necessary to tweak the vaccine over time,” she said. A senior British lawmaker expressed concerns in an interview on Friday that COVID-19 vaccines might not work properly against the South African variant. He was not responding to questions about Friday’s data."
-2.0975044781660714," EU says it has secured nearly half of Pfizer's 2021 global output of COVID-19 shots BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for 300 million additional doses of their COVID-19 vaccine, the head of the European Commission said on Friday, in a move that would give the EU nearly half of the firms’ global output for 2021. Pfizer has said it can produce up to 1.3 billion doses around the world this year. The new agreement with the EU comes on top of another order for 300 million doses of the vaccine, branded in the EU under the name Comirnaty, that the bloc agreed with Pfizer and German partner BioNTech in November. “We now have agreed with BioNTech and Pfizer to extend this contract. With the new agreement we could purchase a total of up to an additional 300 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine,” Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference on Friday. Pfizer was more cautious. “We are in talks with the European Commission about an amendment to our existing supply agreement for Comirnaty, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,” it said in a statement. The move would allow EU governments to double their orders from Pfizer to 600 million doses, von der Leyen said, as the 27-nation bloc races to ramp up the vaccination of its 450 million people. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine need two doses to develop maximum protection. In a separate announcement, the EU drug regulator changed its recommendation for the use of the Pfizer vaccine, allowing the extraction of six doses from a vial instead of five, confirming an earlier Reuters story. That would increase available doses by 20%. The pricing would continue to be calculated in doses and not in vials, a spokesman for Pfizer said, meaning that there would be no discount on prices paid by the EU for new deliveries. An EU document seen by Reuters in December showed the price was 15.5 euros ($19) per dose. Von der Leyen said 75 million of the additional doses under the new deal would be delivered in the second quarter of this year, and the rest by the end of 2021. Pfizer said that in total 500 million doses would be available to the EU by the end of this year, and an option for another 100 million could be taken up. The large EU order is likely to require an expansion of Pfizer-BioNTech production capacity this year, as the companies already have deals with other wealthy nations for large supplies in 2021. They cut by half to 50 million doses their production in 2020 after facing some snags in securing supplies of vaccine ingredients. European officials said the companies were working to expand production capacity in Europe. Pfizer has agreed to sell the United States up to 600 million doses, of which 200 million have been already ordered. Another 120 million doses are reserved for Japan this year, and 40 million for Britain, among disclosed deals. Germany said on Monday it had agreed with BioNtech to supply 30 million additional doses in a side deal, although the timing of the delivery was unclear. The German move, agreed in September but revealed only this week as the government faced pressures at home, appears to be in contrast with EU agreements that forbid members to negotiate parallel deals with vaccine makers. “No member state on this legal binding basis is allowed to negotiate in parallel or to have a contract in parallel,” von der Leyen said. But a Commission spokesman declined to comment on whether the German deal was legal under EU agreements. The new EU agreement includes a possible immediate order for 200 million doses and an additional option to buy another 100 million, the Commission said.

EU countries started inoculating people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine two weeks ago, after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the shot’s conditional approval under the brand name Comirnaty with an authorisation that allows five doses to be extracted from each vial. “EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended updating the product information for Comirnaty to clarify that each vial contains six doses of the vaccine,” EMA said. Final approvals are up to the European Commission (EC), which typically follows recommendations from the EMA. “Once endorsed by the EC, the label would state that after dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain six doses of 0.3 ml of vaccine,” Pfizer said in a statement. Reuters had reported on Wednesday that the regulator was close to approving such a move. This change in authorisation could allow 20% more doses to be available in the EU under an existing contract with Pfizer, EU lawmaker Peter Liese had said. The European Union reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for 300 million additional doses of the vaccine, the head of the European Commission said on Friday, in a move that would give the EU nearly half of the firms’ global output for 2021. The move would allow EU governments to double their orders from Pfizer to 600 million doses, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, as the 27-nation bloc races to ramp up the vaccination of its 450 million people. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine need two doses to develop maximum protection. To extract the sixth dose from a single vial, low dead volume syringes or needles, which only retain a low amount of solution after an injection, should be used, EMA said, adding that there should be no pooling from multiple vials to make up a full dose."

Pfizer (PFE.N) has said it can produce up to 1.3 billion doses around the world this year. The new agreement with the EU comes on top of another order for 300 million doses of the vaccine, branded in the EU under the name Comirnaty, that the bloc agreed with Pfizer and German partner BioNTech in November. ""We now have agreed with BioNTech and Pfizer to extend this contract. With the new agreement we could purchase a total of up to an additional 300 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine,"" Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference on Friday. Pfizer was more cautious. ""We are in talks with the European Commission about an amendment to our existing supply agreement for Comirnaty, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,"" it said in a statement. The move would allow EU governments to double their orders from Pfizer to 600 million doses, von der Leyen said, as the 27-nation bloc races to ramp up the vaccination of its 450 million people. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine need two doses to develop maximum protection. In a separate announcement, the EU drug regulator changed its recommendation for the use of the Pfizer vaccine, allowing the extraction of six doses from a vial instead of five, confirming an earlier Reuters story read more . That would increase available doses by 20%. The pricing would continue to be calculated in doses and not in vials, a spokesman for Pfizer said, meaning that there would be no discount on prices paid by the EU for new deliveries. An EU document seen by Reuters in December showed the price was 15.5 euros ($19) per dose read more . Von der Leyen said 75 million of the additional doses under the new deal would be delivered in the second quarter of this year, and the rest by the end of 2021. Pfizer said that in total 500 million doses would be available to the EU by the end of this year, and an option for another 100 million could be taken up. PRODUCTION CAPACITY The large EU order is likely to require an expansion of Pfizer-BioNTech production capacity this year, as the companies already have deals with other wealthy nations for large supplies in 2021. They cut by half to 50 million doses their production in 2020 after facing some snags in securing supplies of vaccine ingredients. European officials said the companies were working to expand production capacity in Europe. Pfizer has agreed to sell the United States up to 600 million doses, of which 200 million have been already ordered. Another 120 million doses are reserved for Japan this year, and 40 million for Britain, among disclosed deals. read more Germany said on Monday it had agreed with BioNtech to supply 30 million additional doses in a side deal, although the timing of the delivery was unclear. read more The German move, agreed in September but revealed only this week as the government faced pressures at home, appears to be in contrast with EU agreements that forbid members to negotiate parallel deals with vaccine makers.

But a Commission spokesman declined to comment on whether the German deal was legal under EU agreements. The new EU agreement includes a possible immediate order for 200 million doses and an additional option to buy another 100 million, the Commission said.

-2.0975044781660714," Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears effective against mutation in new coronavirus variants -study Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine appears able to protect against a key mutation in the highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker. The study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralizing variants with the so-called N501Y mutation, situated on a portion of the virus that it uses to enter and infect cells. All of the vaccines already approved or in development use this outer portion of the virus, known as the spike protein, to train the body to recognize the virus and make virus-neutralizing antibodies. The N501Y mutation is linked to greater transmissibility, and scientists have expressed concerns it could also allow the virus to escape the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer's top viral vaccine scientists. The first results of tests on some of the key variants of concern offer some hope as Britain and other countries try to tame the more infectious variants, which authorities believe are driving a surge in infections that could overwhelm healthcare systems. Although all viruses mutate constantly, scientists are concerned about the mutations first discovered in Britain and South Africa because they are believed to be capable of altering key functions of the virus. The Pfizer study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus. Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as against 15 other mutations the company has previously tested. ""So we've now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That's the good news,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."" The study still does not address a worrisome mutation in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation. CONSTANT MONITORING The U.S. researchers plan to run similar tests to see whether the vaccine protects against other mutations from the variants from Britain and South Africa. They hope to have data within weeks. The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness. Independent experts gave a cautious welcome to the Pfizer study findings, but said the situation needs constant vigilance. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia, said ""the jury is still out on the impact of the South African variant on vaccine efficacy."" Deborah Dunn-Walters, a professor of immunology at Surrey University in Britain, said it was ""reassuring"" that Pfizer is closely monitoring variants. Ongoing testing will be needed, experts said, to allay concerns about whether vaccines being given to millions of people in the fight against the pandemic will protect them as the virus mutates. COVID-19 has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide. read more ""The evidence is not conclusive but there is a lot to indicate that the existing mRNA vaccines do cover the new variants. That is the good news,"" said Andreas Bergthaler, principal investigator at the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. TESTS AND TWEAKS AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Moderna (MRNA.O) and CureVac (5CV.DE) are also testing whether their shots will protect against the fast-spreading coronavirus variants. They have said they expect them to be effective, but have not said when study results will be published. read more The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc, which both use synthetic messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, can be quickly adapted to address new mutations in the coronavirus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.

""It may be necessary to tweak the vaccine over time,"" she said. A senior British lawmaker expressed concerns in an interview on Friday that COVID-19 vaccines might not work properly against the South African variant. He was not responding to questions about Friday's data. read more"

-2.0489700444246797," Britain working with Pfizer, AstraZeneca to increase vaccine supplies LONDON (Reuters) - The pace of Britain’s rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is being limited by the supply of shots, and the government is working with both Pfizer and AstraZeneca to increase supplies, health minister Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The government must quickly ramp up the rate of vaccinations in order to meet an ambitious target to inoculate more than 13 million people who are elderly, vulnerable or frontline workers by mid-February. “The rate limiting step is the supply of vaccine, and we’re working with the companies, both Pfizer and of course AstraZeneca, to increase the supply,” Hancock told broadcasters. “The manufacturers are doing a brilliant job, and they’re delivering to the schedule that’s agreed, but that schedule is the amount of vaccine that we have ... we expect to see that amount of vaccine being delivered going up.” Hancock spoke after the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University was rolled out in doctors surgeries from Thursday. More than 1.3 million people in the United Kingdom have received one shot of either AstraZeneca’s or Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, but the government needs to be administering around 2 million doses a week to hit its February target. In a sign of supply constraints, one doctor visited by Hancock on Thursday said she had not received the delivery of AstraZeneca’s vaccine she had been expecting. Birmingham City Council’s leader and local lawmakers also wrote to Hancock saying no AstraZeneca vaccine was available in the central English city and that stocks of the Pfizer shot would run out on Friday. Britain is prioritising the administration of an initial shot to more people, delaying second doses beyond a month after the first. Just 20,000 people received their second shot of the Pfizer vaccine before the guidance was changed. Pfizer has said there is no data for the efficacy of the first shot beyond 21 days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if the vaccine rollout goes to plan, new lockdown measures introduced this week could start to be eased in February. Johnson, who will give a news conference later on Thursday, has previously cited the time it takes for the regulator to approve batches of AstraZeneca’s vaccine as one limiting factor. AstraZeneca’s vaccine was first deployed in hospitals on Monday. It does not have the ultra-low temperature requirements that Pfizer’s does, making it easier to roll out. Initial boxes of the Pfizer vaccine contained nearly 1,000 doses, but the NHS said smaller boxes had also been approved for use that could be used in settings like care homes without wasting doses."

The WHO’s Hans Kluge’s comments come as some countries including Britain are seeking to counter low vaccine supplies by extending the gap between first and second doses to up to 12 weeks, and by considering lower volume doses of some shots. Kluge said it was important to strike a balance between making the most of limited supplies and protecting as many people as possible. “It is important that such a decision represents a safe compromise between the limited global production capacity at the moment, and the imperative for governments to protect as many people as possible while reducing the burden of any subsequent wave on the health systems,” he told a media briefing. Proposals to prolong the gap between first and second dose have generated fierce debate among scientists. Pfizer and BioNTech have warned they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first. The EU gave emergency use approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech shot two weeks ago and hundreds of thousands of Europeans have received it since the rollout began just over a week ago.

Here are details of estimated distribution timelines, announced supply deals and clinical trials in the region. On Dec. 30, the city-state became the first Asian country to begin inoculation of the Pfizer vaccine, despite one of the lowest fatality rates from the coronavirus worldwide. It has signed advanced purchase pacts and made early down-payments on vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. It expects to have secured enough vaccines for its 5.7 million people by the third quarter of 2021. The country has secured about 140 million doses: 53.8 million from AstraZeneca, 51 million from Novavax Inc, 10 million from Pfizer, and 25.5 million from distribution programme COVAX. It expects delivery of 3.8 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in January and February 2021, and plans to begin inoculations in February. Novavax agreed to supply 10.7 million doses, with initial doses to be delivered by mid-2021. China has not announced supply deals with Western drugmakers, which have partnered with private firms in the country instead. AstraZeneca’s vaccine may be approved in China by mid-2021 and is being produced by its Chinese partner Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products Co Ltd. Additionally, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd plans to buy at least 100 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding Co is bringing in Russian vaccine candidate Sputnik V and plans early and mid-stage trials in China. On Dec. 31, China gave its first COVID-19 vaccine approval to a shot developed by a unit of state-backed Sinopharm, for use by the general public. Prior to the approval, China had already vaccinated more than 2 million people under an emergency use programme, using three different shots developed by Sinopharm units and Sinovac. Japan has deals to buy 120 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech in the first half of 2021 and to purchase 120 million from AstraZeneca - the first 30 million to be shipped by March 2021. It has also agreed to buy 250 million from Novavax. Japan is also in talks with Johnson & Johnson, and has a deal with Shionogi & Co Ltd. Experts said vaccine makers would need to run at least Phase I and II trials in Japan before seeking approval for use. The country has deals to buy 20 million doses each from AstraZeneca and Pfizer, 40 million from Moderna and 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. It will procure additional doses for 10 million people through COVAX, and its total supply deals will be enough to cover up to 56 million people. Inoculation will begin in late February with the AstraZeneca vaccine. In January, India approved two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, one developed by AstraZeneca, and the other backed by a state-run institute. It plans to roll out a vaccination programme by next week, aiming to cover 300 million people by July. Taiwan has agreed to buy almost 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, including 10 million from AstraZeneca. It plans to get a total of 30 million vaccine doses to cover about 65% of its population. The first vaccines are expected to arrive in March. Thailand has secured 63 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine -- 61 million from AstraZeneca and 2 million from Sinovac. The country will receive its first delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine ahead of schedule before the second quarter, the government said.

-2.0489700444246797," Australia says COVID-19 vaccinations likely to begin February CANBERRA/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia is on course to begin administering the first COVID-19 vaccines in February, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday, as the country moves to accelerate its inoculation programme as two states try to contain outbreaks. Morrison said Australia’s pharmaceutical regulator is expected to approve the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by the end of January, with the first doses issued within weeks. “We are now in a position where believe we will be able to commence vaccinations in mid-to-late February,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Australia earlier this week said it expected to begin COVID-19 vaccinations in March. Australia has reported a total of just over 28,500 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, with border closures and speedy tracking systems helping keep numbers relatively low. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) Authorities are trying to contain new virus clusters in its largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. The most populous state New South Wales, the epicentre of the country’s latest outbreak, on Thursday said it recorded zero local COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours. Australia has ordered 10 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. It has also struck a deal with AstraZeneca PLC that sees the vaccine produced locally. Morrison said regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine is expected in February. Once both are approved, Morrison said Australia aims to vaccinate 80,000 people each week. This would then be expanded in the following four to six weeks, and by the end of March 4 million people could be vaccinated. The acceleration in the COVID-19 vaccination programme comes amid heightened concern about the spread of the virus globally. Australia’s national cabinet will meet a month earlier than scheduled on Friday, Morrison said, as authorities seek to stop the spread of a more contagious variant of COVID-19 that emerged in Britain. A handful of international arrivals in Australia have tested positive to the UK-strain. The cabinet meeting will consider a proposals to strengthen travel rules for its citizens and residents returning from overseas, Morrison wrote in a Facebook post late Wednesday. Australian media reported the government has plans to introduce mandatory COVID-19 testing for all international travelers before they board their flights to the country. Since March, the country has shut its borders to all non-citizens and permanent residents. ($1 = 1.2807 Australian dollars)"
-2.0489700444246797," Corporate group urges officials consider Trump's removal 'to preserve democracy' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a major U.S. business group that represents 14,000 companies including Exxon Mobil Corp, Pfizer Inc and Toyota Motor Corp urged senior U.S. officials to consider removing President Donald Trump from office after supporters of the outgoing president stormed the U.S. Capitol. National Association of Manufacturers Chief Executive Jay Timmons said Trump “incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. ... Vice President (Mike) Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy.” Trump has 14 days remaining in office before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. The mayhem at the Capitol forced Congress to temporarily postpone a session to certify Biden’s victory. The chaotic scenes unfolded after Trump, who before the election refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost, addressed thousands of supporters near the White House, repeating unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him due to widespread fraud and irregularities. Other business groups issued strong statements but did not go as far as the manufacturers’ group. Under the amendment’s Section 4, never invoked, the vice president and a majority of either Cabinet officials or “such other body as Congress may by law provide” may declare in writing that the president “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Several Democratic lawmakers in Congress also urged Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of some of America’s biggest companies, said that “the chaos unfolding in the nation’s capital is the result of unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election.” They called on Trump “and all relevant officials to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power,” the group said in a statement. ‘TIME TO COME TOGETHER’ Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said “those responsible for this insurrection should be held to account, and we must complete the transition to President-elect Biden’s administration.” JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said: “Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power. Now is the time to come together to strengthen our exceptional union.” Blackstone Group Chief Executive Steve Schwarzman, a Trump ally, said in a statement: “The insurrection that followed the President’s remarks today is appalling and an affront to the democratic values we hold dear as Americans. I am shocked and horrified by this mob’s attempt to undermine our constitution.” Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an internal message reported earlier by Axios and confirmed by a company official that “we need our political leaders to lead by example and put the nation first.... We removed the recent video of President Trump’s remarks expressing support for the people causing the violence. We are treating this situation as an emergency.” General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Twitter that “the violence at the U.S. Capitol does not reflect who we are as a nation. It’s imperative that we come together as a country and reinforce the values and ideals that unite us.” The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful business lobby based near the White House, said that “attacks against our nation’s Capitol Building and our democracy must end now.” “The Congress of the United States must gather again this evening to conclude their Constitutional responsibility to accept the report of the Electoral College,” Thomas Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Lawmakers reconvened shortly after 8 p.m. (0100 GMT on Thursday) to resume the election certification. “To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today - you did not win,” Pence said as the session resumed. “Let’s get back to work,” he said,"

The 32-year-old internist, who got the vaccine on Dec. 30, had several seizures in the following days and is being treated in a specialized hospital that is part of Mexico’s social security institute IMSS. The health ministry’s initial diagnosis after the reaction was encephalomyelitis. Encephalomyelitis is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The ministry has said the doctor has a history of allergic reactions. Victor Hugo Borja, an IMSS director, said the doctor has so far responded favorably to treatment, has had no new seizures, and recovered some of the muscle strength lost. “Today, she’s been able to sit up and it’s possible she’ll be discharged in the following days,” said Borja at a news conference. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it was carefully monitoring allergic reactions to the coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc and urged individuals who had a serious reaction not to get the second dose. A study published on Wednesday in the CDC’s weekly report on death and disease looking at cases between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23 identified 21 cases of anaphylaxis after the administration of 1,893,360 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Doctors are still studying whether the doctor’s seizures and decreased muscle strength are related to the vaccine against COVID-19 or previous conditions. The ministry has said there is no evidence from clinical trials that anyone has developed an inflammation of the brain after the vaccine’s application. Pfizer said it is aware that the health ministry is studying the case and vowed to continue to collaborate “with any information that is requested from us.” Mexico started its COVID-19 vaccination plan before Christmas, giving frontline workers priority."

EU countries started inoculating people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine two weeks ago, after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the shot’s conditional approval under an authorisation which allows five doses to be extracted from each vial. The agency is now considering whether to give the go ahead for an extra dose to be taken from each vial. The source, who asked to remain anonymous because discussions are not public, said the change to the authorisation could come “very soon”. “The company has submitted a request for change, which is being reviewed by the CHMP (human medicines committee) in the shortest possible timeframe,” an EMA spokeswoman said, noting the agency had prompted Pfizer to submit data on the possible use of six doses per vial. “If the CHMP finds that 6 doses can be extracted consistently, it will recommend a change to the current terms of the authorisation to support Member States in their roll-out of the vaccine,” the spokeswoman added. Pfizer was not immediately available to comment and BioNTech declined to comment. The change could add a requirement for the use of special syringes that allow the precise extraction of more doses from the same vial, the source said. “The responsible people in the member states should order these special syringes (Low Dead Space Syringes) now,” EU lawmaker Peter Liese said, adding they were widely available and could cost as little as 0.09 euros ($0.1) each. This change in authorisation could allow 20% more doses to be available in the EU under an existing contract with Pfizer, Liese said.

-1.1603568989695259," U.S. officials report more severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it is carefully monitoring allergic reactions to the coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc and urged individuals who had a serious reaction not to get the second dose. In a conference call with reporters, the U.S. public health agency said allergic reactions are occurring at a rate of 11.1 per 1 million vaccinations. That compared with flu vaccines, in which such reactions occur at a rate of 1.3 per 1 million shots. The severe reactions are still “exceedingly rare,” they said, stressing the need for people to get vaccinated when the shots become available to them, given the threat of death and serious disease from the coronavirus that has already claimed more than 357,000 lives in the United States alone. The CDC said it is monitoring allergic reaction incidents closely and plans to post weekly updates on its website. The agency is also urging that venues that deliver the vaccine be prepared not only to recognize serious allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, but be trained on how to treat them and recognize when individuals need to be referred to hospitals for additional care. CDC officials said 28 people who received the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech had severe allergic reactions. They also noted one case of anaphylaxis, which can cause throat swelling and breathing difficulty, after an individual received Moderna’s vaccine. Officials attributed the difference largely to the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized earlier than the Moderna shot, and said the precautions apply to both. A study published on Wednesday in the CDC’s weekly report on death and disease looking at cases between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23, identified 21 cases of anaphylaxis after the administration of 1,893,360 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Of these, 71%occurred within the first 15 minutes after vaccine administration. Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine."
-1.1603568989695259," Nurse first in Netherlands to get COVID-19 vaccination VEGHEL, Netherlands (Reuters) - A Dutch nurse on Wednesday became the first person in the Netherlands to receive a COVID-19 shot as the European Union’s last vaccination programme for the new coronavirus began after a late start. Sanna Elkadiri, a 39-year-old who cares for dementia patients at a care home in the south of the country, received a shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech on live television. “This is the beginning of the end of this crisis,” said Health Minister Hugo de Jonge at a brief ceremony. Elkadiri said she didn’t hesitate after being offered the chance to get the shot, travelling to a converted distribution centre capable of conducting hundreds of vaccinations per week. Public anger swelled over the weekend and opinion polls showed support for the government waning after it became apparent the Netherlands was last among major European countries to begin vaccinations. In a debate in parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Mark Rutte defended the slow roll out. “The main problem was that we got it sooner than we had expected,” Rutte said, referring to regulatory approval for a vaccine. “It was a different vaccine (than we had expected)...making it impossible to be flexible.” The Dutch government thought the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would be approved first, though Rutte did not explain why. Moderna’s vaccine is expected to become the second COVID-19 vaccine endorsed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) later on Wednesday. After a review, the Dutch government and National Institute for Health (RIVM) dropped plans to vaccinate elderly people in care homes first. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will go initially to nursing home staff and healthcare workers. That list will expand as more vaccines become available. Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have remained high in recent weeks, despite a tough lockdown in which all schools and most stores remain closed."
-1.1603568989695259," Slow vaccine rollout stokes tensions among EU states BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Frustration over the slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has sparked tensions within the European Union, echoing disarray within the bloc at the beginning of the pandemic over sharing of protective medical equipment and the closure of borders. There are concerns that a separate order of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine shots Germany made for itself could cut into supplies for bloc-wide distribution, and a spat has erupted over contracts awarded for “French” and “German” vaccines. European Council President Charles Michel, who represents the 27 EU member states’ governments, said late on Tuesday he would call a video-conference summit before the end of January to discuss the “tremendous” vaccination challenge they face. The European Commission, the EU’s executive, has signed six supply deals with vaccine makers for nearly 2 billion doses to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to members states based on their populations. Of those, only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for use so far. The European Medicines Agency recommended on Wednesday the approval of the Moderna vaccine. The European Commission this week defended its strategy, saying it had been important not to put all its eggs in one basket when various vaccines were still at development stage. “We always knew that it would be a complex operation and this is precisely why the European Commission was so adamant that it was important that we could sign contracts with different companies,” spokesman Eric Mamer said on Wednesday. The German government is facing criticism at home for not ensuring greater supplies of the vaccine developed by Germany’s BioNTech and U.S. company Pfizer. However, in September it reached a bilateral deal - separate from the EU’s contracts - for an additional 30 million doses, German officials said. The European Commission said that EU countries committed not to conduct parallel talks with vaccine makers, but declined to comment on whether Germany had a separate deal with BioNTech. Separately, Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist and lawmaker with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Social Democrat coalition partners, accused France of trying to influence the EU’s clutch of contracts in favour of a vaccine being developed by France’s Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline. “France took care that not too much German vaccine was purchased in relation to the French vaccine,” he told German TV on Monday. “I do believe that other issues rather than purely health-related matters played a role here.” Echoing him, Germany’s biggest tabloid Bild ran a headline saying “France prevented more German vaccine”, referring to the Sanofi/GSK shot and that of Pfizer with the German biotechnology company BioNTech SE. Lauterbach declined to comment on Wednesday. French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune rejected accusations against France as “unacceptable and false”. “It is absurd to play countries and laboratories off against each other because all countries need all the vaccines to vaccinate the maximum number of people between now and the summer,” he said in a statement. The tensions over the vaccination campaign come as coronavirus infections quicken in many member states. The EU has displayed unprecedented solidarity in the face of the pandemic, agreeing on a huge joint borrowing programme to bolster the recovery of its economy. However, there were strains earlier last year when countries hoarded personal protective equipment and unilaterally blocked border crossings."
-1.1603568989695259," Spanish care home investigated over claims it broke COVID-19 vaccine protocol MADRID (Reuters) - Madrid’s regional authorities launched an investigation on Wednesday into a report that a care home allowed priests and relatives of workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in contravention of rules. Only care home residents and staff are supposed to be vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine under Madrid regional health authority regulations. However, relatives of some of the staff at Casablanca Valdesur nursing home, in Valdemoro, south of Madrid, also received injections of the vaccine, eldiario.es, an online newspaper, reported on Wednesday. “We have launched an investigation into the claim,” a Madrid regional government spokesman said on Wednesday. Grupo Casablanca, a care home company contracted by regional authorities to administer the vaccine to 1,600 people in a series of homes, said the drug has lifespan of two hours if not used. To avoid wasting doses, it was used on people who were not staff or residents at the Valdesur home, the company said, adding rules were followed at all other homes. “Some anomalies have been detected in the selection of people vaccinated against Covid-19 who are not residents of the Casablanca Valdesur nursing home, but who belong to their environment,” it said in a statement. “With the sole aim of taking advantage of 100% of the doses received and protecting the elderly in our residences as much as possible, several priests who assist us spiritually in the group centres, volunteers who are in contact with the elderly and some relatives of some employees have been vaccinated.” “The Casablanca group assumes responsibility for what happened and regrets the consequences that these anomalies in the selection process may have caused.”"

Germany has asked an independent expert panel for advice on whether to allow a delay in administering the second dose to make scarce supplies go further, after a similar move by Britain last week. “My impression is that it makes a lot of sense, especially with these sensitive issues, where trust and reliability are important, that we stick to the approval,” Spahn told a news conference, adding that this was in line with the initial feedback he had received from the vaccination experts. He also spoke out against mixing or switching between COVID-19 vaccines, which some nations are also considering to stretch scarce supplies. Germany’s 83 million residents will receive more than 130 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, enough for everybody who needs to receive the shots, Spahn said. He said that he expects first deliveries of the vaccine developed by Moderna next week. The European Medicines Agency earlier on Wednesday approved the U.S. drugmaker’s vaccine for emergency use. Germany will receive 50 million doses of the Moderna vaccine this year, of which 2 million doses are expected in the first quarter, he said."
-1.1603568989695259," Factbox: Moderna's mRNA coronavirus vaccine (Reuters) - The European Union’s drug watchdog on Wednesday authorized emergency use of Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, nearly two weeks after approving Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE’s shot for the virus. On Tuesday, Israel became the first country outside North America to grant authorization to Moderna’s vaccine. The United States and Canada have already started rolling out the two-dose vaccine. Below are more details on Moderna’s vaccine: - The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. - Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 was the first authorization of any treatment developed using the technology. - Other firms using mRNA technology for developing COVID-19 vaccines include Germany’s Curevac and U.S. biotech firm Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. - Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20 degrees Celsius, though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). Those are less onerous requirements than Pfizer’s, which must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius, but can last in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or 15 in a thermal shipping box. - The vaccine was shown to be nearly 95% effective, with no serious safety concerns in a late-stage study. - Moderna was among the first to conduct COVID-19 vaccine human trials, starting in March. Its late-stage 30,000 participant testing began on July 27 in the United States. It finished enrolling participants in October. - The company slowed enrollment in September to increase the diversity of the trial population. It ultimately enrolled 3,000 Black American participants and more than 6,000 Hispanic participants. - The vaccine candidate is being tested at 100 clinical research sites in the United States. - Moderna’s U.S. trial was the first under the government’s Operation Warp Speed program and is funded by Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.

Carlito Galvez, a former general in charge of the country’s strategy to fight the coronavirus, said the government hopes to close deals with Novavax, Moderna, AstraZeneca , Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sinovac Biotech and the Gamaleya Institute this month, although availability could be a challenge amid stiff competition. “We will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from seven manufacturers. However, that will be dependent on global supply,” Galvez told a media briefing. Wealthier nations had already snapped up 80% of available doses, he said, without providing a source for the data. The Philippines had earlier targeted 80 million doses and though it has been talking with vaccine-makers for months, the country has secured only 2.6 million doses, from Britain’s AstraZeneca, paid for by a private sector group, which will give half of those to their employees. AstraZeneca on Wednesday applied for an emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines. The country will get subsidised doses for 23 million of its people through the global vaccine partnership known as COVAX, Galvez added. Healthcare workers, elderly, soldiers, police, teachers and government workers will be prioritised in a rollout that could start as early as the first quarter, he said. Philippine regulators have yet to approve any COVID-19 vaccines and news of President Rodrigo Duterte’s security detail being inoculated in September has caused an uproar among activists and lawmakers. Duterte has promised safe, effective and free vaccines for all 108 million people, Galvez said. The Philippines has recorded 480,737 infections and 9,347 deaths due to the coronavirus."

The Netherlands has hundreds of thousands of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses in cold storage, but will not give a first shot until Wednesday, in a limited roll-out to health care workers. Rutte’s government was criticised by lawmakers during a debate for allowing the Netherlands to be the last country in the EU to begin vaccinating. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Dec. 21. By last week, 164,000 doses had been delivered to the Netherlands and that number stood at 288,000 on Tuesday, Rutte said. The Netherlands was not prepared for the logistics of distributing the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, Rutte told parliament. “The main problem was that we got it sooner than we had expected,” Rutte said, referring to the EMA approval. “It was a different vaccine (than we had expected)...making it impossible to be flexible.” Labour Party leader Lodewijk Asscher accused Rutte of making excuses, while “there are 300,000 vaccines in freezers and no one vaccinated”. The Dutch had planned to start vaccinating the most vulnerable people at elderly care homes, but the Pfizer vaccine comes in boxes of nearly 1,000 doses, which could not be stored at those sites. Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have remained high in recent weeks, despite a tough lockdown in which all schools and many stores were closed last month. “There are no convincing effects of the Dec. 15 lockdown yet,” the National Institute for Public Health said on Tuesday."

Brady, 65, is the second House member to report testing positive for the virus this week. An aide to Representative Kay Granger, 77, the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, announced on Monday that the lawmaker had tested positive. “Tonite, the Office of House Physician informed me that I’ve tested positive for Covid 19 & am quarantined,” Brady said on Twitter on Tuesday. “As recommended, I received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine Dec 18 & also recently tested negative for Covid on New Years Day. Begin treatment tomorrow. Shld be fine.” A nurse in California tested positive for COVID-19 last month, more than a week after receiving the first dose of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine. Experts say a second dose of the vaccine is needed to ramp up protection against the virus. Dozens of lawmakers in Congress have tested positive, or were presumed to have had COVID-19, over the past year. The coronavirus pandemic has infected nearly 21 million Americans and killed more than 357,000."

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which has shown a 95% success rate, was formally approved by the National Institute of Food and Drug Surveillance (Invima). “This is a very important step,” Duque said in his nightly broadcast, adding the approval for the vaccine had been given in record time. The country now awaits approval for vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical unit Janssen, Duque added. Patients aged 60 and over, or with co-morbidities such as asthma and diabetes, will be among the first in line for vaccines, as well as health workers. Colombia has agreed to buy 10 million doses each of the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, as well as 9 million from Janssen.

-1.3856460212723765," Peruvian minister raises 'controversy' over Pfizer vaccine liability clause LIMA (Reuters) - Peru’s health minister said on Tuesday that “controversy” had arisen over a liability waiver in the country’s negotiations to obtain COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc. Pilar Mazzetti told Congress that Peruvian officials had been in “constant contact” with Pfizer since July but that a dispute arose in their negotiations in December. She said she could not give details because of a confidentiality agreement but added that they related to “the waiving of important elements such as ... jurisdictional immunity.” “It is true that one needs the vaccine but it is also true that there are aspects related to aspects of our sovereignty that the country has to protect ... it has to do with risk for future generations,” she told lawmakers. Several other countries, including Brazil and Argentina, have raised concerns about liability waivers in their negotiations with Pfizer. World Bank officials said on Tuesday they were working with countries to address the liability waiver issue which they said had emerged as one of the key obstacles to sealing vaccine supply deals. Peru has hosted trials for COVID-19 vaccines developed by China`s Sinopharm, U.S.-based Johnson & Johnson and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca Plc and is in negotiations to secure vaccines from other companies, Mazzetti said. Peru’s foreign minister told a legislative commission last month that Peru had resumed conversations with AstraZeneca after cutting off negotiations in October when it alleged the company had not provided adequate data on its testing. Peru has also signed up to receive 13.2 million doses of vaccines through the COVAX facility, an alliance led by the World Health Organization and GAVI. Mazzetti told Congress on Tuesday that the doses had previously been expected in July but the government had been “recently” told by COVAX to expect them “in the first three months of this year.”"

Spain has administered 139,339 doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine so far out of the 743,925 distributed to the country’s 17 regions - who manage health care - since the European Union approved the vaccine two weeks ago, Spain’s Health Ministry said on Tuesday. It was a significant increase from the prior day when 82,834 people were inoculated, health minister Salvador Illa said late on Monday, stressing that the goal was to have between 15 million and 20 million Spaniards vaccinated by May or June. Spanish doctors and health experts have expressed frustration at the slow start of the country’s vaccination campaign, echoing similar complaints in other European countries. The inoculation campaign has been unequal within Spain. The northern region of Asturias is in the lead, having administered 54.5% of the doses it received, while the rate in the neighbouring region of Cantabria is only 5.1%, according to the Health Ministry. Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, with over 51,000 deaths and close to 2 million cases. The number of fatalities grew on Tuesday by 352 from Monday’s Health Ministry report, while the number of cases by 23,700 as some regions tightened their restrictions."

-1.3856460212723765," WHO recommends two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine within 21-28 days GENEVA/ZURICH (Reuters) - People should get two doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine within 21-28 days, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, as many countries struggled to administer the jabs that can ward off the COVID-19 virus. Many are experiencing intensifying pressure on their health services due to surging coronavirus cases and the emergence of new variants that appear to spread more easily. Governments are introducing new lockdown measures to halt the spread while facing massive demand for vaccines which are seen as the best way out of the global health crisis. But with jabs in limited supply as production ramps up, the WHO has been examining how they can be used most effectively. “We deliberated and came out with the following recommendation: two doses of this (Pfizer) vaccine within 21-28 days,” Alejandro Cravioto, chairman of WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), told an online news briefing. The panel said countries should have leeway to spread out shots over six weeks so that more people at higher risk of illness can get them. “SAGE made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of (Pfizer) vaccine supply constraints to delay the administration of the second dose for a few weeks in order to maximise the number of individuals benefiting from a first dose,” Cravioto said. He added: “I think we have to be a bit open to these types of decisions which countries have to make according to their own epidemiological situations.” More than 85 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and around 1.85 million have died, according to a Reuters tally. SAGE executive Joachim Hombach said spacing out the two Pfizer inoculations could be acceptable for countries unable to implement the main recommendation. “The JCI, the recommending body of the UK, has given more flexibility up to 12 weeks in consideration of the specific circumstances that the country is currently facing,” he said. “We...totally acknowledge that countries may see needs to be even more flexible in terms of administration of the second dose. But it is important to note that there is very little...empirical data from the trials that underpin this type of recommendation,” he added. Given the limited supply of vaccines at present, Cravioto said SAGE did not recommend the Pfizer jab for international travellers as a priority unless they were in a very high-risk group, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing ailments. Kate O’Brien, a WHO immunization expert, said there was a robust discussion at SAGE about the trade-off between adhering strictly to standard dosing in clinical trials and allowing for a broader use of vaccine as first doses, thus risking delay in getting the second dose out to some people. Alluding to delays in rolling out inoculations, she said: “Nobody expected this to be easy and we are starting to see where the road bumps are and where we need to make adjustments.” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said he was “very disappointed” that China had not authorised entry of an international mission to examine the origins of the global coronavirus pandemic. Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019."

Although Ottawa has purchased almost half a million doses of vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc and expects another 1.2 million by the end of January, the 10 provinces are responsible for administering them. Domestic media, citing official data, note Israel has reached 15.83 doses per 100 people compared with 1.38 in the United States and just 0.38 in Canada, where a rapidly spreading second wave threatens to overwhelm some healthcare services.

-1.3856460212723765," Mexico's president sets out vaccination plan, targets rural areas MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday set out plans to vaccinate the country’s population and said the government hoped to inoculate the country’s elderly by the end of March. So far, the country has administered jabs to about 44,000 healthcare workers using Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, the only one available in the country so far, but authorities hope to ramp up vaccinations in coming weeks. Vaccinating all “senior citizens” by the end of March would be a huge logistical challenge in a nation of 127 million people with shoddy medical services in vast rural areas. “We are going to start at the bottom, where the most marginalized people live,” Lopez Obrador told his daily morning news conference. Mexico expects to receive 1.4 million Pfizer vaccines that require two doses per person by the end of January, which should be enough to vaccinate most of the 750,000 frontline healthcare workers who are at the front of the queue. Lopez Obrador said the plan to vaccinate older adults in remote areas will rely on vaccines from Chinese company CanSino Biologics, in part because it requires a single shot and is easy to store. Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept in special ultra-cold freezers. Mexico has sought to order 35 million CanSino vaccines, with about 8 million arriving by March, officials say, though Mexico’s regulator has yet to approve its use. Mexico’s vaccination drive would be carried out in 10,000 community centres serving small and remote towns and focusing on adults above 60 years of age. Medium sized towns and large cities would follow, Lopez Obrador said. More than 127,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Mexico, which has the world’s fourth highest death toll. Mexico has several vaccine agreements, including with AstraZeneca and the World Health Organization-backed COVAX scheme set up to deliver vaccines to developing countries."

The bloc, with a population of 450 million, has already ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has taken up an option to buy another 100 million under a contract signed with the two companies in November. Each recipient needs two doses of the vaccine. The sources said the EU is seeking to buy 50 or 100 million additional doses from the companies. The new doses could be delivered as soon as in the third quarter, two sources said. But one of the sources added that deliveries could also be made in the fourth quarter and would be at the same price per dose as agreed in the existing contract. The EU agreed to pay 15.5 euros per dose in that contract, according to an EU document seen by Reuters. An European Commission spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday on numbers of possible orders. But on Monday he told a news conference the EU was trying to secure more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech in addition to the 300 million shots already booked A Pfizer spokesman said he could not comment as discussions with governments are confidential.

With 233,000 doses delivered by Pfizer and BioNTech, so far, the country is expecting vaccine deliveries to hit at least 1.5 million doses by the end of February, provided Moderna’s shot wins the regulator’s blessing. The shots require two doses several weeks apart, to confer maximum protection shown in clinical trials to be around 95%. Switzerland is concentrating initial shots on older people, including in nursing homes, and those with chronic diseases. Switzerland has ordered a total of about 15 million doses, including from other manufacturers whose products have yet to be approved, after setting aside 400 million Swiss francs ($455 million) to buy shots. High global demand from virtually everywhere, combined with limited production, means there is too little to go around. “We continue to be in negotiations, to see how we can boost volumes,” said Nora Kronig, head of the Swiss Federal Health Ministry’s international division that is leading talks with companies, during a press conference in Bern. Kronig declined to say if talks extend to companies including Johnson & Johnson, which is due shortly to release results of clinical trials of its one-dose vaccine in tens of thousands of volunteers. Switzerland has, so far, recorded 28 documented cases of COVID-19 infections caused by an especially infectious variant of the new coronavirus that has been circulating rapidly in Britain. That’s up from just a handful reported late last month. ($1 = 0.8799 Swiss francs)"
-1.3856460212723765," Belgium to get half the Pfizer vaccine doses it ordered for January BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium will receive only half the doses of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer vaccine it ordered for January because of a logistical difficulty that occurred last month. Health Ministry spokesman Yves Van Laethem said a logistical issue in the second half of December prevented the delivery of the vaccines as planned in the Belgian vaccination strategy, without detailing the problem. “The company Pfizer, which supplies us, will only be able to supply half of the planned doses for the month of January and so we go from 600,000 doses to a little over 300,000 doses,” Van Laethem told a news conference. After vaccinating about 700 people in four nursing homes during a test week of vaccination, Belgium started on Tuesday to vaccinate residents in nursing homes nationwide along with the health staff there. The country of 11 million people has suffered one of Europe’s highest death rates per capita from the pandemic, with 60% of fatalities occurring in nursing homes. This first phase of vaccination will continue as planned with two doses being injected. “It was decided to continue a complete vaccination with two doses in the most fragile people, struck more heavily by the disease,” Van Laethem said."

-0.3676352418552713," Irish hospitals cannot manage current COVID-19 trajectory - health chief DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland’s hospitals cannot manage the current trajectory of its fast-growing COVID-19 outbreak and will cancel most non-urgent procedures this week to create as much spare critical care space as possible, its hospitals’ chief said on Monday. COVID-19 hospital admissions are rising by 20% a day, and the number of patients being treated could surpass the first wave peak within a day or two, having reached 776 on Monday. There were 73 patients in intensive care units (ICU). The head of Ireland’s health service operator said that on that trajectory, the total number in hospitals could hit 2,500 this month, with between 250 and 430 in ICU. Public hospitals can surge ICU capacity safely to 375 and the health service was again seeking to take over private hospital ICU beds, Paul Reid said. “I think we’ve run out of adjectives to describe how serious this is... The numbers in that trajectory we cannot sustain,” Reid told the Newstalk radio station. Until recently Ireland had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe, leading the government to allow the reopening of most of the economy in December. But the 14-day COVID-19 incidence rate per 100,000 people has risen almost five-fold to 583 in the last two weeks. Modelling chief Philip Nolan said the true underlying rate, owing to a backlog of positive tests, was 700-800, surpassing the corresponding first wave peak of around 600 in April. The country’s Chief Medical Officer last week said Ireland now had the “fastest-growing” incidence rate in the European Union and on Monday said officials have not been as concerned at any point in the whole pandemic as they are now. Ireland will ramp up its early stage vaccine rollout this week. Its immunisation advisory committee recommended the continued administering of two doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine in the period indicated by its manufacturers, and not to follow a recent shift by Britain to postpone second doses in order to give more people a first shot. Reid said the health service would likely report around 7,000 daily COVID-19 cases in the coming days, “a frightening scale” after the positive test rate soared to 25% on Sunday alone. One local doctor in Louth, the second hardest-hit county that borders Northern Ireland where cases are also surging, said 90% of her COVID-19 referrals from Dec. 28 to Dec. 31 returned positive. “I was referring symptoms as mild as head colds. If you think ‘this is not COVID’ and are about to meet up for that walk or go into work... Think again,” the general practitioner, Amy Morgan, said on Twitter."
-0.3676352418552713," Spanish doctors disappointed by slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish doctors and health experts expressed frustration on Monday at the slow start to the country’s campaign to inoculate people against COVID-19, with fewer than 90,000 people vaccinated since the EU approved a vaccine two weeks ago. Some 82,834 people in Spain have received the first dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine so far, health minister Salvador Illa told reporters on Monday. “We have received the third shipment of the vaccine... and hope to reach cruising pace in our vaccination campaign in the coming weeks,” Illa said, adding that the objective was to have between 15 and 20 million Spaniards vaccinated by May-June. “We still recommend administering the vaccine’s second dose in the period indicated by BioNTech-Pfizer,” Illa noted. The United Kingdom recently opted to use up its vaccine stock to give more people a single inoculation, a strategy Germany is also studying. The vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech cleared EU regulatory hurdles on Dec. 21 and vaccinations began on Dec. 27, but the process has been slow and cumbersome, prompting criticism in several member states including Germany and France. In Spain, the vaccination campaign has been partially interrupted by a long New Year weekend, with many health sector workers still on holiday and some nursing home residents away visiting relatives. Several regions also complained of delays in receiving the vaccines last week. “It has been quite disappointing and worrying. It was the perfect opportunity to give a boost to the fight against the virus and to set an example,” Quique Bassat, an epidemiologist and researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Heath, told Reuters. Echoing such frustration, French officials urged a faster rate of vaccinations on Monday, while Germany’s health minister has come under fire over a shortage of vaccines there and the slow inoculation campaign. With health a regional government competence in Spain, many regions have not published their own data yet, although Illa gave the first nationally compiled data today. However, a compilation of the more granular data available in some of Spain’s most populous areas shows the number of shots administered during the week was much lower than the 350,000 doses shipped, with big differences between regions. Madrid had only vaccinated over 3,000 people as of Saturday from the 48,000 doses it received, while in Catalonia, where 60,000 vaccines are sent every week, only 8,293 people have been vaccinated so far. The northwestern region of Galicia had vaccinated 9,500 people as of Sunday, about half of the 18,000 vaccines the region is due to receive each week. In the Canary Islands, 4,593 people had been inoculated by Saturday, 30% of people targeted in the first phase, using a third of their weekly doses. “Some regions have performed reasonably well ... others have been slower. There is a gap and it causes us a certain degree of frustration,” doctor Amos Garcia Rojas, head of the Spanish Association of Vaccinology, told Reuters. Madrid regional health official Enrique Ruiz Escudero said they intend to accelerate to administering 24,000 shots a week, while the rest of their weekly stock would be used as a second dose. Catalan regional authorities, which plan to give shots to 748,000 of its 7.5 million inhabitants within 12 weeks, have pledged to give inoculations every day of the week to accelerate the process. “We are confident we can achieve this,” Josep Maria Argimon, Catalonia’s regional head of public health, told a news conference. With holiday season not over in Spain until after Epiphany day on Wednesday, some experts remained wary. “It is incomprehensible that there are not enough staff and resources to continue to vaccinate every day. I think this is a big scandal,” Manuel Perez-Alonso, Professor of Genetics at the University of Valencia, wrote on Twitter."

-0.3676352418552713," Germany mulls delaying second COVID-19 vaccine shot, Denmark approves delay BERLIN/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Germany was weighing on Monday whether to allow a delay in administering a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech and Pfizer to make scarce supplies go further, after a similar move by Britain last week. Separately, Denmark approved on Monday a delay of up to six weeks between the first and second shots of the vaccine. In Berlin, the health ministry was seeking the view of an independent vaccination commission on whether to delay a second shot beyond a current 42-day maximum limit, according to a one-page document seen by Reuters on Monday. The move came amid criticism of Health Minister Jens Spahn - including from his conservative political allies - that Germany has failed to procure enough vaccines and been too slow to ramp up its national inoculation campaign. Spahn told his Christian Democratic Union at a closed-door meeting on Monday that he hoped to offer vaccinations by this summer to everyone in Germany, once more vaccines have won regulatory approval, according to sources who attended. Some German health experts have welcomed Britain’s move to delay administering a second dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot, which comes as governments try to provide protection against coronavirus to as many people as possible by giving them one shot and delaying a second. “In view of the current scarcity of vaccines and the very high numbers of infections and hospitalisations (in Germany), a strategy in which as many people as possible are vaccinated as early as possible is more effective,” said Leif-Erik Sander, head of the vaccine research team at Berlin’s Charité hospital. However, BioNTech and Pfizer pointed in a joint statement to a lack of trial data to support delaying the second dose. “The safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been evaluated on different dosing schedules as the majority of trial participants received the second dose within the window specified in the study design,” the companies said, referring to a prime shot and a booster given three weeks apart. “There is no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.” The European Medicines Agency said a maximum interval of 42 days between the first and the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine should be respected to obtain full protection. According to the latest daily update from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has vaccinated around 239,000 people since starting its campaign on Dec. 27 - well short of the 1.3 million doses that were delivered by the end of 2020. By way of comparison, Britain has administered more than a million COVID-19 vaccines so far, more than the rest of Europe put together, Health Minister Matt Hancock said. The Danish Health Authority will allow a wait of up to six weeks before administering a second dose, its head Soren Brostrom told local news wire Ritzau on Monday, after scrutinising vaccine data. But Brostrom said the original guidelines of waiting only three to four weeks should be followed whenever possible. “If you go longer than six weeks, we cannot see the scientific evidence that you are protected with certainty. Therefore we cannot recommend that,” Brostrom added. As of Monday, a total of 46,975 Danes had received the first Pfizer-BioNTech shot, mostly health workers and the elderly. While a longer interval between shots has not been tested in clinical trials, some scientists said it was a sensible plan given the extraordinary circumstances. European Union approval for a vaccine from Moderna, expected this week, should add another 1.5 million doses of supply in the coming weeks, the German Health Ministry document said. In total, Germany, which has around 83 million people, should get 50 million doses of the Moderna shot this year under EU-wide procurement contracts. Regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine approved last week by Britain, the German Health Ministry said the European Medicines Agency’s rolling review was proceeding at “high pressure”. “The goal is, as soon as possible, to decide on the way forward and on the scope of approval” for the AstraZeneca vaccine, the document said."

Evidence of the vaccine efficacy is based on a study where administration of doses was done 19 to 42 days apart, the agency said, noting that full protection comes only seven days after the booster. It added: “Any change to this would require a variation to the marketing authorisation as well as more clinical data to support such a change, otherwise it would be considered as ‘off label use’.” Off label use entails lower liabilities on vaccine makers."

The bloc, with a population of 450 million, has already ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has taken up an option to buy another 100 million under a contract signed with the two companies in November. The vaccine needs to be administered in two doses per person. “The Commission is checking with the companies whether there is a way to add additional doses to those for which we already have a deal,” the spokesman told a news conference. A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on whether new talks were under way with the EU. BioNTech was not immediately available for comment. It told Reuters on Jan. 1 that it was in talks with Brussels on boosting production for Europe. The EU’s attempts at securing more doses of the only COVID-19 vaccine it has authorised come amid concern in some capitals that a separate German order for the same shot might compete with broader supplies for the 27-country bloc. Germany said on Monday that it had agreed with BioNTech last September to supply an additional 30 million doses on a bilateral basis. This was a memorandum of understanding, of which the EU was aware, the Health Ministry said. That month, Germany announced 375 million euros ($460 million) of funding for BioNTech, a biotech startup based in Mainz, to help speed research and expand production capacity in Germany. Health Minister Jens Spahn has said national deals were possible with the same vaccine makers once the EU has concluded its own contract and as long as supplies to EU countries were not disrupted. The bilateral German deal predates by two months the EU contract for the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine that was signed in November after talks that had been going on at least since July. A spokesman for the EU Commission said he had no information on Germany’s bilateral deal with BioNTech and declined to comment on whether it was in breach of EU agreements. He said, however, that EU countries had made a political commitment to avoid parallel negotiations with the same pharmaceutical companies to secure COVID-19 vaccines.

Currently battling one of Asia’s most stubborn coronavirus epidemics, Indonesia has secured more than 329 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, most notably from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, and AstraZeneca. Those to be used in the first phase are CoronaVac, the vaccine of China’s Sinovac, of which Indonesia has received 3 million doses. Airlangga Hartarto, the country’s chief economic minister, said the vaccination programme is scheduled to start next week, pending data from BPOM, which he said draws findings from the clinical trials in Brazil and Turkey. The vaccine will be administered for free across the archipelago, with the rollout expected to be completed within 15 months. The government expected the programme to cost more than 74 trillion rupiah ($5.33 billion), Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said. Indonesia’s state-owned drugmaker Bio Farma has already dispatched about 714,000 CoronaVac doses to the country’s 32 provinces, it said on Monday. Bambang Heriyanto, corporate secretary for Bio Farma, told Reuters the vaccines had been pre-positioned to save time and allow inoculations to start as soon as BPOM’s authorisation is given. Senior BPOM official Lucia Rizka Andalusia said interim data from late stage clinical trials in West Java plus findings from Brazil and Turkey needed to be studied, but she was hopeful the emergency use authorization would be issued. Early results from CoronaVac late-stage trials showed it was 91.25% effective, while researchers in Brazil have said it was more than 50% effective, though full results were yet to be released at the company’s request. Budi Gunadi Sadikin, Indonesia’s health minister, has said that Indonesia needs to inoculate about 181 million people, or roughly 67% of its population, to reach herd immunity.

The trial's Vaccine Transition Option allows all participants aged 16 or older the choice to discover whether they were given the placebo, ""and for participants who learn they received the placebo, to have the option to receive the investigational vaccine while staying in the study,"" the companies said on their website here for trial participants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a panel of its outside advisers have expressed concerns over Pfizer’s “unblinding” plan, saying it could make it harder to continue collecting data on safety and effectiveness needed to win full FDA approval of the vaccine. Trial participants who received the placebo will have two doses of the investigational vaccine reserved for them within the study, the companies said on the website. “The study doctor will follow the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their local health authorities to offer the Vaccine Transition Option to participants in a prioritized manner,” the companies said."

The German biotech startup has led the vaccine race but its shot has been slow to arrive in the European Union because of relatively late approval from the bloc’s health regulator and the small size of the order placed by Brussels. The delays in rolling out the home-grown vaccine have caused consternation in Germany, where some regions had to halt vaccinations within days of starting an inoculation drive. “At the moment it doesn’t look good - a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told news weekly Spiegel. Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife, Oezlem Tuereci, who is the company’s chief medical officer. Both faulted the EU’s decision to spread orders in the expectation that more vaccines would be approved quickly. The United States ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot in July, while the EU waited until November to place an order half that size. “At some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly,” Tuereci told Spiegel. “By then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.” After publication of the interview, BioNTech said it was in talks with Brussels on boosting output “We are in productive discussions with the European Commission on how to make more of our vaccine in Europe, for Europe,” a spokeswoman said. BioNTech hopes to launch a new production line in Marburg, Germany, ahead of schedule in February, with the potential to produce 250 million doses in the first half of 2021, said Sahin. Talks are also under way with contract manufacturers and there should be greater clarity by the end of January, he added. Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Twitter that German authorities would do everything possible to enable a swift start in Marburg. The federal government, which has backed BioNTech with 375 million euros ($458 million) in funding, has resisted calls from opposition leaders to speed production of its vaccine by issuing compulsory licences to other drugmakers. Another vaccine from Moderna is expected to be cleared by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Jan. 6. Spahn has also urged the EMA to quickly approve the Oxford University-AstraZeneca shot cleared by Britain. The EU timeline for that treatment remains uncertain. That vaccine was approved by India’s drug regulator on Friday for emergency use, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Sahin said the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with a new, more contagious variant first detected in Britain. “We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant and will soon know more,” he said. Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks - though such new treatments might require additional regulatory approvals. Sahin also said BioNTech would make its vaccine, which requires storage at about minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), easier to handle, adding that a next-generation vaccine could be ready by late summer.

The United Nations health agency said it will work with regional partners to tell national health authorities about the two-dose shot and its anticipated benefits. The WHO established its emergency use listing (EUL) process to help poorer countries without their own regulatory resources quickly approve medicines new diseases like COVID-19, which otherwise could lead to delays. The WHO’s review found Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine met the “must-have” criteria for safety and efficacy benefits outweigh its risks. “This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccines,” said Mariangela Simao, the WHO’s access to medicines program leader. “But I want to emphasize the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere.” The UN health agency, with the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), are spearheading a global effort called COVAX to secure and distribute vaccines to poorer countries, to ensure shots do not go only to wealthy nations. The WHO-backed COVAX alliance has agreements for nearly 2 billion doses, with first deliveries due in early 2021. The alliance has been in talks with Pfizer and BioNTech to secure vaccine. Even so, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine’s challenging storage and delivery requirements, including keeping it at minus 70 degrees Celsius, have made deliveries challenging in western countries, and may pose bigger hurdles for developing nations without adequate infrastructure. The vaccine has gotten regulatory backing from the United Kingdom, the European Medicines Agency, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada, Bahrain, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Pfizer and BioNTech’s messenger RNA vaccine was found to be 95% effective after two doses 21 days apart."
-0.5049424177061655," Local funding crisis threatens U.S. vaccine rollout NEW YORK (Reuters) -Seattle public health officials have so little COVID-19 funding on hand they worry they will have to shut down some virus testing sites as they mount a campaign to dose their 2.3 million residents with Pfizer Inc’s and Moderna Inc’s vaccines. King County, which represents greater Seattle, has $14 million of COVID-19 funding for 2021, roughly enough to fund its operations for a single month, and a fraction of the $87 million emergency COVID-19 aid it received in 2020, said Ingrid Ulrey, the public health policy director for King County. “We’ve been on pins and needles the whole last three or four months, watching what’s happening at the federal level, waiting, watching,” she said. When newly approved federal funds finally trickle down to her level, she expects them to be less than this year, insufficient and too late. “It’s shockingly low,” she added. “We have a huge new, unprecedented, daunting task of vaccine delivery.” King County is at risk of being unable to hire the up to 40 additional staff needed to begin the next wave of public vaccinations. In counties across the United States, the funding crisis has limited the hiring of needed vaccine staff, delayed the creation of vaccination centers, and undermined efforts to raise public awareness, officials told Reuters. The federal government spent more than $10 billion to speed COVID-19 vaccine development but has so far disbursed little funding for distribution, even as it pushed the responsibility of actual immunizations onto state and local governments. A new $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package provides $8.75 billion to states to assist in vaccinations, in line with what state and local officials had requested, but months after distribution work should have begun. “The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday. The promised wave of newly approved vaccinations has been only a ripple: around 2.8 million Americans have received a shot, including fewer than 170,000 residents of nursing homes, one of the most at-risk groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is far fewer than the 20 million vaccinations the federal government promised for December. Nearly 10 million of the 12.4 million doses the government has distributed to states sit unused, and on Tuesday President-elect Joe Biden said it would take years, not months, to vaccinate most Americans at the current pace. Hospitals and pharmacies CVS and Walgreens are in charge of the first wave of vaccinations of health care workers and long-term care residents. But local health systems will take a leading role in immunizing the next, bigger waves, and will be critical for groups such as the uninsured, underinsured, homeless and others. The shortage of local public health staff will only grow more challenging as the vaccination effort expands to essential workers and older Americans, said Claire Hannan, the director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a trade group for local public health departments. Brandon Meline, logistics chief for Illinois’s Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said their district was tapping a rainy day fund until more federal assistance arrives. “We’re four weeks into significant planning and two weeks into active distribution and we don’t have a secure funding stream,” Meline said in a Christmas Eve interview while waiting for a vaccine shipment to arrive. Coconino County, the largest in Arizona by area, needs to hire around 20 people to run vaccination clinics and get to residents who live hours from hospitals, including some who are at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, said Kim Musselman, director of the county’s health and human services department. Musselman said its nurses are stretched thin as they staff the free vaccination clinic it set up in Coconino County and will struggle to maintain it, let alone set up additional clinics, without more funding. The state has not signaled help is forthcoming. “We have been told, because we’ve repeatedly asked, is there any public assistance reimbursement for vaccine-related expenditures? And we have continued to be told no at this time,” she said."

-0.5049424177061655," Exclusive: Drugmakers to hike prices for 2021 as pandemic, political pressure put revenues at risk NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Pfizer Inc, Sanofi SA, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc plan to raise U.S. prices on more than 300 drugs in the United States on Jan. 1, according to drugmakers and data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors. The hikes come as drugmakers are reeling from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced doctor visits and demand for some drugs. They are also fighting new drug price cutting rules from the Trump administration, which would reduce the industry’s profitability. The companies kept their price increases at 10% or below, and the largest drug companies to raise prices so far, Pfizer and Sanofi, kept nearly all of their increases 5% or less, 3 Axis said. 3 Axis is a consulting firm that works with pharmacists groups, health plans and foundation on drug pricing and supply chain issues. GSK did raise prices on two vaccines - shingles vaccine Shingrix and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine Pediarix - by 7% and 8.6%, respectively, 3 Axis said. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc hiked prices on 15 drugs, including Austedo, which treats rare neurological disorders, and asthma steroid Qvar, which together grossed more than $650 million in sales in 2019 and saw price hikes of between 5% and 6%. Teva hiked prices for some drugs, including muscle relaxant Amrix and narcolepsy treatment Nuvigil, as much as 9.4%. More price hikes are expected to be announced on Friday and in early January. In 2020, drugmakers raised prices on more than 860 drugs by around 5 percent, on average, according to 3 Axis. Drug price increases have slowed substantially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the number of drugs affected. The increases come as pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer are playing hero by developing vaccines for COVID-19 in record time. The hikes could help make up for lost revenue as doctors visits and new prescriptions plummeted during the global lockdown. Pfizer plans to raise prices on more than 60 drugs by between 0.5 % and 5%. Those include roughly 5% increases on some of its top sellers like rheumatoid arthritis treatment Xeljanz and cancer drugs Ibrance and Inlyta. Pfizer said it had adjusted the list prices of its drugs by around 1.3% across all products in its portfolio, in line with inflation. “This modest increase is necessary to support investments that allow us to continue to discover new medicines and deliver those breakthroughs to the patients who need them,” spokeswoman Amy Rose said in a statement, pointing in particular to the COVID-19 vaccine the company developed with Germany’s BioNTech SE. It said that its net prices, which back out rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts, have actually fallen for the last 3 years. France’s Sanofi plans to increase prices on a number of vaccines 5 percent or less and will announce more price increases later in January, spokesperson Ashleigh Koss said. None of the company’s price increases will be above the expected growth rate of U.S. health spending of 5.1 percent, she said. Slashing U.S. prescription drug prices - which are among the highest in the world - was a focus of U.S. President Donald Trump, after making it a core pledge of his 2016 campaign. He issued several executive orders in late 2020 meant to cut prices, but their impact could be limited by legal challenges and other problems. A federal judge earlier this month blocked a last-minute Trump administration rule aimed at lowering drug prices that was set to be implemented at the beginning of the year. It was challenged by drug industry groups including PhRMA, the nation’s leading pharmaceutical trade group. President-elect Biden has also vowed to reduce drug costs and to allow Medicare, a U.S. government health insurance program, to negotiate drug prices. He has support from Congressional Democrats to pass such legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office has said could cost the industry more than $300 billion by 2029."

A new $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package provides $8.75 billion to states to assist in vaccinations, in line with what state and local officials had requested, but months after distribution work should have begun. ""The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!"" U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday. The promised wave of newly approved vaccinations has been only a ripple: around 2.8 million Americans have received a shot, including fewer than 170,000 residents of nursing homes, one of the most at-risk groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is far fewer than the 20 million vaccinations the federal government promised for December. Nearly 10 million of the 12.4 million doses the government has distributed to states sit unused, and on Tuesday President-elect Joe Biden said it would take years, not months, to vaccinate most Americans at the current pace. Hospitals and pharmacies CVS (CVS.N) and Walgreens (WBA.O) are in charge of the first wave of vaccinations of health care workers and long-term care residents. But local health systems will take a leading role in immunizing the next, bigger waves, and will be critical for groups such as the uninsured, underinsured, homeless and others. The shortage of local public health staff will only grow more challenging as the vaccination effort expands to essential workers and older Americans, said Claire Hannan, the director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a trade group for local public health departments. Brandon Meline, logistics chief for Illinois’s Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said their district was tapping a rainy day fund until more federal assistance arrives. “We’re four weeks into significant planning and two weeks into active distribution and we don’t have a secure funding stream,” Meline said in a Christmas Eve interview while waiting for a vaccine shipment to arrive. Coconino County, the largest in Arizona by area, needs to hire around 20 people to run vaccination clinics and get to residents who live hours from hospitals, including some who are at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, said Kim Musselman, director of the county’s health and human services department. Musselman said its nurses are stretched thin as they staff the free vaccination clinic it set up in Coconino County and will struggle to maintain it, let alone set up additional clinics, without more funding. The state has not signaled help is forthcoming. ""We have been told, because we've repeatedly asked, is there any public assistance reimbursement for vaccine-related expenditures? And we have continued to be told no at this time,"" she said."
-0.5049424177061655," Vaccinated U.S. nurse contracts COVID-19, expert says Pfizer shot needed more time to work - ABC (Reuters) - A nurse in California tested positive for COVID-19 more than a week after receiving Pfizer Inc's vaccine, an ABC News affiliate reported bit.ly/2L8iBel on Tuesday, but a medical expert and the U.S. drug maker said the body needs more time to build up protection. Pfizer “will review all available information on this case and all reports of any confirmed diagnosis following vaccination,” the drug maker said in a statement to Reuters. “Based on our Phase 3 safety and efficacy study, the vaccine provides some protection against COVID-19 within about 10 days of the first dose and substantially boosted after the second dose, supporting the need for a 2-dose vaccination series”, it said. “Individuals may have contracted disease prior to or right after vaccination”, the statement added. Matthew W., 45, a nurse at two different local hospitals, said in a Facebook post on December 18 that he had received the Pfizer vaccine, telling the ABC News affiliate that his arm was sore for a day but that he had suffered no other side-effects. Six days later on Christmas Eve, he became sick after working a shift in the COVID-19 unit, the report added. He got the chills and later came down with muscle aches and fatigue. He went to a drive-up hospital testing site and tested positive for COVID-19 the day after Christmas, the report said. Christian Ramers, an infectious disease specialist with Family Health Centers of San Diego, told the ABC News affiliate that this scenario was not unexpected. “We know from the vaccine clinical trials that it’s going to take about 10 to 14 days for you to start to develop protection from the vaccine,” Ramers said. “That first dose we think gives you somewhere around 50%, and you need that second dose to get up to 95%.”"

The Andean country, which has reported over 1.6 million cases of coronavirus and just under 43,000 deaths, had already secured deals with Pfizer and AstraZeneca Plc to provide 10 million doses each of their COVID-19 vaccines. Colombia will also receive an additional 20 million doses through the COVAX mechanism. “Today the agreement was signed for the acquisition of 9 million vaccines for 9 million citizens,” Duque said. While the earlier-secured vaccines require two doses per person, the J&J vaccines need just one, meaning the country has secured enough for around 29 million people, Duque said. More vaccine agreements will be finalized in the coming days, Duque added, allowing for the vaccination of 35 million people in the country. “According to experts, with those 35 million (vaccinated people), we will be coming closer towards herd immunity,” Duque said. Colombia will provide COVID-19 vaccines for free under its national vaccination plan, but is also preparing rules to allow people to purchase the vaccine privately, according to the health ministry. First in line for vaccination will be healthcare workers and those over 80 years old, followed by people aged between 60 and 79, and those whose chronic health conditions put them at greater risk of severe COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Fearing rising infection numbers over the holiday season, Colombian authorities have implemented measures such as banning sales of alcohol in bars and restaurants at night, as well as limiting when people can enter shops based on their national identity number."

-0.6455405355166344," Germany sees rapid EU approval of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany expects the European Union to give rapid approval to the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca that was cleared for use in Britain on Wednesday, its top vaccines official said. Berlin’s support for AstraZeneca comes as EU member countries seek to fill supply chains for vaccination drives that began last weekend using a shot from Pfizer and BioNTech - the only one to win EU approval so far. Germany has made relatively quick headway, saying 78,000 shots have been administered, but there have been reports of setbacks with some vaccination centres shutting down temporarily because of supply shortages. Responding to complaints in the capital Berlin and in the federal states of Brandenburg and Bavaria of delays in delivering the Pfizer vaccine, the Health Ministry said further shipments were due on Jan. 8 and Jan. 18. Fatalities linked to COVID-19 in Germany hit a record daily high of 1,129 on Wednesday, bringing total deaths to 32,107, as local authorities caught up with a Christmas reporting backlog. Total confirmed cases reached 1.69 million. The mass-selling Bild newspaper reported that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff had agreed during a video conference with regional leaders to extend a lockdown until Jan. 24 or 31. Merkel will finalise the date and details of the measures during talks with regional leaders in the new year. Klaus Cichutek, head of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, said that, thanks to the rolling EU review of the AstraZeneca vaccine, it would be possible to take a quick decision once a formal application was submitted. No such application had been received by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by Wednesday morning, Cichutek told reporters, but a debate in its councils would follow as soon as it arrived. “Once the application is submitted a decision can be taken quickly,” Cichutek told a news conference. “THOROUGH AND QUICK” German Health Minister Jens Spahn urged “a thorough and quick examination” of the AstraZeneca vaccine by EMA, in addition to the expected clearance of a shot from Moderna in early January. “Vaccination is the key to getting out of this pandemic,” Spahn told reporters. “Preventing death and suffering is key. It is the key to getting our normal lives back.” Spahn confirmed that Germany still expected to take delivery of 1.3 million doses of the Pfizer shot by the end of the year. Then, after the two consignments in January, weekly shipments of 670,000 doses would follow each Monday, his ministry said. Even with increased supply going into early 2021, it will take months to inoculate the wider population. “I can only appeal for patience,” he said. “Please don’t forget that we have a vaccine ... that is reason enough for joy and optimism.” Amid heightened contagion, continued strong reductions of social contacts would continue to be necessary, officials said. “It will take months until enough people are vaccinated to reduce the circulation of the virus in the population,” said Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute responsible for coordinating Germany’s pandemic response."
-0.6455405355166344," Shots first, questions later: Britain's new COVID-19 vaccine rollout approach LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday it would prioritise making sure that more people receive their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine quickly over giving a second shot to those who have already had one, a change in strategy as the country battles record numbers of new coronavirus cases. The decision will apply to the newly approved AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, as well as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, which was rolled out in Britain three weeks ago. The first recipients of the latter have just started receiving their booster shots. The British regulator approved AstraZeneca and Oxford’s vaccine on Wednesday, saying a gap of three months between shots could boost its efficacy. Developers of the vaccine have said that quick deployment will help reduce hospitalisations from COVID-19 as daily cases topped 50,000 for the first time on Tuesday. The dose interval for the Pfizer vaccine in Britain was changed from 21 days to “at least 21 days” on Wednesday, and for both vaccines, the second dose was advised to be given up to 12 weeks later. “This approach will maximise the benefits of both vaccines,” a health ministry spokesman said. “It will ensure that more at-risk people are able to get meaningful protection from a vaccine in the coming weeks and months, reducing deaths and starting to ease pressure on our NHS.” Pfizer, sounded more cautious on the prospect of shifting the schedule of the second dose of the vaccine, noting it had not been evaluated on different dosing schedules. “There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days,” it said in a statement, adding the implementation of alternative schedules should be closely monitored. “While decisions on alternative dosing regimens reside with health authorities, Pfizer believes it is critical... to ensure each recipient is afforded the maximum possible protection, which means immunisation with two doses of the vaccine.” Britain has said the new strategy still means everyone will receive a second dose within 12 weeks of the vaccine. AstraZeneca has said that the MHRA’s approval of a two-dose regime, with 4-12 weeks between the first and second dose, was the “best vaccination strategy” for the shot. [L8N2JA2FF] The government said it would also not recommend one vaccine over another for different cohorts of the population, even though data on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine’s efficacy in older people is currently limited. Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human medicines expert Working Group on COVID-19 vaccines, said only a small amount of data on efficacy in older people was available because of the way the trial was designed. “From the data that was available, there was indication that the vaccine was effective in older people as well,” he said. Oxford vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said more data would be made available, especially regarding efficacy in older adults, but that starting inoculations while some questions were unanswered was important. “We are in a pandemic situation,” she told Sky News. “The MHRA have determined that we have a safe vaccine, a highly effective vaccine, and the one that we need to start using now to control this pandemic.”"

-0.6455405355166344," 'Well into spring' before Italy sees significant impact of COVID vaccine, PM says ROME (Reuters) - Vaccines will start to have a clear impact on the spread of the coronavirus in Italy “well into spring” when 10-15 million people will have been inoculated, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday. Italy, the first Western country to be hit hard by the pandemic, has reported more than 73,000 COVID-related deaths since discovering its outbreak late in February, the highest death toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world. Italy kicked off its vaccination drive on Sunday with the first shots produced by Pfizer-BioNTech. The campaign will initially target health workers and the elderly, followed by people with chronic diseases. “It will be well into spring when we see a first significant impact,” Conte told reporters at the prime minister’s traditional end-year news conference. But he ruled out making the shots obligatory, contradicting some government members who had said this could be an option if insufficient numbers of people volunteer. “I am asking for a collective effort, let’s put aside ideology or emotions. Let’s vaccinate,” Conte said. The EU is due to receive its first 12.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by Jan. 1, with distribution of 200 million doses across its 27 member countries to be completed by September. Asked why Italy did not follow Germany’s example by procuring vaccine supply over and above its EU allotment, Conte said this was forbidden under the terms of the agreement overseen by the European Commission. There have been complaints in Italy among commentators and the political opposition that Germany - the EU’s largest member state and home to BioNTech - may be getting more than its fair share of shots. Most of the three-hour news conference was devoted to tensions in Conte’s ruling coalition in which former prime minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the tiny centrist party Italia Viva, constantly threatens to bring down the government. Renzi is unhappy with Conte’s plans for using money expected from the European Recovery Fund. Among numerous other complaints he is also upset about the government’s reluctance to ask for a loan from the euro zone’s bailout fund and wants Conte to give up control of Italy’s secret services. Conte warned that the bickering risked delaying Italy’s presentation of its Recovery Plan to the EU in order to access some 209 billion euros ($256.57 billion) from the Recovery Fund designed to help the bloc’s economies worst hit by the pandemic. “We cannot govern without the cohesion of the majority,” he said in an appeal for unity. “We can struggle on, but Italy needs more than a government that just struggles on.” ($1 = 0.8146 euros)"
-0.6455405355166344," Czechs approve squeezing extra dose from Pfizer vaccine vials PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic has allowed the squeezing of an extra dose from COVID-19 vaccine vials supplied by Pfizer and BioNTech, taking advantage of a reserve amount put into the vials by the maker, the Health Ministry said. Under standard rules, five doses can be drawn from each vial, but experts have said that, with the right needle and syringe, is possible to obtain a sixth or even seventh dose. Prime Minister Andrej Babis asked the European Commission earlier this week to allow use of the extra amount as European Union countries ramp up vaccination campaigns that began just after Christmas. Italian regulators have already approved the drawing of six doses, overriding guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the bloc as a whole. BioNTech said on Monday it was in discussion with regulators on whether a sixth dose could be approved. Responding, the EMA said it had asked the company to submit data showing that six doses can be reliably extracted. The EMA said it expected the company to submit a request for change in the coming days, which the responsible committee would assess rapidly. “If the (committee) finds that six doses can be extracted reliably, it will recommend a change to the current terms of the authorisation,” the EMA said. The vaccine, made by Pfizer of the United States and the German biotech startup BioNTech, is the only one so far with EU approval. The Czech Health Ministry said in a ruling dated Dec. 29 that, in divergence from the vaccine’s EU registration, it was temporarily allowing extraction of the extra dose, on condition that the regular volume of each dose was strictly observed. It said that the extra dose must be available in an individual vial, meaning that material from more that one vial cannot be mixed. The Czech Republic reported a record high 16,329 daily new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday. The central European country of 10.7 million has been one of the worst hit in recent months, with its total number of detected cases reaching 701,622, and 11,429 deaths."

Once front-runners in a global race to develop a vaccine, the AstraZeneca and University of Oxford partnership has been overtaken by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States. The following are details of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine effort. - Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine is a recombinant viral vector vaccine, meaning a virus is used as a means of delivering the vaccine. - It uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus that encodes instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate an immune response and prevent infection. - AstraZeneca has said the UK authorisation was for a two dose regime. - Two regimens are being tested: one in which recipients get two full doses, and another with half a dose followed by a full dose. - The half-dose first regimen was found to be 90% effective in a subset of trial subjects. The success rate was 62% with the originally planned two full doses, based on interim data. - In December, Oxford said the vaccine has a better immune response when a two full-dose regime is used, citing data from early trials. - Immune response could last at least a year. - The vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, and studies are under way to fully probe the impact of the mutation. - The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions for at least six months, making it logistically easier to transport than Pfizer’s vaccine. - AstraZeneca aims to supply millions of doses in the first quarter to Britain and is working with the UK government for first vaccinations to begin early in the new year. - Pricing in Britain is unknown so far. - Italy’s health ministry said in June the vaccine would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.80) per dose in Europe. - AstraZeneca has said it will be able to manufacture the vaccine at a few dollars per dose. - Pricing in Latin America is not expected to exceed $4 per dose. - Serum Institute of India has said it would price the vaccine at $3 per dose for India and other emerging economies. - Sources told Reuters it could cost $4 to $5 per dose in Bangladesh. - Costs in other regions have not yet been disclosed. - AstraZeneca has said it would not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic, but a report from the Financial Times in October showed the company can declare when it considers the pandemic to have ended in its deals for the vaccine. - AstraZeneca will look to profit from wealthier countries at the “appropriate time”. - Trials combining the vaccine with Russia’s Sputnik V will start by the end of the year, and Russia wants to jointly produce the new vaccine if it is proven to be effective. - Vastly divergent performance with different dose regimens has called for more clarity on the vaccine’s efficacy which averaged 70.4%, well below vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, but above the 50% threshold set by many regulators. - Serum Institute of India will continue to test a two full dose regimen of the vaccine. - AstraZeneca had to pause global trials on Sept. 6 after an unexplained illness in a participant. - Trial of the vaccine in the United States resumed in October after other countries had ended their pause. - AZD1222 produces an immune response in both old and young adults, and also led to lower adverse responses among the elderly, AstraZeneca said in October. - The vaccine also accurately follows genetic instructions programmed into it by its developers, according to an analysis by independent scientists. - Brazil said in October that a trial volunteer had died. - A source told Reuters the Brazilian trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, although the death was reported to be a suicide. - In July, data from early-stage trials published in The Lancet showed the vaccine was safe and produced an immune response. - The lead developer had said in July the vaccine could be rolled out by year-end, but the delivery and testing timeline has since been pushed back. - Data read-out submitted to regulators across the world to seek approval. - Experts have predicted a safe and effective vaccine could take 12-18 months to develop, even at the record speeds. - More than 3 billion doses are planned. - The company will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, and 700 million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021. - AstraZeneca is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and refrigerate it when the vaccine gets closer to approvals. - Even before studies showed any signs of efficacy, AstraZeneca had signed several supply and manufacturing deals around the world. - It also joined forces with IQVIA to speed up testing. - AstraZeneca has been granted protection from future liability claims related to the vaccine by most of the countries with which it has struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters in July."

So I am hopeful that this vaccine will do the same,” Marimuthu said in recorded remarks provided by the health ministry. Singapore is the first country in Asia to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It has also signed advance purchase agreements and made early down-payments on several other vaccine candidates, including those being developed by Moderna and Sinovac. It expects to have enough vaccine doses for all its 5.7 million people by the third quarter of 2021. “SAFE AND EFFECTIVE” Singapore hopes to complete vaccination coverage by the end of next year, health minister Gan Kim Yong said. “Our priority over the next few months is to ensure that the vaccines that we use are safe and effective, and we are able to roll out this programme to the whole population smoothly and in an orderly manner,” he said. Singapore acted swiftly after the first cases of the virus were reported, and although it was blindsided by tens of thousands of infections in migrant workers’ dormitories, it has reported only a few new local cases in recent months. In total, only 29 people in Singapore have died from COVID-19, one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. This has led some Singaporeans to question whether they need to take the jabs. While Gan acknowledged Singaporeans’ concerns over the unknowns of a new vaccine, he said it had met all safety and efficacy requirements based on current data and that the authorities would continue their monitoring. To show the vaccine is safe, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 68, said he and his colleagues would be among the first to get the shots. They will be free and voluntary, but the government is encouraging all medically eligible residents to take them. Wednesday’s vaccinations mark “a new chapter in our fight against the pandemic,” Lee said in a Facebook post. “The vaccine is key to living in a COVID-19 world, but it will still be some time before this storm will pass.”"

Mexico began importing vaccines from Pfizer last week and has inoculated 18,529 healthcare workers so far. It also has an agreement to buy vaccines from CanSino, once the vaccine is approved. The company was due to submit the vaccine for review last week. “We hope the evidence indicates that it’s a safe product,” Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a nightly news conference. “If that’s the case, we would have 2 million doses in January.” He said 9,000 people are participating in CanSino’s clinical trial in Mexico. Mexico on Tuesday reported 990 more deaths, one of the pandemic’s highest daily increases, bringing the death toll to 123,845. The country also registered another 12,099 infections, pushing the overall tally to 1,401,529. The government says the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases."

A senior Health Ministry official vowed to improve dialogue with Pfizer after it complained of an onerous emergency use application and reiterated that vaccinations could start as soon as Jan. 20. Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, has said he will not take any coronavirus vaccine whatsoever. The vaccines are seen as crucial to ending the pandemic in Brazil, home to the world’s second-deadliest outbreak after the United States. Yet basic details about the government’s vaccine plans remain sketchy, with regulators yet to approve the AstraZeneca shot Brazil has already bought, and China’s Sinovac vaccine struggling to produce late-stage data. The federal government waded into an awkward scrap with Pfizer, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States, over what the U.S. firm described as a surprisingly onerous procedure to apply for an emergency use authorization. In a news conference, Deputy Health Minister Elcio Franco defended the government, saying it was hamstrung by local laws which only allow it to sign vaccine purchase agreements once producers have emergency use authorizations or full authorizations. He vowed to seek a better dialogue with Pfizer, but said he could not force the company to apply for an emergency use authorizations or a full regulatory application. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He urged vaccine makers to apply for emergency use authorizations as soon as possible, adding that in a best case scenario, immunizations in Brazil could begin on Jan. 20. The scandal over Brazil’s slow vaccine rollout comes as the coronavirus roars back to life in Brazil. The country recorded 58,718 additional confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, along with 1,111 deaths, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday. It was the worst daily death toll reported by the ministry since September."

-0.08534548693477827," Germany says it needs third COVID vaccine to make inoculation universal BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany could offer shots against the coronavirus to all who want them by the summer if a third vaccine from either Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca or CureVac wins EU approval, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. Spahn was grilled during an interview broadcast live on the website of mass-selling Bild newspaper about media reports that Germany had so far only received four million doses of Pfizer Inc’s and BioNTech’s vaccine compared to five million shots secured by Israel, whose population is one-tenth of Germany’s. “We have not ordered insufficiently,” Spahn said. “We expect on the whole some 130 million doses from Moderna and BioNTech which will be enough to offer the vaccine to anyone wishing to be vaccinated.” Asked when Germany would be in a position to make the vaccine available to all those wishing to have it, Spahn said: “It depends if we get more approvals, meaning Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and CureVac. If one or two additional vaccines get approval, I think we will reach that point toward summer.” Germany at the weekend rolled out the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine developed by the German biotech company with its U.S. partner, starting in elderly care homes where death rates are highest. Europe’s biggest economy has been in a strict lockdown that is expected to be extended beyond Jan. 10 as it struggles to contain a second wave of infections. BioNTech/Pfizer is the only COVID-19 vaccine approved in the EU. Moderna has said it expects the EU, which has already secured about 160 million shots from the U.S.-based company, to approve its vaccine in mid-January. German biotech firm CureVac this month started a large Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of its vaccine candidate. J&J has said it has enrolled about 45,000 participants for the first late-stage trial of its single-dose vaccine candidate and that it expects interim data by late-January. A senior EU drugs regulator has said the bloc will most likely not be able to approve the vaccine developed by drug maker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in January. Spahn said if a third vaccine is approved in the EU, Germany would in theory be able to achieve herd immunity through inoculation next year."

Ireland had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe a few weeks ago, but its seven-day average has tripled over the past 14 days to 1,034 cases following an easing of public health measures ahead of Christmas. “The numbers are rising exponentially,” Health Minister Stephen Donnelly told RTE after cases increased to 1,546 cases from the previous record of 1,296 cases hit last Saturday. The vaccination of 79-year-old Annie Lynch at Dublin’s St James’s Hospital also made Tuesday “a day of hope” for the country, Donnelly said. Health staff and patients at three other hospitals were also vaccinated. Ireland brought forward the vaccine programme by a day following criticism it was acting too slowly after receiving the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Dec. 26, as part of a coordinated European Union-wide roll-out. The country plans to vaccinate all 75,000 people who live or work in nursing homes and tens of thousands of other health workers by the end of February, Donnelly said. A senior official said Ireland may be able to provide a COVID-19 vaccine to everyone in the country who wants one by August in a “fairly positive scenario” that would depend on the timing of approval of other vaccines. The government announced an emergency meeting on Wednesday to consider additional measures to try to control the surge, which has seen the number of people in hospital jumping to 409 on Tuesday from 234 a week ago. Officials announced new restrictions before Christmas, including closure of bars and restaurants and limits on travel, but it has not yet closed non-essential retail and is allowing some household visits until Thursday. A total of 88,439 have been infected in Ireland since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2,213 people have died as a result, the health ministry said. The British region of Northern Ireland also reported its highest-ever number of cases on Tuesday with 1,566."

The plan comes after some of the vaccine candidates ordered by the EU faced unexpected delays in clinical trials, forcing the bloc and other wealthy nations to rely on shots from fewer manufacturers than initially planned. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot, the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by Western drugs regulators, is being rolled out in countries including Britain and the United States. Under the EU contract, the two firms have committed to rapidly deliver 200 million doses after regulatory approval for 15.5 euros ($18.8) apiece, EU officials told Reuters in November. The extra 100 million doses would be supplied at the same price, but with the timetable to be negotiated, EU officials said. All 300 million doses are expected to be delivered in 2020 and 2021, Pfizer/BioNTech said in a statement on Tuesday. “The additional 100 million doses will be delivered in 2021, supporting the vaccination campaigns, which started two days ago in all 27 member states,” BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said. With a population of 450 million, the bloc is now relying on the 200 million Pfizer shots it has already ordered for its first vaccinations. In January, the EU is also expected to approve the shot developed by Moderna. It has an initial order of 80 million doses, with an option for 80 million more that will be exercised. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses per person. In total, the EU has booked nearly 1.3 billion vaccines in deals with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Sanofi/GSK and CureVac, and has options to buy another 660 million."

La información es falsa, aparentemente una broma, y Walmart la desmintió horas después. Algunas de las publicaciones que incluyen el comunicado pueden verse aquí here , aquí here y aquí here . La nota, elaborada en letras claras sobre un fondo del color azul eléctrico corporativo de Walmart, lleva el nombre de la compañía, su logo y el título de “Aviso importante”. “Cumpliendo con la directriz del Gobierno de México, en mutuo acuerdo con la compañía farmacéutica Pfizer, y atendiendo a las justas demandas de la ciudadanía que cuenta con los recursos para pagar, Walmart pone a disposición de la población mexicana la vacuna SARS coV-2 a partir del día lunes 28 de diciembre a un precio de $20 Dólares (400 pesos aproximadamente al tipo de cambio actual), en toda su cadena de supermercados de la república”, dice. El comunicado, que tiene una apariencia idéntica a cualquier otro comunicado de la filial mexicana de la firma de Estados Unidos, especificó que solo se ofrecería una vacuna por cliente y que el fármaco sería aplicado por personal capacitado de la empresa, manteniendo las reglas de seguridad sanitaria, como el uso de cubrebocas o la distancia reglamentaria para evitar el contagio del coronavirus. Por último, añadió que para “conservar la vacuna en condiciones óptimas de temperatura” la compañía había calibrado sus refrigeradores. “Nuestros clientes pueden hacer fila desde estos momentos en el área de salchichería, donde uno de nuestros asociados les atenderá”, agregó el texto, que concluyó con la leyenda “Vigencia: 28 de diciembre de 2020-hasta agotar existencias”. México recibió el 23 de diciembre el primer cargamento con las vacunas contra el COVID-19 y comenzó a aplicarlas en personal médico al día siguiente (aquí here y aquí here ). Como en otros países, la distribución de la vacuna está en manos de las autoridades, que han prometido inocularla de forma gratuita a los 130 millones de habitantes de la nación latinoamericana hasta marzo de 2022, empezando por los trabajadores sanitarios y prosiguiendo con los adultos mayores, para después suministrarla personas más jóvenes de forma escalonada, por franjas de edad. Sin embargo, a raíz de que en redes sociales algunos ciudadanos se quejaran de que no van a poder comprarla, sino esperar a que el Gobierno la distribuya, el domingo 27 de diciembre el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador dijo que no pondría obstáculos si empresas u hospitales privados deciden adquirir el producto en el mercado internacional y venderlo entre la población, algo poco probable por la enorme demanda global, los compromisos adquiridos por las farmacéuticas con los estados y el carácter de política pública que ha tomado la vacunación contra el COVID-19 en el planeta (aquí here ). La difusión del boletín se produce, además, en coincidencia con el Día de los Santos Inocentes, en el que es tradicional realizar bromas al prójimo contando noticias poco verosímiles. Sin embargo, el falso comunicado no incluyó ninguna aclaración al respecto. Es más, la posibilidad de que algunos lo consideraran real llevó a Walmart a difundir una nota pública desmintiendo la información. ""Aclaramos que es falsa la información difundida en redes sociales sobre el supuesto suministro de la vacuna contra el COVID-19 en nuestras unidades en México"", indicó la empresa, que hace unos días tuvo que desmentir también que hubiera dejado de vender productos en el área de juguetes de sus supermercados y grandes superficies en la Ciudad de México por la decisión de las autoridades de la capital de suspender actividades económicas no esenciales como parte de una estrategia de confinamiento social para frenar un repunte de los contagios del coronavirus, después de que algunos usuarios subieran a las redes sociales fotos con esas áreas precintadas en algunos establecimientos (aquí here y aquí here ).

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer’s vaccine is the first of several expected to reach the country as the government presses companies to honor delivery commitments on time amid concerns of delays due to a global scramble to secure supplies.

Experts say it is possible to obtain six doses from each vial, more than the five approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had raised the matter with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with a view to seeking EMA clearance for the extra shot as soon as possible.

Budi Gunadi Sadikin said a 50-million-dose deal with AstraZeneca would be finalised before the end of the year, and one of the same size with Pfizer in the first week of January. The first shots for both those drugs, which have gained regulatory approval in many western countries, are not scheduled to arrive for months, the minister told his first news conference. So Indonesia plans to start vaccinations with the Sinovac treatment, of which it secured 1.2 million doses this month and expects 1.8 million more in January, once it gains emergency use clearance. Interim results from its phase III trial are expected to be delivered to Indonesia’s Food and Drug Agency next month. Budi said the country’s 1.3 million front-line health workers would get priority in the first wave of vaccinations between January and April. “They are the most important group of people in our battle against the pandemic,” he told a news conference. The world’s fourth most populous country has had over 727,000 confirmed COVID cases and 21,700 deaths, among Asia’s highest tallies. Public servants will be next in line for shots, with those in infection “red-zones” aged between 18 and 59 prioritised in a second round of vaccinations. Indonesia is focusing its programme on that age range rather than the elderly in an effort to safeguard the working population. Bambang Heriyanto, corporate secretary of state-owned drugmaker Bio Farma, said that strategy would allow Indonesia to reach herd immunity. Including Tuesday’s announcement, Indonesia has secured 329 million vaccine doses, including about 125 million from Sinovac, 50 million from Novavax and 54 million from global vaccine programme COVAX. The AstraZeneca vaccines are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021 and Pfizer’s in the third quarter, according to a slide presentation by Budi. The companies were not immediately available for comment. The vaccine deals met with mixed reactions on the streets of the capital Jakarta on Tuesday. “There’s lots of diseases with no cure, but there’s already (a) cure for COVID,” said 25-year-old radio announcer Cindy Lauw, “I’m just wary.” Suhaimi, a 55-year-old retiree, said he would await trial results, and news about whether the vaccine was permitted under Islam. A December survey by Indonesian pollster Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting showed 37% of 1,202 respondents were willing to be vaccinated, while 40% would consider it and 17% would refuse. While acknowledging the essential role of vaccinations, epidemiologist Pandu Riono warned against over-reliance on them. “Vaccines are the second step in prevention, the first is behaviour and surveillance, testing, contact tracing and isolation,” he said."

A former World Bank economist, Sandu defeated the pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in last month’s presidential election, promising to fight endemic corruption and putting Moldova’s relations with the European Union back on track. The eastern European country of 3.5 million, where the West and Russia vie for influence, has been rocked in recent years by instability and corruption scandals, including the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system. Though Moldova rolled out a political and trade agreement with the EU in 2014, the EU has become increasingly critical over Moldova’s track record on reforms and fighting corruption. Iohannis never visited Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, during Dodon’s tenure. Romania has access to 10 million doses as part of the EU’s agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech, and began vaccinating frontline healthcare workers on Sunday. “The victory of Maia Sandu in the presidential elections is a victory of historic importance. My visit is taking place against the backdrop of a massive vote by Moldovan citizens for European values,” Iohannis told a televised briefing. Romania will also donate 6,000 tonnes of diesel fuel to Moldovan farmers hit by drought. “These days, a new stage begins in Moldova, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy. The stage of getting out of international isolation,” Sandu said, speaking alongside Iohannis, with both leaders wearing surgical masks. Moldova’s government, which was politically aligned with President Igor Dodon, resigned last week following Sandu’s election. Sandu is pushing to dissolve parliament to pave the way for a snap general election."

The financial hub of the United Arab Emirates began the first phase of the vaccination campaign last week, targeting “priority groups”, including those 60 and older, people with chronic medical conditions, those with disabilities and frontline workers. In contrast with the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi, which rolled out a vaccine made by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) to the general public, Dubai followed Saudi Arabia, which earlier this month became the first Arab country to use the Pfizer vaccine. “We are targeting to vaccinate approximately 70% of the population of Dubai by the end of 2021. We want to reach the herd immunity that is required,” Farida al-Khaja, chairwoman of Dubai’s steering committee for COVID-19 vaccinations, told Reuters. Khaja said a second phase would kick off in April and would be open to all citizens and residents. Dubai, which in 2019 had a population of over 3.3 million, has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, which hurt its key tourism, real estate and trade sectors. The UAE’s health ministry has registered the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for emergency use, but none of the other emirates has so far announced plans to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for which data has shown 95% efficacy. Asked about coordination between the UAE’s seven emirates, Khaja said: “There is a (national) vaccination campaign in the UAE and all the emirates are covering their vaccine programmes.” The UAE was the first country outside China to roll out the Sinopharm vaccine to the public and said earlier this month it had 86% efficacy, citing a review of an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials. Its phase III clinical trials in the UAE included 31,000 volunteers from 125 nationalities. Neither the UAE nor Sinopharm has released detailed data from the study. The UAE announcement did not say what, if any, side effects it identified, how many participants have become ill or how many volunteers were given the vaccine or a placebo. The Sinopharm vaccine is now available to anyone living in the UAE who wishes to receive it, including at a field hospital in Dubai set up by the federal government. Emaad Alvi, a senior at Cornell University who is also a resident of Dubai, received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. “The reason I chose to get the vaccine ASAP is because I’m asthmatic and I have trust in the doctors and I think the vaccine should be fine,” he said."

0.538776982238943," German vaccination campaign overshadowed by mishaps FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign has been overshadowed by an overdose mishap in the north and problems with the transportation of the vaccine in the south which lead to 1,000 shots being sent back. Some districts in Bavaria said on Monday they would not use the shots received over the weekend on concerns the vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech may have become too warm during their delivery in household cool boxes, a spokesman for the Lichtenfels district said. “There were doubts as to whether the cold chain was maintained at all times,” Lichtenfels District Administrator Christian Meissner told Reuters TV. The vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially designed cool boxes filled with dry ice. Once out of ultra-low temperature storage, the vaccine must be kept at 2C to 8C to remain effective for up to five days. The cool boxes designed by Pfizer are fitted with GPS trackers so the companies can deal with potential storage issues en route. While BioNTech takes responsibility for the transport to the deep freezer hubs, local authorities are tasked with providing safe and cooled transport to the individual vaccination centres. The vaccines arrived in Lichtenfels and six other northern Bavarian districts on Saturday in cool boxes of the type used for picnics or camping trips. The temperature loggers in some cases showed interim temperatures of up to 15C. “BioNTech commented and said that the vaccine was probably okay, but probably okay is not enough,” Meissner said, adding that the shots would not be used to prevent damage to the public’s trust in the vaccination campaign. According to the government of Upper Franconia, where the districts are based, BioNTech had told it: “Based on of the facts presented by you in your email of 12-27-2020 at 19.52 and internal stability data we do not see any influence of the described transport deviation on the quality of the vaccine shots concerned.” BioNTech declined to comment. After consulting with the Bavarian Health Ministry, the districts decided not to use the 1,000 shots earmarked for use in Lichtenfels as well as Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel, also in northern Bavaria, the Lichtenfels spokesman said. Local medical staff had said that they would not feel comfortable using the shots, he said, adding that a new batch of vaccine shots arrived on Monday perfectly cooled and that the vaccination campaign started one day late. Elsewhere in Germany, in the Vorpommern-Ruegen district, authorities said eight workers in an elderly care home in Stralsund city received five times the recommended dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine on Sunday. Four went to hospital for observation after developing flu-like symptoms. “I deeply regret the incident. This individual case is due to individual errors. I hope that all those affected do not experience any serious side-effects,” district chief Stefan Kerth said in a statement. Vorpommern-Ruegen authorities pointed to previous statements by BioNTech saying larger doses were tested in the Phase I study without serious consequences. BioNTech pointed to the vaccine’s package insert, which says that in the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended."
0.538776982238943," EU's marathon COVID vaccination drive off to uneven start BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The EU’s campaign to vaccinate Europeans against COVID-19 has got off to an uneven start in what will be a marathon effort to administer shots to enough of the bloc’s 450 million people to defeat the viral pandemic. In one mishap, eight workers at a care home in Stralsund on the north German coast were injected with five times the recommended dose of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Four were hospitalised. “I deeply regret the incident. This individual case is due to individual errors. I hope that all those affected do not experience any serious side effects,” district chief Stefan Kerth said on Monday. In southern Germany, officials had to send back about 1,000 doses after finding they had been transported in cool boxes typically used for picnics or camping trips that failed to keep the vaccine cold enough. The EU vaccination drive kicked off at the weekend, with health workers and residents of care homes across the bloc among the first to get the shots from Pfizer, which must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. In Italy, meanwhile, some politicians complained that Germany - the EU’s largest member state and home to BioNTech - may be getting more than its fair share of shots. The EU is due to receive its first 12.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by New Year’s Day, with distribution of 200 million doses across its 27 member countries to be completed by next September.

Talks are under way to agree on the delivery of an optional further 100 million doses under the contract sealed with the two companies, the EU said. The initial glitches highlight the challenge in rolling out the vaccine while regulators consider approving other vaccines, including from Moderna and AstraZeneca, which are easier to transport and store. The rollout of the Pfizer shot in the United States has been slow, putting the government’s target of 20 million vaccinations this month in doubt, as hospitals navigate preparing the previously frozen shots for use, finding staff to run clinics and ensuring proper social distancing. As well as being the first COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered across the EU, the Pfizer shot is particularly tricky to handle.

Hamad Hassan told Reuters two weeks ago the country was about to sign a deal for supplies and that the first batch would arrive eight weeks later. “We have reserved about 2 million doses of the vaccine and that will be enough for 20% of Lebanese living in the country,” he said at the presidential palace on Monday. Lebanon’s hospitals are under pressure as infections surge. Doctors warn ICU beds are filling up fast. The medical system has also been battered by the country’s financial crisis, which caused supply shortages, and August’s port explosion, which damaged major Beirut hospitals. The COVID-19 outbreak has killed nearly 1,400 people in Lebanon, which has an estimated population of 6 million including more than 1 million Syrian refugees.

-0.47703588153561644," Cold chain doubts delay COVID-19 vaccinations in some German cities FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany’s coronavirus vaccination campaign faced delays in several cities on Sunday after temperature trackers showed that about 1,000 of the shots made by BioNTech and Pfizer may not have been kept cold enough during transit. “When reading the temperature loggers that were enclosed in the cool boxes, doubts arose about the compliance with the cold chain requirements,” the district of Lichtenfels in the north of Germany’s largest state, Bavaria, said in a statement. Medical staff found that the temperature in one vaccine transport cool box had risen to 15 degrees Celsius, a spokesman for Lichtenfels said, above the maximum of 8C stipulated by the manufacturers. He added that his district had not received advice from BioNtech yet on how to proceed. The regional government of Bavaria’s Upper Franconia region where several affected districts are based said that BioNTech cleared the vaccines late on Sunday. “BioNTech has confirmed the quality of the vaccine shots,” a spokeswoman for Upper Franconia said. “The vaccination programme can start (in our region).” BioNtech had earlier said in a statement it was responsible for the shipment to the 25 German distribution centres and that the federal states and local authorities were responsible for the shipment to the vaccination centres and the mobile vaccination teams. “This is where the variations in temperature occurred. We are in contact with many authorities to provide advice, however it is up to them how to proceed”, a BioNTech spokeswoman said. In a December presentation, BioNtech had said that once removed from the freezer, the vaccine can be stored for up to five days at 2-8C and up to two hours at temperatures up to 30C, prior to use. The vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112°F) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially designed cool boxes filled with dry ice. Once out of ultra-low temperature storage, the vaccine must be kept at 2C to 8C to remain effective for up to five days. The cool boxes designed by Pfizer are fitted with GPS trackers so the companies can deal with potential storage issues en route. The spokesman for Lichtenfels said 1,000 shots had been affected by the temperature issue and that the city and the districts of Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel in northern Bavaria were waiting to hear from BioNTech about whether the vaccine could still be used. “Vaccination against the coronavirus is not about who vaccinates the fastest or who does the most doses. Safety and conscientious work for the benefit of the population have the highest priority,” said Oliver Baer, district administrator in Hof. The European Union launched a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive on Sunday with pensioners and medics lining up to get the first shots to see off a pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide. The delays in Germany highlight the challenge in rolling out the vaccine while regulators review for approval other shots, including those made by Moderna and AstraZeneca, which are easier to transport and store. The roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine in the United States has been slow putting the government’s target of 20 million vaccinations this month in doubt, as hospitals have navigated preparing the previously frozen shots for use, finding staff to run clinics and ensuring proper social distancing. In Germany, similar temperature issues also delayed the start of the vaccination campaign in the southern Bavarian districts of Augsburg and Dillingen, where staff eventually got clearance from BioNTech to use the shots. Germany’s vaccination campaign officially kicked off on Sunday with residents of elderly care homes being inoculated. The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million doses to local health authorities by the end of this year and about 700,000 per week from January."

Three health workers at the Rome Spallanzani hospital were inoculated shortly before 0700 GMT with the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, a statement by the commissioner for the epidemic Domenico Arcuri said. “The vaccine went very well and it was an exciting, historical moment,” 29-year-old nurse Claudia Alivernini told state-owned television RAINEWS24. “It is the beginning of the end and I hope to be the first of over 60 millions of Italians”. Italy on Thursday became the eighth country in the world to exceed 2 million officially recorded cases. It has reported 70,909 deaths, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth highest in the world. The vaccine will be free of charge and health workers and elderly people will be the first to be offered the voluntary inoculation. Hungary and Slovakia began their vaccination campaigns on Saturday with other European Union countries joining Italy in rolling out the shots from Sunday, as the pandemic surges across the continent. Around 9,750 doses have already arrived in Italy and another 470,000 are expected to arrive from next week, the health ministry said. “Today is a symbolic day which must give the idea of the beauty of Europe that has bought the vaccines for everybody and distributed them,” Commissioner Arcuri said. To aid the roll out of the vaccine, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will pop up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring.

-0.47703588153561644," 'We have a new weapon': Europe rolls out vaccines in bid to slay COVID MADRID/ROME (Reuters) - Europe launched a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive on Sunday with pensioners and medics lining up to get the first shots to see off a pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide. “Thank God,” 96-year-old Araceli Hidalgo said as she became the first person in Spain to have a vaccine at her care home in Guadalajara, near the capital Madrid. “Let’s see if we can make this virus go away.” In Italy, the first country in Europe to record significant numbers of infections, 29-year-old nurse Claudia Alivernini was one of three medical staff at the head of the queue for the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. “It is the beginning of the end ... it was an exciting, historic moment,” she said at Rome’s Spallanzani hospital. The region of 450 million people is trying to catch up with the United States and Britain, which have already started vaccinations using the Pfizer shot. The European Union is due to receive 12.5 million doses by the end of the year, enough to vaccinate 6.25 million people based on the two-dose regimen. The companies are scrambling to meet global demand and aim to make 1.3 billion shots next year. The bloc has secured contracts with a range of drugmakers besides Pfizer, including Moderna and AstraZeneca, for a total of more than two billion vaccine doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated during 2021. With surveys pointing to high levels of hesitancy towards the vaccine in countries from France to Poland, leaders of the 27-country European Union are promoting it as the best chance of getting back to something like normal life next year. “We have a new weapon against the virus: the vaccine. We must stand firm, once more,” tweeted French President Emmanuel Macron, who tested positive for the coronavirus this month and left quarantine on Christmas Eve. “Completely painless,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos said after getting his vaccination in a hospital in Athens. The distribution of the shot presents tough challenges as the vaccine uses new mRNA technology and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112°F). In Germany, the campaign faced delays in several cities after a temperature tracker showed that about 1,000 shots may not have been kept cold enough during transit. BioNTech said it had responded to queries from German districts on whether the shots could still be used but declined to specify what it had told them. Pfizer referred Reuters to its German partner for comment. The Pfizer shots being used in Europe were shipped from its factory in Puurs, Belgium, in specially designed containers filled with dry ice. They can be stored for up to six months at Antarctic winter temperatures, or for five days at 2C to 8C, a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals. In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers - a symbol of spring - sprouted in town squares as the vaccination drive kicked off. Portugal has been establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. At the Santa Maria hospital in Portugal’s capital Lisbon, Pedro Pires waited for a shot with other nurses at the end of an overnight shift. “It has been tiring ... a lot of work,” he told Reuters. Branka Anicic, an 81-year-old resident of a care home in Zagreb, became the first person to get a shot in Croatia. “I’m happy I will now be able to see my great-grandchildren,” she said. “It will change the lives of everyone in the world,” said an elderly passerby in Paris who gave her name as Anaik. German pilot Samy Kramer celebrated the vaccination campaign by tracing out a giant syringe in the sky. He flew 200 km (125 miles), following a syringe-shaped route that showed up on internet site flightradar24. ‘FIRST MAN ON THE MOON’ The vaccination drive is all the more urgent because of the concern around new variants of the virus linked to a rapid expansion of cases in Britain and South Africa. “We know that the pandemic won’t just disappear as of today, but the vaccine is the beginning of the victory over the pandemic, the vaccine is a ‘game changer’. We have always know that, and today is the first day of this new phase,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Over the past week, cases of the UK variant have been detected in Australia, Hong Kong and in several European countries, mostly recently Sweden, France, Norway and Portugal’s island of Madeira. So far, scientists say there is no evidence to suggest the vaccines developed will be any less effective against the new variants. While Europe has some of the best-resourced healthcare systems in the world, the sheer scale of the effort means some countries are calling on retired medics to help while others have loosened rules for who is allowed to give the injections. Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres left vacant by lockdown restrictions will become venues for mass inoculations. Vaccinations also started in Norway, which is not a member of the bloc but part of the EU’s drive. “I feel like a historical figure ... almost like the first man on the Moon,” said care home resident Svein Andersen, 67, as he received the country’s first shot in the capital Oslo. After European governments were criticised for failing to work together to counter the spread of the virus in early 2020, the goal this time is to ensure that there is equal access to the vaccines across the region. But even then, Hungary on Saturday jumped the gun on the official roll-out by administering shots to frontline workers at hospitals in the capital Budapest. The Netherlands said it will not start vaccinating until Jan. 8. Slovakia also went ahead with some inoculations of healthcare staff on Saturday and in Germany, a small number of people at a care home were inoculated a day early too. “We don’t want to waste that one day that the vaccine loses shelf life,” Karsten Fischer, from the pandemic staff of the Harz district in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, told broadcaster MDR."

Similar problems also delayed the vaccination campaign in the southern Bavarian city of Augsburg, daily Merkur reported. Germany's vaccination campaign officially kicked off on Sunday with residents of elderly care homes being inoculated. The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million doses to local health authorities by the end of this year and about 700,000 per week from January. Vaccinations will be free and available to everyone from mid-2021 once the priority groups are expected to have finished being inoculated. ""This makes us proud and above all confident that we can overcome this pandemic - because vaccinating paves our way out of the crisis,"" Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a tweet."

-3.251842947747875," 'Best gift in 2020': COVID-19 vaccinations begin in Latin America MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico on Thursday inoculated its first person against COVID-19 to kick off a fightback from a pandemic that has killed 120,000 people in the country and battered the economy, celebrating a Christmas roll-out that also began elsewhere in Latin America. In a ceremony broadcast on national media and watched by the president, officials directed the administration of the Pfizer vaccine to 59-year-old nurse Maria Irene Ramirez, head nurse at the intensive care unit of Mexico City’s Ruben Lenero hospital. “This is the best gift that I could have received in 2020,” said Ramirez, adding that it would give her strength to continue the “war” against the pandemic. Afterwards, the government broadcast the vaccine being given to medical personnel in other parts of Mexico. Pfizer’s is the first COVID-19 vaccine to reach Mexico, which has also signed deals for vaccines from other firms. Chile received the first 10,000 doses of a 10-million order of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine on Thursday, with inoculations of health workers due to begin immediately. In Costa Rica, health workers administered the first doses of Pfizer vaccine to a pair of senior citizens in a home near the capital San Jose, while some 300,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine arrived in Argentina. “My message is that everyone should be vaccinated,” said Jorge De Ford, a 72-year-old former university professor who was one of the first two in Costa Rica to get the injection. No COVID-19 vaccine has been approved yet for use in Brazil, Latin America’s most populous country. In Mexico, the first Pfizer shipment arrived on Wednesday containing only 3,000 doses of the vaccine. The next one will contain 50,000 doses, with Mexico slated to receive 1.4 million units of the two-shot Pfizer vaccine by Jan. 31. “And thus begins the road to the end of the pandemic,” Martha Delgado, a deputy foreign minister tasked with securing vaccine supplies for Mexico, said on Twitter. The vaccine roll-out is expected to last months and will initially prioritize Mexican medical staff. A September report by Amnesty International found Mexico had lost more healthcare workers to the virus than any other country. Mexican infections and deaths are surging, putting hospitals under immense strain, and prompting fresh lockdowns in Mexico City and its urban sprawl last week. A Stanford University-Mexico CIDE research group study found Mexico City could breach its hospital capacity in late December and peak in late January. Over 1.35 million cases and 120,300 coronavirus deaths have been reported in Mexico, which has the fourth-highest official death toll from COVID-19 worldwide. The government acknowledges that the real figures are likely significantly higher."

EU member countries including Germany, France, Austria and Italy plan to start vaccinations from Dec. 27 as Europe tries to catch up with the United States and Britain, where inoculations began earlier this month. The vaccine won regulatory clearance for use on people over 16 years old from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Monday. The regulator in Switzerland, which is not an EU member, approved the vaccine at the weekend. Following are plans for the European rollout: The Swiss started selected vaccinations of especially vulnerable people on Dec. 23, as the Swiss military distributed the first instalment of 107,000 shots.

-3.4145691710253443," South Korea to import J&J, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for 16 million people SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has signed deals with Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen to import coronavirus vaccines to cover up to 16 million people, as it grapples with the third wave of the pandemic, the prime minister said on Thursday. The government has faced growing public pressure over their COVID-19 vaccine procurement plans as the country reported its second-highest daily tally of cases on Wednesday. Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, will be enough to cover 10 million people and its shipment is expected in the third quarter of 2021. “We are mobilising the entire national capabilities to bring in the shipments within the second quarter,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a televised briefing. “The negotiation is underway.” Chung said the doses from Janssen - J&J’s pharmaceuticals division - were added from the initial amount for 4 million people to 6 million and will be ready for inoculation from the second quarter. The Pfizer and Janssen deals are part of a government plan to buy enough doses from four drugmakers and the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization, that will allow immunisation of at least 85% of South Korea’s population of 52 million. The government had already signed a deal with AstraZeneca Plc, which will be shipped as early as January next year, and is in final talks with Moderna Inc to sign a deal in January to secure 20 million doses. Health authorities will start a public vaccination programme as early as February next year, which will be completed around November, before the start of the flu season, Yang Dong-gyo, a senior official at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), told a briefing. The government had allocated an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year’s budget for vaccines. The KDCA reported 985 new coronavirus cases as of Wednesday midnight, bringing the nation’s tally to 53,533, with 756 deaths. South Korea has ramped up testing to more than 55,000 people a day, compared with roughly 16,000 a day in September, to track down cases from unknown origin and asymptomatic cases. Authorities have shut down all ski resorts and winter tourist spots and banned gatherings of more than four in a bid to stop the spread during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

-3.4145691710253443," Millions of U.S. vaccine doses sit on ice, putting 2020 goal in doubt (Reuters) -Millions of COVID-19 vaccines are sitting unused in U.S. hospitals and elsewhere a week into the massive inoculation campaign, putting the government’s target for 20 million vaccinations this month in doubt. As of Wednesday morning, only 1 million shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been given, about one-third of the first shipment sent last week. Over 9.5 million doses of vaccines, including Moderna’s, have now been sent to states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While hospitals have started giving out Moderna’s vaccine, the CDC has not yet reported that data and there may be a lag in reporting shots given of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The slow pace has barely picked up from the first week when 614,000 shots were given although nearly 2.9 million were shipped. Hospitals said the first COVID-19 vaccinations started slowly last Monday as they navigated preparing the previously frozen shots for use, finding employees to run the vaccination clinics, and ensuring proper social distancing both before and after vaccination. Some said they did only about 100 shots the first day. They were contending with a COVID-19 surge, as cases around the United States surpassed 18 million with 323,000 deaths. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) The Trump administration promised to vaccinate 20 million by the end of the year while providing little funding to achieve the goal. That’s nine days to give out nearly 19 million shots or over 2 million people vaccinated a day including on Christmas Day. Almost 5.9 million doses of Moderna Inc’s vaccine should go out this week and an additional 2 million doses from Pfizer and partner BioNTech. “The commitment that we can make is to make vaccine doses available,” U.S. Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said on a Wednesday press call. He noted the rate of people getting a shot in their arm is “slower than we thought it would be.” Two more vaccines may be approved in February from Johnson & Johnson Inc and AstraZeneca Plc. The government’s goal is 100 million Pfizer and Moderna shots in arms by March 1. Operation Warp Speed’s General Gustave Perna, who is leading the vaccine distribution effort, on Monday said that the CDC data reflects a reporting lag and that the number of vaccinations will catch up as time goes on. The CDC said its data may also reflect a lag between vaccine dosing and state reporting. Most nursing home vaccinations only began in mass this week, and the CDC data does not specify how many doses from the first shipment were being held by states for that group. Margaret Mary Health, a 25-bed rural hospital in Indiana, built a drive-thru vaccination clinic at a local fire station and one at a local recreation center to vaccinate healthcare workers in the surrounding counties, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Putnam. Putnam, who has done traffic control at the clinic’s drive-thru, said they have used about 400 of 1,100 doses received. “We’re asking for volunteers from our staff, volunteers from the local community college to step in and build this process from the ground up,” he said. Some of the largest U.S. hospitals inoculated more than 1,000 people per day, having done dry runs of the vaccine delivery and rollout. Vermont, Delaware and Idaho were among states that confirmed their states had given only thousands of doses - a fraction of those available to them - during the first week. Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at Yale School of Public Health, described the initial tally as “discouraging” and said “the challenges of getting vaccines out as quickly as we’re able to manufacture them will only grow.” Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine could speed deployment because it requires a conventional refrigerator and has no specialized procedures to thaw out and administer, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association for Immunization Managers trade group. AstraZeneca’s two dose vaccine also can be stored in a refrigerator. “When it’s refrigerator-stable and a one-dose regimen, it can’t get any easier than that,” Hannan said. Dr. Saul Weingart, the chief medical officer of Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said the hospital had given about 750 doses of the around 3,000 available as of Friday. It started with 100 shots per day and worked up to about 450, he said. He said experts at the hospital modeled that giving Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine would take 10 minutes, about two to three times as long as a flu shot, due to the procedures needed because the vaccine is stored in a deep freeze. Patients need to socially distance before and after being given the vaccine and be monitored for allergic reactions. The United States gives 170 million flu vaccinations each year within a few months, but for the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States must give about three times that number of shots - the Pfizer and Moderna shots are two doses - to reach most Americans by July. At its current pace, the U.S. appears to have the capacity to administer less than a third of the shots that are shipped in a given week, underscoring the gap. A spokesperson for Houston Methodist, a hospital in Houston, Texas, said it had given 8,300 employees the vaccine as of Monday with about 7,000 doses left from the first shipment. The University of Southern California’s Keck Medicine medical school has vaccinated over 3,000 employees and said it will take six weeks for everyone, similar to its flu vaccination schedule. States and health departments need federal money to hire staff, from data center workers to track inoculations to call center employees to field questions, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. The U.S. Congress’s current coronavirus aid package sets aside more than $8 billion for vaccine distribution but is delayed. “You can’t hire someone in December and train them up if you don’t know you can pay them in January,” Casalotti said."

-4.528123402467468," Mexico to start COVID vaccinations as virus stretches hospitals MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico plans to begin inoculating health workers against COVID-19 on Thursday with the arrival of the first vaccines, as the government battles a sharp surge in infections that has pushed hospitals to their limits. Vaccinations will begin at hospitals in Mexico City and the northern city of Saltillo, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday before the first Pfizer vaccines were flown into the capital from Belgium. “It’s true that we still face a tremendous pandemic, but today is the beginning of the end,” Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told a news conference at Mexico City’s airport. Still, the first shipment only contained 3,000 doses of the vaccine. The next one will contain 50,000 doses, with Mexico slated to receive 1.4 million units of the two-shot Pfizer vaccine by Jan. 31, the foreign ministry said. By contrast, Costa Rica said it would receive its first 9,750 doses of Pfizer’s vaccine on Wednesday night. Lopez Obrador said he wanted the vaccine to be used in additional areas as officials seek to reach workers at nearly 1,000 hospitals treating coronavirus patients nationwide. Senior citizens and people with chronic illnesses would be next. Pfizer’s is the first COVID-19 vaccine to reach Mexico, which has also signed deals for vaccines from other firms. With hospital bed occupancy rates surging, Mexico has put the heavily populated capital and two states into semi-lockdowns to try to prevent the virus spreading more, while urging residents to avoid holiday gatherings and socializing. A Stanford University-Mexico CIDE research group study found Mexico City could breach its hospital capacity in late December and peak in late January. Last weekend, the Mexico City government sent out a text message saying hospitals were “at the limit.” Mexico has recorded nearly 1.4 million cases and 119,495 deaths from COVID-19, the fourth highest death toll worldwide. In Mexico City’s bustling center, banners warned “you are in a high infection area” while a message on loudspeakers urged the public to wear masks and avoid parties. “The only thing is for us all to be well and get through this year,” street vendor Ricardo Flores said of his family. “There won’t be any Christmas dinner, there won’t be any gifts.” Gerardo Reyes, an accountant, explained that he had taken precautions to allow his family to celebrate together. “We all got tested to be sure we won’t have any problems,” he said. Others, especially in Mexico City’s vast informal economy, just hope to scrape by as tighter health restrictions bite. Street food seller Fidelina Esperon fretted her livelihood could be about to dry up. “The little I had saved, I’ve already spent it all,” she said."

-4.528123402467468," Pfizer, U.S. strike 100 million COVID-19 vaccine deal with 70 million due by June (Reuters) - The U.S. government will pay Pfizer Inc nearly $2 billion for 100 million additional doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to bolster its supply as the country grapples with a nationwide spike in infections. Under the new agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30 and the rest no later than July 31, the company said on Wednesday, bringing the total number of doses to 200 million for a total price of about $4 billion. The purchase price amounts to $19.50 per shot and is slightly higher than the $18.90 per dose that Reuters has reported the European Union has agreed to pay. The shot has been authorized for use in EU and the United States. The U.S. deal comes after growing concern that the government had not done enough to secure doses of one of the two authorized vaccines, made more pressing amid a COVID-19 surge that has left hospitals struggling to find beds for the sick. Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, is being rolled out across the United States after the shot won emergency use authorization earlier this month. The country has also authorized a vaccine from Moderna Inc. Pfizer and the government have said that they had been negotiating the terms of the agreement, with the company indicating it was trying to work out how to deliver the doses in the second quarter. Pfizer and BioNTech have said they expect to produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, but executives at the German biotech have said they were trying to boost manufacturing. Governments around the world are scrambling to get enough supplies of the vaccine to tame the pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people globally and crushed economies. “This new federal purchase can give Americans even more confidence that we will have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 2021,” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. “Securing more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech for delivery in the second quarter of 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio.” Pfizer said last week it may need the U.S. government to help it secure some components needed to make the vaccine. While the company halved its 2020 production target due to manufacturing issues, it said last week its manufacturing is running smoothly now. The government also has the option to acquire up to an additional 400 million doses of the vaccine. More than 600,000 Americans have received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The first wave of shots have so far gone to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, as well as some top government officials. Americans in “essential” jobs and those over 75 will likely start to receive vaccines in January while general population vaccinations will start in a few months."
-4.528123402467468," Dubai to begin inoculations with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from Wednesday DUBAI (Reuters) -Dubai will start inoculating people with the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech for free from Wednesday, the government said, joining Saudi Arabia which last week became the first Arab country to begin using this vaccine. The move comes after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain earlier this month rolled out a vaccine by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) to the general public. The UAE’s Ministry of Health and Prevention registered the Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine for emergency use on the request of Pfizer, state news agency WAM reported, citing the ministry. The UAE was the first country outside China to roll out the Chinese vaccine to the public, saying earlier this month it had 86% efficacy, citing an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials. China has included two candidate vaccines from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd in an emergency-use programme launched in July, targeting specific high-infection risk groups such as medical workers and border inspectors. Dubai’s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management said on Twitter late Tuesday an “extensive vaccination campaign” against COVID-19 would kick off on Wednesday using Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine. A message on Dubai Health Authority’s (DHA) hotline said the first phase of the COVID-19 vaccine would be for citizens and Dubai residents 60 years and above, and for individuals with chronic illness over the age of 18. The second category would comprise front-line staff in public and private sectors, third would be vital-sector workers, and finally, the general public, WAM cited DHA as saying. Dubai, the financial hub of the UAE, has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, which hurt its key tourism, real estate and trade sectors. S&P Global warned earlier this year Dubai’s economy was set to shrink 11% in 2020, almost four times the drop in GDP experienced during the global financial crisis in 2009. Qatar has also granted emergency use authorisation for the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, while Oman will receive its first shipment of the same vaccine on Wednesday. Qatar started the free vaccination drive on Wednesday, Qatari media reported. Kuwait received 150,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday and expects to receive about 450,000 doses of it in the first quarter, Ghada Ibrahim, head of public relations at the ministry health, said in a video on Twitter. UAE has recorded 195,878 coronavirus cases and 642 deaths so far from the virus."

Lucerne and the rural canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden were first among Switzerland’s 26 cantons to begin inoculations after regulators approved the vaccine from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech on Saturday. Initial vaccine doses will go to cantons to inoculate vulnerable people, including those aged over 75 and people with medical conditions. “Residents of nursing and care homes will be first to get vaccines,” Lucerne said on Wednesday, adding it hopes to have the general population vaccinated by late 2021. While COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in record time, production lags demand, with shots seen in short supply for months as a second infection wave disrupts normal life. The woman in Lucerne who received the shot lives in a care home. Her name was not released. Switzerland’s decentralised system of government has left it up to its cantons to develop individual plans to vaccinate the nation of 8.6 million people, though the military is helping with logistics.

Under the new agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30 and the rest no later than July 31, the company said on Wednesday, bringing the total number of doses to 200 million for a total price of about $4 billion. The purchase price amounts to $19.50 per shot and is slightly higher than the $18.90 per dose that Reuters has reported the European Union has agreed to pay. The shot has been authorized for use in EU and the United States. read more The U.S. deal comes after growing concern that the government had not done enough to secure doses of one of the two authorized vaccines, made more pressing amid a COVID-19 surge that has left hospitals struggling to find beds for the sick. read more Pfizer's two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech , is being rolled out across the United States after the shot won emergency use authorization earlier this month. The country has also authorized a vaccine from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O). Pfizer and the government have said that they had been negotiating the terms of the agreement, with the company indicating it was trying to work out how to deliver the doses in the second quarter. Pfizer and BioNTech have said they expect to produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, but executives at the German biotech have said they were trying to boost manufacturing. Governments around the world are scrambling to get enough supplies of the vaccine to tame the pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people globally and crushed economies. ""This new federal purchase can give Americans even more confidence that we will have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 2021,"" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. ""Securing more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech for delivery in the second quarter of 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio."" Pfizer said last week it may need the U.S. government to help it secure some components needed to make the vaccine. While the company halved its 2020 production target due to manufacturing issues, it said last week its manufacturing is running smoothly now. The government also has the option to acquire up to an additional 400 million doses of the vaccine. More than 600,000 Americans have received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The first wave of shots have so far gone to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, as well as some top government officials. Americans in ""essential"" jobs and those over 75 will likely start to receive vaccines in January while general population vaccinations will start in a few months."
-4.528123402467468," Swiss start rolling out COVID-19 vaccine, elderly first in queue ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland got its first doses of COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, paving the way for jabs to begin just as the country imposes a month-long clampdown on public life in an attempt to curb stubbornly high infection rates, health officials said. Switzerland’s drugs regulator authorised use of jabs from Pfizer and partner BioNTech on Saturday in what officials called the world’s first such approval under a standard procedure. An initial batch of 107,000 doses will go to individual cantons to start inoculating vulnerable people, including those over 75 at first and those with medical conditions. “In the next seven days the first targeted vaccination programmes can start,” federal health agency official Virginie Masserey told a news conference in Bern. Unlike a high-profile vaccine rollout in Britain, Swiss officials are keeping the media away from homes for the elderly where the first jabs will take place. “Switzerland’s Maggie remains unknown,” the Blick tabloid wrote in reference to Margaret Keenan, the 90-year-old British grandmother who this month became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer vaccine. A nationwide Swiss campaign to vaccinate risk groups starts from Jan. 4. Subsequent deliveries of 250,000 doses a month and expected approval of other vaccines under regulatory review held out hope that all who wanted a free jab could get one by mid-2021, health agency officials have said. COVID-19 cases in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein have surpassed 400,000 and the death toll has topped 6,000, prompting the government last week to close restaurants for a month and urge people to stay home. Switzerland has a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech to get 3 million doses of the vaccine, enough to give 1.5 million two jabs three weeks apart.

-4.528123402467468," Drugmakers expect tests to confirm vaccines effective against new coronavirus variant ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - At least four drugmakers expect their COVID-19 vaccines will be effective against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that is raging in Britain and are performing tests that should provide confirmation in a few weeks. Ugur Sahin, chief executive of Germany’s BioNTech, which with partner Pfizer Inc, took less than a year to get a vaccine approved, said on Tuesday he expects its messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine to still work well. Moderna Inc, Germany’s CureVac and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc also believe their shots will work against the new threat that has sown chaos in Britain, prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe and threatening to further isolate the island country. “Scientifically it is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine can also deal with this virus variant,” he said on a call with reporters. Sahin said it will take another two weeks or so of study and data collection to get a definitive answer. “The vaccine contains more than 1,270 amino acids, and only nine of them are changed (in the mutated virus). That means that 99% of the protein is still the same.” The mutation known as the B.1.1.7 lineage may be up to 70% more infectious and more of a concern for children. In the event that the variant presents vaccine developers with an unexpected challenge, an advantage of mRNA is that scientists can quickly re-engineer genetic material in the shot to match that of the mutated protein, whereas modifying traditional vaccines would require extra steps. “In principle, the beauty of the mRNA technology is we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation,” Sahin said. “We could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks. Of course, this is not only a technical question. We have to deal with how regulators... would see that.” Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac all developed mRNA vaccines, while AstraZeneca has a more traditional vaccine that uses an adenovirus found in chimpanzees to deliver genetic material from the coronavirus to spur an immune response. Germany’s CureVac started late-stage clinical trials on its vaccine candidate last week and is constantly reviewing variants, which the company said are common as viruses spread. Britain’s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said on Saturday vaccines appeared to be adequate in generating an immune response to the variant of the coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday it will convene a meeting of members to discuss strategies to counter the mutation."

This could be the first country to give the regulatory green light for the British drugmaker’s vaccine as the British medicine regulator continues to examine data from the trials. India, the world’s biggest vaccine-making country, wants to start inoculating its citizens next month and is also considering emergency use authorisation applications for vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and local company Bharat Biotech. Getting vaccines to the world’s second-most populous country with one of the highest infection rates will also be a big step in the battle against the pandemic. The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot is considered vital for lower-income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper, easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal fridge temperatures. India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) first reviewed the three applications on Dec. 9 here and sought more information from all the companies, including from Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making the AstraZeneca shots. SII, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, has now provided all the data, the two sources said. The authorities were still waiting for more details from Pfizer, a government health adviser told here a news briefing on Tuesday, while one of the sources said additional information was expected from Bharat Biotech. Both sources said Indian health officials were in direct contact with their British counterparts over the AstraZeneca shot and that there were “strong indications” an approval would come by next week. The expected approval comes after data from AstraZeneca’s late-stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose. The Indian regulator is only considering the two full-dose regimen of the shot despite it showing a lower success rate, the sources said. “Serum is ready,” said one of the sources. “Initially, we may get around 50 million to 60 million doses.” The sources declined to be named as deliberations were ongoing and the timeline could change. CDSCO chief V.G. Somani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bharat Biotech and Pfizer declined to comment, while SII did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. India has not yet signed a vaccine supply deal with any company, but SII has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot and plans to make a total of 400 million doses by July."

In order to boost confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, Muhyiddin said he would be among the first to receive a dose, followed by frontliners and high-risk groups such as senior citizens. The government expects to receive the first batch of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in February, he added. Malaysia was the first country in Southeast Asia to strike a deal with the U.S. drugmaker. Under the Pfizer deal, it will receive 1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021 and 1.7 million, 5.8 million and 4.3 million doses in the subsequent quarters. Neighbouring Singapore was the first Asian nation to take delivery of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday when its first batch arrived from Belgium. (1 Malaysian ringgit = $0.2469)"

-2.644113127130707," Fact check: Publicaciones críticas del rápido desarrollo de la vacuna de COVID-19 hacen comparaciones erróneas con el VIH, el cáncer y el resfriado común En las semanas posteriores a que los fabricantes de medicamentos Moderna, AstraZeneca y Pfizer-BioNTech anunciaran resultados de ensayos clínicos exitosos para sus respectivos candidatos a vacunas COVID-19, publicaciones en las redes sociales insinuaron que no eran seguros al hacer comparaciones engañosas entre la velocidad en el desarrollo de la vacuna COVID-19 y los esfuerzos para encontrar curas para el VIH / SIDA, el cáncer y el resfriado común. Publicaciones de este tipo que dicen: ""40 años de investigación ... sin vacuna contra el VIH / Al menos 100 años de investigación ... sin vacuna para el cáncer / Investigación en curso ... sin vacuna para el resfriado común / ¿Menos de un año para una vacuna de Covid?"" - se pueden encontrar aqui here , y here . Reuters Fact Check ha desacreditado anteriormente las afirmaciones que comparan los esfuerzos de vacunas para COVID-19 con la influenza, el RSV (resfriado común) y el cáncer ( here y comparando la eficacia de COVID-19 y las vacunas contra la influenza here ). A partir de 2017, la mitad de todas las personas que viven con el VIH en todo el mundo están recibiendo tratamiento antirretroviral, también conocido como TAR (here). HIV.gov explica que cuando ""las personas que viven con el VIH logran y mantienen la supresión viral al tomar los medicamentos contra el VIH a diario según lo prescrito, pueden mantenerse saludables y no tienen ningún riesgo de transmisión sexual del VIH a sus parejas"". Encontrar una vacuna contra el VIH ha sido un desafío porque el virus ""muta rápidamente y tiene formas únicas de evadir el sistema inmunológico"", según el Instituto Nacional de Alergias y Enfermedades Infecciosas (NIAID), perteneciente a la red de Institutos Nacionales de la Salud (NIH) de Estados Unidos (here). Si bien las vacunas típicas imitan la respuesta inmune de los pacientes recuperados, “no hay casos documentados de que una persona que vive con el VIH desarrolle una respuesta inmune que elimine la infección”. Si bien las vacunas suelen ser virus inactivados o debilitados, “el VIH inactivado no fue eficaz para provocar respuestas inmunitarias en los ensayos clínicos” y “una forma viva del VIH es demasiado peligrosa para usar”. Con la afirmación ""Al menos 100 años de investigación ... ninguna vacuna para el cáncer"", las publicaciones en las redes sociales retratan falsamente al cáncer como una enfermedad transmisible. A diferencia del SIDA, causado por virus de inmunodeficiencia humana, o COVID-19, causado por un nuevo coronavirus conocido como SARS-CoV-2, el cáncer no suele ser causado por virus o bacterias, que es contra lo que las vacunas protegen al cuerpo (here).  “No existe una causa única para el cáncer”, señala Stanford University Healthcare. En cambio, los científicos creen que es la interacción de muchos factores juntos lo que produce cáncer. Los factores involucrados pueden ser características genéticas, ambientales o constitutivas del individuo"" (here). Sin embargo, existen varios virus que pueden aumentar el riesgo de padecer ciertos tipos de cáncer, como el virus de Epstein-Barr (EBV), el virus de la hepatitis B (VHB), el virus de la hepatitis C (VHC), el virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH), el virus del herpes humano. 8 (HHV-8), virus del papiloma humano (VPH) y virus de la leucemia de células T humanas (HTLV-1) ( here  ,  here  ). La vacuna contra el VPH puede ayudar a reducir el riesgo de cáncer de cuello uterino y la vacuna contra la hepatitis B puede ayudar a reducir el riesgo de cáncer de hígado (here). Las pruebas de detección periódicas, la práctica de sexo seguro y no compartir jeringas o agujas son medios recomendados de prevención de los otros virus mencionados. En cuanto a las bacterias, la Sociedad Estadounidense del Cáncer dice que la infección de estómago a largo plazo con la bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) puede causar úlceras que pueden conducir al cáncer con el tiempo (here). Además, la infección por Chlamydia trachomatis, un tipo común de bacteria que puede transmitirse a través del sexo y afectar el sistema reproductor femenino, puede aumentar el riesgo de cáncer de cuello uterino, según algunos estudios (here). Actualmente no hay vacunas en el mercado para prevenir ninguno de los tipos de infección bacteriana, aunque los científicos están trabajando para desarrollarlas ( here  ,  here ).  RESFRIADO COMÚN WebMD explica que encontrar una vacuna eficaz para el resfriado común ha sido difícil ""principalmente porque hay más de 200 variedades diferentes de virus que pueden causar resfriados"" (here). Como consigna aquí (here) Scientific American, los científicos han estado buscando una cura para el resfriado común desde la década de 1950, cuando los rinovirus se identificaron por primera vez como una causa principal. Con al menos 160 cepas diferentes de rinovirus solamente, “hacer frente al resfriado no es tanto buscar una solución a un problema como tratar de diseñar una llave maestra para abrir cientos de cerraduras diferentes a la vez”, dijo Peter Barlow, inmunólogo en la Universidad Napier de Edimburgo en Escocia, a Scientific American. La vacuna COVID-19 apunta al SARS-CoV-2, el virus que causa la enfermedad (here). Investigaciones iniciales sugieren que hay al menos seis cepas de SARS-CoV-2, pero que la tasa de mutación es baja y el virus muestra poca variabilidad, lo que vuelve más fácil desarrollar una vacuna ( here ,  here ).   En noviembre del 2020, las farmacéuticas AstraZeneca (here), Moderna (here) y Pfizer-BioNTech (here) anunciaron resultados exitosos de ensayos finales para sus respectivos candidatos a vacuna COVID-19. Los datos finales del ensayo de vacunas mostraron que las vacunas COVID-19 producidas por Pfizer-BioNTech y Moderna tuvieron una eficacia superior al 90% sin efectos secundarios graves ( here ,  here ).  Estados Unidos ha autorizado hasta la fecha dos vacunas contra el virus, una desarrollada por Pfizer Inc y su socio alemán BioNTech SE, aprobada el 11 de diciembre, y otra de Moderna Inc, que recibió la luz verde el 18 de diciembre. En comparación con el VIH, el cáncer y el resfriado, la tasa de infección por COVID-19 y el impacto económico inmediato en la economía mundial ciertamente contribuyeron a la velocidad del desarrollo de la vacuna (here). La velocidad ha creado preocupación entre el público y los países están observando a Gran Bretaña, el primer país en implementar la vacuna Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19, para obtener información sobre los posibles efectos secundarios ( here  ,  here  ). Las vacunas deben pasar por una serie de etapas antes de ser aprobadas (here).   Ha habido un gran esfuerzo global para unir recursos con el fin de acelerar el desarrollo y la producción de la vacuna COVID-19 (here). En abril de 2020, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y sus socios lanzaron el Acelerador de acceso a herramientas COVID-19 (ACT) (here) , que reunió a gobiernos, científicos, empresas, sociedad civil, filántropos y organizaciones de salud mundial para apoyar la desarrollo y distribución de pruebas, tratamientos y vacunas. Como explica la OMS, en el caso de COVID-19, inversiones financieras y colaboraciones científicas sin precedentes han hecho posible que algunos pasos en la investigación y el desarrollo sucedan ""en paralelo"". Por ejemplo, algunos ensayos clínicos están evaluando múltiples vacunas al mismo tiempo, aunque los estándares clínicos y de seguridad se mantienen a pesar de la aceleración de los procesos (here).  Falta contexto. Las publicaciones hacen una comparación falsa al yuxtaponer el cronograma rápido de la vacuna COVID-19 con la falta de una vacuna para el VIH / SIDA, el cáncer y el resfriado común. Encontrar una vacuna eficaz contra el VIH es difícil porque el virus muta rápidamente. El cáncer no es una enfermedad transmisible y no suele ser causado por virus, aunque algunos virus aumentan el riesgo de padecer ciertos tipos de cáncer.

-2.644113127130707," EU clears Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for first inoculations AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The European Union geared up to start mass vaccinations against COVID-19 just after Christmas after the shot developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech cleared regulatory hurdles on Monday. European Union countries including Germany, France, Austria and Italy have said they plan to start vaccinations from Dec. 27 as Europe tries to catch up with the United States and Britain, where inoculations began earlier this month. Having secured a green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Commission gave final approval on Monday evening to the EU’s first COVID-19 vaccine. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said doses would be available for all EU countries, at the same time and on the same conditions. “Today we add an important chapter to a European success story. We approved the first safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19. More vaccines will come soon,” she said. Pfizer and BioNTech said here they are ready to immediately ship initial doses of the vaccine, branded in the EU as Comirnaty, to the 27 EU member states. Vaccine doses for Europe will be produced in BioNTech’s manufacturing sites in Germany, and Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, the companies said. Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza hailed the approval as “the news we have been waiting for”. “(It) opened up a new phase and gives us more strength and confidence” in tackling a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Europeans, he said. Preparations for the vaccine roll-out come as the identification of a highly infectious new strain of the coronavirus in Britain caused chaos across the region, with countries shutting off travel ties with the United Kingdom and disrupting trade ahead of the Christmas holiday. EMA officials said it was highly likely the vaccine would work against the new variant of the coronavirus. EMA executive director Emer Cooke said it would take a long time to inoculate the 450 million people of the 27 EU countries. “Vaccines alone will not be the silver bullet that will allow us to return to normal lives, but the authorisation of this first vaccine is definitely a major step in the right direction and an indication that 2021 can be brighter than 2020,” she told a news briefing. Student medics, retired doctors, pharmacists and soldiers are being drafted into a European vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale. A phased-in approach means frontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of care homes are being prioritised, with most national schemes not reaching the general public until the end of the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest. The EMA had started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6 in an effort to speed an approval process that usually takes at least seven months. The EMA clearance, initially granted as conditional marketing approval (CMA), is valid for one year and can be renewed annually. It can be converted into a standard marketing authorisation after further data checks. This would be valid for five years but can be renewed for unlimited validity. The process took longer than the ultra-fast emergency authorisation given by Britain, the first western country to endorse a COVID-19 shot. The roll-out will be a test for Brussels’ ability to unify Europe amid political pressure to speed up the process and tame the pandemic which has killed more than 1.6 million people globally. The EU has ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, enough to vaccinate 100 million people, paying 15.50 euros ($18.90) per dose. It will also buy an extra 100 million with a timetable for delivery still to be negotiated. EMA officials denied any political interference and defended the speed of the approval process. “The focus was exclusively on the science, there were too many involved of the member states who would look into the science as to allow any political whitewashing or adaption,” said Harald Enzmann, chair of EMA’s Human Medicines Committee (CHMP)."

He welcomed the approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech by the European Medicines Agency as a milestone in the fight against the pandemic. “Vaccination is paving the way for us out of the crisis. And we’re doing everything we can to take this path as quickly as possible,” Spahn said. The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million vaccine doses to local health authorities in Germany’s 16 federal states by the end of this year, Spahn said. “In January, at least another 670,000 vaccine doses will be distributed each week,” he said.

-2.644113127130707," EU regulator says Pfizer vaccine should be considered case by case for pregnant women AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The European drug regulator on Monday said the use of the COVID-19 vaccine jointly developed by U.S. company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on pregnant women should be considered case by case. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) does not have enough data from the companies’ clinical trials on the potential risks to pregnant women, Harald Enzmann, chair of the EMA’s Human Medicines Committee, said in a briefing. The agency can change its recommendation if more information becomes available, he said without disclosing the circumstances under which the vaccine might by deemed appropriate for pregnant women. Enzmann also said he would urge caution in using the vaccine on people with a known history of anaphylaxis reaction after several cases of allergic reactions to the vaccine in the United States and United Kingdom. His comments followed the regulator’s approval for use of the COVID-19 vaccine for people over the age of 16, putting Europe on course to start inoculations within a week. Enzmann defended the independence of the EMA in the approval process despite suggestions in some quarters that there may have been political pressure to speed the process for the EU after Britain had already begun vaccinations. “The focus was exclusively on the science,” he said, adding that the number of member states involved meant there could be “political whitewashing or adaption”."

WHO assistant director general Mariangela Simao said in a briefing the global health body could decide on Pfizer’s vaccine candidate by the end of the year. A roll-out in a limited number of countries will take place by end-January or early February as part of the COVAX programme, led by the WHO to provide shots for poor- and middle-income countries, Soumya Swaminathan, WHO chief scientist, said.

-2.644113127130707," Colombia to receive 1.7 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in February BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia will receive its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in February, the country health ministry said on Monday. The 1.7 million doses are enough to vaccinate about 850,000 people as each requires two doses. First in line for inoculations will be healthcare workers and those over 80 years old, officials said in a statement. The Andean country, whose daily confirmed number of new coronavirus cases hit a record hit of 13,990 on Saturday, said last week it signed deals with Pfizer and AstraZeneca Plc to provide 10 million doses each of their COVID-19 vaccines. The country, which has recorded more than 1.5 million coronavirus cases and over 40,000 deaths, will receive an additional 20 million doses through the COVAX mechanism, giving it enough vaccine to inoculate some 20 million people. Colombia will provide COVID-19 vaccines for free under its national vaccination plan, but is also preparing rules to allow people to purchase the vaccine privately, the ministry said in a statement. People between the ages of 60 and 79 and those with chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 will form the second tranche of people to be vaccinated, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said. Members of the general population - including people in the military, teachers and those who care for others - will follow, Ruiz added. “All of this plan we are looking to carry out in 2021,” he said in the statement. The country will not vaccinate those under 16 or pregnant women because not enough data on the effect of vaccines in those populations is available yet, the ministry added. Colombian officials have urged people to avoid peak shopping times and to celebrate holidays with only their household, to keep virus transmission down as they await the vaccines. Capital Bogota on Monday returned to restrictions that allow just one person per household to go shopping and restrict entrance to stores and restaurants."
-2.644113127130707," Fact check: COVID-19 ‘vape vaccine’ is a hoax An image that appears to show a Pfizer-branded coronavirus vaccine “vaporizer cartridge” has gone viral online. This is a hoax: the pharmaceutical company Pfizer has not released a vape vaccine against COVID-19. The photo being shared shows a package containing a cartridge that would be used in an electronic cigarette and inhaled as a vapor (here). It carries Pfizer-style branding and is described as a “single dose” vaccine cartridge. There are signs the label was printed as a joke; the box describes Pfizer as “makers of ‘the boner pill’”. It was widely shared humorously as early as Dec. 19, for instance here and here . While most shares of the image appear to recognise that the product is not real, it nonetheless generated confusion for some. A string of social media users shared the image with captions such as “Could this be fake?”, “Can you escape the RESET?” and “Why’s the Pfizer vaccine made in China?”, the latter comment being in response to text on the fake package reading “MADE IN CHINA”. The real vaccine is being made using Pfizer and BioNTech’s combined manufacturing network in Germany, Belgium and the United States (here). Reuters contacted Pfizer who confirmed by email the vaporiser cartridge was fake. The real Pfizer vaccine is injected into the upper arm and given as two doses 21 days apart (here). False. Pfizer did not make a COVID-19 vaccine cartridge designed to be “vaped” in an electronic cigarette. The product in the image was fake and likely made as a joke.

-2.644113127130707," Singapore gets Asia's first batch of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore received its first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, according to its flag carrier, ahead of a rollout in the city-state that health officials have said could be as soon as two-three weeks away. Singapore Airlines, which carried the vaccines on board one of its freighters from Belgium, did not specify the size of the batch. Singapore is the first Asian country to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech shots after it said last week that it had approved the companies’ vaccine. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 68, has said he would be among the early recipients of the vaccine in the nation of 5.7 million people, which has one of the lowest coronavirus fatality rates globally. “Delighted to see the first shipment of vaccines arrive in Singapore,” Lee posted on Facebook on Monday, adding that the authorities will announce details of a rollout in due course. He reiterated that the vaccination will be voluntary, and that he encouraged Singaporeans to take it. The government plans to first administer the vaccine to healthcare workers and the elderly. Health ministry official Kenneth Mak had last week said the first jabs could be given “within the next two to three weeks” if safely delivered. Singapore has kept new local infections to almost zero each day in recent months and will further ease restrictions next week. It has signed advanced purchase agreements and made early down-payments on several vaccine candidates including those being developed by Moderna and Sinovac, setting aside more than S$1 billion ($746.16 million) for shots. Most of the city-state’s more than 58,000 coronavirus cases occurred in cramped migrant worker dormitories, but there are some concerns about asymptomatic carriers and undetected transmission taking place. The government said on Saturday it was investigating whether 13 travellers who tested positive at a five-star hotel in November may have been infected there during their mandatory quarantine, rather than prior to their arrival in the country."

The mRNA technology contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus, and is used in vaccines from Moderna Inc as well as from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE. Both those vaccines have obtained efficacy data from late-stage, large-scale trials and emergency-use approval from the United States. The plant for China’s mRNA candidate, which is being jointly developed by the Academy of Military Science (AMS), Walvax Biotechnology and Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, could be operational within eight months, the official China News Service reported. The facility will have a first-phase annual capacity of 120 million doses, the report said. The candidate, known as ARCoV or ARCoVax, has entered a Phase 1b clinical trial in October after a Phase 1 trial that started in June, data on the website of Chinese Clinical Trial Registry show. At least five Chinese candidates have already entered Phase 3 clinical trials, three of which have been given to people of high infection risk via China’s emergency inoculation programme.

U.S. plans call for at-risk groups such as elderly people in nursing homes and medical workers to receive injections first. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an emergency use authorization for Moderna’s vaccine, the second COVID-19 vaccine to receive approval. Moderna said a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Saturday to recommend its vaccine for use in people aged 18 and older. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices panel voted 11-0 in favor of the vaccine. The jab developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE was authorized Dec. 11. Pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc’s facility in Bloomington, Indiana, is filling and packaging vials with Moderna vaccine and handing them to McKesson.

Pfizer organized its own distribution system. The U.S. government’s vaccine program, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, is in charge of logistics for Moderna’s distribution under Perna. ‘MY FAULT’ Perna apologized to U.S. governors for confusion on the vaccine’s availability after the U.S. government reduced the number of doses states would receive in the upcoming week. States including Oregon and Washington, which are ramping up to get frontline healthcare workers vaccinated as quickly as possible, said their allocation had dropped by as much as 40%. Perna said he made an error estimating the number of doses that would actually be cleared by regulators for shipment, which was fewer than the number of doses produced. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said 7.9 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would be delivered nationally this week. The Moderna delivery system will have some of the same players as Pfizer’s but will differ in key ways. Transportation companies UPS and FedEx are giving priority to vaccines on planes and trucks that are moving holiday gifts and other cargo. Their drivers will handle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vaccine deliveries. They are going directly to vaccination sites, unlike Pfizer’s which was sent to large hubs and redistributed. “We added a lot of aircraft, a lot of temporary workers. (Vaccines) are a very small fraction of total volumes,” said Wes Wheeler, a UPS executive in charge of vaccine shipments. Moderna’s vaccine is available in quantities as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators, while the inoculations from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), and can be held for only five days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday. A CDC advisory panel on Sunday will consider which groups should get vaccinated next. Perna said the United States is on track to have enough doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of the year to inoculate 20 million people, as the government projected, but deliveries of those doses may continue into first week of January. Healthcare experts forecast it will take well into 2021 for a significant portion of Americans to be inoculated. Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues."

Shipments of the Pfizer vaccines began arriving in Israel last week. Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines are on order. Israel expects to have enough doses by the year’s end for the 20% of its population most prone to COVID-19 complications. With polls finding that around two-third of Israelis intend to get vaccinated, officials have sought to stave off what they deem “fake news” about possibly perilous side-effects. Netanyahu said he was being vaccinated first in order to encourage others. Doffing his suit jacket and rolling up a sleeve, he told reporters his was “a strong hand and an outstretched arm” - a play on the Book of Exodus’ description of God’s power. With the procedure at Sheba Medical Center over, Netanyahu paraphrased astronaut Neil Armstrong’s first words on the moon: “That was a small jab for a man, a huge step for the health of us all. May this be this successful. Go out and get vaccinated!” Israel, with a population of 9 million, has reported 372,401 coronavirus cases and 3,070 deaths. It has imposed two national lockdowns and may soon order curbs on high-contagion areas. Netanyahu has self-isolated three times after exposure to carriers."

The announcement follows the FAA’s Dec. 12 approval for pilots and controllers to use the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech The U.S. aviation regulator said pilots and controllers must not fly or conduct safety-related duties for 48 hours after receiving doses. The FAA said it “will monitor the patient response to each vaccine dose and may adjust this policy as necessary to ensure aviation safety.” On Thursday, groups representing aviation unions and American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and other airlines, wrote all U.S. governors asking them to “prioritize aviation frontline workers for allocation of the vaccine in your upcoming implementation plan.” The groups noted that “aviation workers are frontline workers who either encounter the traveling public frequently or are required to perform our work in close proximity to our colleagues and perform our jobs onsite.” Earlier this month, the FAA sent guidance to airports to prepare for vaccine distribution, including other facilities that may serve as alternate or diversion airports. The FAA said that some aircraft used for vaccine shipments may be larger than the aircraft used for passenger-carrying flights that typically serve that airport and operators may opt to have extra aircraft rescue and firefighting services."

Britain this month became the first Western country to start immunizing with the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNtech, followed by the United States which has now also approved a vaccine from Moderna. There have been 18.65 million new cases in the past month, the highest reported for a 30-day period since the pandemic started. Europe remains the region with the most cases - 21.6 million cases - followed by North America with 17.9 million, Latin America with 14.5 million and Asia with 13 million. In Europe, a million new cases were recorded over just five days, with Russia and France reporting more than 2 million cases since the coronavirus outbreak began. The United Kingdom and Italy both have approximately 1.9 million cases each. The United States became the first country in the world to record more than 300,000 deaths on Monday. The nation is reporting more than 2,500 deaths daily, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the previous seven days. Hospitals across the United States have begun giving the first shots of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine. The United States remains the country with most cases - more than 17 million since the outbreak started - followed by India and Brazil respectively. With just 4% of the world’s population, the United States has about 23% of all global cases. Brazil registered a single-day record of 70,000 new cases on Wednesday, joining the United States and India as the only countries to have reported more than 7 million total infections. With almost 180,000 confirmed fatalities, the South American nation has the second-highest death toll in the world. On Saturday, India exceeded 10 million coronavirus infections. India has prepared to deliver 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months."
-4.680153107487431," Swiss to start Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine jabs after watchdog's OK ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will start getting doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and partner BioNTech within days after its drugs regulator authorised use of the jabs in what officials called the world’s first approval under a standard procedure. Two months after receiving the application, Swissmedic allowed the vaccine for people aged 16 and older after a rolling review of documents being submitted. That cleared the way for an initial delivery of just over 100,000 doses, which the army will put into deep-freeze storage and send to cantons to start inoculations of vulnerable people, including the elderly and those with medical conditions. A nationwide campaign to vaccinate risk groups can start from Jan. 4. Subsequent deliveries of 250,000 doses a month held out hope that all who wanted a free jab could get one by mid-2021, federal public health agency officials said. With approval of another product expected soon, Switzerland would have enough vaccine in the months ahead, agency director Anne Levy told a news conference in Bern. Swissmedic is also reviewing applications for vaccines made by Moderna and AztraZeneca. COVID-19 cases in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein have surpassed 400,000 and the death toll has topped 6,000, prompting the government on Friday to close restaurants for a month and urge people to stay home. Although the timing of Swissmedic’s approval took even government officials by surprise, the agency said data showed the vaccine was safe and effective. “The safety of patients is an essential prerequisite, especially where the authorisation of vaccines is concerned,” Swissmedic Director Raimund Bruhin said. Sabine Bruckner, Pfizer’s head of Swiss operations, called Swiss approval “a historic moment in the fight against this deadly disease”. The vaccine has been authorised or approved for emergency use in more than 15 countries, the partners said. Bruhin said he expected European Union approval soon. Pfizer has to keep submitting information on the safety, efficacy and quality of its vaccine, Swissmedic said. “We will take immediate action if necessary should safety signals emerge,” Bruhin told a news conference. Switzerland has a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech to deliver 3 million doses of the vaccine, enough for 1.5 million people to get two jabs three weeks apart."

The AstraZeneca deal, to be signed on Monday, will allow immunisation of about 20% of Malaysia’s population of 32 million, similar to that of the deal with U.S. giant Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE, said Health Minister Adham Baba. The Southeast Asian nation has seen a spike in cases since September, with nearly 92,000 cases of the new coronavirus and 433 COVID-19 deaths. Malaysia expects to receive enough vaccines to inoculate 10% of the population through the global COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization, he said in a statement. The government is working to secure more deals to expand inoculation to 70% of the population, Adham said. “What is important is which company can provide us quick access to their vaccine and that it must be safe, effective and of high quality,” he said. The government expects to receive the first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses in February, national news wire Bernama said. Malaysia said last month it had agreed to buy 12.8 million doses of this vaccine, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to strike a deal with the U.S. drugmaker. Under the Pfizer deal, Malaysia will receive 1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021 and 1.7 million, 5.8 million and 4.3 million doses in the subsequent quarters. Pfizer-BioNTech have supply deals with several countries including the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain.

-4.680153107487431," Explainer: How the Moderna vaccine stacks up against Pfizer/BioNTech's NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators authorized Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, a week after granting the first U.S. authorization to Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE’s coronavirus shot. The following is a comparison of the two vaccines and what to expect as both become available: Both vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus. The instructions spur the immune system into action, turning the body into a virus-zapping vaccine factory. No actual virus is contained in the vaccines. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines target the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that it uses to break into healthy human cells. The spikes also give the family of viruses their distinctive name. The vaccines appear to be similarly effective. Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was around 95% effective at preventing disease symptoms in its late-stage trial, while Moderna’s vaccine was around 94% effective. Both are given in two doses; Pfizer’s 21 days apart and Moderna’s 28 days apart. Very few participants who received the vaccine in either trial got sick with COVID-19 and almost none got seriously ill. Data the companies have submitted to the Food and Drug Administration suggest that they start offering partial protection against COVID-19 around two weeks after recipients receive their first dose. The main difference between the two vaccines is the temperature required to keep them stable long-term. Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit). Once thawed, it can only be refrigerated for 5 days. The vaccine requires a special shipping container packed with dry ice to keep it at the proper temperature. Moderna’s vaccine can be stored at standard freezer temperatures of -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for up to six months. After it’s thawed, it can be kept in a refrigerator for up to 30 days. Neither of the two large-scale clinical trials of the vaccines turned up any serious long-term side effects. But the vaccines do have slightly different short-term side effect profiles. While the vaccines have not been compared head-to-head, Moderna’s vaccine appears to be associated with slightly more severe cases of fatigue, headache and fever in the day or two following the second shot, especially in people younger than 65. Although not seen in its clinical trial, Pfizer’s vaccine has been linked with a few cases of severe allergic reactions as it has been rolled out in the UK and the United States. At least two healthcare workers in Britain and two in Alaska have reported severe allergic reactions soon after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Britain’s medical regulator has said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it should be safe for most Americans with allergies to receive the vaccine. More data is needed to understand exactly how effective either vaccine is at preventing virus transmission. While they are both highly effective at keeping symptoms and severe illness at bay, we do not know if they prevent someone from becoming infected. Until that is known, experts say, masks will still be needed to ensure that vaccinated people do not spread the virus. At this point, with vaccines in short supply, few people will have the luxury of expressing a preference of which they receive. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that the first doses be given to healthcare workers and residents in long-term care facilities and most states plan to do that."
-4.680153107487431," Fairbanks clinician is third Alaskan with adverse reaction to COVID-19 vaccine ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A Fairbanks clinician suffered anaphylactic symptoms after being given the Pfizer Inc coronavirus vaccine, a hospital said on Friday, becoming the third Alaska health care worker to suffer an adverse reaction to the new drug. The clinician, whose name was not released, started showing symptoms about 10 minutes after being inoculated on Thursday, according to Foundation Health Partners, operator of the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. The health care worker was treated in the hospital’s emergency room with epinephrine and released about six hours later, Foundation Health Partners said in a written statement. Two health care workers in Juneau suffered adverse reactions to the medication earlier this week. One was briefly hospitalized in that city for anaphylaxis after she was vaccinated on Tuesday. The second had a milder reaction on Wednesday and was treated at the hospital emergency room and released. “Allergic reactions, though uncommon, can occur with injections of medications and vaccines,” Foundation Health Partners’ Chief Medical Officer Dr. Angelique Ramirez said in the statement. The Fairbanks clinician issued her own statement that was included in the Foundation Health Partners release. “I would get the vaccine and recommend it to anyone, despite my reaction, to help our country get immunized which is needed for the health of all Americans, for the economy, get families hugging again, for getting children back to schools, and to get the country on the other side of this pandemic,” the health worker said. Alaska received its first shipments of the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday evening, state officials said. Batches have been sent around the state, including by floatplane and boat to more remote sites."
-4.680153107487431," Colombia reaches deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca for COVID-19 vaccines BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia has inked deals with pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca to provide 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, President Ivan Duque said on Friday. The Andean country topped 40,000 coronavirus deaths and witnessed a new record for daily confirmed cases, reaching 13,277 on Friday. It has had nearly 1.5 million confirmed cases. “We have closed a deal with pharmaceutical company Pfizer for the acquisition of 10 million doses. We have also closed a deal with AstraZeneca for the acquisition of 10 million doses,” Duque said on his nightly television broadcast. The 10 million doses each from Pfizer and AstraZeneca and 20 million doses, which will be received through the COVAX mechanism will cover two doses for 20 million people, pending approvals by the national health regulator, Duque added. “In the first weeks of 2021 we will be carrying out the process of mass vaccination,” he said. Colombia will focus initially on vaccinating healthcare workers, those over 60 and those with pre-existing conditions like hypertension, HIV and diabetes. It will provide inoculation for free under its generous national vaccination plan. The initial group set to be vaccinated comprises just over 11 million people, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said on the program. Recipients have already been identified by name using health data, he added. About 1.2 million of the first group are healthcare workers, including clinic personnel like cleaners, Ruiz said. Many vaccinations in 2021 will take place in June, July and August. The country will continue negotiating with companies to acquire more doses, Duque said. Colombia authorities have repeatedly said vaccines like Pfizer’s, which require ultra-freezing will present logistical challenges, but that they are preparing cold storage. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was once seen as the frontrunner in the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but has been overtaken by Pfizer, whose shots have been rolled out in Britain and the United States this month."
-4.680153107487431," Texas doctors in rural hotspots left out in cold on vaccine Running in between patients, Dr. Eileen Sprys pauses to catch her breath, tries to gather herself, but cannot mask her frustration: The health care workers in her COVID-besieged West Texas hospital were left out of the first shipment of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, and they have no idea when they may get it. Not a single rural hospital in this state that prides itself on its country roots received any doses of the vaccine this week, despite such medical outposts serving around 20% of the state's population, or 3 million people. Even before the pandemic, rural hospitals in Texas and many other states were operating on ""skin and bones"" staffing and budgets, Sprys said. ""We're all exposed all the time,"" she said. ""We don't have an isolated COVID wing or staff only dedicated to COVID unlike in larger hospitals. To not be included in the first shipment of vaccines is just so upsetting."" This isn't the first sign of inequality in the pandemic. Rural and urban poor residents across the U.S. have lamented not receiving treatments and medications as the better off, nor the quantity or quality of testing. Sprys, her three fellow doctors and the 28 members of the nursing staff at the Medical Arts Hospital in Lamesa have been looking forward to the vaccine for months, hoping it would bring relief to Dawson County. One of the poorest counties in Texas, nearly a quarter of Dawson's 13,000 residents live in poverty. To date, it has seen 1,325 coronavirus cases and 42 deaths, according to the state health department's count. Rural hospitals around the nation, and particularly in Texas, have faces widespread closures after years of budget cuts. Some 27 rural hospitals have closed in Texas in the past decade - double that of any other state. If it weren't for a $10 billion federal stimulus aimed at rural hospitals nationwide in May, another half dozen small Texas facilities would have closed, estimated John Henderson, the president of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. NEEDLES IN ARMS The Texas Department of State Health Services is tasked with allocating where the vaccine goes. A 17-person expert panel is charged with delivering recommendations on allotments to the state's health commissioner, Dr. John Hellerstedt, who has the final say on deliveries. In a Dec. 14 letter sent to rural health advocates, Hellerstedt praised their patience and wrote that a ""more inclusive"" strategy of who gets vaccines will begin next week and that the pending approval of the Moderna vaccine would help alleviate rural shortfalls. Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for state health services, said there were two big reasons why rural areas were left off the initial Pfizer vaccine shipments. The first is that the smallest shipment contains 975 doses, so the state sent it to hospitals who said they had that many health care workers to inoculate. The second reason is that the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored in special freezers, which larger facilities were more likely to have. But that reasoning irks the doctors in Lamesa as their hospital had purchased one of those freezers in anticipation. The Moderna vaccine, Van Deusen said, is easier to store and will be able to be shipped with a minimum of 100 doses, meaning it can go to smaller hospitals. Time is of the essence, said Henderson, of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. ""You have one doctor out because of coronavirus in a small town, and that may mean you just lost half of your medical staff,"" he said. Henderson said the state should embrace alternatives - such as having regional medical centers not vaccinate lower-risk staff, and instead earmark some doses for the frontline rural doctors and nurses. 'ANSWERING THE CALL' It's difficult to recruit doctors to work in any small town, and those that do are considered the crown jewels of their communities. Many residents interviewed in Lamesa said they were adamant that their medical staff should be protected immediately. Debbie Aylesworth, 67, credits Sprys and the staff at the Lamesa hospital with keeping her off a ventilator when she had COVID-19 a few months ago. After Aylesworth was exposed to the virus in October, Sprys texted her daily to ask if she was having any symptoms. If not for Sprys' insistence, Aylesworth said she likely would have delayed seeking treatment and ended up being far worse off. ""Those doctors are answering the call,"" she said. ""They are dealing with the worst of what this pandemic is dishing out, so they should be seeing the benefit of the vaccine."" Josh Stevens, the mayor of Lamesa, said the area has been as brutalized by the pandemic as anywhere else in Texas. Making matters worse, he said, is that about 85% of the town's population is considered part of the essential work force - most working in agriculture along with oil and gas - meaning more of Lamesa's citizens have been out on the frontlines. ""Most people in Lamesa have had nowhere to hide from this virus, and our doctors have had to deal with that reality,"" he said. ""Them not being at the front of the line to get a vaccine is a slap in the face for all of rural Texas."""
-4.03627653596571," Doctor behind the NBA 'bubble' receives COVID-19 vaccine BURLINGAME, Calif. (Reuters) - Dr. Leroy Sims, the medical director of the National Basketball Association who managed this past summer’s bio-secure bubble in Orlando, joined frontline workers in California in getting the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine on Friday. He was among 148 respiratory therapists, registered nurses, and doctors to get the jab at Sutter Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame, south of San Francisco, on the hospital’s first day of administering vaccines. “For me, this has been a long-time coming,” Sims, who practices emergency medicine at the hospital as well, told Reuters. “I’ve been dealing with the pandemic from Jan. 4 in terms of informing the NBA and friends and family and followed it really closely,” he said. “So to be at this point, there’s no anxiety whatsoever. I’m really proud to be at this place.” His vaccine comes days before the regular season is set to tip off. A handful of teams, including the Orlando Magic and Utah Jazz, are allowing a limited number of fans into their arenas. The rest will depend, Sims said. “Really it’s going to be based on what the U.S. looks like. The northeast looks different from the southeast looks different from the west. “And what the case burden is, positivity rates, so until we get the green light from the Department of Public Health and in those areas where we’re not allowed to have fans, we won’t, but to the extent that we can do it and do it safely, we will,” said Sims, who did not give dates on whether fans could come to games. In the meantime, the league remains focused on keeping players safe, recommending that they continue to mask and keep physical distance, he said. The league will also continue its deep testing protocols, Sims added. According to the league and the National Basketball Players Association, almost 9% of players tested positive before training camps opened earlier this month. Back in late June, just over 5% tested positive before they gathered in Florida, where teams finished out the season and postseason in a “bubble.” During the league’s three-month stay at Walt Disney World in Orlando, no players and coaches tested positive for COVID-19 after the virus derailed the season in March for four months. As the vaccine rollout continues into the new year, Sims said the NBA would be waiting for healthcare workers, the vulnerable, and any necessary essential workers to get vaccinated before its players and staff do. “In everything that we do, we have an eye on social responsibility. So we’re not jumping the line. When the opportunity comes for us to roll it out in a larger way to our players and to our staff, we’ll do that,” he said. “But we’re not going to do that before the necessary essential workers get vaccinated.”"

Canada began inoculations on Monday with the Pfizer vaccine, and will receive about 255,000 total doses in December, slightly more than the 249,000 announced earlier this month, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said. The country is on track to receive deliveries of 4 million Pfizer doses by the end of March, as had been previously announced, Anand said. “In January, we’ll be getting 125,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine per week, for a total of 500,000 doses that month,” Trudeau said in a news conference. Ontario, the country’s most populous province, is considering further lockdowns after 2,290 new cases were reported on Friday, Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his government would hold emergency meetings over the weekend and announce on Monday possible new health restrictions. Lockdowns due to end on Monday in Toronto and Peel, two of the hardest hit parts of the province, will be extended, Ford said. Overall, Canada has reported a total of 488,638 cases of COVID-19, with 7,008 new ones on Thursday, and 13,916 deaths. Separately a television interview, Trudeau confirmed a Reuters report from November that Canada was in talks to donate shots to lower-income countries. “As Canada gets vaccinated, if we have more vaccines than necessary, absolutely we will be sharing with the world,” Trudeau said in a CTV interview. Trudeau did not outline how donations might work. Canada has reserved more vaccine doses per capita than any other country in the world. “I would like to thank Canada and Prime Minister Trudeau for committing to share surplus doses of COVID-19 vaccines,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a Geneva press conference on Friday night."

-4.866297961934371," Brazil, Pfizer spar over onerous COVID-19 vaccine requirements RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Pfizer is encountering difficulty in registering its COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in Brazil due to the level of detail required by the regulator, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on Thursday. The health minister’s comments could raise tensions with Pfizer, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States. They will also fuel concerns from critics who argue that Brazil’s vaccine rollout is progressing too slowly, just as the virus roars back to life. Vaccines are seen as crucial to ending the outbreak in Brazil, its death toll second only to the United States at more than 180,000 people. President Jair Bolsonaro, already under fire for his handling of the pandemic, is one of the world’s most prominent COVID-19 skeptics, and has said he will not take any vaccine. Addressing lawmakers on Thursday, Pazuello said he spoke with Pfizer’s country manager on Sunday and directed him to meet with officials from health regulator Anvisa. After meeting Anvisa officials, the manager told the health minister that he had expected the emergency use process to be less onerous, Pazuello said. “‘I thought it was simpler, but the agency is very detailed,’” Pazuello quoted the unnamed Pfizer executive as saying. Pfizer Brazil’s country manager, Carlos Murillo, could not immediately be reached for comment. In a series of statements on Thursday, Pfizer said it could not comment on talks with the government. Its statements confirmed that Anvisa had made specific requests that required more time. As a result, it said that seeking full regulatory approval for its vaccine - rather than a more onerous emergency use authorization - was the fastest course of action at this time. It said the Anvisa requirement for specific country data was more onerous than other regulatory agencies, which were happy to analyze the trial information as a whole. Pazuello said Pfizer had presented a variety of demands in order to close the deal, including a waiver of liability. “We are thinking of accepting,” Pazuello said of the demands. In its statements Pfizer said many countries had agreed to waive liability, including in Latin America. Anvisa confirmed that Pfizer had yet to apply to register its vaccine. It said that information provided by Pfizer was “not the complete data necessary to judge the safety, efficacy and quality of a vaccine for registration.” The regulator added that so far no vaccine producer had applied for full registration or approval for emergency use. A source with knowledge of Pfizer’s position said it was only going to apply for an emergency use authorization once the Brazilian government signed a contract to buy its vaccine. Brazil’s federal government has repeatedly changed the date by which it expects to start inoculations. After a lull of a few months, infections are rising again sharply, hitting a fresh daily record on Wednesday of 70,000 new cases. Brazil expects to receive some 24 million COVID-19 vaccines by January, Pazuello said. He said Brazil expected Pfizer to provide 500,000 of those doses next month, China’s Sinovac to provide 9 million doses and AstraZeneca to provide 15 million doses. Brazil expects to reach 37.7 million vaccine doses by February, with another 31 million doses arriving in March, the minister added."

The U.S. government has signed a deal with Pfizer for a 100 million doses of the vaccine, which has started being rolled out across the country under an emergency use authorization. Pfizer had reported some production issues with the vaccine, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said on Wednesday. He had said the U.S. government would provide the company full support to ensure it can produce the vaccine for American people."

The state-run National Health Service (NHS), which is running Britain’s mass COVID vaccination programme, posted several pictures of McKellen, in a blue T-shirt and a rainbow striped scarf, giving a thumbs up as he received the shot. “It’s a very special day. I feel euphoric,” McKellen, 81, was quoted as saying in one NHS post which he retweeted. “I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. I feel very lucky to have had the vaccination.” Nearly 140,000 people have received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in Britain since roll out began on Dec. 8. People aged over 80 are in the highest priority group. A star of British stage and screen since the 1960s, McKellen attained a new level of global fame in the 2000s when he appeared as Gandalf in the movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s novels and directed by Peter Jackson. He was the latest British celebrity to go public about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, part of a collective effort to reassure members of the public who may be harbouring doubts about the jab’s safety. The chef and cookery writer Prue Leith, 80, who presents the high-ratings TV show “The Great British Bake Off”, also posted a picture of herself receiving the shot. It is not known whether Queen Elizabeth, 94, and her husband Prince Philip, 99, have had the vaccine yet. The Times reported they may “let it be known” once they have.

-4.866297961934371," Retired medics, armies enlisted for Europe's vaccine push (Reuters) - Student medics, retired doctors, pharmacists and soldiers are being drafted into a European COVID-19 vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale, beginning just after Christmas. As coronavirus cases continue to rise in a pandemic that has killed nearly half a million Europeans, the EU announced on Thursday that a bloc-wide inoculation campaign would begin on Dec. 27, four days after European authorities are expected to give approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres emptied by lockdown measures will become venues for mass inoculations. In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will spring up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring. Faced with a shortage of health professionals able to give the shot, many countries are on a recruitment drive. German states are calling on retired medics and company doctors to join the push, in some cases offering up to 140 euros ($170) an hour. “This will probably be the biggest mass vaccination campaign in history, certainly of our century and our generation,” Domenico Arcuri, Italy’s special commissioner for the COVID emergency, told reporters at a launch of national plans. A phased-in approach means frontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of care homes are being prioritised, with most national schemes not reaching the general public until the end of the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest. The goal of the 27-member European Union is nonetheless to reach coverage of 70% of its 450 million people. The European Commission, which struggled in the early months of the crisis to persuade national capitals to work together, is calling for the inoculation drive to be coordinated across borders. “This is a huge task. So let’s start rapidly with the vaccination together, as 27, on the same day,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week. On Thursday she confirmed the start date for the whole bloc would be Dec. 27. In a sign of the impatience of some member states, Germany had already announced that date on Wednesday. Britain, which quit the EU this year, was the first country to deploy the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outside of clinical trials, giving it emergency approval two weeks ago. It said nearly 140,000 people received their first shots in the first week of roll-out. It is introducing a new national protocol allowing midwives, physiotherapists, pharmacists and others to give the shot. “This will help ensure we have the workforce needed to deliver a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme, in addition to delivery of an upscaled influenza programme, in the autumn,” a government consultation document said. National rules vary by country. In France the injection must take place in the presence of a doctor. In Germany it can be administered by someone else as long as the patient can consult a doctor first. There is a concern social distancing rules and paperwork could create bottlenecks at inoculation venues such as Berlin’s Velodrom sports hall or the Hamburg trade hall. Some countries face extra hurdles. Portugal is establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira; non-EU member Norway is buying doses from neighbouring Sweden. Armies in countries including Switzerland and Italy are set to help secure vaccine supplies, while in Germany the Bundeswehr - already involved in contact-tracing - is on standby to help with injections if local regions need it. With surveys showing many Europeans remain wary of taking a vaccine developed in record time, authorities are accompanying the push with information campaigns. Stefano Boeri, the architect behind Italy’s primrose-themed pavilions, said the spring flower was picked to “convey a sign of serenity and regeneration”. “If the virus has locked us in hospitals and homes, the vaccine will finally bring us back into contact with social life and the nature that surrounds us.”"

-4.866297961934371," EU to order more Pfizer vaccine after declining earlier offer BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will take up its option to buy up to 100 million more doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine after turning down an opportunity in July for a much bigger deal, according to EU officials and an internal document. The plan comes after some of the vaccine candidates ordered by the EU faced unexpected delays in clinical trials, forcing the bloc and other wealthy nations to rely for now on shots from fewer manufacturers than initially planned. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot, the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by Western drugs regulators, is being rolled out in countries including Britain and the United States, and is expected to be approved for use in the EU next week. The European Commission decided on Tuesday to exercise its option to buy up to 100 million additional doses under an existing contract with Pfizer and BioNTech, a spokesman for the EU executive told Reuters on Thursday. Under the same contract it has already ordered 200 million doses. “We want to be sure to get more doses because there is big demand,” the spokesman said. An EU official said talks were underway over how many of the extra 100 million doses might be taken. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment. BioNTech declined to comment. Under the EU contract, the two firms have committed to rapidly deliver 200 million doses after regulatory approval for 15.5 euros ($18.8) apiece, EU officials told Reuters in November. The extra 100 million doses would be supplied at the same price, but with the timetable to be negotiated, EU officials said. Pfizer and BioNTech have said they can produce about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, but they are trying to expand manufacturing capacity as global demand surges. The discussions to order more Pfizer shots, even before the first shipments have arrived, underscore the pressure on the EU to secure more supplies to tackle a pandemic that has already killed 470,000 Europeans and is picking up pace in winter. That contrasts with EU negotiators’ more relaxed stance in the summer, when the pandemic was waning and the bloc was sealing supply deals with multiple vaccine makers. At a meeting with EU diplomats in July, a Commission official said the EU had declined an offer of 500 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech because it was too expensive, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows. The Commission and BioNTech declined to comment on this. Pfizer did not reply to a request for comment. With a population of 450 million, the bloc is now relying only on the 200 million Pfizer shots it has already ordered for its first vaccinations, which could start around Christmas. In January, the EU is also expected to approve the shot developed by Moderna, but it has an initial order of just 80 million doses, with an option for 80 million more. The Commision this week has also decided to take up that option immediately, the EU spokesman said. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses per person. Pfizer’s vaccines for the EU are produced at a plant in Belgium, but the factory is currently also supplying the United States, Britain and Canada. “We have millions of doses ready (..) for distribution, depending on regulatory approval,” a spokesman for the plant told Reuters, when asked whether shipments to countries outside the EU could temporarily reduce supplies to the bloc. In total, the EU has booked nearly 1.3 billion vaccines in deals with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Sanofi/GSK and CureVac, and has options to buy another 660 million. But clinical tests of the vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca and Sanofi have suffered delays, and CureVac has not yet begun large-scale trials. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca could submit applications to EU regulators by March, the head of the EU drugs regulator said last week. ($1 = 0.8207 euros)"

Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “In Britain, 140,000 people have been vaccinated by now and the tolerability data are exactly as we have shown in our clinical trial,” Chief Medical Officer Oezlem Tuereci said in a webcast call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said side effects have been mild to moderate and short-lived and similar to those typically seen in other commonly used vaccines.

-4.866297961934371," From Navajo Nation to New Orleans, challenges arise in vaccine roll out LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - From the wide-open spaces of a U.S. tribal nation to urban hospital emergency rooms, doctors, nurses and delivery people are wrestling with challenges in the roll-out of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine - including delays, anxiety and keeping the drug at just the right level of cold. U.S. Public Health Service Lieutenant Commander Erica Harker on Monday delivered a red, portable cooler with 165 doses of the vaccine to a hospital in tiny Ganado, Arizona, one of three drop-offs on a roughly 200-mile (322 km) round trip through the Navajo Nation, accompanied by tribal police. The long-awaited vaccine - which must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F) - comes in pizza-sized plastic boxes containing 975 doses, too much for many rural areas. When pharmacists like Harker crack open those boxes to extract vials, they start a 120-hour countdown to get the vaccine into arms. “It wasn’t anything where we could just lollygag and take our time,” said Harker, who used a sensor to be sure that her deliveries stayed in a temperature range similar to that of a home refrigerator. Big delivery companies experienced problems when a handful of trays bound for California and Alabama in Pfizer’s dry-ice cooled containers hit minus 92 Celsius (minus 197.6°F) in transit, which was too cold, U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on a conference call on Wednesday. “We locked those trays down ... they never left the truck,” Perna said of those shipments. Reserving initial doses for healthcare professionals made the roll-out somewhat easier. “They are anxious to get the vaccine. Out of hundreds of clinical caregivers in round 1, only a handful have declined,” for reasonable issues such as pregnancy, said Marcy Brown, chief operating officer of Southern California’s Hoag Health Network, which experienced a vaccine delivery delay. Oschner Health in Louisiana on Monday got about a tenth of the doses it prepared for at its New Orleans hospital - forcing staffers there to reschedule appointments. “The biggest disappointment was expecting 9,500 doses ... and getting much less,” said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, the system medical director of hospital quality. Despite the headaches that come with the nation’s largest and most complex vaccination campaign in history - healthcare workers said the release of the vaccine was a ray of hope after months of witnessing the deaths of patients and co-workers. It is particularly poignant for workers in heavily hit areas, like the Navajo Nation. The impact of the pandemic “is a memory that will be ingrained in our hearts, our mind and our souls, for a lifetime,” Harker, of the Public Health Service, said."

Saudi Arabia received two shipments of the vaccine on Wednesday. Earlier this week, health authorities asked citizens and residents to register to receive the vaccine, which they said would be given free to all in the country. The kingdom has reported around 360,000 cases coronavirus case with 6,080 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Although it began lifting restrictions several months ago, the country has so far avoided a new wave of infections. Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah was one of the first people to receive the vaccine, rolling up his sleeve to receive the inoculation in front of the media. “Today marks the start of relief to this crisis,” Rabiah told reporters at a vaccination center with more than 550 inoculation stations in Riyadh. “For the past nine months, I anxiously monitored the number of registered cases,” he said. “But today, I will happily monitor the numbers of those getting vaccinated.” Vaccination stations will be set up throughout the kingdom, he said. Saudi Arabia earlier this week asked citizens and residents to sign up for its vaccination program. The first phase will include people most exposed to the disease. The second and third stages will target those over 50 before the vaccine is made available to the wider public. Citizens and foreign residents lined up to receive the vaccine on Thursday morning, as part of the phase 1 roll-out which includes those most exposed and vulnerable to the disease."
-4.866297961934371," Some vaccine doses kept too cold, Pfizer having manufacturing issues, U.S. officials say (Reuters) - The first days of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout have seen unexpected hitches including some vaccines being stored at excessively cold temperatures and Pfizer reporting potential challenges in its vaccine production, U.S. officials said on a Wednesday press call. At least two trays of COVID-19 vaccine doses delivered in California needed to be replaced after their storage temperatures dipped below minus 80 Celsius (minus 112 Fahrenheit), U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on the call. Pfizer’s vaccines, made with partner BioNTech SE, are supposed to be kept at around minus 70C. Officials are investigating whether storing the vaccines at excessively cold temperatures poses a safety or efficacy risk, he said. Pfizer also has reported some production issues, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said. “We will ensure that by whatever mechanism, that we provide them full support to ensure that they can produce for the American people,” Azar said. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its Chief Executive Albert Bourla told CNBC earlier this week the company was asking the U.S. government to use the Defense Production Act to relieve some “critical supply limitations,” particularly in some components. He did not provide further details. Officials did not outline what the specific manufacturing challenges were. Ugur Sahin, chief executive of Pfizer’s partner BioNTech, told Reuters last week that Pfizer’s initial 2020 production target of 100 million doses was halved earlier this year in part over issues with raw materials supply. He said that has since been resolved and manufacturing has begun at scale. Officials said Wednesday they plan to allocate 2 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week and 5.9 million doses of Moderna Inc’s, assuming it receives regulatory authorization. Moderna’s vaccine is likely to be authorized as soon as Friday, they said. The U.S. government is in talks with Pfizer to secure 100 million additional doses, U.S. Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said on the call. It had previously contracted with Pfizer for the option to buy up to 500 million additional doses at an unspecified price. Officials said on Wednesday the United States has already contracted for 300 million vaccine doses between the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and one from Moderna in the first half of next year, and 900 million doses in total from drugmakers developing COVID-19 vaccines. Officials said logistics companies United Parcel Services Inc and FedEx Corp are developing contingency plans for vaccine deliveries this week in response to forecasts of severe snowstorms in some parts of the United States."
-4.866297961934371," FDA says extra doses from vials of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine can be used (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday that extra doses from vials of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine can be used after reports of vaccine doses being thrown away by pharmacists due to labeling confusion. Stat News reported earlier that hospital pharmacists found themselves in the position of throwing away one in every six doses of the first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines distributed this week in the United States because of the confusion over labeling. The Pfizer vials are supposed to hold five doses, according to the labeling, but media reports said pharmacists had found a way for a sixth or even a seventh dose. Without clear approval from the manufacturer, the extra dose had to be discarded. “At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue,” an FDA representative said in an emailed statement. “However, since the vials are preservative free, it is critical to note that any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one,” the statement added. Rollout of the first tranche of 2.9 million doses of the newly authorized vaccine from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE continued for a third full day, with shipments headed to 66 more distribution hubs across the United States. A second vaccine from Moderna Inc could win emergency-use approval from the FDA this week. An additional 2 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 5.9 million doses of the Moderna vaccine could be allocated next week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on a conference call on Wednesday. Two doses of the vaccines, given three or four weeks apart, would be required for each person being inoculated."

The Institute of Public Health (ISP) received the Pfizer request for approval on Nov. 27, and a panel of experts was convened to analyze the vaccine data supplied by the U.S. drugmaker. “This month a plane with the first 20,000 doses of vaccines will land in Chile, allowing us to immediately start vaccinating all who work in the intensive care units of our health system in the regions with the highest incidence of coronavirus,” President Sebastian Pinera said in a televised address. “In January we will continue to receive new doses of vaccines with the aim of vaccinating critical and higher risk populations during the first quarter of 2021, and continuing with other groups during the first half of the year,” he said. Chile has signed a purchase agreement for 10 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, enough to inoculate 5 million people. The vaccine is administered in two doses three weeks apart. Chile’s health minister Enrique Paris said over the weekend the country was logistically prepared to begin administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as it was approved and available. Chilean media reports this week suggested an initial batch of around 30,000 doses could arrive in as little as eight days, and be administered on Dec. 24 and 25, though the health ministry declined to confirm the reports. Paris told Reuters last month the Pfizer vaccine would be used in the first three months of 2021 to vaccinate five million people from among Chile’s most “susceptible” populations, including health workers, prison officers, prisoners, armed forces and people in old age homes. He added that he hopes to have 80% of Chile’s population of 18 million vaccinated by the end of the first half of 2021. Chile has also secured a deal for 14.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and incorporated a clause into its agreement for the Sinovac vaccine trial the country is hosting for preferential purchase of 20 million doses, rising to 60 million doses over three years. It also has signed up to have access to 7.6 million vaccine doses through the global vaccine distribution scheme COVAX, co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization.

-4.281749514770811," Alaskan has allergic reaction after getting Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) - An Alaskan health worker had a serious allergic reaction after getting Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine, but is now stable, public health authorities said on Wednesday. The adverse reaction in the person, minutes after taking the Pfizer shot on Tuesday, was similar to two cases reported last week in Britain. Britain’s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said that most Americans with allergies should be safe to receive the vaccine.

-4.281749514770811," U.S. agency says employers should tread carefully in mandating COVID-19 vaccines (Reuters) - The U.S. agency that enforces workplace discrimination laws said on Wednesday that employers who choose to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 must be prepared to exempt employees with disabilities and religious objections. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued the guidance on its website after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the way for a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech. Many employers have said they are considering mandatory vaccines amid a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases that could lead to some businesses being shut down or limiting their operations. The EEOC said companies that choose not to have vaccines administered at the workplace can require employees to provide proof that they received a vaccination without violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. But the law only permits employers to ask workers why they have refused to be vaccinated if the information is “job related and consistent with business necessity,” the agency said. Workers who refuse to be vaccinated because of medical conditions or religious beliefs cannot be excluded from the workplace, the EEOC said, unless an employer finds that there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation. Working from home, wearing a mask or being reassigned to a more secluded work area could all qualify as reasonable accommodations, depending on the circumstances."
-4.281749514770811," Germany to roll out BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 27 BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against COVID-19 on Dec. 27, with priority given to the elderly in care homes, Berlin city government said on Wednesday. The announcement came as Germany registered its highest daily death toll from COVID-19 and as it entered a strict lockdown in an attempt to bring down soaring infections. As a member of the European Union Germany must wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to approve the vaccine. It is expected to make an announcement on Dec. 21. A senior EU official said on Wednesday the bloc could give its final approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Dec. 23. “The federal states will start vaccination against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 on Dec. 27,” Berlin city government said in a statement after a conference between Health Minister Jens Spahn and health officials from Germany’s 16 states. Spahn has expressed frustration at the lack of approval of a vaccine partly developed in Germany even as countries such as Britain and the United States are rolling it out. The number of registered COVID-19 deaths jumped by a record 952 on Wednesday. The previous record was 598 last Friday. However, Wednesday’s figures are not entirely comparable to previous days because they were inflated by a technical problem in one state, said the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, which collates the data. Fears that the pandemic is spiralling out of control prompted Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors to announce on Sunday a tough lockdown from Dec. 16 until at least Jan. 10. Shops and schools will stay shut in a pre-Christmas tightening of restrictions following a partial lockdown in November, which closed bars and restaurants but failed to contain a second wave of the pandemic. Germany was more successful than many countries in keeping the coronavirus under control in the first wave in the spring but the situation looks different now. The Robert Koch Institute put the number of confirmed cases at 1,379,238, an increase of 27,728. The total death toll in Germany is 23,427. The seven-day incidence of cases ticked up to 180 per 100,000 people from 174 on Tuesday."
-4.281749514770811," Fact check: Six people have not died from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine A social media post has claimed that six people have died from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This claim is false. Six people died during trials, but only two of these volunteers had received the vaccine and none of the deaths were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The post shows an image taken from a TV news broadcast, reporting that six people died during the Pfizer-BioNTech trials (here). This image is in turn captioned: “6 people dead so far from the covid vaccine, plus another 4 have developed Bells Palsy, a paralysis of the face......but hey, this vaccine is ""safe""”. Six participants did die during the 44,000 person Pfizer vaccine trial, two of whom were given the vaccine while the other four people received a placebo (here). Of the vaccine recipients, one had a cardiac arrest 62 days after a second dose of the two-dose vaccination and died three days later, while the other died from arteriosclerosis three days after a first dose of the vaccination (here). One of the placebo recipients died from myocardial infarction, another from haemorrhagic stroke and two others from unknown causes. Briefing documents from the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deemed the deaths to be unrelated to the vaccine: “None of these deaths were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention” (here). They explain: “All deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred, at a similar rate.” (here). The documents also show that it is true that there were four cases of Bell’s Palsy among those who received the vaccine (here). Bell’s Palsy is a sudden weakness or freezing of muscles on one side of the face, which in most cases is temporary (here). The briefing says that the frequency of Bell’s Palsy in the vaccine group is “consistent with the expected background rate in the general population”, adding there is “no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time” (here). The FDA said it would, however, recommend “surveillance” for cases of Bell’s Palsy as the vaccine is sent out to larger groups of people. False. Six people did die during the 44,000 person Pfizer vaccine trials, but only two of them were given the vaccine, the other four were given a placebo of salt and water. None of the deaths were assessed by the investigator as being related to the trial. No causal relationship has been made between the four cases of Bell’s Palsy and the vaccine.

-4.281749514770811," Lebanon to get first batch of COVID-19 vaccines in two months, minister says BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is expected to sign a deal this week for supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine and is set to receive the first batch eight weeks after that, the caretaker health minister said. A surge in infections is straining Lebanon’s healthcare system which has been struggling amid a financial crisis and after a huge port explosion in August smashed up hospitals in Beirut. Adding to the pressures, the economic meltdown has prompted many doctors to emigrate and raised concerns that subsidies on medicines will be removed. Lebanon, with an estimated population of 6 million, has reported 1,210 deaths as a result of COVID-19. Despite the nation’s dire shortage of foreign exchange, the government expects to sign the deal for supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this week, Health Minister Hamad Hassan told Reuters on Monday. The minister initially put the value of the deal at $18 million, but he clarified on Wednesday that this figure was still being negotiated. Officials previously said Lebanon was in talks to secure 1.5 million shots of the vaccine. The first payment of $4 million “was secured” in a meeting with the central bank and outgoing prime minister. “We removed this obstacle,” the minister said, adding that the first batch of vaccines was expected to arrive eight weeks after the signing. Lebanon has also signed up to join COVAX, a global scheme backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to poorer countries. Lebanon’s latest two-week lockdown to curb a surge in infections ended this month. The authorities have struggled to enforce coronavirus restrictions in a country where half the nation has slipped into poverty. As hospitals have filled up, Hassan said Lebanon aimed to add 200 more intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the next two months, raising the total to 700. He urged U.N. agencies and non-governmental organisations to help secure more vaccines for Lebanon, where refugees make up at least a quarter of the population. “Protecting all the communities living in Lebanon ... should be part of the same plan,” he said."
-4.281749514770811," EU could give final approval for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 23 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could give final approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as early as Dec. 23, a senior Commission official said on Wednesday, only two days after a possible green light from the bloc’s regulator. Under EU rules, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends the approval of new medicines and vaccines, but the final decision to allow them onto the market is made by the EU executive Commission after consultation with EU governments. The EMA said on Tuesday it could issue a recommendation on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Dec. 21.. “If this is the case, the European Commission is ready to provide the formal authorisation placing it in the market in supersonic, fast procedures,” Commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas told EU lawmakers. “We can do it in two days,” he said, meaning final approval could come as early as Dec. 23. This further shortens the approval timetable after the EMA brought forward by more than a week its possible decision, originally planned for Dec. 29. The Commission said last week it could approve vaccines within three days of approval by the EMA. Britain and the United States are among countries which have already approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The EMA usually takes at least seven months to issue a recommendation on vaccines after it receives full data from manufacturers, while the Commission can take as long as two months to authorise a vaccine after EMA approval. If the EMA approves the vaccine on Monday, it will have taken just 20 days to assess the shot since it received data from large-clinical trials from Pfizer on Dec. 1. The approval would be a conditional authorisation, meaning the vaccine would continue to be strictly monitored for efficacy and possible side-effects. Available data show that in the short term the vaccine is highly effective against the new coronavirus and causes only mild side-effects. But long-term data are not yet available."

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said an expert panel would convene on Monday Dec. 21 to evaluate the vaccine made by U.S. company Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. It had previously said the meeting could be as late as Dec 29. While EMA’s mandate is to issue recommendations on new medical treatments, the European Commission has the final say on approval and typically follows EMA’s advice. EMA said its expert meeting was brought forward after the companies had provided more data, as requested, and the EU Commission would fast-track its procedures to rule on approval “within days”. Germany should start giving coronavirus shots 24 to 72 hours after the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine gets EU approval and could begin as soon as Christmas, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed those sentiments by saying on Twitter “(It is) Likely that the first Europeans will be vaccinated before end 2020.” Germany, France, Italy and five other European states will coordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns, the countries’ health ministers said in a joint statement on Tuesday. The countries will promote “the coordination of the launch of the vaccination campaigns” and will rapidly share information on how it is proceeding, said the statement, released by Italy. The statement was also signed by the health ministers of Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and EU neighbour Switzerland. Rising infection rates and tighter lockdown measures in many European nations have added to the pressure on the EMA to act as quickly as possible and cast a shadow over the Christmas celebrations. The EMA added any approval would come with a safety monitoring plan, manufacturing controls, an investigation plan for use in children and binding obligations by the manufacturers to provide more efficacy and safety data. Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada on Dec. 9 and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 11. EMA said in early December it planned to issue its view on the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine by Dec 29, and on another candidate developed by Moderna by Jan. 12. Both U.S. biotech firm Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have reported vaccine effectiveness in trials of well above 90% - an unexpectedly high rate.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said an expert panel would convene on Monday Dec. 21 to evaluate the vaccine made by U.S. company Pfizer (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech . It had previously said the meeting could be as late as Dec 29. While EMA's mandate is to issue recommendations on new medical treatments, the European Commission has the final say on approval and typically follows EMA's advice. EMA said its expert meeting was brought forward after the companies had provided more data, as requested, and the EU Commission would fast-track its procedures to rule on approval ""within days"".

-7.529797185231048," Canada administers first COVID-19 vaccines, PM Trudeau in no rush for his shot TORONTO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada kicked off its inoculation campaign against COVID-19 on Monday by injecting frontline healthcare workers and elderly nursing home residents, becoming just the third nation in the world to administer the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The first dose broadcast on live TV went to Anita Quidangen. The personal support worker at the Rekai Centre, a non-profit nursing home for the elderly in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, said she was “excited” to have been first in line. Healthcare workers in masks and white coats applauded after she was injected. “It’s a great relief. Clearly, it may only be the beginning of the end but we sense nevertheless that there will be an end to this pandemic,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, making clear he would not be pressing to have his shot immediately. “We obviously have to give priority to the most vulnerable but the second I have a chance - like all healthy adults - I will do so very visibly and with enthusiasm,” he told French-language broadcaster Radio-Canada. A second wave of the coronavirus is ripping across Canada, forcing several provinces to clamp down again on businesses and limit social gatherings. Canada has so far reported 460,743 cases, most of them in Ontario - the most populous province - and Quebec. “It’s really good news for Canada. It’s really good news for Quebec,” federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said outside of the Maimonides Geriatric Center in Montreal, which also began to immunize patients on Monday. Some 150 residents were set to receive shots at Maimonides on Monday, and 50,000 people will be vaccinated in Quebec by Jan. 4, Quebec’s Health Minister Christian Dube said. More than 60% of Canada’s 13,431 pandemic deaths overall have been in residences for the elderly, down from 80% in the first wave. Canada’s federal health authorities on Friday called for provinces to impose more restrictions. The United States also began inoculations on Monday after the United Kingdom kicked off its national effort last week. The vaccine developed by German biotech BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc is given in two doses, three weeks apart. Canada is expecting to receive 30,000 doses this week and 249,000 total by the end of the year. “It’s an act of love to get vaccinated,” said resident Rabbi Ronnie Cahana, speaking by Zoom, before receiving the shot. Cahana, who is a quadriplegic, said he was overjoyed to hear the vaccine was coming. “I was dancing up and down the halls, and I can’t even walk.” His daughter, Kitra Cahana, who recently returned to Montreal from her home in the United States so she could be present if her father fell ill from COVID-19, said she hopes the vaccine ends her family’s constant worry for his safety. “I think it’s hard to imagine the level of fear and worry that surrounds these homes,” she said. Maimonides resident Beverly Spanier said she hoped being inoculated would restore some of the freedoms lost during the pandemic. “I’d like to see grandchildren able to visit grandparents again,” Spanier said."

The staggering death toll comes as the nation begins a historic inoculation campaign using a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE. Moderna Inc’s vaccine could get approval as soon as this week. The vaccine comes as COVID-19 cases explode across the nation and hospital intensive care units run out of beds. Daily coronavirus cases and deaths have set records multiple times since Thanksgiving holidays with daily fatalities topping 3,000 for the second time last week on Friday, the same day the vaccine got approval from the Food and Drug Administration. It took 27 days to go from 250,000 total U.S. COVID-19 deaths to 300,000 - the fastest 50,000-death jump since the pandemic began. Some models project that deaths could reach 500,000 before vaccines become widely available in the spring and summer. In recent weeks, South Dakota and North Dakota have led the nation in deaths per capita. Overall, New Jersey and New York, early epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, lead the nation in per capita deaths. The United States recently crossed 16 million confirmed cases - the most in the world. According to Reuters analysis, the United States is reporting 91 deaths per 100,000 people, seventh worst in the world on a per capita basis and 2.5 times the rate in Canada. The nation’s hospitals are flooding with COVID-19 patients, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems and providers. There are over 108,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the highest since the first coronavirus case was detected in the country in January."

Even as the first Americans were given the newly approved Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday, health officials warned that infections will continue to rise in the coming weeks as families gather for the holiday season. Deaths increased 12% in the week ended Dec. 13 to a total of about 300,000 since the start of the outbreak, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports. (For a state-by-state interactive, open tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR in an external browser) More than half of U.S. states have enacted new lockdown restrictions as many hospital intensive care units are nearly full. The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has projected that COVID-19 deaths will exceed 500,000 by April 1. The number of new COVID-19 cases rose 15% to almost 1.6 million last week, including a backlog of almost 65,000 cases cases reported by Texas. Even excluding the backlog, the number of new infections last week hit a record high. Rhode Island, Tennessee and Ohio had the highest new cases per capita in the country last week, according to the Reuters analysis. Across the United States, 12% of tests came back positive for the virus, up from 10.5% the prior week, according to data from The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. Out of 50 states, 32 had a positive test rate of 10% or higher. The highest rates were in Iowa and Alabama at 50%. The World Health Organization considers positive test rates above 5% concerning because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered."

Healthcare facilities in four island territories - American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the North Mariana Islands and Guam - are still awaiting their supplies, the spokeswoman told Reuters. The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE was authorized by U.S. regulators for emergency use late on Friday, and the first shipments were sent out on Sunday. The U.S. government is aiming to distribute the first wave of 2.9 million vaccine doses to 636 locations nationwide by the end of the week. U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on a Monday press call that severe storms expected in some parts of the country this week could pose challenges to vaccine shipments. Federal officials are in talks with Pfizer to acquire additional COVID-19 vaccine doses beyond the 100 million that it has already purchased, U.S. Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said on the call, confirming earlier comments from Pfizer’s chief executive. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said on the call that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided $145 million to states to aid with distribution. “Literally millions of doses right now are getting out there to the American people. And by next week, we believe we could be having a second vaccine,” Azar said at a news conference at George Washington University Hospital as part of a vaccination kick-off event. “By the end of February, what you saw today could be replicated a 100 million times, a 100 million shots in arms between the first and booster vaccine,” Azar said. Most doses delivered in the United States will be sourced from Pfizer’s U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, including its factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Some of the initial doses were sourced from a facility in Belgium, Perna said. He said he expects subsequent doses to be sourced from within the United States. U.S. officials are hoping Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently being reviewed by U.S. regulators, will be available for distribution as early as the beginning of next week, Perna said.

""It didn't feel any different from taking any other vaccine,"" Lindsay said. ""I feel hopeful today, relieved. I feel like healing is coming. I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a very painful time in our history. ""I want to instill public confidence that the vaccine is safe,"" she added. ""This is what heroes look like,"" Cuomo wrote in the caption of a photo of Lindsay, wearing a mask and staring resolutely ahead, that he posted on Twitter. Similar scenes played out at select hospitals in other cities, including Los Angeles, where California Governor Gavin Newsom applauded as a Kaiser Permanente emergency room nurse rolled up her sleeve for a needle jab on live television. ""It's been an incredible morning. It's historic,"" said Dr. Leonardo Seoane after he received a shot at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, where he has led some of the clinical trials that found the vaccine 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 illness. The made-for-TV events - the first U.S. coronavirus immunizations outside of clinical trials - were part of a broad campaign by public health authorities and political leaders to reassure Americans of the vaccine's safety as they launched a national immunization program of unprecedented scope. Developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE , the vaccine, given as two doses three weeks apart, won U.S. emergency-use authorization on Friday. By day's end on Monday, vaccine shipments had made it to nearly all of the 145 U.S. distribution sites pre-selected to receive the initial batch of doses, with a number of major hospital systems launching immunizations immediately. ""This is a race against time,"" said Greg Adams, chairman and CEO of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. U.S. officials said no major hiccups were reported.

As part of a national security protocol aimed at ensuring continuity of government in the event of an emergency, senior leaders in the executive branch, Congress and judiciary were also being offered early vaccines. Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller got his on Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, apparently the first Cabinet-level official inoculated. It will take months before vaccines become widely available to the public at large, and health officials have warned Americans to remain diligent about social distancing and the wearing of face masks to curb virus transmissions.

The greenback last traded little changed to 90.7040, down 0.07%, as an intensive care unit nurse became the first person in the United States to receive the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE on Monday. Its arrival provided some relief as the country passed the grim milestone of 300,000 lives lost on Monday. “It’s one of those days where we are settling down and understanding just how successful we may be in distributing these vaccines,” said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus, Inc. “That has created a very strong risk-on sentiment.” The vaccine comes as negotiators in the U.S. Congress were nearing agreement on Monday on a massive government spending deal that would avoid a government shutdown and could serve as the vehicle to pass a fresh round of aid to a coronavirus-hit nation. Lawmakers, facing a midnight Friday deadline, were scurrying to put the finishing touches on a $1.4 trillion spending bill for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. A $908 billion bipartisan COVID-19 relief plan will be split into two packages, a person briefed on the matter said. “I think you’re going to have some optimism that maybe we’re going to be able to get some relief push through,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange broker OANDA. “And that is going to be very negative for the dollar.” The dollar index earlier fell as low as 90.419, the lowest since April 2018. Investors will also be playing “catch up” with their positions related to Brexit as Britain and the European Union committed extended their Sunday deadline in an effort to strike a trade deal, Moya said.

Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Monday as investors gained confidence in risk-raking. The risky Australian and New Zealand dollars were also up, with the New Zealand dollar reaching its strongest since April 2018 at 0.7086, up 0.08% versus the dollar. The Aussie - a liquid proxy for risk - was last up 0.07% versus the dollar at 0.7539. The euro rose around 0.31% versus the dollar, at $1.2146.

-8.708970413075974," Fact check: Photo does not show three recipients of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine that developed Bell’s palsy A photo circulating on social media has been falsely labelled to claim it shows three out of the four recipients of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that developed Bell’s palsy - a condition, temporary in most cases, of partial facial paralysis. This image, which appears to show some sort of paralysis caused by Bell’s palsy, has been circulating at least since 2019. A tweet with the mislabeled photo here (archived version archive.vn/jeulB )  reads: “Vaccine informed is a more accurate name. These are 3 of the 4 volunteers who developed Bells palsy after being vaccinated with the Pfizer (SIC) covid experimental vaccine. Masks anyone?” Other posts are visible on Instagram here and Facebook here , here The same photo appears in an article about Bell’s Palsy here which, according to the website, was last updated on Nov. 20, 2019. On Dec. 11, the FDA said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial ( here ). According to the FDA’s briefing document dated Dec. 10 here , Bell’s palsy was reported in four vaccine participants and none in the placebo group, out of the 44,000 total participants of the late-stage vaccine trial ( here ). But the FDA stated that “the observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time.” Still, the agency recommended surveillance of this condition once the vaccine is distributed into larger populations. Reuters previously clarified other claims around the side effects of the Pfizer vaccine here . As explained by Johns Hopkins Medicine here , Bell’s palsy is an episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis, that “usually resolves on its own and causes no complications.” While its cause is unknown, it is thought to be caused by “inflammation affecting the body’s immune system”. It is associated with the body’s response to viral infection, and with other conditions such as diabetes. The symptoms of the condition, which include headache and pain, twitching or weakness in one side of the face, begin suddenly and it usually worsens within the next 48 hours, leading to the face drooping and a lopsided smile ( here ). Some posts on social referring to the FDA’s findings claim that Bell’s palsy is a permanent condition ( here ). Experts note that in most cases, the weakness is temporary and significantly improves within weeks, “with full recovery in about six months”  ( here ). The FDA briefing states that one of the four cases “was reported as resolved with sequelae within three days after onset”.  (here) Another post on social media ( here ) claims Bell’s palsy “is related to strokes”. While this condition may trigger similar symptoms, the conditions have different causes ( here , here , here, here ).  Among the examples of Bell's Palsy developed after the administering of various vaccines found by Reuters ( here   , here , here ) some have been determined to be a “theoretically possible” rare complication, though not proven (  here ) and most others were not causally associated at all ( here   , here ). The Institute for Vaccine Safety, Johns Hopkins University explains that vaccines for varicella, tetanus and diphtheria prevent Bell’s palsy by protecting against these infections that have been associated with the condition ( here ) Partly false. The photo does not show three out of four recipients of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that developed Bell’s palsy, a partial face paralysis considered to be a temporary condition. According to the FDA, these cases were not considered to be necessarily caused by the vaccine. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

-8.708970413075974," Pressure mounts on EU drug regulator to approve Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine BRUSSELS(Reuters) - Europe’s drug regulator is under increasing pressure to quickly approve the COVID-19 vaccine developed by U.S. giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, officials said, as inoculations get started in Britain and the United States. The push underscores the frictions between regulators and governments wishing to curb the pandemic that has killed more than 1.6 million people worldwide. Four EU sources told Reuters that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been under pressure from the European Commission and EU governments to approve vaccines more quickly. One EMA official said on Monday pressure had increased on the agency from EU governments “through usual channels of communications” after Dec. 2, when the British regulator granted an emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. A second source familiar with EMA’s work confirmed pressure has increased after approvals elsewhere. Britain’s regulator used a procedure allowed under EU rules in exceptional cases, but EU authorities declined to follow the same route because they said it was not appropriate for vaccines that need thorough assessment. “All the necessary data on BioNTech are available,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “UK + US have already granted approval. An assessment of the data and an approval by EMA should happen as fast as possible.” EMA said in emailed statements to Reuters in recent days that it was not under political pressure to be faster. It declined to comment on Monday about Spahn’s remarks. The European Commission denied exerting pressure on EMA for a faster approval. The EU regulator received data from Pfizer’s large-scale trials on Dec. 1 and said it would decide on possible conditional approval of the vaccine by Dec. 29 “at the latest”. Officials have said the are working night and day through December, with night shifts, to complete the evaluation. It usually takes the agency at least seven months to approve a vaccine after it gets full data from manufacturers. EU officials have repeatedly said that no shortcuts would be taken, and a faster assessment was possible because preliminary data on the vaccine had been shared by Pfizer since October. The breakneck pace to deploy in less than 12 months vaccines that normally take 10 years to be developed is mentioned in global polls as one of the main concerns about the safety of shots and could undermine confidence in vaccinations, experts said. Continental European countries have traditionally high rates of vaccine hesitancy. The British regulator modified its warning on the use of the Pfizer vaccine after two cases of serious allergic reactions emerged among those who received the vaccine in the first day of the rollout on Dec. 8. The United States began shipping its first shots of the vaccine over the weekend."

""We reserved ahead of time, we made agreements, what we want now is for the agreements to be honored,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. Lopez Obrador acknowledged that companies were experiencing heavy demand for the vaccines, but said it was important that the accords reached were respected ""on time."" Mexico has signed purchase agreements for vaccines with several companies, including from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and China's CanSino Biologics Inc (6185.HK). Deputy Foreign Minister Martha Delgado told broadcaster Televisa that Mexico will this Monday put in an order for vaccine doses from Pfizer, which she believed could arrive in five to eight days. Initial doses would come from its plant in Belgium, she said. However, Delgado noted that an executive order signed last week by U.S. President Donald Trump to prioritize U.S. citizens in distribution of U.S.-made vaccines might delay delivery of subsequent vaccine doses arriving from the United States. read more"

-9.9206892948994," RPT-India readies for 600 mln COVID vaccine jabs; to use standard cold storage - top govt expert (Repeats Friday’s story with no changes to the text) * India ready for vaccines needing 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage * AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech, RDIF’s Sputnik V among frontrunners * Pfizer, Moderna unlikely to be able to supply India with volumes until H2 2021 NEW DELHI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - India will deploy its vast election machinery to deliver 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months through conventional cold chain systems, the expert leading the initiative said on Friday. The government has lined up cold storage facilities with temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F), said V.K. Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for COVID-19 that advises India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Paul said these preparations meet the requirements of what he said were the four emerging candidates in the race for India’s vaccine. “The four that I can see, including Serum, Bharat, Zydus, and Sputnik need normal cold chain. I see no problem for these vaccines,” he told Reuters in an interview. Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, is already mass producing and stockpiling AstraZeneca’s Covishield shot, while Indian biotech players Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are developing their own vaccine candidates. And last month, Indian pharmaceutical player Hetero inked a deal with Russia’s RDIF to manufacture over 100 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine per year in India. The government expects the first approvals “very soon” from the independent drug regulator for emergency use, he said. “I am hoping at the earliest because we are ready.” The government, however, was yet to have formal talks on pricing and had no firm purchase orders, he said. “The Indian companies know the government will give a fair and reasonable price.” At present, Indian regulators are considering three vaccines for emergency use authorisation, including those from Pfizer Inc , AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech. But, Pfizer’s limited stockpiles and its extreme storage condition requirements at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, would likely limit its use in India, which lacks such infrastructure. “In a theoretical scenario, where there is no vaccine with conventional cold chain requirement, minus 70 degrees Celsius capacities will have to be created, and we will do so,” Paul said. Paul said the government is also in talks with Moderna , which also has requirements for ultra-cold storage. India does not anticipate supplies from either Pfizer or Moderna until the second half of next year, said Paul. “We would like to work with them (Moderna) to make that vaccine available in India, and (ensure) that vaccine is also manufactured in India - for us and for other countries. This is the call we have given to Pfizer also and we are in touch with them as well.” Paul said India may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator. “As of now, it is a norm or standard operating procedure that any vaccine marketed in India should have human study results from the Indian subjects,” he said. India has the world’s second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, but its death rate has been far lower. Still, Paul said the immediate task was to protect lives and the government had prepared a plan to administer vaccines to 300 million people - or 600 million doses at two jabs each - in the first part of the programme. This would be made up of 260 million people above the age of 50, an estimated 10 million below the age of 50 with serious co-morbidities and 30 million frontline workers, who have borne the brunt of infections. “The way it looks as of now, optimistically, it appears possible to cover the above population of 300 million in six to eight months’ time.”"

-9.9206892948994," First U.S. shots in COVID-19 vaccine campaign coming Monday, Army general says (Reuters) - The first shots in a massive U.S. COVID-19 vaccine campaign will be administered as early as Monday, with Pfizer Inc and partners aiming to start shipments across the hard-hit country on Sunday, an Army general organizing the rollout said. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of the first wave of 2.9 million shots this month, with healthcare worker inoculations as soon as Monday and nursing home residents by the end of next week, U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on a Saturday press call. Despite months of preparation, distributing and administering the vaccine to as many as 330 million recipients poses a major logistical challenge, he said. The vaccine has complex shipping requirements and must be stored at -70 Celsius. “We have a lot of work to do. We are not taking a victory lap. We know road ahead of us will be tough,” Perna said. Pfizer’s vaccine was authorized for use by U.S. regulators on Friday. Cases are surging in the United States, with thousands of deaths per day, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity. More than 295,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Doses of the vaccine from U.S.-based Pfizer and German partner BioNTech will be delivered to 145 locations around the country on Monday, Perna said. The remainder of the 636 delivery locations selected by U.S. states and territories will receive doses on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, adding that every week going forward Pfizer will have more doses ready for distribution and administration. Within three weeks, the vaccine program known as Operation Warp Speed should be able to get Pfizer’s shots to any healthcare facility in the country, Perna said. Pfizer is working with logistics companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp to distribute the vaccines. They must coordinate deliveries of doses with shipments of other products needed to store and administer vaccines, such as syringes, dry ice, and protective equipment for healthcare workers. “The final mile is going to be the most difficult. Once it hits the hospital or nursing homes, they also have to keep the vaccine under temperature control,” said Cathy Morrow Roberson, a logistics consultant and former UPS analyst. “This massive clock is ticking, there is no room for error,” she added. More U.S. residents will be eligible in January, when those in the highest priority populations are expected to have had an opportunity to receive a vaccine. With distribution imminent, top regulators sought to reassure Americans that the record fast pace was warranted and had not sacrificed safety. “We worked quickly based on the urgency of this pandemic, not because of any other external pressure,” U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during a press conference earlier in the day. The United States on Friday evening granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine for people aged 16 and older. The immunization was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a late-stage trial. It is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the United States. Britain, Canada and three other countries have already authorized the vaccine.

-14.104822078153353," CDC advisory panel recommends COVID-19 vaccine for widespread use (Reuters) -A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel on Saturday recommended the nation’s first COVID-19 vaccine, helping clear the way for public health authorities to begin the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted 11 to 0 to recommend the vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE as appropriate for Americans 16 and older. There were three abstentions due to prior conflicts of interest. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, clearing it for use by the general public. The CDC is expected to consider and approve the recommendations by the panel in short order. State and local public health authorities will use FDA and CDC guidance as they administer the first 2.9 million doses of the vaccine released to state, cities, and territories by the federal government. ACIP already recommended that authorities should prioritize healthcare workers and nursing home residents for the first doses that become available. It then falls on states and certain large cities to start administering the vaccine to local hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals are expected to start vaccinating their employees as early as Monday. The CDC panel discussed clinical considerations for certain patients like pregnant women and people with severe allergies, who were not studied in clinical trials, but the panel did not formally vote on these considerations. Officials presenting at the meeting said that while there is not yet data on how the vaccine may impact pregnant women, pregnant women could decide for themselves whether or not to be vaccinated and should consult with their doctor. They said that pregnant women should take acetaminophen, more commonly known by its brand-name Tylenol, if they get a fever after vaccination, which is one of the vaccine’s side effects, as fevers can pose risks to pregnancy. In the same section of the meeting, officials also said patients with severe allergies to vaccines should not get it at this time. A fact sheet about the vaccine, released with its FDA emergency use authorization, also says that patients with a history of anaphylaxis due to severe allergies should not get the vaccine. Experts on the call discussed how to refine language of what qualifies as a severe allergic reaction to ensure that only those who are at risk are excluded from vaccination. Various experts cautioned that data still needed to be collected and their advice about who should get it may change as more information becomes available."
-14.104822078153353," AstraZeneca to buy Alexion for $39 billion to expand in immunology FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Britain’s AstraZeneca has agreed to buy U.S. drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals for $39 billion in its largest ever deal, diversifying away from its fast-growing cancer business in a bet on rare-disease and immunology drugs. The deal comes in a week that AstraZeneca said it was conducting further research to confirm whether its COVID-19 vaccine could be 90% effective, potentially slowing its rollout, and as a rival shot from Pfizer was launched in Britain and approved for use in the United States. The British company said on Saturday that Alexion shareholders would receive $60 in cash and about $115 worth of equity per share - either in AstraZeneca’s UK-traded ordinary shares or in dollar-denominated American Depositary Shares. Based on a reference average ADR price of $54.14, that implies a total price of $175 per share. Alexion shares closed at around $121 apiece on Friday. “It is a tremendous opportunity for us to accelerate our development in immunology, getting into a new segment of disease, a new segment of physicians, and patients we haven’t been able to cover so far,” AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told a media call. Alexion’s best-selling drug is Soliris, used against a range of rare immune-disorders including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which causes anaemia and blood clots, and whose revenue rose 3.6% in the first nine months to $3 billion. AstraZeneca hopes that an improved version of Soliris called Ultomiris has an even larger market potential. It expects more growth from introducing the target’s rare-disease treatments to China and other emerging markets. The British firm said the boards of both companies had approved the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. AstraZeneca was once seen as leading the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, but has fallen behind Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, as well as Moderna, whose shots have shown greater efficacy in late-stage clinical trials. With a planned capital increase of about $25 billion after the deal closure, Soriot is looking to harness a strong advance by AstraZeneca stock, driven by the stellar growth of new cancer drugs. The shares have climbed about 70% through the past three years. A precursor cash call, on a much smaller scale, was a $3.5 billion issue last year to fund the purchase of rights to cancer drug Enhertu from Daiichi Sankyo. Despite generating billions in cash from treatments such as Soliris, one of the most expensive drugs in the world costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, Alexion shares have struggled in recent years as investors have worried about competition heating up. That had led it to be seen as a possible bid target. Hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management has urged Alexion to seek a buyer and in May spoke out publicly. The fund, which had held private meetings with the company, said CEO Ludwig Hantson’s go-it-alone approach had failed to gain traction and opposed its plan to buy rivals to diversify its research pipeline. Elliott first invested in Alexion in 2017 when the share price was only slightly lower than Friday’s close of $120.98. Elliott did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AstraZeneca said it expected the deal to immediately boost core earnings and to deliver pretax synergy gains of around $500 million per year. It also expects around $650 million in one-time cash costs during the three years following completion. Speaking on an analyst call, 61-year-old Soriot said the deal should put to rest speculation he was on his way out, as he was determined to stay on board to see the strategic benefits of the transaction delivered. Soriot also told reporters the deal was the result of exclusive talks and no competitive bidder was involved. AstraZeneca finance chief Marc Dunoyer said a capital increase for the equity component of the transaction would take place on closure of the deal. On AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Soriot said it wasn’t yet clear if the company would need results from a U.S. clinical trial before filing for approval with U.S. regulators. Assuming positive results from that trial, the company should be able to submit the vaccine to U.S. regulators within the next six weeks, he added."
-14.104822078153353," Most Americans with allergies should be safe to get Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine: FDA (Reuters) - Top U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulators said on Saturday that most Americans with allergies should be safe to receive the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany’s Biotech SE. The FDA, which authorized the nation’s first COVID-19 vaccine on Friday night, said that only people who have previously had severe allergic reactions to vaccines or ingredients in this particular vaccine should avoid getting the shot. “We’re telling people that unless they’ve had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine, or one of its components, they can receive it,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA division that authorized the vaccine, said at a press conference. After Britain began inoculations this week, two people with severe allergies reported side effects and the British medicine regulator advised that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. “About 1.6% of the population has had a severe allergic reaction of some sort or another to a food or some environmental aspect and we would really not like to have that many people not be able to receive the vaccine,” Marks said. The vaccine is seen as a key tool in stemming the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 300,000 people in the United States. The FDA advised people with allergies to consult with their doctors to make sure that they are not allergic to any of the component of the vaccine. Pfizer executives said on Friday that there had been no cases of severe allergic reactions to the vaccine during its nearly 44,000 volunteer late-stage clinical trial. That trial excluded people with a history of severe allergic reactions to any vaccine or to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s ingredients. They said there were no anaphylactic episodes related to the vaccine in the trial, which did include about 6,000 participants respectively in both the vaccine and placebo groups with a range of allergic conditions such as pollen allergies and food allergies. Those participants had a history of symptoms including anaphylaxis."

-14.104822078153353," U.S. FDA authorizes Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use (Reuters) -The United States said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in a country where the pandemic has killed more than 295,000 people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial. It said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses this month. BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said the vaccine “will help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality.” U.S. health authorities, shipping services, hospitals and pharmacies have been readying a nationwide inoculation campaign. Pfizer said it would start shipping immediately and state public health systems have been planning to begin shots as early as Monday. The government plans to accelerate vaccinations in the coming weeks and months, especially if a second vaccine from Moderna Inc is quickly approved. An advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet on Saturday to make crucial recommendations about whether some groups such as pregnant women and 16-year-olds should be immunized. The authorization comes as cases are surging in the United States, with thousands of death per day, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems. “It is one step in a sequence of steps that will bring this pandemic to an end,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He added: “A lot of people will be infected, a lot will be hospitalized and a lot will die before the vaccine is able to have a meaningful impact on spread.” The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was first approved in Britain earlier this month, and UK residents began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Canada also authorized the vaccine and expects to start inoculations next week. Mexico, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved the Pfizer vaccine. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a video posted on Twitter, trumpeted the achievement and blamed China for the pandemic. Critics have said his focus on China was aimed at deflecting attention from his missteps in combating the pandemic. “The United States is the first nation in the world to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine. Today’s achievement is a reminder of America’s unlimited potential,” Trump said. Others with vaccines in advanced development include Moderna, which could win emergency U.S. authorization as soon as next week, AstraZeneca Plc with Oxford University, and Johnson & Johnson. BioNTech began developing the vaccine in January, using a technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) that had yet to produce an approved product. The technology uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic part of the new coronavirus, which the immune system learns to recognize as an invader. BioNTech struck a development deal with Pfizer in March. The vaccine comes with complex distribution challenges as it must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or supplies of dry ice. Moderna’s vaccine employs the same technology but does not need to be stored at sub-Arctic temperatures. Pfizer has developed a special shipping container that will be filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling. Many states are concerned about whether there is enough dry ice for shipments to rural areas that lack the specialized freezers, but Pfizer believes there should be sufficient supply. U.S. health officials have said they will have enough to supply all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021. ‘HERD IMMUNITY’ The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - through its Operation Warp Speed virus development program and could negotiate for more. The status of those talks are unclear. Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down. The United States has agreed to buy 200 million doses of Moderna’s two-dose vaccine.

Next week, the state Institute of Public Health will review data on the performance of the vaccine, which is also expected to be used in the United States. Chilean authorities will make an official decision based on the review of that data. “I cannot give you any dates, but we will make every effort ... to start the coronavirus vaccination program as soon as possible,” Paris said in televised remarks. He encouraged people to keep wearing face masks and practice social distancing, considering that it will not be possible to complete the immunization campaign by the end of the first half of 2021. Some 15,846 people in Chile have died of COVID-19 so far."
-14.104822078153353," India readies for 600 million COVID vaccine jabs; to use standard cold storage - top government expert NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will deploy its vast election machinery to deliver 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months through conventional cold chain systems, the expert leading the initiative said on Friday. The government has lined up cold storage facilities with temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F), said V.K. Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for COVID-19 that advises India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Paul said these preparations meet the requirements of what he said were the four emerging candidates in the race for India’s vaccine. “The four that I can see, including Serum, Bharat, Zydus, and Sputnik need normal cold chain. I see no problem for these vaccines,” he told Reuters in an interview. Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, is already mass producing and stockpiling AstraZeneca’s Covishield shot, while Indian biotech players Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are developing their own vaccine candidates. And last month, Indian pharmaceutical player Hetero inked a deal with Russia’s RDIF to manufacture over 100 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine per year in India. The government expects the first approvals “very soon” from the independent drug regulator for emergency use, he said. “I am hoping at the earliest because we are ready.” The government, however, was yet to have formal talks on pricing and had no firm purchase orders, he said. “The Indian companies know the government will give a fair and reasonable price.” At present, Indian regulators are considering three vaccines for emergency use authorisation, including those from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech. But, Pfizer’s limited stockpiles and its extreme storage condition requirements at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, would likely limit its use in India, which lacks such infrastructure. “In a theoretical scenario, where there is no vaccine with conventional cold chain requirement, minus 70 degrees Celsius capacities will have to be created, and we will do so,” Paul said. Paul said the government is also in talks with Moderna, which also has requirements for ultra-cold storage. India does not anticipate supplies from either Pfizer or Moderna until the second half of next year, said Paul. “We would like to work with them (Moderna) to make that vaccine available in India, and (ensure) that vaccine is also manufactured in India - for us and for other countries. This is the call we have given to Pfizer also and we are in touch with them as well.” Paul said India may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator. “As of now, it is a norm or standard operating procedure that any vaccine marketed in India should have human study results from the Indian subjects,” he said. India has the world’s second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, but its death rate has been far lower. Still, Paul said the immediate task was to protect lives and the government had prepared a plan to administer vaccines to 300 million people - or 600 million doses at two jabs each - in the first part of the programme. This would be made up of 260 million people above the age of 50, an estimated 10 million below the age of 50 with serious co-morbidities and 30 million frontline workers, who have borne the brunt of infections. “The way it looks as of now, optimistically, it appears possible to cover the above population of 300 million in six to eight months’ time.”"
-14.104822078153353," What's next for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine after UK rollout (Reuters) - Britain began the mass-vaccination of its population against COVID-19 on Tuesday, becoming the first Western nation to do so in a global endeavour that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history. Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother from Britain, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer vaccine outside of a trial following its rapid clinical approval on Dec. 2. Pfizer said in November final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective. Below are the main details of the vaccine, progress on supply deals and potential approvals: - The vaccine, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity. - mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. - The new technology has not been approved for any other vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA. - The vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course. - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay. - BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin has said he is optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last. - India is accelerating its review of Pfizer’s vaccine to for emergency use, a senior official said on Dec.7. - Canadian health authorities could approve the vaccine within the next week, medical officials indicated on Dec. 3. - The European Medicines Agency said on Dec. 1 that if its experts have received enough data from Pfizer about the vaccine, the agency will complete its reviews by Dec. 29. - Pfizer and BioNTech submitted approval requests for their vaccine candidates to the European drugs regulator on Dec. 1. - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July, and is expected to give more indications of its use this week. - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April. - Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month. - Trials are continuing globally in 154 locations, including in Germany, Japan, Brazil and in several locations within the United States in participants aged 12 years and older. The global Phase I/II/III trials enrolled about 44,000 volunteers. (bit.ly/3lfaaeF)"
-14.104822078153353," UPDATE 4-U.S. FDA authorizes Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use The United States said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in a country where the pandemic has killed more than 295,000 people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech , which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial. It said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses this month. BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said the vaccine ""will help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality."" U.S. health authorities, shipping services, hospitals and pharmacies have been readying a nationwide inoculation campaign. read more Pfizer said it would start shipping immediately and state public health systems have been planning to begin shots as early as Monday. The government plans to accelerate vaccinations in the coming weeks and months, especially if a second vaccine from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) is quickly approved. An advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet on Saturday to make crucial recommendations about whether some groups such as pregnant women and 16-year-olds should be immunized. The authorization comes as cases are surging in the United States, with thousands of death per day, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems. ""It is one step in a sequence of steps that will bring this pandemic to an end,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He added: ""A lot of people will be infected, a lot will be hospitalized and a lot will die before the vaccine is able to have a meaningful impact on spread."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was first approved in Britain earlier this month, and UK residents began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Canada also authorized the vaccine and expects to start inoculations next week. read more Mexico, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved the Pfizer vaccine. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a video posted on Twitter, trumpeted the achievement and blamed China for the pandemic. Critics have said his focus on China was aimed at deflecting attention from his missteps in combating the pandemic. ""The United States is the first nation in the world to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine. Today's achievement is a reminder of America's unlimited potential,"" Trump said. COMPLEX CHALLENGES Others with vaccines in advanced development include Moderna, which could win emergency U.S. authorization as soon as next week, AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) with Oxford University, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). BioNTech began developing the vaccine in January, using a technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) that had yet to produce an approved product. The technology uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic part of the new coronavirus, which the immune system learns to recognize as an invader. BioNTech struck a development deal with Pfizer in March. The vaccine comes with complex distribution challenges as it must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or supplies of dry ice. Moderna's vaccine employs the same technology but does not need to be stored at sub-Arctic temperatures. Pfizer has developed a special shipping container that will be filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling. Many states are concerned about whether there is enough dry ice for shipments to rural areas that lack the specialized freezers, but Pfizer believes there should be sufficient supply. U.S. health officials have said they will have enough to supply all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021. 'HERD IMMUNITY' The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - through its Operation Warp Speed virus development program and could negotiate for more. The status of those talks are unclear. Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down. The United States has agreed to buy 200 million doses of Moderna's two-dose vaccine. The government also has supply deals with J&J and AstraZeneca, but authorization of those vaccines are not imminent. Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said if distribution goes well and enough Americans agree to get vaccinated, relief for a pandemic weary nation may be on the horizon, with enough immunizations providing safety for the 'herd' of collective society.

A late-stage trial testing the potential vaccine excluded participants who had a prior history of severe allergic reactions to any vaccine or to the constituents of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, said Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development. “We’ve not had any anaphylactic episodes related to the vaccine,” Gruber said during a panel meeting of independent advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The trial included about 6,000 participants respectively in both the vaccine and placebo groups with a history of a range of allergic conditions like pollen allergy, food allergy, all the way up to anaphylaxis, Pfizer executive Susan Mather said. Anaphylaxis is an overreaction by the body’s immune system that could sometimes be life-threatening. The comments follow British medicine regulator’s advice that people with a history of significant allergic reactions do not get the Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine after two people reported adverse effects.

Canada would receive 30,000 doses next week and up to 249,000 by the end of the year. The following are the current plans by the 10 provinces and three territories to start inoculations: * Quebec: Immunization in Canada’s worst-affected province may start on Dec. 14 at two nursing homes, one in Montreal (Maimonides) and in Quebec City (Centre d’hébergement Saint-Antoine). The initial batch is expected to be 4,875 doses. * Ontario: Canada’s most populous province and the second-worst affected province will start immunization on Dec. 15 to healthcare workers at University Health Network in Toronto and Ottawa Hospital. It expects to receive roughly 6,000 doses on Monday that it will split between the two cities, the head of the province’s vaccine deployment program said, which it will use to vaccinate over 2,500 people. Enough doses to vaccinate 90,000 people could be received by the end of December. * Alberta: The province with the third-highest cases will receive 3,900 doses in time to start vaccinations on Dec. 16 at two sites, one in Edmonton, one in Calgary. * British Columbia: 3,900 doses will be received initially, with vaccinations to be administered in Vancouver and a location in Fraser health region. * Saskatchewan: Will use its initial shipment of 1,950 doses to give the first of two required shots to 1,950 people. Immunization will take place at Regina General Hospital. * Manitoba: Expects the initial 1,950 doses to arrive sometime next week. These will vaccinate 900 people, with the province holding back some of the first supply to give the same people their second shots a few weeks later. * Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut: The territories are not expected to receive part of the initial Pfizer batch given the challenges of transporting it at ultra-cold temperatures. * New Brunswick: Expects to receive 1,950 doses on Dec. 14 and the vaccines will be administered at Miramichi Hospital. * Nova Scotia: Doses are expected to arrive on Dec. 15 and will be used for vaccinations at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre in Halifax. * Prince Edward Island: Expects to receive 1,950 doses next week. * Newfoundland & Labrador: Will start vaccinations in St. John’s next week.

Since then, a photograph of a patient who received the vaccine at Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, UK (here), has been shared online. The photo shows a healthcare professional who is standing alongside a patient wearing a polo shirt, touching his arm at the usual position of vaccination. In a screenshot of the post shared on social media, a caption reads: “He was in such a dash to get it, he didn’t even bother to roll up his sleeve!” On social media, some have claimed that this is evidence that the vaccination never happened, and that the photo was staged. “It’s so blatant and laughable. Open eyes up peeps. It’s a pantomime”, one social media user said in a comment (here). However, this photograph was not taken to show the patient being injected. It was taken before the injection, while the healthcare worker was explaining how and where the vaccine would be administered.

Soumya Swaminathan said the global health body could decide on Pfizer’s vaccine candidate in the next “couple of weeks”, and later said it could also review Moderna’s and AstraZeneca’s candidates in a few weeks. WHO approval could allow a vaccine to be deployed in some countries where national medical regulators have not yet been able to evaluate it. Swaminathan said at least 10 companies had expressed an interest in or submitted a request for emergency approval for vaccine candidates. Pfizer’s vaccine has already received emergency approval in Britain and Canada, and could receive U.S. approval within days. The first British recipients were vaccinated this week. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said nearly a billion doses of vaccines had been secured for the COVAX programme to provide shots for poor- and middle-income countries, with 189 countries participating. WHO officials described the arrival of vaccines as a major development, but stressed repeatedly that it would take a long time before vaccines could be rolled out worldwide. In the meantime, the epidemic is worsening in much of the world, and countries must continue to take other steps to curb infection, such as testing, tracing, isolating cases and social distancing. Tedros noted that coronavirus deaths had increased 60% in the last six weeks. Swaminathan said the supply of vaccines was likely to be limited for the first half of 2021. WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said: “Vaccines represent a major, major light at the end of the tunnel, but we have much work to do to make that a reality.” Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to Tedros, added: “It is a long tunnel, to give it to you straight. It is a long tunnel.”"
-14.670235996359452," Where water turns to snow: S.Korean ultra-cold warehouse prepares to store Pfizer's vaccine PYEONGTAEK, South Korea (Reuters) - Some of the rooms in Korea Superfreeze Inc’s coldest warehouse are so frigid that a cup of warm water thrown into one will immediately turn into snow. Located 65 km (40 miles) from Seoul and boasting temperatures frostier than an Antarctic winter, the facility would be the best, perhaps only, place in South Korea suitable for bulk storage of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, says company CEO Kim Jin-ha. “As soon as we heard about the Pfizer vaccine, we started getting ready... other options wouldn’t work,” Kim told Reuters, adding that the warehouse’s use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to keep temperatures cool trumped electricity. Warehouses which use electricity would have difficulty maintaining the -70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) required by the vaccine for storage and carry the risk of the temperature rising during a power blackout, he said. The company, which is backed by Goldman Sachs and SK Holdings Co Ltd, has been in talks with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency since early November and while nothing is yet decided, expectations are high it will land a contract. The agency has asked Korea Superfreeze to provide plans and cost estimates for storing and distributing vaccines, including how it would handle a scenario where vaccines would be shipped to 260 different locations, Kim said. South Korea has arranged to buy 20 million doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The country also has deals for 20 million doses each for the vaccines developed by Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc/Oxford University and for another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson. In total, that would be enough to inoculate 34 million people in a country of 51.8 million and shipments are expected to begin no later than March. Kim said, however, it was not clear to him if the agency would tap the company for vaccines other than Pfizer’s which have less onerous cold storage requirements. Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20 C while AstraZeneca’s vaccine needs only normal fridge temperatures. To accommodate Pfizer’s vaccine, Korea Superfreeze is planning a dedicated passageway and elevator so there is no interference from outside temperatures. Once it confirms it has a contract, it will begin construction which may take 2-3 months. The warehouse also has 220 closed-circuit cameras that monitor resting cargo round the clock, Kim said. He added that South Korea and Japan were the only countries with LNG-powered facilities which can offer storage at these temperatures and that the warehouses in Japan were much smaller and more remotely located due to earthquake risks. All in all, the Korea Superfreeze rooms capable of storing goods at -70 C add up to 1,600 square metres (17,222 square feet). But just how much of that will be needed remains unclear as the company has not yet ascertained how big the containers carrying the vaccines will be and how much will be shipped to South Korea at a time. Kim said, however, that some regular customers of the storage facilities might have to be inconvenienced. “For the tuna and other goods that are being kept here at -60 degrees, we’re going to have to ask their permission, compensate them for it and clear them out of here.”"

That will be followed by shots from Moderna Inc about a week later, they told Reuters. Pfizer and BioNTech SE could receive emergency authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine from regulators as soon as Friday. Moderna’s regulatory process is about a week behind. Officials have said that Pfizer and the U.S. government will begin distributing the shots within 24 hours of receiving a regulatory green light, and hospitals are planning to give healthcare workers the first shots early next week. CVS expects to receive its first Pfizer dose allotment toward the end of next week but will wait until December 21 to give shots, said Chris Cox, senior vice president at CVS Health. He said U.S. officials want to allow time for the companies to review information documents about the shot and get waivers from nursing home residents and their families. Some states are opting to use Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine to inoculate their nursing home residents rather than the Pfizer shot, he added, saying that earliest date that CVS can administer Moderna’s shots is December 28. Moderna has applied for emergency authorization and is expected to receive it soon after a meeting of advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 17. CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, which run the nation’s largest pharmacy chains but also offer other offsite pharmacy services, have an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the country through a voluntary program. Cox said he believed all states had opted into the federal program, and CVS Pharmacy said more than 40,000 long-term care facilities had selected it as their COVID-19 vaccination provider."

-14.670235996359452," Fact check: Posts critical of fast COVID-19 vaccine development make misleading comparison to HIV, cancer, common cold In the weeks after drug manufacturers Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer-BioNTech announced successful clinical trial results for their respective COVID-19 vaccine candidates, posts on social media implied they were unsafe by making misleading comparisons of the speed of COVID-19 vaccine development and ongoing efforts to find cures for HIV/AIDS, cancer and the common cold. Such posts – which read, “40 years of research… no vaccine for HIV / At least 100 years of research… no vaccine for cancer / Ongoing research… no vaccine for the common cold / Less than a year for a Covid vaccine?” – can be found here , here and here . The Reuters Fact Check has previously debunked claims comparing vaccine efforts for COVID-19 to influenza, RSV (common cold) and cancer (here and comparing the efficacy of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines here ). As of 2017, half of all people living with HIV worldwide are receiving antiretroviral treatment, also known as ART (here). HIV.gov explains that when “people living with HIV achieve and maintain viral suppression by taking HIV medication daily as prescribed, they can stay healthy and have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their partners.” Finding an HIV vaccine has been challenging because the virus “mutates rapidly and has unique ways of evading the immune system,” according to the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (here). While typical vaccines imitate recovered patients’ immune response, “there are no documented cases of a person living with HIV developing an immune response that cleared the infection.” While vaccines are usually inactivated or weakened viruses, “inactivated HIV was not effective at eliciting immune responses in clinical trials” and “a live form of HIV is too dangerous to use” (here). Using the same technique as Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines, a new investigational HIV vaccine from Moderna relies on messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus (here). With the statement “At least 100 years of research… no vaccine for cancer,” the social media posts falsely portray cancer as a communicable disease. Unlike AIDS, caused by human immunodeficiency viruses, or COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, cancer is not typically caused by viruses or bacteria, which is what vaccines protect the body against (here).  “There is no one single cause for cancer,” Stanford University Healthcare points out. Instead, scientists believe that it is the interaction of many factors together that produces cancer. The factors involved may be genetic, environmental, or constitutional characteristics of the individual” (here). There are, however, several viruses that can increase one’s risk for certain cancers, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), Human papillomavirus (HPV), and Human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV-1) (here , here ). The HPV vaccine can help reduce risk of cervical cancer and the hepatitis B vaccine can help reduce your risk of liver cancer (here). Regular screening, practicing safe sex, and not sharing syringes or needles are recommended means of prevention for the other viruses mentioned. As for bacteria, the American Cancer Society says that long-term stomach infection with Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria can cause ulcers that may lead to cancer over time (here). In addition, infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, a common type of bacteria that can be transmitted through sex and affect the female reproductive system, may increase one’s risk for cervical cancer, according to some studies (here). There are currently no vaccines on the market for preventing either kind of bacterial infection, though scientists are working to develop them (here , here).  WebMD explains that finding an effective vaccine for the common cold has been difficult “primarily because there are more than 200 different varieties of viruses that can cause colds” (here). As stated here by Scientific American, scientists have been searching for a cure for the common cold since the 1950s, when rhinoviruses were first identified as a leading cause. With at least 160 different strains of rhinovirus alone, “cracking the cold isn’t so much looking for one solution to one problem as it is trying to design a master key to open hundreds of different locks at once,” Peter Barlow, an immunologist at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland, told Scientific American. The COVID-19 vaccine is targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease (here). Initial research suggests that there are at least six strains of SARS-CoV-2 but that the mutation rate is low and the virus shows little variability, making it easier to develop a vaccine (here  ,  here).   In November 2020, drug manufacturers AstraZeneca (here) , Moderna (here) and Pfizer-BioNTech (here) announced successful final trial results for their respective COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Final vaccine trial data showed that the COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were over 90% effective with no serious side effects (here  , here).  The first round of vaccinations are expected to be administered in the United States as soon as the COVID-19 vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA), which will review Pfizer’s trial data on Dec. 10 and Moderna’s on Dec. 17 (here).   Compared to HIV, cancer and the cold, COVID-19’s infection rate and the immediate economic impact to the world economy certainly contributed to the speed of the vaccine’s development (here). The speed has created concerns among the public and countries are watching Britain, the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, for information about possible side effects (here , here ). Vaccines have to go through a number of stages before they are approved (here).   There has been a huge global effort to pool resources in order to accelerate the development and production of the COVID-19 vaccine (here).   In April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator (here) was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, bringing together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, philanthropists and global health organizations to support the development and distribution of tests, treatments and vaccines.  As the WHO explains, in the case of COVID-19, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations have made it possible for some steps in research and development to happen “in parallel.” For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time, though clinical and safety standards are maintained despite the acceleration (here).   Missing context. The posts make a false comparison by juxtaposing the quick timeline of the COVID-19 vaccine with the lack of a vaccine for HIV/AIDS, cancer, and the common cold. Finding an effective HIV vaccine is difficult because the virus rapidly mutates. Cancer is not a communicable disease and is not commonly caused by viruses, though a handful of viruses do increase one’s risk for certain cancers. Finding a vaccine for the common cold is difficult as there are over 200 different varieties of viruses that can cause colds. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

Soumya Swaminathan said the global health body could decide on Pfizer's vaccine candidate in the next ""couple of weeks"", and later said it could also review Moderna's and AstraZeneca's in a few weeks. WHO approval could allow a vaccine to be deployed in some countries where national medical regulators have not yet been able to evaluate it. Swaminathan said at least 10 companies had expressed an interest or submitted a request for emergency approval for vaccine candidates. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said nearly a billion doses of vaccines had been secured for the COVAX programme to provide shots for poor- and middle-income countries, with 189 countries participating. But several WHO officials noted that it would still take time to manufacture enough doses of vaccines to meet demand. Swaminathan said the supply was likely to be limited for the first half of 2021."

Pfizer and BioNTech SE could receive emergency authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine from regulators as soon as Friday. Moderna’s regulatory process is about a week behind. Officials have said that Pfizer and the U.S. government will begin distributing the shots within 24 hours of receiving a regulatory green light and hospitals are planning to give healthcare workers the first shots early next week. CVS expects to receive its first Pfizer dose allotment toward the end of next week but will wait until December 21 to give shots to comply with regulators, said Chris Cox, senior vice president at CVS Health. He said U.S. officials want to give administrators of shots to nursing homes time to review information documents about the shot and get waivers from nursing home residents and their families. Some states are opting to use Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine to inoculate their nursing home residents rather than the Pfizer shot, he added, saying that earliest date that CVS can administer Moderna’s shots to nursing home residents is December 28. Moderna has applied for emergency authorization and is expected to receive it soon after a meeting of advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 17. CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, which run the nation’s largest pharmacy chains but also offer other offsite pharmacy services, have an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the country through a voluntary program. Cox said he believes all states have opted into the federal program at this point and that CVS is working with 8,000 skilled nursing facilities nationwide.

-14.670235996359452," Analysis-World watches as first-mover Britain probes adverse reactions to Pfizer vaccine LONDON (Reuters) - Britain hailed “V-Day” when it became the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Yet, as first mover, it has also become the first to report cases of adverse reactions, allowing other nations to watch and learn. Officials from around the world are keen for British authorities to give them as much information as possible about the two reported cases of anaphylaxis among thousands of people inoculated since mass-vaccination began on Tuesday. Anaphylaxis is an over-reaction of the body’s immune system, which health specialists describe as severe and sometimes life-threatening. While such allergic reactions are rare in any individual vaccine recipient, they are not unusual during large-scale rollouts, scientists, experts and industry figures said. The reports nonetheless led to Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) beefing up its guidance for the shot at midnight leading into Thursday, specifically warning that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis should not take it. In the United States, regulators and public health officials are determining whether to approve the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, and what advice to issue. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the British regulator was being cautious in its approach to the shot, which uses new genetic mRNA technology. “They’re being very, very careful. These are new vaccines using a new technology. They’ve gotten a signal here that they need to investigate,” he said. “We’ll benefit from their investigation.” Schaffner, who is a non-voting member of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said the group would likely discuss the topic when it discusses the use of Pfizer’s vaccine on Friday. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said his agency was trying to learn from the UK experience. “We’re working very closely with our UK partners to understand what went on with respect to those allergic reactions,” he told CBS News ahead of a meeting of outside advisers to weigh whether to recommend approval of the vaccine. Canada’s health ministry, which approved the vaccine on Wednesday, also said it would look at the reported reactions in Britain, but added that adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk/benefit of the shot. ‘BENEFITS OUTWEIGH RISKS’ The MHRA, which last week became the first regulator in the world to approve the vaccine, said it was looking into the reports of anaphylaxis as a matter of priority. “Anaphylaxis is a known, although very rare, side effect with any vaccine,” the watchdog said. “Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks.” Its updated guidance to health professionals reads: “Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.” That fleshed out an earlier change, in response to the reports of adverse reactions, that had more broadly warned against those with a history of a “significant allergic reaction” to a vaccine, medicine or food taking the shot. A vaccination resources database for doctors in France estimates the number of anaphylaxis events at below 1 per 100,000 doses, although it says it can happen to “any patient with any type of vaccines”. Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology at Imperial College London’s who has been advising the MHRA, said it was unlikely the adverse reactions were due to food allergies. They may have been caused by a component of Pfizer’s vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines, he added. “As we’ve had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true,” he said. “Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,” Turner told Reuters. Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA investigation. Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate’s ingredients were excluded from their late-stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA’s emergency-approval protocol. ‘CAN GET A HANDLE ON IT’ The British regulator insisted no corners were cut when it issued emergency use approval for Pfizer’s vaccine last Wednesday, adding that the highest standards were maintained, despite raising some eyebrows abroad with the move. Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologised for casting doubt on the MHRA’s rigour last week, while the EU drug regulator has said its process was more appropriate for the pandemic. The founder of German biotech firm CureVac, whose own COVID-19 vaccine based on mRNA technology is in clinical trials, said the side effects seen in Britain were unsurprising. “It is quite clear, with the immune system, that this can also explode. This applies to all immunisations, including the flu vaccination, for example,” Ingmar Hoerr told RTL/ntv. “But that’s not so bad, you can get a handle on it. You can take medication that brings the immune system down again.”"

U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order to ensure Americans are first in line for domestically produced coronavirus vaccines. That raised questions about availability of the vaccines being jointly developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BionNTech SE, first in line for regulatory approval in Canada. Dominic LeBlanc, minister of intergovernmental affairs, said Canada was confident Pfizer and other companies obligated to deliver vaccine doses to Canada will meet those obligations. He said Canada’s purchases are not tied to any one manufacturing site, and noted Pfizer manufactures in Europe as well as the United States. Pfizer Canada spokeswoman Christina Antoniou said the company is committed to honoring agreements with Canada. “We are a global company that prioritizes patients all over the world,” she said in response to a question about Trump’s executive order. Canada is expected to receive up to 249,000 doses of Pfizer’s shots this month. Quebec plans to start inoculating residents and staff next week at two long-term care facilities. Residents in long-term care facilities accounted for most of Quebec’s deaths during the first wave. Maimonides, one of the two care homes, has installed freezers and expects two boxes of doses, said Francine Dupuis, associate chief executive of an integrated health network serving West-Central Montreal. “We have practiced, we have worked for a number of days to get ready, to have all the logistics in place,” Dupuis said.

Located 65 km (40 miles) below Seoul and boasting temperatures frostier than an Antarctic winter, the facility would be the best, perhaps only, place in South Korea suitable for bulk storage of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, says company CEO Kim Jin-ha. “As soon as we heard about the Pfizer vaccine, we started getting ready... other options wouldn’t work,” Kim told Reuters, adding that the warehouse’s use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to keep temperatures cool trumped electricity. Warehouses which use electricity would have difficulty maintaining the -70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) required by the vaccine for storage and carry the risk of the temperature rising during a power blackout, he said. The company, which is backed by Goldman Sachs and SK Holdings Co Ltd, has been in talks with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency since early November and while nothing is yet decided, expectations are high it will land a contract. The agency has asked Korea Superfreeze to provide plans and cost estimates for storing and distributing vaccines, including how it would handle a scenario where vaccines would be shipped to 260 different locations, Kim said. South Korea has arranged to buy 20 million doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech . The country also has deals for 20 million doses each for the vaccines developed by Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc /Oxford University and for another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson. In total, that would be enough to inoculate 34 million people in a country of 51.8 million and shipments are expected to begin no later than March. Kim said, however, it was not clear to him if the agency would tap the company for vaccines other than Pfizer’s which have less onerous cold storage requirements. Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20 C while AstraZeneca’s vaccine needs only normal fridge temperatures. To accommodate Pfizer’s vaccine, Korea Superfreeze is planning a dedicated passageway and elevator so there is no interference from outside temperatures. Once it confirms it has a contract, it will begin construction which may take 2-3 months. The warehouse also has 220 closed-circuit cameras that monitor resting cargo round the clock, Kim said. He added that South Korea and Japan were the only countries with LNG-powered facilities which can offer storage at these temperatures and that the warehouses in Japan were much smaller and more remotely located due to earthquake risks. All in all, the Korea Superfreeze rooms capable of storing goods at -70 C add up to 1,600 square metres (17,222 square feet). But just how much of that will be needed remains unclear as the company has not yet ascertained how big the containers carrying the vaccines will be and how much will be shipped to South Korea at a time. Kim said, however, that some regular customers of the storage facilities might have to be inconvenienced. “For the tuna and other goods that are being kept here at -60 degrees, we’re going to have to ask their permission, compensate them for it and clear them out of here.”"

-14.670235996359452," U.S. FDA advisers overwhelmingly back authorizing Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) -A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for the agency to authorize the shot for a nation that has lost more than 285,000 lives to COVID-19. The FDA is widely expected to authorize emergency use in days. Distribution and inoculations in the United States are expected to begin almost immediately thereafter. The committee voted 17-4 that the known benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks of taking the shot for individuals 16 and older, with 1 member of the panel abstaining. “This is a historic moment,” Eric Dickson, chief executive of UMass Memorial Health Care, who was not on the advisory panel, said after the vote. He called the vaccine from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech “the best solution to get us out of our current situation and help us save lives.” Pfizer had asked that the two-dose vaccine be approved for use in people aged 16 to 85. Several advisory panel members discussed whether 16 and 17 year olds should be included in the recommendation. In the end, they voted on the question as put them by the FDA, which included 16 to 17 year olds. It was not clear why four panelists voted against authorization but several mentioned they were not comfortable with including 16 and 17 year olds, arguing the risk to those individuals was low, and the evidence in the trial was scant. “The final decision about whether to authorize the vaccine for emergency use will be made by FDA’s career officials,” the agency said in a statement. The panel also discussed concerns raised by two reports of serious allergic reactions among vaccine recipients in Britain, and what to advise pregnant women, who were excluded in the study. Women of childbearing age comprise a large proportion of healthcare workers, who will be among those first in line to get the vaccine. The FDA said during the panel meeting that there was not enough data to support or contradict use of the vaccine in pregnant women. The agency recommends they make the decision on their own with advice from their doctors. Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who has previously served two terms on the FDA advisory panel, said he was surprised advisers did not voice more cautions about pregnant women. The advisers also spent a major portion of the meeting discussing Pfizer’s plan to give volunteers who received a placebo in its trial the option to get the vaccine when they become eligible for it under recommendations set by state and local health officials. Much of that focused on how an emergency authorization would affect the scientific integrity of Pfizer’s ongoing study and the way other vaccines are studied in the future. Pfizer believes it should offer the vaccine to people in the placebo group of its trial as they become eligible for the shot. The concern, expressed by both the FDA and members of the advisory panel, is that telling trial participants who got placebo and who got the vaccine, called “unblinding,” will make it harder to continue collecting data on safety and effectiveness needed to win full FDA approval of the vaccine. Documents prepared by the FDA ahead of the meeting did not point out any new safety or efficacy issues, raising optimism the United States would soon follow the UK and Canada authorizing the vaccine. Britain’s health regulator on Wednesday advised some people with a history of anaphylaxis, an overreaction of the body’s immune system related to medicine or food, to avoid the getting the vaccine. Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told the panel they “saw no serious allergic reactions to the vaccine” among the nearly 44,000 volunteers enrolled in the trial. Nevertheless, an FDA official said the agency has asked Pfizer to add severe allergic reactions to their plans to study safety issues related to the vaccine once it’s authorized. Pfizer and BioNTech last month said a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from COVID-19, and detailed data released in the agency’s documents showed the vaccine began showing some protection even before volunteers received a second dose. The documents also disclosed data on safety including cases of Bell’s palsy among volunteers in the placebo and vaccine groups, though it said the cases in the trial occurred at the same rate as in the general population. Other reactions included fever, fatigue and chills."

The retailer said it was preparing over 5,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies with freezers and dry ice to handle vaccine storage requirements. It was also working with states to support vaccinations in long-term care facilities, if needed. Pharmacy chains CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boot Alliance have also signed agreements with the U.S. government to administer COVID-19 vaccines to residents of long-term care facilities. The United States has agreed to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine - closest to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A panel of advisers to the FDA was set to review and recommend on Thursday whether the U.S. agency should authorize emergency use of the vaccine. “States will determine who should receive the first doses of the vaccine and when. Walmart will not have any say in who can receive the vaccine, but we are ready to support states once they do,” Walmart said. It said it was educating its employees about COVID-19 vaccine, and they can choose to receive it once they are eligible."

-14.670235996359452," EXPLAINER-I just got a COVID-19 vaccine. Now what? Britain became the first country in the world on Tuesday to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNtech (22UAy.DE), initially making the shot available at 50 hospitals. The country's National Health Service is giving priority to vaccinating people over the age of 80, frontline healthcare workers and nursing home staff and residents. Here is what people getting the vaccine should expect. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE GETS THE VACCINE? The vaccine, developed with new messenger RNA technology using a manufactured fragment of the coronavirus' genetic code, is injected into the arm. The immunization is given in two doses, three weeks apart, and has been shown in trials to protect up to 95% of recipients from contracting COVID-19. Pfizer has said side effects in trial volunteers were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The most severe side effects occurred after the second dose: fatigue in 3.8% of volunteers and headache in 2%. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events. WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION DOES IT GIVE? The vaccine prevented COVID-19 illness seven days after the second injection - which is about a month after the first shot. Clinical trials so far have not been designed to determine if an immunized person can still spread the coronavirus to someone else. Some vaccines, such as hepatitis A, do provide such protection - known as sterilizing immunity - but others do not. COVID-19 vaccine makers focused trials on determining whether the drug stopped people from getting ill. It will also be several more months before it becomes clear how long the vaccination will protect someone from coronavirus infection. ""Until then, it is better to avoid the pub, and other in-person gatherings with many people,"" said Dr. Anita Shet, infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. DOES THE VACCINE MEAN BACK TO NORMAL LIFE? Since there is no evidence that the immunization prevents transmission of the virus - and no vaccine is 100% effective - scientists call for continued vigilance, including mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing. ""As with all vaccines, it may work really great in certain patient subsets, but not as well in others ... Does that mean you are free to hop on a plane or have 30 people over at your house? Probably not,"" said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director for infection prevention at Colorado's UCHealth. She said vaccination campaigns are unlikely to reach ""a critical mass"" until next spring or early summer."

Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the shot are needed per person to gain immunity. Below are details on what the government, companies and health service have said about the manufacturing and storage process, logistics of the rollout, who gets the vaccine and where they will get it. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below. - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days. - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius). - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer's manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites. LOGISTICAL DETAILS: - Pfizer dispatched initial volumes of vaccine from Belgium, which arrived at secure locations in Britain by the weekend. Around 800,000 doses are expected to be available in the first week of rollout. - After arriving, there is a post-delivery quality assurance process to ensure the vaccine's quality and integrity has been maintained through transit, which can take 12-24 hours. - Each box is then opened and unpacked manually, with temperature data downloaded from each box. - There are five packs of 975 doses per box. Only sites with the right regulatory licence can split the vaccine packs, which limits where they can be sent in the first instance. WHICH PEOPLE GET IT WHEN? - Britain has said the speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine. - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year. - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality. WHERE WILL PEOPLE GET IT? - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the vaccine. - At first, the vaccine will be available from around 50 ""Hospital Hubs"", where shots will be defrosted and then prepared. - Over 1,000 local vaccination centres, operated by groups of general practitioners (GPs), will then open. The health service has asked doctors to be ready to begin vaccinations from Dec. 14. - When there is more vaccine and it is possible to split the packs up, the government has said it plans bigger vaccination centres and smaller arrangements through local pharmacies."

-15.38463796580899," RPT-UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA advisers wrestle with ethical issues linked to authorizing Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine (Repeats with no changes to text) Dec 10 (Reuters) - A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration meeting on Thursday to weigh authorizing Pfizer Inc’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use were wrestling with when people in the clinical trial who received a placebo should be allowed to get the shots. The committee is expected to vote sometime after 3:10 p.m. ET (20:10 GMT) on whether the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE, has shown effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 and if its benefits outweigh the risks. Documents prepared by the FDA ahead of the meeting did not point out any new safety or efficacy issues, raising hopes the vaccine will soon be authorized in the United States. It has already received regulatory green lights from the UK and Canada. Pfizer has asked for broad authorization for use of its two-dose vaccine in people aged 16 to 85. Much of the discussion so far has focused less on whether the vaccine should be authorized, and more on how its emergency use would affect the scientific integrity of the ongoing trial and the way other vaccines are studied in the future. Once the vaccine is cleared, Pfizer has said it has an ethical responsibility to tell participants if the vaccine is available to them outside of the trial. It has asked the FDA to allow it to give the vaccine to volunteers who had been in the placebo group that request it. The concern, expressed by both the FDA and members of the advisory panel, is that “unblinding” the trial will make it harder to continue collecting data on long-term safety and effectiveness, and would make it more challenging for companies still testing vaccines to conduct blinded trials, in which people do not know if they got the experimental vaccine or a placebo. “Once you unblind, you can never go back. We can never collect those data that we need and people want unless you completely redo the whole study,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who has previously served two terms on the FDA advisory panel. Dr. Steven Goodman of Stanford University School of Medicine said in a presentation to the panel that offering the vaccine to people who got a placebo could result in them “jumping the line,” by receiving the vaccine before they otherwise would under priorities recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Goodman recommended instead a blinded double crossover design, in which people in the trial who got a placebo would be offered the vaccine, and those who received the vaccine would be offered the placebo. With that approach, everybody eventually gets the vaccine without being tempted to leave the trial to get it elsewhere. ‘FDA IS THE GOLD STANDARD’ The panel had yet to take up the vaccine’s safety and efficacy, but is likely to discuss concerns raised after two vaccine recipients in Britain reported serious allergic reactions after getting their first shot. The country’s health regulator on Wednesday advised some people with a history of anaphylaxis, an overreaction of the body’s immune system related to medicine or food, to avoid the getting the vaccine. FDA Commissioner Steven Hahn, ahead of Thursday’s meeting, said the agency was carefully reviewing all the data on Pfizer’s vaccine, including potential allergic reactions following the UK warning. “We’re working very closely with our UK partners to understand what went on with respect to those allergic reactions,” Hahn said on the “CBS This Morning” program, adding that the vaccine’s label would include details about who the vaccine was recommended for - and who should not get it - if it is ultimately approved. “FDA is the gold standard for regulatory approval or authorization of medical products,” he added. “If our career scientists say that the vaccine is safe and effective, I have complete confidence in that decision, and I think the American people should as well.” The panel is expected to vote on its recommendations toward the end of the meeting, after presentations from the FDA, Pfizer, other public health officials and members of the general public. The FDA is expected to make its authorization decision within days of the meeting. Pfizer and BioNTech last month said a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from COVID-19, and detailed data released in the agency’s documents showed the vaccine began showing some protection even before volunteers received a second dose. The documents also disclosed data on safety including cases of Bell’s palsy among volunteers in the placebo and vaccine groups, though it said the cases in the trial occurred at the same rate as in the general population. Other reactions included fever, fatigue and chills."
-15.38463796580899," In Canada, COVID-19 vaccine transport rules will keep early doses out of most care homes TORONTO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Many Canadian seniors living in nursing homes could face delays before receiving Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine after first deliveries arrive next week, as health officials seek to comply with restrictive vaccine handling advice from the drugmaker. Pfizer has advised Canadian health officials to administer early doses of the vaccine at the sites where they are first delivered in large batches. At least until more data is available, it will not be possible to break up batches and send small quantities of the vaccine on to other locations. That means many long-term care residents are likely to miss out on the first batch of vaccinations in Canada, the third country in the world to approve the vaccine, in the midst of a surge in infections that threatens to overwhelm hospitals. It is not yet clear how movement restrictions could play out in other countries. In the United Kingdom, first doses were delivered to hospitals, and not care homes. But the drug regulator said on Thursday that some licensed companies and hospitals will be allowed to break down vaccine shipments so they can be taken into care homes, once processes and training are in place. A delay in vaccinating long-term care home residents risks increasing COVID-19 deaths in Canada, which has struggled to protect its elders and staff. In the first wave, 81% of deaths were among care home residents, a share well above the OECD average.

On Wednesday, Health Canada cleared Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for public use, after an accelerated review. A panel advising the government has said long-term care home residents and healthcare workers should be prioritized for early vaccination. But in Ontario, care home residents may need to wait until the Pfizer vaccine can be moved more easily or a vaccine from Moderna Inc is available, said Rick Hillier, head of the province’s vaccination task force, at a Monday briefing. While the need to store the vaccine at ultra-cold temperatures has been widely discussed, Ontario officials said the movement restriction is meant to limit the amount of physical movement, like shaking, during vaccine handling. Pfizer has said it would consider relaxing the restrictions depending on the result of initial campaigns, said Christian Dubé, health minister of the province of Quebec. Asked about the restrictions, a Pfizer Canada spokeswoman said it will ship frozen vials directly to 14 initial points of vaccination chosen by the government. The company did not give a reason for the restriction. “For the initial stages of vaccination, I can confirm that we are asking for vaccines to be administered only at the first vaccination points,” said spokeswoman Christina Antoniou. In hard-hit Quebec, the first vaccines will be shipped directly to two long-term care homes next week, including the Maimonides care facility in Montreal, to vaccinate residents and staff. To work around the movement restrictions, health workers from other care homes will travel to Maimonides to be vaccinated with any leftover doses, said Francine Dupuis, associate chief executive of the health network that oversees the home. The challenge for administrators comes later, when shipping vaccines to smaller care facilities across the province, she said. Thomas Madden, chief executive of BioNTech partner Acuitas Therapeutics, based in Vancouver, said the issue is most likely a lack of data during the rapid rollout, not the vaccine’s actual durability. “Whatever storage and transportation conditions are used for the vaccine, studies have to have been conducted in advance to demonstrate that the quality of the vaccine is maintained under those conditions,” he said. Madden, an expert in lipid nanoparticles, a key ingredient in the vaccine, said, “the challenge is that you have a limited amount of time to run those studies, which are relatively complicated.” Madden noted that BioNTech gave less restrictive guidance in a recent presentation, which said defrosted vials could be transported for up to six hours. Elsewhere in Canada, in Saskatchewan, which has a large number of remote, indigenous communities, officials plan to deploy Moderna’s vaccine mainly in rural, isolated places, said Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab. The nearby province of Manitoba has said it will likely vaccinate at centralized super-sites."
-15.38463796580899," Fact check: Clarifying claims around Pfizer vaccine deaths and side effects Social media users have been sharing a post that makes several claims of serious negative health effects from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, including that 6 people died during late-stage trials. These claims are partly false. Six people did die during the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials, but only two of them were given the vaccine. The other four were given a safe placebo solution of salt and water. No causal relationship was established between the vaccine and the two deaths, which occurred in line with the normal death rate for the general population. The first person to get the vaccine in the UK is not in critical condition. Four cases of Bell’s Palsy (partial facial paralysis) were also not considered to necessarily be caused by the vaccine but the symptom will be under surveillance when the vaccine is distributed. Precautions have also been added for allergic reactions. The post (here) says, “Six people died in Pfizer’s late-stage trial of the COVID-19 #vaccine […] (4 of the 6 died from the placebo injection, why would #Pfizer have to use a deadly #placebo, short of manipulating data […] Warning over UK vaccine rollout as two NHS staff given jab suffer ‘anaphylactic reaction’: Regulators urge people with history of ‘significant’ allergies NOT to have Pfizer injection […] Also four people in the United States, who got COVID-19 vaccine shot developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, developed Bell’s Palsy […] Update – Now the first woman to receive covid-19 vaccine in the UK is in critical condition.” Vaccinations with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have begun in the UK and the vaccine has been also authorized for use in Bahrain and Canada (here). At the time of writing discussions were underway at the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about whether to approve the vaccine in the United States, after FDA staff said in briefing documents that the vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for emergency use authorization (here). Reuters has recently debunked other claims about the first person to receive the vaccine in the UK (here) and the vaccine itself ( here , here , here ). Six participants did die during the 44,000 person Pfizer vaccine trial, two of whom were given the vaccine while the other four people received a placebo (here). Details of the deaths are laid out in FDA briefing documents ( here and here ), ahead of a Thursday meeting of outside experts to the FDA who will discuss whether to recommend the Pfizer shot for people aged 16 and older. One of the vaccine recipients had a cardiac arrest 62 days after a second dose of the two-dose vaccination and died three days later. The other died from arteriosclerosis three days after a first dose of the vaccination. One of the placebo recipients died from myocardial infarction, another from haemorrhagic stroke and two others from unknown causes. The FDA briefings clarify that the deaths were not deemed to be related to the vaccine: “None of these deaths were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention”. They explain: “All deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred, at a similar rate.” The social media post claims that Pfizer used a “deadly placebo” in order to manipulate data. Pfizer documents show that the placebo (here) is a normal saline, specifically a 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection, which means it is simply a mixture of salt and water. The FDA briefing documents also show that it is true that there were four cases of Bell’s Palsy among those who received the vaccine (here). Bell’s Palsy is a sudden weakness or freezing of muscles on one side of the face, which in most cases is temporary ( here , here ). The briefing says that the frequency of Bell’s Palsy in the vaccine group is “consistent with the expected background rate in the general population”, adding there is “no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time”. The FDA said it would, however, recommend “surveillance” for cases of Bell’s Palsy as the vaccine is sent out to larger groups of people. Britain’s medicine regulator, The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis in reaction to a medicine or food, or with a history of significant allergies should not have the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The advice comes after two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since the vaccine was rolled out on Dec. 8 ( here , here ). Margaret Keenan, the first person to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, was well enough to be discharged from hospital on Dec. 9. Videos from BBC News and Sky News show that she was far from being in a critical condition ( here , here ). In a statement on that same day Keenan said, “I feel great.” (here). There have been no credible reports of Keenan falling ill since Dec. 9 ( here , here ). Partly false. Those who have a history of significant allergies have been advised not to take the vaccine, however no causal relationship has been established between the vaccine and the two deaths, nor the four Bell’s Palsy cases during the trial. The first person to take the vaccine in the UK is not in a critical condition. The placebo is a solution of salt and water. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

-15.38463796580899," Explainer: What do the UK allergic reaction cases mean for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) - Britain’s medicines regulator has advised people with a history of significant allergies not to get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout in the UK. Here are some questions and answers about the cases and what they might mean. UK officials said there have been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. Anaphylaxis can cause throat swelling, breathing trouble and difficulty swallowing, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body’s immune system, which the UK National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening. British regulators initially responded by saying anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food should not take the shot. An adviser to the group later said it was “tweaking” advice in part to say a food allergy was not a risk. Late on Wednesday, the UK regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not get the vaccine. Pfizer had excluded people with a history of significant adverse reaction to vaccines or its vaccine’s ingredients from late-stage trials. U.S. regulators are expected to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine soon after a Thursday meeting of advisers. Moncef Slaoui, who is spearheading the U.S. government’s vaccine development efforts, said on Wednesday he expected the British allergic reactions would be considered in the U.S. authorization process and that people with known severe allergic reactions probably should not take the vaccine until more was understood. Some praised UK regulators’ caution, while others said broad restrictions were not warranted by available evidence. “For the general population, this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. What would be wise, he said, would be “for anyone who has known severe allergic reaction such that they need to carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.” Mayo Clinic virologist Gregory Poland, who has advised U.S. regulators, described Britain’s early reaction as “overdoing it,” pointing to the initial response about food allergies, which he said “have nothing to do with this.” “I would have said, ‘If you’ve had anaphylactic-level reactions to vaccines, we want to know about that so we take extra care,’” he said. “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t immunize you. But I would do it in a more controlled setting.” Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, praised the way the reactions had been handled. “The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that the monitoring system is working well,” he said. Mitchell Grayson, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio, voiced concern over how the issue might reduce interest in vaccinations. “I’m worried the whole event will cause millions of people to choose not to get vaccinated because of what they heard,” he said. “In the UK in 2012 there were around seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies. This included different triggers such as foods, drugs and insect stings,” said Louisa James, a expert in immunology at Queen Mary University of London. Fatalities remain very rare and have not increased even as hospital admissions have risen in many countries."

On Dec. 8, Keenan received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot at her local hospital in Coventry, a week before turning 91 (here). The posts compare screenshots from two different articles – one from CNN, the other from the BBC – with each seemingly showing images of Keenan receiving the vaccine. The BBC article is dated Dec. 8, while the CNN piece is from Oct. 22. This has caused some to falsely claim that the media are using old images to report the story, and that Keenan is a “crisis actor”. “Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true”, one Twitter post shared 6,400 times asks (here). However, the CNN article from October (here) has nothing to do with Keenan’s vaccination and did not use pictures of her. The piece covers a report estimating the number of deaths that could have been prevented through changes in the U.S. pandemic response.

This gives us a very robust data set on which to make a decision, both on safety and efficacy,” Emer Cooke said at a committee meeting of the European Parliament. The agency is expected to complete reviews by Dec. 29 for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and by Jan. 12 for the Moderna vaccine “at the latest”. Cooke said that the approval decision dates could change, depending on the assessment. “We cannot guarantee that there will be a positive outcome at this stage” Cooke said, adding that the agency’s experts had to examine very large data sets. “We have to make sure we analyse those data correctly,” she said. Cooke added that EMA analysts were also checking data against the new information that emerged in Britain on Wednesday when two people had anaphylaxis and one a possible allergic reaction after the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine began. She added that she expected AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson to submit in the first quarter of next year their applications for a marketing authorisation of their COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The agency has been assessing preliminary data of the AstraZeneca shot since early October, and Johnson & Johnson’s data since early December.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said on Wednesday documents related to the development of their COVID-19 vaccine had been “unlawfully accessed” in a cyberattack on the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA had disclosed the attack hours earlier but gave no details about when or how it took place, who was responsible or what information was compromised. “We have been subject to a cyber attack over the last couple of weeks,” Emer Cooke told EU lawmakers during a hearing on Thursday. “I can assure you that this will not affect the timeline for delivery of vaccines and that we are fully functional.” Pfizer and BioNTech said they did not believe any personal data of trial participants had been compromised and the EMA “has assured us that the cyber attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review”. The agency has said it will decide on a possible conditional approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by Dec. 29.

-15.38463796580899," UK issues anaphylaxis warning on Pfizer vaccine after adverse reactions LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s medicine regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, giving fuller guidance on an earlier allergy warning about the shot. Starting with the elderly and frontline workers, Britain began mass vaccinating its population on Tuesday, part of a global drive that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there had been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. “Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,” MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement. “Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks... You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.” Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body’s immune system, which the National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening. The fuller guidance, clarifying that the main risk was from anaphylaxis specifically, was issued after consulting experts on allergies. The MHRA had initially advised anyone with a history of a “significant allergic reaction” not to take the shot. Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA’s investigation. Last week, Britain’s MHRA became the first in the world to approve the vaccine, developed by Germany’s BioNTech and Pfizer, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) continue to assess the data. A top U.S. official said on Wednesday that Americans with known severe allergic reactions may not be candidates for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine until more was understood about what had happened. Canada’s health ministry said it would look at the reported adverse reactions in Britain, but said adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk/benefit of the shot, after the country approved the vaccine. MHRA chief Raine told lawmakers such allergic reactions had not been a feature of the Pfizer’s clinical trials. Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate’s ingredients were excluded from their late stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA’s emergency approval protocol. However, the allergic reactions may have been caused by a component of Pfizer’s vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines. Imperial College London’s Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology, who has been advising the MHRA on their revised guidance, told Reuters: “As we’ve had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true.” “The ingredients like PEG which we think might be responsible for the reactions are not related to things which can cause food allergy. Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,” Turner told Reuters. The EMA said in an email that all quality, safety and efficacy data would be taken into account in assessing the vaccine, including data generated outside the EU. In the United States, the FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for an advisory committee meeting on Thursday, saying the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization. The briefing documents said 0.63% of people in the vaccine group and 0.51% in the placebo group reported possible allergic reactions in trials, which Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said was a very small number. “The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well,” he said. However, Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that the MHRA and NHS had overreacted initially. “I would not have broadened to the degree they did,” he said. “It’s reasonable to let the world know about this, and to be aware of it in terms of people who have had reactions like this to vaccines. I think to say medicines, foods or any other allergies is past the boundary of science.”"

Some praised UK regulators’ caution, while others said broad restrictions were not warranted by available evidence. “For the general population, this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. What would be wise, he said, would be “for anyone who has known severe allergic reaction such that they need to carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.” Mayo Clinic virologist Gregory Poland, who has advised U.S. regulators, described Britain’s early reaction as “overdoing it,” pointing to the initial response about food allergies, which he said “have nothing to do with this.” “I would have said, ‘If you’ve had anaphylactic-level reactions to vaccines, we want to know about that so we take extra care,’” he said. “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t immunize you. But I would do it in a more controlled setting.” Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, praised the way the reactions had been handled. “The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that the monitoring system is working well,” he said. Mitchell Grayson, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio, voiced concern over how the issue might reduce interest in vaccinations. “I’m worried the whole event will cause millions of people to choose not to get vaccinated because of what they heard,” he said. “In the UK in 2012 there were around seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies. This included different triggers such as foods, drugs and insect stings,” said Louisa James, a expert in immunology at Queen Mary University of London. Fatalities remain very rare and have not increased even as hospital admissions have risen in many countries."
-15.38463796580899," Data from by Pfizer/BioNTeh, Moderna for COVID-19 vaccines 'very robust'-EMA BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The data submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna for their COVID-19 vaccine candidates is “very robust”, its executive director said on Thursday. “We have a data set of over 30,000 subjects who have been followed through the clinical trials. This gives us a very robust data set on which to make a decision, both on safety and efficacy,” Emer Cooke said at a committee meeting of the European Parliament. The agency is expected to complete reviews by Dec. 29 for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and Jan. 12 for the Moderna vaccine at the latest. “We cannot guarantee there will be a positive outcome,” Cooke said."
-15.38463796580899," Hackers steal Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine data in Europe, companies say LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said on Wednesday that documents related to development of their COVID-19 vaccine had been “unlawfully accessed” in a cyberattack on Europe’s medicines regulator. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which assesses medicines and vaccines for the European Union, said hours earlier it had been targeted in a cyberattack. It gave no further details. Pfizer and BioNTech said they did not believe any personal data of trial participants had been compromised and EMA “has assured us that the cyber attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review.” It was not immediately clear when or how the attack took place, who was responsible or what other information may have been compromised. The two companies said they had been informed by the EMA “that the agency has been subject to a cyber attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate” had been viewed. Such documents could be extremely valuable to other countries and companies rushing to develop vaccines, experts said. “When it comes to the data submitted to these kinds of regulatory bodies, we are talking confidential information about the vaccine and its mechanism of action, its efficiency, its risks & known possible side effects and any unique aspects such as handling guidelines,” said Marc Rogers, founder of a volunteer group fighting Covid-related breaches, CTI-League. “It also provides detailed information on other parties involved in the supply and distribution of the vaccine and potentially significantly increases the attack surface for the vaccine,” adding more ways the formulas or production could be hacked or stolen. The companies said “no BioNTech or Pfizer systems have been breached in connection with this incident and we are unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed.” A spokeswoman for BioNTech declined further comment. Pfizer did not respond to a request for further comment. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is a top contender in the global race to beat back COVID-19. It is already being administered in Britain. The EMA has said it would complete its review by Dec. 29, although its schedule may change. The EMA statement gave few details about the attack, saying only it was investigating with help from law enforcement. “EMA cannot provide additional details whilst the investigation is ongoing,” it said in a statement. U.S. law enforcement and cybersecurity officials did not respond to requests for comment. Hacking attempts against healthcare and medical organisations have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic as attackers ranging from state-backed spies to cyber criminals hunt for information. Reuters has previously reported on allegations that hackers linked to North Korea, South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, China and Russia have on separate occasions tried to steal information about the virus and potential treatments. Reuters has documented that espionage campaigns targeted a slew of pharmaceutical and vaccine development companies including Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, and Moderna. Regulators and international organizations such as the World Health Organization have also come under repeated attack. “Vaccine candidates represent liquid gold to many parties, both in terms of the opportunity and the pure market value,” said Rogers, who is also vice president at security company Okta Inc. “Information on the vaccine and access to any link in the distribution chain has significantly increased value.” The respiratory virus, which emerged in China in late 2019, has infected more than 68 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. More than 1.5 million people have died."
-15.38463796580899," Japan plans vaccine freezer buying binge as Tokyo reports record cases TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Thursday it will buy 10,500 deep freezers to store novel coronavirus vaccines as it prepares for the “extraordinary task” of protecting its people, while the capital, Tokyo, reported a record number of new infections. Japan, with a population of 126 million, has agreements to buy a total of 290 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc, or enough for 145 million people. Pfizer’s vaccines need to be kept at around minus 75 Celsius (minus 103 Fahrenheit), and Moderna’s at about minus 20C, posing complex logistics challenges in rolling them out. “An extraordinary task awaits us,” Tokuaki Shobayashi, director general of the health service bureau at the ministry of health, told a media briefing on preparations. A 90-year-old grandmother in Britain became the world’s first person to receive a fully tested COVID-19 shot on Tuesday. Though Japan has seen far fewer coronavirus cases than many Western countries, new infections are on the rise as colder weather keeps people indoors. In all, it has recorded more than 165,000 infections and about 2,500 fatalities as of Wednesday, with Tokyo particularly hard hit. The capital reported a record 602 new cases on Thursday, with nationwide daily infections at 2,078, according to public broadcaster NHK. Top officials said the situation called for “maximum caution” as the spread showed little sign of easing. Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi this week ordered the military, known as the Self Defence Forces (SDF), to send nurses to a hard-hit city in Hokkaido prefecture in the north. The government will also send nurses from the SDF to Osaka, in western Japan, where the number of coronavirus cases is rising, Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday. The health ministry said it is too early to say when Japan would get the vaccines, but AstraZeneca has announced that, of the 120 million doses to be allocated to Japan, 30 million would likely be supplied in the first quarter of 2021. The government will oversee the vaccination operation and shoulder the costs. Front-line medical workers, the elderly and people with underlying health conditions will be given priority to get vaccinated. Doctors and nurses will give the vaccines at clinics and hospitals, while facilities with parking lots such as gyms, shopping malls and community centres were being considered as vaccination venues, the ministry said. Major Japanese manufactures of freezers include PHC, Nihon Freezer and Ebac. The government also plans to buy dry ice in bulk to maintain cold supply chains. Infectious disease specialist Norio Sugaya said coming late to vaccination had its upsides. “Truth be told, it would have been good if we had been able to have this started by the end of the year,” Sugaya said. “But we will be able to learn more about potential side effects and about how to build up the whole vaccination system that can maintain minus 70 Celsius.” Britain’s medicines regulator has advised people with a history of significant allergies not to get the Pfizer vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout there."

-15.38463796580899," Not without India: World's pharmacy gears up for vaccine race PUNE, India/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, is getting set for the massive global blitz to contain the coronavirus pandemic with its pharmaceutical industry and partners freeing up capacity and accelerating investments even without firm purchase orders. India manufactures more than 60% of all vaccines sold across the globe, and while its $40 billion pharmaceutical sector is not yet involved in the production of the expensive Pfizer Inc and Moderna shots, the nation will play a pivotal role in immunizing much of the world. Indian companies are set to produce eight, more affordable vaccines designed to fight COVID-19, including AstraZeneca's Covishield, called the ""vaccine for the world here"" by its developers. “There are many vaccines being produced in countries around the world but there’s only one nation that has the manufacturing capacity to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of citizens in every country, and that’s India,” said Australia’s ambassador to India, Barry O’Farrell, after touring vaccine manufacturing sites in India with many other diplomats. Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine maker, has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot, even as it awaits emergency-use approvals from both British and Indian authorities. SII plans to make a total of 400 million doses of Covishield by July and is setting up new production lines to roll out roughly one billion shots a year. Pharmaceutical packager Schott Kaisha, meanwhile, is stepping up production of vaccine vials and Deutsche Post’s DHL is working out how best to distribute the shots within the country and around the world. “Because of the large volumes coming out of India and of course the affordable vaccines, there is no other country that will contribute more towards ending the pandemic than India,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters at the company’s sprawling campus in the western city of Pune. Here, automated machines fill and seal thousands of vials with the AstraZeneca shot every hour before they are moved to a vast, high-ceiling cold room. But much of India’s vaccine production could be, at least initially, for domestic use. With nearly 10 million infections, the world’s second-highest after the United States, India’s government is likely to order a huge chunk of the vaccines for its 1.3 billion people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to specify how much India will require, but his government has said some vaccines may be approved in the next few weeks and that it was “committed to partnering with all interested countries in vaccine-related efforts”. Poonawalla said he expects to sell hundreds of millions of doses at home. Even as immediate local demand is met, nearly half of its production would go overseas, the company has said. India’s Bharat Biotech, which has also sought emergency approval for its government-backed vaccine candidate, is in discussions with more than 10 countries in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe to sell its product. Russia, meanwhile, has signed deals with Indian companies to make the country the production and export hub for its Sputnik V vaccine, starting with more than 100 million doses a year. Many companies in India’s vaccine supply chain are laying out investments without deals in hand. “We’ve taken a calculated risk,” said Rishad Dadachanji, a director at Schott Kaisha that is in supply talks with around 10 vaccine makers at home and abroad. It is increasing its annual manufacturing capacity by 300 million to 1.5 billion vials by November. Executives at rival firms SGD Pharma India and Piramal Glass said they were expanding their production base, or re-allocating manufacturing lines to focus on vials. SGD plans to add 100 million units to its current capacity of 350 million glass vials, while Piramal says it can double its specialised vial capacity at just a month’s notice “to meet any unforeseen demand.” Others that are likely to benefit from an expected surge in demand are: pharmaceutical firms Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cadila Healthcare and Hetero; logistics company FedEx; cold chain storage specialist Snowman Logistics and Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices, among others. Hindustan Syringes says it will increase capacity by 42% to 1 billion units by the first half of next year. It has already shipped some 140 million syringes that disable themselves after one use for the global vaccine distribution program COVAX. But because the Indian government has not yet signed any contracts with vaccine suppliers, some ancillary companies have been left guessing what kind of products they should prepare for as specifications may vary from vaccine to vaccine. Vial maker SGD’s managing director, Sardar Akshay Singh, warned that a last-minute rush to secure vaccines for India could hit exports - similar to the way officials stalled shipments of masks and sanitizers early in the pandemic to meet local demand. “We have been feeding the government a lot of information but they’ve not come up with a plan so far,” said Sunil Nair, CEO of India’s biggest cold chain operator, Snowman. The company’s ongoing expansion will nevertheless double its vaccine handling capacity to 200 million doses by March. It operates some 500 trucks fitted with containers refrigerated by Carrier Global, has vendors on standby if more are required, and says it can deliver vaccines from production site to inoculation centres within hours thanks to its countrywide reach. SII, which also has COVID vaccine tie-ups with U.S. biotech firm Codagenix, Novavax and Austria’s Themis, has scaled back production of shots for other diseases and is readying more cold rooms, buying more trucks and hiring more workers. For DHL, the world’s largest courier and logistics company, vaccine transportation work has already begun in India. It recently brought in Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine for trials and says it will play a crucial role in exporting vaccines, and distributing them within the country. “The next 12-24 months are going to be significantly exciting and there’s going to be a lot of capacity issues, but I think it’s a positive headache to have,” DHL Express India head R.S. Subramanian said."

If the deals are agreed, Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s most populous country with more than 270 million people, would have 271.5 million doses of vaccines, above its target of 246.6 million. It has already secured 125.5 million doses from China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd and 30 million from Novavax Inc , according to data presented to parliament by Budi Gunadi Sadikin, chief of an economic recovery task force. It is in talks with Pfizer and AstraZeneca to buy 50 million doses each and expects to get 16 million doses from the COVAX global vaccine distribution scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. It also plans to hold talks this week with vaccine developer Moderna, Budi said. A first batch of 1.2 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine arrived this week with another 1.8 million due next month, as authorities await emergency authorisation to begin using the vaccine. A spokesman for Bio Farma, Sinovac’s local partner, said this week that vaccination might start in February, depending on the results of the phase 3 trials now being conducted. President Joko Widodo has said health workers, police and military personnel would be first in line when vaccination begins. Indonesia has had Southeast Asia’s most serious outbreak of the novel coronavirus with nearly 600,000 infections and more than 18,000 deaths.

A second dose should not be given to anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis following administration of the first dose of this vaccine,” said June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Earlier it had warned that people with a “significant allergic reaction” to those things should not take the shot, without specifying anaphylaxis."
-15.38463796580899," Canada approves first COVID-19 vaccine, expects inoculations next week OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Wednesday approved its first COVID-19 vaccine and said initial shots will be delivered and administered across the country starting next week, while every Canadian will be able to be inoculated as early as the end of September. Canada is the third country after Britain and Bahrain to give the green light to Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech SE. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in parliament it was “a good day for Canadians”. “We will see 30,000 vaccines begin to arrive next week with many more on the horizon, but ... we’ve got a tough winter to get through,” Trudeau said. Canada is in the midst of a virulent second wave of the pandemic, with several areas of the country imposing new health restrictions, weighing down what had been a clear rebound after the first wave. General inoculations for all Canadians will begin in April after priority populations are taken care of, the government said in a vaccination plan also released on Wednesday. The nation is now “well-positioned to immunize 100% of the population in 2021,” the plan said, while a separate table distributed by the Health Ministry said immunization could be completed by the end of September. “It is going to be good for Canada and the world economy once the vaccinations start rolling out in a meaningful fashion,” said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corp in Toronto. Toronto’s stock market has rallied about 12% since the end of October and the commodity-linked Canadian dollar has climbed to a 2-1/2-year high against its U.S. counterpart as investors bet that the rollout of vaccines would boost the global economy next year. The vaccine, which the regulator said was “safe, effective and of good quality,” was approved under an interim, accelerated drug review system very similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorizations. It comes a day before a panel of advisers to the FDA is set to review and recommend whether the U.S. agency should authorize use of the Pfizer vaccine. On Tuesday, British citizens became the first in the world to get the shots outside of clinical trials following last week’s UK approval. In a large, late-stage trial, the vaccine was shown to be 95% effective at preventing illness, far better than originally anticipated. However, on Wednesday Britain’s medicine regulator advised that people with a history of significant allergies not get Pfizer’s vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout. Responding to questions on the allergic reactions, Health Canada officials said that is always a risk with vaccines and that they will monitor developments. They only are recommending that people who have previously had adverse reactions to any of the vaccine’s ingredients not take it for now. ‘HISTORIC MOMENT’ The province of Saskatchewan said on Wednesday it expected to receive enough doses for 1,950 people by Tuesday, intended first for healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Quebec expects to have received 55,000 doses of the vaccine by Jan. 4, the premier of the predominantly French-speaking province, Francois Legault, said. Legault also said he is weighing new restrictions and stepping up enforcement of current ones. Alberta will begin vaccinations on Wednesday, with health care workers getting the first 3,900 doses, Health Minister Tyler Shandro said. British Columbia will also have about the same number of doses as Alberta next week, but did not specify when it would begin vaccinating people. The province said it expects to vaccinate 400,000 people by the end of March. As of Tuesday, Canada had reported 429,035 total cases, an increase of 5,981 on the day before, and 12,867 deaths. “Today’s decision from Health Canada is a historic moment in our collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and is a major step towards returning to normalcy in Canada,” Cole Pinnow, president of Pfizer Canada, said in a statement. Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses of the vaccine, enough to inoculate 10 million people, with options to buy up to 56 million more. Pfizer will ship its vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, to warehouses across Canada. For the most part, provincial and territorial health systems will administer the shots, for free. They will have final say over how to use scarce early supplies in their jurisdictions. Priority groups who will get vaccinated first include some healthcare workers, long-term care residents and employees, the elderly and Indigenous populations, according to federal guidelines. Regulators have received rolling applications for three other experimental vaccines, from Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson. The Moderna vaccine is farthest along, having completed pivotal trials showing it to be 94.1% effective at preventing illness and 100% at preventing severe COVID-19. Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses given about three weeks apart. FedEx Corp and Innomar Strategies, a Canada-based unit of U.S. drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp, have been hired to provide logistical support on vaccine delivery."
-16.786680955654006," EXPLAINER-What do the UK cases of allergic reaction mean for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Dec 9 (Reuters) - Britain’s medicines regulator has advised people with a history of significant allergies not to get Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout in the UK. Here are some questions and answers about the cases and what they might mean. Two UK health care workers with a history of significant allergic reactions reported anaphylactoid reactions and are recovering well. Anaphylactoid reactions are allergic reactions that share some of the characteristics of anaphylaxis but are less severe, said UK Drug Safety Research Unit Director Saad Shakir. Anaphylaxis can cause throat swelling, breathing trouble, and difficulty swallowing, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. UK authorities did not describe symptoms further. British regulators initially responded by saying anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food should not take the shot. An adviser to the group later said it was “tweaking” advice in part to say a food allergy was not a risk. Pfizer had excluded people with a history of significant adverse reaction to vaccines or its vaccine’s ingredients from late stage trials. U.S. regulators are expected to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine soon after a Thursday meeting of advisers. Moncef Slaoui, who is spearheading the U.S. government’s vaccine development efforts, said on Wednesday he expected the British allergic reactions would be considered in the U.S. authorization process and that people with known severe allergic reactions probably should not take the vaccine until more was understood.

That would include the vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc. The vaccines work by carrying genetic instructions for making a protein from the virus that the immune system learns to recognize and defend against. The mRNA is encased in a microscopic ""packet"" called a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), or liposome, that protects and delivers the fragile molecule into cells. While this technique is new for vaccines, it has long been used to carry cancer drugs into tumors, because tumors easily take up liposomes. This raises the possibility that tumor tissues would capture some of the liposomes carrying the vaccine's mRNA, said Gerard Milano of Nice University in France. The potential for part of the vaccine to become stuck in tumors and the resulting effect on cancer patients ""is an open question to which there is currently no answer,"" Milano said. In a paper published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer, his team calls for ""a careful evaluation of the efficacy of these promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered as lipid carriers for patients with solid tumors, including a possible re-appraisal of the dosing for optimal protection of this specific and frail population.""

They reported on Wednesday in Environmental Science & Technology that concentrations of genetic material from the virus were up to 1,000 times higher in the solids than in the wastewater, making detection more sensitive and accurate for the solid samples. They also analyzed settled solids collected over several months from waste treatment plants in a large urban area and found that concentrations of genetic material on different days correlated with the number of new COVID-19 cases reported on those days.

-16.786680955654006," Explainer: How Canada will vaccinate its population against COVID-19 OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Wednesday approved the first COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE, and is now preparing to distribute early doses to the most vulnerable groups. Managing the nationwide rollout will be one of the most complex logistical undertakings in the country’s history, officials say. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Canada would receive 30,000 doses next week and up to 249,000 by the end of the year. Only a handful of provinces have so far detailed their immediate plans. Saskatchewan said it expected to receive Pfizer vaccine for 1,950 people by Tuesday, and would use it to inoculate healthcare workers caring directly for COVID-19 patients. Neighboring Manitoba said it expected enough Pfizer vaccine next week to immunize 900 healthcare workers. General immunization for all 38 million Canadians will begin in April 2021 with a goal of 100% coverage by the end of the third quarter, Health Canada said in a document. Officials say priority groups such as healthcare workers, employees in long-term care homes, vulnerable members of the elderly population and those living in remote Indigenous communities will receive vaccines first. Provincial orders for vaccines will be coordinated through a national operations center with help from the military. Pfizer’s ultra-low temperature vaccine will be transported by the manufacturer directly to the 14 points of inoculation that Ottawa has set up across the country. The federal government has contracted FedEx Corp and Innomar Strategies, a Canada-based division of AmerisourceBergen to provide logistical support on vaccine delivery. Frozen vaccines, like Moderna’s, will be transported by federally contracted logistics service providers from where they are manufactured to set points of delivery. Canada is now running distribution drills to ensure that critical capability gaps are filled, risks are mitigated, and contingencies are put in place. Canadian officials say the next regulatory decision will be on Moderna Inc’s candidate vaccine. Canada also has agreements to purchase the potential vaccines of Novavax Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi SA with GlaxoSmithKline Plc, AstraZeneca Plc, and Medicago. If all were to receive regulatory approval, Canada could buy enough doses to vaccinate the country more than five times over. Canada expects the first 6 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna Inc to arrive in the first quarter of 2021, enough for 3 million of the 38 million population. Health authorities in the provinces and territories are responsible for determining how vaccines will be deployed and on administering them to their populations. Inoculation will be free. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has also set up a task force headed by Canada’s former Chief of the Defence Staff Rick Hillier."

-16.786680955654006," 'Light at the end of the tunnel,' as Canada approves COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) - Health Canada on Wednesday approved the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, clearing the way for shots to be delivered and administered across the country. The nation’s first coronavirus vaccine green light comes under a new interim order system that allows for accelerated approval very similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorizations. LINK: here “As a global citizen you couldn’t be happier as there is light at the end of the tunnel. As an investor we can now turn our attention to 2022 and appropriately assess a company’s earnings potential. We think 2022 will be a pivotal year for stocks as the majority of vaccinations won’t occur until the end of 2021 when the true winners and losers from this pandemic will become apparent. We will finally be able to determine which companies have had true terminal value impairment and which companies have seen their end markets grow or capture additional market share.” NORMAN LEVINE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT CORP: “I am really quite pleased that Health Canada acted very quickly on the Pfizer vaccine approval and has deemed it to be quite safe and that people will start getting inoculated, which is needed to get the economy back to some semblance of normal.” “The problem is that Canada like almost every other country it appears is receiving a token amount from Pfizer to start with and it is going to be some time before meaningful amounts start flowing to Canada and other countries.” “Investors should be looking at what are things going to be like when the vaccine rollout is in full force ... it is going to be good for Canada and the world economy once the vaccinations start rolling out in a meaningful fashion.” ALLAN SMALL, SENIOR INVESTMENT ADVISER AT ALLAN SMALL FINANCIAL GROUP WITH HOLLISWEALTH: “The approval of the vaccine in North America in general... will be great for the economy... You will see the markets reflect that in the coming months.” “If you combine the vaccine with the current environment for investing, low interest rates, low inflation, government stimulus, central bank accommodation, I believe it’s tremendous, probably the best environment you could have for the economy and for the stock market going into 2021.” “Overall, distribution is going to be an issue, getting the vaccine out to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible... (But) you’re going to have five or six companies distributing the vaccine early on in the New Year.” “We will have to live through the next month or two, with case counts in the U.S. and Canada going higher, but once we get past January into February and March, I think it is going to be even more optimistic than it is today.” Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the newly-approved vaccine will help alleviate pressure on the province’s congested hospitals once vulnerable people such as health care workers, along with residents of seniors’ homes and long-term care facilities are inoculated. “Once these three groups are vaccinated the situation will improve a lot,” he told reporters. Quebec expects 55,000 doses of the vaccine from now through January 4 and 1.3 million doses from now to March 31. “Relative to our assumptions from a few months ago, what we are seeing on the vaccine front probably means Canada’s recovery is going to gain momentum as 2021 progresses and the economy will get back to full capacity sooner than we had been anticipating and probably sooner than the Bank of Canada had expected.” “We’ve seen a second wave of coronavirus infections and health restrictions being tightened in light of that. That is sapping momentum from the economic recovery in Q4 (the fourth quarter) and heading into 2021. But the positive vaccine news that we have seen over the past month and indications that vaccines are probably going to start being rolled out over the first half of 2021, that creates quite a lot of light at the end of the tunnel.” DR. SAQIB SHAHAB, SASKATCHEWAN’S CHIEF MEDICAL HEALTH OFFICER: “What a remarkable achievement it is for us to have a vaccine 10 months into a pandemic. But it will take time.” “Now we expect to receive those vaccines more quickly than was originally anticipated, and in greater quantities than we originally anticipated.”"

A cargo plane landed at Ben Gurion Airport carrying what officials said were tens of thousands of doses of Pfizer Inc. vaccines for a trial run of transportation and storage procedures. “I believe in this vaccine. I expect that it will get the requisite (regulatory) approvals in the coming days,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an airport ceremony, adding that he intended to be the first Israeli to be vaccinated. Israel will begin administering the vaccines on Dec. 27 and is prepared to vaccinate 60,000 of Israel’s 9 million citizens per day, Netanyahu said in a televised address later on Wednesday. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech agreed last month to provide Israel with 8 million doses of the vaccine, which Britain became the first country to administer on Tuesday. Israel has also ordered vaccines from Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc.. An Israeli cabinet member said this week that the Pfizer vaccines would be administered first to the elderly and other high-risk populations. An executive with distributor Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said vaccines would arrive at greater pace during the course of the month. “We are talking about a huge estimated scope of 4 million vaccine (doses) by year’s end,” Teva Israel Chief Executive Yossi Ofek told Israel’s Army Radio. A Teva spokeswoman said two vaccine doses would be required per person. The Lancet medicine journal estimated in June that 22% of the global population are at “increased risk” of contracting COVID-19. Israel has reported 348,968 coronavirus cases and 2,932 deaths."

More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, including a detailed scientific summary and the full clinical trial data package. “Canadians can feel confident that the review process was rigorous and that we have strong monitoring systems in place. Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will closely monitor the safety of the vaccine once it is on the market and will not hesitate to take action if any safety concerns are identified. “The terms and conditions of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine authorization require the manufacturer to continue providing information to Health Canada on the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine to ensure the benefits of the vaccine continue to be demonstrated through market use. “The initial indication of the vaccine is for use in people 16 years of age or older. Pfizer-BioNTech are running further clinical trials on children of all age groups and the indication could be revised in the future to include children if the data from these studies support it. “The vaccine was authorized under Health Canada’s Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19. This process allowed Health Canada to assess information submitted by the manufacturer as it became available during the product development process, while maintaining Canada’s high standards.”"

The vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE could be authorized for emergency use as soon as this week and must be transported and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or dry ice. More than a dozen U.S. states, including Washington, New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana and Indiana, told Reuters they are rushing to secure dry ice to replenish suitcase-sized shipping containers from Pfizer. Once opened, if being used as temporary storage by a vaccination center, the vaccines can last a total of 30 days with re-icing every five days, Pfizer said. The company said it believes there is sufficient dry ice supplies to serve the needs of all 50 states without serious constraints. “This is the most challenging vaccination program ever attempted. (It) will be especially complicated in rural and remote communities,” said Dr. Kelly Moore, an advisor to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine program and associate director at the Immunization Action Coalition. While the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak was originally centered around densely populated areas in the U.S. Northeast, the coronavirus is now rampaging across the country, hitting small towns and rural areas with limited resources particularly hard. Rural areas account for about 60 million people, less than one fifth of U.S. population. The Pfizer vaccine could soon be followed by another from Moderna Inc that can be kept in a standard freezer. Officials in states including Texas and Arkansas see Moderna’s vaccine as the main solution for rural areas, but many state and hospital officials are planning to receive supplies of the Pfizer vaccine and expressed concerns about logistics involved. Pfizer sends its vaccine in pizza box-sized minimum lots of just under 1,000 doses, along with a dry ice refill to last a total of five days. After the added time it takes getting vaccines to rural communities, “is that sufficient time for them to turn around and vaccinate folks?” asked Soumi Saha, vice president of advocacy at Premier Inc, which coordinates purchases for thousands of U.S. hospitals and health systems. “Are they going to say, ‘Hey, you don’t even have enough people, you’re just gonna waste it’?” she added. “Does that mean that you have these vacuums throughout the country where people don’t even have access, because of that concern?” Batesville, Indiana-based Margaret Mary Health, midway between Cincinnati and Indianapolis, has plans to prevent vaccine waste or spoilage as it prepares to inoculate healthcare workers over its 1,400-square-mile (3,626 square kms) area from two sites, including a drive-through at a local fire department. It has multiple dry ice and deep freezer providers lined up to prevent mishaps, and will schedule vaccination appointments, with a backup list so no-shows do not lead to waste. “If we take it out of the cooler, it’s going into someone’s arm,” said Margaret Mary Chief Executive Tim Putnam. With the optional dry ice refill of 23 kilograms (50.7 pounds) arranged with Pfizer and delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, vaccine recipients are on their own. Many states are already scheduling dry ice deliveries. Gehm and Sons in Akron, Ohio, has a deal to provide Ohio with 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg) a week of dry ice pellets for 55 cents a pound, including delivery. Dry ice is made from carbon dioxide. The Compressed Gas Association trade group said it expects current dry ice production capacity to meet an estimated 5% increase in carbon dioxide demand from vaccines. However, some dry ice suppliers said it is challenging to plan for the vaccine rollout because much is unknown about how much dry ice will be needed. “There’s going to be spots in other parts of the country that there’s vulnerability or weakness in supply,” said Steve Atkins, executive vice president of gases at nexAir in Memphis, Tennessee. Many ethanol plants - a major source of carbon dioxide - were shuttered early in the pandemic. Despite improvement, carbon dioxide production from ethanol plants remains about 25% below this time last year, according to the Renewable Fuels Association. Grant Hagberg’s Indiana dry ice company is fielding calls from mostly local hospitals. Dry ice manufacturers and distributors “are few and far between,” said Hagberg, general manager."

We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature,” June Raine, Chief Executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), told lawmakers. “But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations, the groups who have been selected as a priority, we get that advice to the field immediately.” (Reporting by Alistair Smout, Editing by Paul Sandle)"
-16.786680955654006," Amnesty: rich countries have bought too many COVID-19 vaccines PARIS (Reuters) - Rich countries have secured enough coronavirus vaccines to protect their populations nearly three times over by the end of 2021, Amnesty International and other groups said on Wednesday, possibly depriving billions of people in poorer areas. Britain approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine this month, raising hopes that the tide could soon turn against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million globally, hammered the world economy and upended normal life. Amnesty and other organisations including Frontline AIDS, Global Justice Now and Oxfam, urged governments and the pharmaceutical industry to take action to ensure intellectual property of vaccines is shared widely. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also called on governments repeatedly this year to make a vaccine protecting against COVID-19 a “public good”. The WHO has backed a global vaccine programme scheme known as COVAX, which seeks to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines and 189 countries have joined. But some countries such as the United States have not signed up, having secured bilateral deals. COVAX hopes to deliver some 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 but that would still only represent about 20% of the populations of countries that are part of the mechanism. “Nearly 70 poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten people against COVID-19 next year unless urgent action is taken,” Amnesty International said, based on recent calculations. “Updated data shows that rich nations representing just 14% of the world’s population have bought up 53% of all the most promising vaccines so far,” it said. Amnesty said Canada was the country that had bought the most shots when considering the size of its population with enough doses to vaccinate every Canadian five times. The organisation urged support for a proposal made by South Africa and India to the World Trade Organisation Council to waive intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments."

Pfizer and its partner BioNTech last month agreed to provide Israel with 8 million doses of the vaccine, which Britain became the first country to administer on Tuesday. The prime minister’s office said in a statement Netanyahu would be at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion airport when a plane carrying the first shipment of the vaccine lands later on Wednesday. Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen said earlier this week a first batch of vaccines would arrive in Israel on Thursday to be administered on the elderly and other high-risk populations. Israeli media reported Wednesday’s shipment would be small and used in a trial run to test transportation and storage procedures, while a larger batch containing 110,000 doses would arrive on Thursday. Israel, with a population of 9 million, has reported 347,497 coronavirus cases and 2,925 deaths. (Reporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa)"

FedEx and UPS are key partners to the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine project and will move millions of doses for Pfizer Inc and other pharmaceutical companies. Experts predict that the unprecedented size of the COVID-19 project will test the nation’s cold-chain shipping capabilities. “There’s plenty of capacity in our networks to handle this, and remember it’s not all going to hit us on a Tuesday,” Smith said during the Operation Warp Speed vaccine summit at the White House. “It’s going to come over time, so we’ve got this.

-18.41239757636034," Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine data wins backing of U.S. FDA staff, authorization nears (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc cleared the next hurdle in the race to get its COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use on Tuesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released documents that raised no new issues about its safety or efficacy. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE said last month their coronavirus vaccine’s two-dose regimen was 95% effective against COVID-19 and had no major safety issues and asked the FDA for emergency use authorization. The vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for emergency use authorization, FDA staff said in documents released ahead of a Thursday meeting of outside experts to the FDA who will discuss whether to recommend the Pfizer shot for people aged 16 and older. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in research note the documents were “very simple and straightforward, which we think will lead to approval imminently.” The agency typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels but is not required to do so. It is not clear how many days or weeks the FDA will take to make a decision, but states are prepping for vaccine deliveries in mid-December. The documents were released on the day Britons began getting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the world’s first recipients outside of clinical trials. “There are no surprises here. The efficacy and the safety is consistent with what we heard and what we hoped for. It does look like the vaccine is safe, at least in the short term,” said Dr. Daniel Culver, chair of Pulmonary Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, in an interview. He said the data showing it was as effective in older people as in younger people was reassuring. Pfizer shares rose nearly 2% and BioNTech’s U.S. shares were up 2.5% in early trading. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Tuesday he expects a “very intense” meeting with a U.S. vaccine advisory panel this week, but is counting on the panel of outside experts to sign off on his company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate. “I think they will vote ‘yes’ given the strength of the data,” Bourla said at a conference hosted by a pharmaceutical industry group. Data from the trial showed that the vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients even before they received the second shot, the FDA said. The effect became most pronounced about 14 days after people received the first shot. The agency’s staff noted that more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single-dose shot. It said that the efficacy after dose 1 and before dose 2 was around 52 percent. A two-dose vaccination was highly effective in preventing confirmed cases of COVID-19 at least seven days after the last dose, FDA staff said. The FDA staff also said that available data, while limited, suggested the people who had been previously infected with the new coronavirus could benefit from vaccination. Very few cases of confirmed COVID-19 occurred among participants with evidence of infection prior to vaccination, though more of those that did were in the placebo group than the vaccine group, the staff said. FDA staff also said that the trial, which was designed to look at effectiveness against COVID-19, did not produce data to answer the question of if it also stopped infection. In terms of safety, the FDA staff said there was currently insufficient data to make conclusions about the safety of the vaccine in people below 16 years of age, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems. There were a total of six deaths in the 44,000 person trial, with two deaths among those who got the vaccine and the rest in those who received a placebo, the documents showed. All deaths represent events that occur in the general population at a similar rate, FDA staff said."

-18.41239757636034," In COVID-19 milestone for West, Britain starts mass vaccination LONDON (Reuters) - A 90-year-old grandmother became the world’s first person to receive a fully-tested COVID-19 shot on Tuesday, as Britain began mass-vaccinating its people in a global drive that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history. Health workers started inoculating the most vulnerable with the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, with the country a test case for the world as it contends with distributing a compound that must be stored at -70C (-94F). Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 in a week, was the first to receive the shot, at a hospital in Coventry, central England. “It’s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of (this) year,” she said. Pfizer received another boost when the U.S. regulator’s staff raised no new safety or efficacy issues. The launch of the vaccine, one of three shots that have reported successful results from large trials, will stir hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people. Britain, the worst-hit in Europe with over 61,000 deaths, is the first Western nation to begin mass vaccinations and the first globally to administer the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. But despite the relief of people receiving the first of the two-dose regimen, they will have to wait three weeks for their second shot, and there is no evidence immunisation will reduce transmission of the virus. “It will gradually make a huge, huge difference. But I stress gradually, because we’re not there yet. We haven’t defeated this virus yet,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he expected millions to be vaccinated by the end of the year, and described the start of the drive as “V-Day”. But he cautioned people should respect social-distancing rules until spring at least, when he hoped the most vulnerable people would be vaccinated. Britain has ordered enough supplies of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million. The developers said it was 95% effective in preventing illness in final-stage trials. Russia and China have both already started giving domestically produced vaccine candidates to their populations, though before final safety and efficacy trials have been completed. In Britain, about 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care-home residents and carers, the over-80s and some health workers prioritised. Hancock said he had a “high degree of confidence” Britain would take delivery of another batch of the vaccine next week. “I know we’re absolutely bursting at the doors with COVID patients, so I more than anybody want it to happen quickly,” said Ami Jones, a hospital intensive-care consultant from Wales who received the jab before going to work. Britain is relatively small with good infrastructure. Yet the logistical challenges in distributing the vaccine, which only lasts five days in a regular fridge, mean it will first go to dozens of hospitals and cannot yet be taken into care homes. Bigger tests could await the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, as well as one from Moderna, which was found to have a similar level of success in trials and is based on the same mRNA genetic technology that requires such ultra-cold storage. Transport and distribution could prove more difficult in hot countries and bigger nations such as the United States and India, which have been worst-hit by COVID-19 and are expected to approve the shot for emergency use in the coming days or weeks. South Korea, which has coped relatively well with the pandemic, sounded a note of caution, saying it would not hurry vaccine rollouts, partly to give it time to observe potential side-effects in other countries. Vaccinations may start in the first half of 2021, the health ministry added. The third vaccine with trial success, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because it is cheaper and can be transported at normal fridge temperatures. But AstraZeneca and Oxford have more work to do to confirm whether their vaccine can be 90% effective, a peer-reviewed paper in The Lancet showed on Tuesday, potentially slowing its rollout. Late-stage trials found it had average efficacy of 70.4% in peer-reviewed data. [nL8N2IO4AN] Britain approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use less than a week ago, and is rolling it out ahead of the United States and European Union, with which Britain will finally part ways at the end of this year. The Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31, and there is the possibility of chaos at ports afterwards, so military aircraft are on standby to step in. In total, Britain has ordered 357 million doses of seven different COVID-19 vaccines. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being imported from Belgium, while initial supplies of the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot are being shipped from Europe. Amid the gravity of the pandemic, the vaccination on Tuesday of one William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old man from Warwickshire in England, was greeted with humour on social media. Twitter users joked about “The Taming of the Flu” and “The Two Gentlemen of Corona”. Some asked whether Margaret Keenan was patient 1A, and Shakespeare “Patient 2B or not 2B?”"
-18.41239757636034," Factbox-Britain begins rollout of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will start rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday, the first Western country to begin vaccinating its population against infection from the new coronavirus. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the shot are needed per person to gain immunity. Below are details on what the government, companies and health service have said about the manufacturing and storage process, logistics of the rollout, who gets the vaccine and where they will get it. - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below. - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days. - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius). - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites. - Pfizer dispatched initial volumes of vaccine from Belgium, which arrived at secure locations in Britain by the weekend. Around 800,000 doses are expected to be available in the first week of rollout. - After arriving, there is a post-delivery quality assurance process to ensure the vaccine’s quality and integrity has been maintained through transit, which can take 12-24 hours. - Each box is then opened and unpacked manually, with temperature data downloaded from each box. - There are five packs of 975 doses per box. Only sites with the right regulatory licence can split the vaccine packs, which limits where they can be sent in the first instance. - Britain has said the speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine. - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year. - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality. - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the vaccine. - At first, the vaccine will be available from around 50 “Hospital Hubs”, where shots will be defrosted and then prepared. - Over 1,000 local vaccination centres, operated by groups of general practitioners (GPs), will then open. The health service has asked doctors to be ready to begin vaccinations from Dec. 14. - When there is more vaccine and it is possible to split the packs up, the government has said it plans bigger vaccination centres and smaller arrangements through local pharmacies."
-18.41239757636034," Some workers given priority in Irish COVID-19 vaccine rollout (The story corrects headline, first, fifth paragraph to show highest ‘key worker’ group refers to those involved in vaccine programme) DUBLIN (Reuters) - Workers in the Irish education sector and those in essential jobs unable to avoid a high risk of exposure will be prioritised in the government’s planned COVID-19 vaccine rollout ahead of a wider distribution to under 65s. European Union governments are considering who should receive vaccines first as they await a decision later this month from the bloc’s drug regulator on whether to approve the first candidate developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Neighbouring Britain became the first Western country to begin vaccinating its population on Tuesday. It is prioritising care homes, health workers, people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions and those in descending age groups from 80 to 50 in its first wave. A slightly different approach outlined by Ireland on Tuesday will see key workers in services essential to the vaccination programme such as logistics receiving the shot after elderly care home residents, the over 65s and healthcare workers but before those under the age of 65 with medical conditions or living in crowded accommodation. Key workers in environments where there is a high risk of exposure, such as food supply, public and commercial transport, will be placed ahead of those aged 55-64 years, alongside school and pre-school staff. Next in line, “occupations important to the functioning of society” where protective measures can be followed without much difficulty, such as the entertainment sector, will get priority over the remaining 18-54 year-olds to try to enable social and economic activity, the government said. If, at that point, evidence demonstrates the vaccine or vaccines prevent transmission, those aged 18-34 should be prioritised because of their increased level of social contact and role in transmission, it added."
-18.41239757636034," CDC advisers to review data on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) - A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel will meet on Friday to review data on the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, with a vote expected on Sunday on specific recommendations to doctors on how it should be used. The CDC panel meeting (bit.ly/36WEmXa) will follow Thursday's meeting of an independent advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that will discuss Pfizer's vaccine data and recommend whether it should be authorized for emergency use. The FDA will have the final say. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert and non-voting member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), said the gap between the two ACIP meetings will allow the FDA time to draft and issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) before the ACIP vote. That schedule could change, however, if FDA advisers have questions or request more data, he said. ACIP last week voted for healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities to receive the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. Healthcare personnel who have been infected with the coronavirus in the three preceding months, can choose to delay vaccination to let those susceptible to infection receive the shots first, the agency said on its website (bit.ly/36X5gOJ). “Current evidence suggests reinfection is uncommon during this period after initial infection,” it said. Pfizer last month said its vaccine’s two-dose regimen was 95% effective at preventing illness from COVID-19 and had no major safety issues. The drugmaker is set to present its data to ACIP on Friday. The FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for Thursday’s advisory committee meeting, saying the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization. The ACIP panel will have to make recommendations about several groups, including whether the vaccine should be used in adolescents aged 16 to 18, and whether it should be used in pregnant women, who were excluded from Pfizer’s late-stage trial. Schaffner, who represents the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases on the ACIP panel, said more than 300,000 healthcare workers are women who are pregnant or lactating. “This is not trivial,” Schaffner said. “The question will immediately come up at every medical center: ‘Do you offer those persons the vaccine? And if so, under what circumstance?’” So far, ACIP discussions have been leaning toward allowing these women to take the vaccine after having received full information on its safety and efficacy, he said, but they have yet to vote on the matter. The CDC sets U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules based on ACIP recommendations. A meeting of advisers to the FDA is scheduled for Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, which is also being reviewed for emergency use in the United States."
-18.41239757636034," Testing times: More work needed on Astra/Oxford vaccine trials LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca and Oxford University have more work to do to confirm whether their COVID-19 vaccine can be 90% effective, peer-reviewed data published in The Lancet showed on Tuesday, potentially slowing its eventual rollout in the fight against the pandemic. Once seen as the frontrunner in the development of a vaccine against the coronavirus crisis, the British team was overtaken by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, whose shots - with a success rate of around 95% - were administered to UK pensioners on Tuesday in a world-first hailed as V-Day. Detailed results from the AstraZeneca/Oxford trials have been eagerly awaited after some scientists criticised a lack of information in their initial announcement last month. However, the Lancet study gave few extra clues about why efficacy was 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose. “(This) will require further research as more data becomes available from the trial,” the study said. Less than 6% of UK trial participants were given the lower dose regimen and none of them was aged over 55, meaning more research will be needed to investigate the vaccine’s efficacy in older people who are particularly susceptible to COVID-19. Pooling the results, overall efficacy was 70.4%, the data on Tuesday showed. That is above the 50% minimum set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech and from Moderna have reported efficacy levels of more than 90% in late stage trials. But the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is seen as particularly important to tackling the pandemic in the developing world, as it would be cheaper and easier to distribute. “The basic message: that the overall efficacy across the trials that are reported here is about 70% but with a clear description of its uncertainty,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “The statistical uncertainty is that the efficacy could be as low as 55% or as high as 80%. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both have efficacies above 90% and are clearly more efficacious under trial conditions.” Asked whether the half, then full dose regimen had been a mistake, Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator into the trials, told a news conference it had been “unplanned.” Mene Pangalos, head of AstraZeneca’s non-oncology research and development, said requests for regulatory approval around the globe could still be submitted this year. “We hope that once the regulatory authorities review the data, we can get approval any time from the completion of the submission, which could be any time from the end of this year to early next year,” he said. However, Pollard conceded the different results from the two dosage regimens complicated matters. “The regulators will decide exactly what their label should say,” he said, when asked whether regulators might approve the two full shots regiment first, and then potentially the half, then full, shot regiment when more data is in. Pangalos also said he assumed U.S. regulators would want to see results from an ongoing trial in the United States before giving their approval. He left it open whether a costly new trial was needed, as the company previously said was likely, because more infections in the ongoing trials may provide the needed clarity. “We haven’t yet decided on what a next study would be, if we do a next study ... we will decide in due course.” Pfizer on Tuesday cleared the next hurdle in the race to get its vaccine approved for U.S. emergency use after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released documents that raised no new issues about its safety or efficacy. The Oxford researchers, in turn, said their vaccine was found to be safe, with three out of the roughly 23,700 participants experiencing serious conditions that were possibly related to either the COVID-19 vaccine or a standard meningitis vaccine given to a control group. A case of a serious neurological illness, transverse myelitis, was reported 14 days after a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, which was “possibly related to vaccination,” they said. This case had led to a seven-week trial suspension in the United States and to brief halts in trials in other countries. A case of fever above 40°C occurred in South Africa, but it was not disclosed whether this participant received the vaccine because the person recovered quickly and is continuing the trial without knowledge of the shot received, as is the norm."

Pfizer and other makers can produce their vaccines in other countries, Dominic LeBlanc, minister of intergovernmental affairs, said at a news conference. “We’re very confident that Pfizer and other vaccine makers that are contractually obligated to deliver vaccine doses to Canada will be able to meet those obligations,” LeBlanc said. “We’re confident that there won’t be any disruption in the effective and timely supply of vaccines.

-18.41239757636034," Explainer-I just got a COVID-19 vaccine. Now what? (Reuters) -Britain on Tuesday became the first country in the world to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE , initially making the shot available at 50 hospitals. The country’s National Health Service is giving priority to vaccinating people over the age of 80, frontline healthcare workers and nursing home staff and residents. The following is what people getting the vaccine should expect. The vaccine, developed with new messenger RNA technology using a manufactured fragment of the coronavirus’ genetic code, is injected into the arm. The inoculation is given in two doses, three weeks apart, and has been shown in trials to prevent illness from COVID-19 in 95% of recipients. Pfizer has said side effects in trial volunteers were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The most severe side effects occurred after the second dose: fatigue in 3.8% of volunteers and headache in 2%. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events. The vaccine begins conferring some protection after the first shot and reaches full effectiveness about a week after the second shot, according to a review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday. Clinical trials so far have not been designed to determine if an immunized person can still spread the coronavirus to someone else. Some vaccines, such as hepatitis A, do provide such protection - known as sterilizing immunity - but others do not. COVID-19 vaccine makers focused trials on determining whether the drug stopped people from becoming ill. It will also be several more months before it becomes clear how long the vaccination will protect someone from the coronavirus. “Until then, it is better to avoid the pub, and other in-person gatherings with many people,” said Dr. Anita Shet, infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since there is no evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of the virus - and no vaccine is 100% effective - scientists call for continued vigilance, including mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing. “As with all vaccines, it may work really great in certain patient subsets, but not as well in others ... Does that mean you are free to hop on a plane or have 30 people over at your house? Probably not,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director for infection prevention at Colorado’s UCHealth. Vaccination campaigns are unlikely to reach “a critical mass” until next spring or early summer."

The FDA released documents on Tuesday saying Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for the authorization. The CDC sets the U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules based on recommendations from ACIP. The panel’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations will include specifics about which age groups should receive the vaccine, the number of doses needed, gap between doses and precautions. The committee last week voted for healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities to receive the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. A meeting of advisers to the FDA is scheduled for Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna Inc’s vaccine candidate, which is also being reviewed for emergency use in the United States."
-18.41239757636034," Pfizer says it is committed to Canadian vaccine agreements ahead of U.S. executive order TORONTO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it is committed to honoring its agreements with the Canadian government to provide COVID-19 vaccines, in response to questions about a U.S. executive order expected on Tuesday that is meant to ensure Americans’ priority access to the shots. President Donald Trump’s executive order is intended to ensure priority access for COVID-19 vaccines procured by the U.S. government, ahead of other nations, senior administration officials said on Monday. “We are committed to honoring our agreements with the Government of Canada,” said Pfizer Canada spokeswoman Christina Antoniou. “We are a global company that prioritizes patients all over the world.” On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine Pfizer developed with German partner BionNTech SE would arrive this month, and a further three million doses should be delivered at the start of 2021. The vaccine is expected to be the first to secure regulatory approval in Canada, though the country has signed supply deals with seven manufacturers.

-18.41239757636034," Pfizer CEO confident of getting U.S. advisory panel nod for COVID-19 vaccine ZURICH (Reuters) -Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Tuesday he expects a “very intense” meeting with a U.S. vaccine advisory panel this week but is counting on the outside experts to sign off on his company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Bourla, speaking on a call with reporters on Tuesday, also reiterated confidence in Pfizer’s ability to deliver its mRNA vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, even though it must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. He added the companies are working on a “new formulation” capable of withstanding higher temperatures. His comments came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released documents raising no new safety or efficacy issues with Pfizer’s vaccine, setting the stage for Thursday’s meeting with outside experts to the FDA who will discuss recommending the shot. “We have answers to every question they will ask,” Bourla said. “I think they will vote ‘yes’ given the strength of the data.” His vaccine, already being delivered in limited quantities in Britain after its emergency approval there, has raised concerns due to the Antarctic temperatures it must be stored at, though Pfizer and BioNTech have sought to reassure that it can survive at 2 and 8 degrees for a limited time. Bourla said he was “very comfortable” with the companies’ ability to distribute the vaccine at minus 70 degrees by using special storage boxes developed by their mechanics. “You can transport (it) in a normal car, for example, we have GPS and thermometers inside those boxes, so at any point in time, we know where each box is, and the temperature,” Bourla said. “We’ve started already in the UK and things are going very well,” he said. “I think everybody will see pretty soon that this is not a challenge, at least in countries where there is basic infrastructure, like a road or a place to store things.” Bourla said the companies are pursuing changes to make the vaccine potentially more suitable for developing countries including Africa where such infrastructure may not be in place. “Yes, we are working also on a new formulation that will be able to avoid the minus 70 and can be stored in simple refrigeration,” he said."

-18.41239757636034," 'Go for it,' says grandmother who got world's first Pfizer COVID vaccine in Britain LONDON (Reuters) - Margaret Keenan, the 90-year-old grandmother who became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine outside of a trial in Britain on Tuesday, has a message for others: “go for it” to beat the devastating disease. An early riser, Keenan, from Northern Ireland, received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot at her local hospital in Coventry, central England, at 0631 GMT, a week before she turns 91. A video showed her being wheeled out of the ward while nursing staff clad in protective gear lined the corridor to applaud and cheer, an echo of moving video clips released through the year when COVID-19 survivors left hospital. “I say go for it, go for it because it’s free and it’s the best thing that has ever happened,” Keenan told reporters as cameras flashed and television reporters asked questions. “If I can do it, well, so can you,” she told any doubters. Known as Maggie to her friends, Keenan said she had stuck by the rules and spent most of the year on her own as the “devastating” pandemic took hold. The vaccine means she can start to look forward to spending time with her family and friends again. Britain is the first Western country to start immunising its population in what has been hailed as a turning point in the battle to defeat the disease. It is the worst-hit country in Europe with more than 61,000 deaths. “I wasn’t nervous at all,” Keenan said, before discussing plans for her birthday. Video footage showed the former jewellery shop assistant wearing a light blue mask, a grey cardigan and a blue T-shirt with a penguin in snow and the message “Merry Christmas”. She received the shot in her left arm from nurse May Parsons, who has worked in Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) for 24 years. “WE WILL BEAT THIS TOGETHER” The mass inoculation will fuel hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has crushed economies and killed more than 1.5 million. Parsons said the last few months had been tough, but that there was now light at the end of the tunnel. “I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day,” said Parsons, originally from the Philippines. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Stephen Powis, medical director for NHS England, said they had both found it emotional watching the vaccine programme rollout. Hancock wiped away tears on live television. An 86-year-old British woman who will also receive the shot on Tuesday was choked with emotion as she recounted on the radio how she had had to grieve for her husband alone after he died with the disease. She is looking forward to going to the shops and taking the bus again. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care home residents and carers, the over-80s and some health service workers the top priority to get them. Keenan said she hadn’t made history before but was very proud to have played her part. For now, though, she said she planned to have a little rest."

-18.41239757636034," South Korea to buy millions of coronavirus vaccine doses but sees no need to hurry SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Tuesday it had signed deals to provide coronavirus vaccines for 44 million people next year but it would not hurry inoculation to allow more time to observe potential side effects. Its cautious approach comes as the country of almost 52 million people battles surging COVID-19 infections that health authorities say threaten to overwhelm the medical system. Other countries are moving ahead to grant emergency use approval for the vaccines in a bid to contain virus transmission. Britain began rolling out Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, and the United States and India have launched regulatory reviews on some vaccine candidates. The South Korean government has arranged to buy 20 million doses each from AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc, and another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, enough to cover up to 34 million people, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told a briefing. Additional doses for 10 million people would be procured through the World Health Organization’s global vaccine project, known as COVAX, he added. Despite the current surge in cases, South Korea’s relative success in tamping down previous waves meant the government did not need to rush a vaccine, Park said. “We don’t see the need to hurriedly begin vaccination without ensuring that the vaccines’ risks have been verified,” he said. Shipments would begin no later than March, and vaccinations may start in the first half of next year depending on factors such as observations in other countries about their safety, the spread of COVID-19 and public demand, the health ministry said. “We had initially planned to secure vaccines for 30 million people but decided to purchase more, as there is uncertainty over the success of the vaccine candidates and the competition is intense among countries for early purchases,” Park said. The government allocated an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year’s budget for vaccines. The first vaccines would likely go to medical workers, elderly and medically vulnerable people, and social workers. The government will seek to set up new storage to ensure the vaccines are kept at the right temperatures, with the Pfizer product required to be refrigerated at minus 70 Celsius degrees (minus 94 Fahrenheit degrees). The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 594 new COVID-19 infections as of midnight Monday, bringing the country’s total to 38,755, with 552 deaths. South Korea’s previous two waves of infections were largely focused around a handful of facilities or events, while the new surge is being driven by smaller, harder-to-trace clusters in and around the densely populated capital city of Seoul. Vice Health Minister Kang Do-tae said the government had been unable to trace the origin of 26% of all cases. “If social distancing is not implemented properly, outbreaks in the greater Seoul area would lead to greater transmissions nationwide,” Kang told a meeting of health officials according to a transcript from the health ministry. Health authorities predicted daily cases would hover between 550 and 750 this week, and could rise as high as 900 next week. If such predictions are accurate, Kang said the country’s health system may collapse. “There could be a dangerous situation where it becomes difficult not only to treat COVID-19 patients but also to provide essential medical services,” he said."

When news broke that the UK had become the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine and that Moderna was hot on its heels having applied for regulator permission in the US and Europe, more than a thousand broadcast channels used Reuters footage to tell the story. On the day coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 200,000 a day, Reuters went inside a Chicago hospital to tell the story behind the numbers, showing how families were keeping in touch with severely sick relatives using tablet computers and Facetime in a piece that was widely used by media outlets worldwide. Comprehensive text and video footage was bolstered by a Wider Image piece looking at how COVID-19 upended life as we know it in a matter of weeks, detailing the journey from the first cases in Wuhan to the rapid global spread through a series of striking images, showing the impact of the pandemic around the world. In addition, a series of innovative Reuters graphics allows users to track the latest news on cases and vaccines progress around the world. Data on the outbreak from 240 countries and territories, including new cases and deaths, is updated daily to track the latest trends. Reuters ‘Tracking the vaccine race’ graphic makes sense of the most important information on the race for a vaccine and offers readers a comprehensive roundup of leading candidates, new technologies to watch and all the latest developments through graphics and clear visuals. Reuters Data Visualization Developer Travis Hartman explains the process behind the new vaccine graphic: “I’d say the main challenge in getting the piece together was to refine what information was most important to surface from the massive amount out there on all the vaccines available. The project went through many iterations before it came to its final presentation and has both an “at-a-glance” summary at the top and a sortable set of cards for each vaccine at the bottom, which hopefully provides our many types of consumers with the information that they need.” Reuters Medical News Editor, Christine Soares says “The visual theme of a “Scorecard” and little individual “baseball cards” was a great solution to the editorial challenge of tracking what is perceived as a “race,” but without us appearing to pick winners and losers, or even appear to be calling them that. Rather, the idea is to define some of the important criteria to think about with regard to the vaccines and then just show in a neutral way which “boxes” a specific vaccine “checks,” as well as where it stands objectively in its progress toward reaching the market. Then readers can judge which aspects are most meaningful to them.” Get access to all the latest news on the race for a vaccine on Reuters.com and Reuters Connect.

-18.41239757636034," Trump to order priority access to U.S. COVID-19 vaccines for Americans WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to ensure that priority access for COVID-19 vaccines procured by the U.S. government is given to the American people before assisting other nations, senior administration officials said on Monday. The Trump administration is confident it will have enough vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants a vaccine by the end of the second quarter of 2021, one official said, disputing a New York Times story that the government declined when Pfizer Inc offered in late summer to sell more vaccine doses to the United States. Trump, who has faced sharp criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, is eager to take credit for the speedy development and distribution of a vaccine. One official said the executive order would lead to the formulation of guidelines for U.S. government agencies to help other countries procure the vaccine once demand in the United States was met. It was unclear why an executive order was needed to ensure that the vaccines would be distributed domestically first, though the order appeared to be designed in part to underscore Trump’s “America First” philosophy ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden. The White House is holding a summit on Tuesday to explain plans for vaccine distribution through Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which has been organizing the effort. Trump and other officials will speak. Vaccine developers Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc will not attend. A White House official said the companies were not coming because they had active applications pending before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A senior FDA official, Dr. Peter Marks, is scheduled to address the Tuesday event. Invitees at the meeting include drug distributors, pharmacies and logistics companies such as McKesson Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, CVS Health Corp, United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp. The New York Times reported that Pfizer may not be able to provide more of its vaccine to the United States until next June because of its commitments to other countries. An administration official noted that Pfizer’s vaccine was still in clinical trials last summer and that the government secured advanced deals to acquire multiple other vaccine candidates. “Anyone who wanted to sell us, guaranteed without an EUA (FDA emergency use authorization) approval, hundreds of millions of doses back in July and August was just not going to get the government’s money,” the person added. About 85 percent of long-term care and assisted living facilities around the country had signed up for a mobile vaccination service provided by CVS and Walgreens, the official said. The U.S. government was concerned about cyber attacks related to the vaccine and had protected itself against them, he added. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said: “The U.S. government placed an initial order of 100 million doses for Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, and Pfizer is ready to begin shipping initial doses soon after receiving an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. Any additional doses beyond the 100 million are subject to a separate and mutually acceptable agreement.” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told NBC News the U.S. government had the option to purchase an additional 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine but declined to say whether the administration was pursuing that option. Representatives from Democratic President-elect Biden’s transition team were not invited to the summit. Trump, a Republican who lost the Nov. 3 election to Biden, has refused to concede.

Additional doses for 10 million people will be procured through the World Health Organization’s global vaccine project, known as COVAX."

The ministry said in a statement that the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, whose final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, will be delivered next year. Earlier on Monday, President Jair Bolsonaro said that the government will offer COVID-19 vaccines to all Brazilians free of charge, once health regulator Anvisa gives it scientific and legal approval. In a post on his Twitter account, Bolsonaro said the economy ministry has assured him that there will be no shortage of resources to administer a vaccine to everyone who wants one. “Once certified by @anvisa_oficial (scientific guidelines and legal precepts), @govbr will offer the vaccine to all, free of charge and not mandatory,” Bolsonaro tweeted. Bolsonaro’s tweet came shortly before the president of Sao Paulo’s Butantan Institute biomedical center, Dimas Covas, said all necessary data for the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd has been or will soon be sent to health regulator Anvisa. He expects Anvisa to approve it, regardless of the political storm between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria over competing vaccines. “I want to think that no political problem is bigger than people’s lives,” Covas said in an interview with GloboNews. Doria said earlier on Monday that the country’s most populous state plans to start vaccinating its population against COVID-19 on Jan. 25, The federal government expects to roll out its own immunization plan at least a month later. Doria’s ambitious timeline comes even though the Sinovac vaccine has yet to be approved by Anvisa. Doria has frequently clashed over the vaccine with Bolsonaro, an aggressive China critic who has baselessly dismissed the Sinovac candidate as lacking credibility. A successful early rollout would mark a significant political victory for Doria, a center-right politician who is expected to run against Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential elections. Brazil has the world’s third highest coronavirus case count at more than 6.6 million, and the second heaviest death toll of more than 177,000."

-18.41239757636034," Hailing 'turning point', Britain begins roll-out of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Britain will start rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday, the first Western country to start vaccinating its general population in what was hailed as a decisive watershed in defeating the coronavirus. The mass inoculation will fuel hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has crushed economies and killed more than 1.5 million, although ultra-cold storage and tricky logistics will limit its use for now. Britain is the worst-hit European country from COVID-19, with over 61,000 deaths, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to turn the tide against the disease by rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine before the United States or European Union. Britain approved the vaccine for emergency use less than a week ago, and is rolling it out through its National Health Service (NHS). “The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic,” said NHS chief executive Simon Stevens. “NHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this COVID jab” In total Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care home residents and carers, the over 80s and some health service workers the top priority to get them. The roll-out provides a test case for Pfizer and BioNTech’s distribution networks. The shot must be stored at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge. While Britain is relatively small and has good infrastructure, the logistical challenges mean it will first be applied in 50 hospitals and cannot yet be taken into care homes. Pfizer and BioNTech said their shot proved 95% effective in preventing illness in final-stage trials. In all, Britain has ordered 357 million doses of seven different COVID-19 vaccines. Russia and China have both started giving vaccine candidates to their populations before final safety and efficacy trials have been completed."

-15.821376623521255," Canada set to receive first doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine this year OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will start receiving its first doses of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine before the end of December, sooner than expected, with millions more to follow in early 2021, officials said on Monday. The news could help the minority Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fend off attacks from opposition parties that have accused Ottawa of acting too slowly to tackle a worsening coronavirus second wave. Officials had initially expected to get a total of six million doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna Inc by end-March. That would be enough to inoculate three million people as both vaccines require two shots about a month apart. But Trudeau said up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine Pfizer is producing with German partner BionNTech SE would arrive this month, and a further three million doses should be delivered at the start of 2021. Saying vaccinations could start next week, Trudeau dismissed the suggestion his government had pressed for early delivery to relieve political attacks by the opposition. “There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty in terms of which vaccines were going to arrive first ... we wanted not to get people’s hopes up,” he told reporters, repeating Ottawa expects regulators to approve the Pfizer vaccine this week. Erin O’Toole, leader of the official opposition Conservatives, said it was unacceptable Trudeau had not made clear when every Canadian would be vaccinated. Several of the 10 provinces are reimposing restrictions on businesses and limiting the size of gatherings as the number of new cases sets daily records. Canada has reported a total of 415,182 cases of COVID-19 and 12,665 deaths. Trudeau said isolated Indigenous communities were a “priority population” for the vaccine and would be among those receiving the first inoculations at the start of next year. For logistical reasons, the three northern territories have requested Moderna’s vaccine, which does not have the same ultra-cold delivery requirements as Pfizer’s, one official said. Ontario and Quebec, the two most populous provinces, account for 67% of the total cases and 87% of the deaths. Ontario announced on Monday that it would prioritize vaccinating healthcare workers and staff, residents and essential visitors in long-term care homes, and adults in Indigenous communities. Quebec said it would receive 4,000 doses next week and start vaccinating nursing home residents."

-15.821376623521255," India speeding up review of Pfizer, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines: senior official NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India is accelerating its review of COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca to authorise for emergency use, a senior official said on Monday, as the world’s second-hardest hit country seeks to contain the virus outbreak. The government is pinning its hopes for mass supply on the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer by volume, which lodged the first formal application for emergency-use approval of AstraZeneca’s shot on Monday. Pfizer had already applied for emergency-use approval for its vaccine in India over the weekend, the government official said, declining to be identified due to the confidential nature of the information. “We are in the process of reviewing. It is an accelerated reviewing process, which is there for Serum too,” said the official. “It is the need of the hour. We have to review at the earliest.” India’s Bharat Biotech also filed an application on Monday seeking emergency-use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, the official said. The private pharmaceutical company based in the southern city of Hyderabad is developing a shot called Covaxin that it plans to launch by the second quarter of 2021. The company could not immediately be reached for comment. The country of over 1.3 billion people has 9.68 million infections, putting it second only to the United States for COVID-19 cases, while more than 140,000 people have died. Lockdowns imposed to contain the spread of the virus have plunged the economy into one of its worst downturns in decades. Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted that the move to apply for emergency use “will save countless lives”, but did not give any other details. The company declined to reply to Reuters’ follow-up questions about the process. AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna Inc are among the drugmakers seeking advanced approvals for their vaccines, which are increasingly being seen by governments as the only way to stop the pandemic. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, called “Covishield” by Serum Institute, has less stringent storage requirements and is expected to be easier to distribute and faster to scale up in low-income countries. But it is also facing queries from scientists over the robustness of some of its trial data, which showed a 1.5 dose regimen delivered more than 90% efficacy and a full two-dose regimen just 62%, both administered over two stages. Britain and some other nations have pressed on with plans to roll out the AstraZeneca vaccine, while the Philippines and Thailand secured millions of doses, giving the shot a vote of confidence. AstraZeneca said two weeks ago that it could launch an additional trial to evaluate the lower dose regimen, but Serum Institute has said it would continue to test only the two full doses as it would delay trials. Poonawalla has said here the company will first focus on supplying the vaccine in India before distributing it to other countries, pricing it at 1,000 rupees per dose ($13.50) for private markets. Serum Institute has also said an emergency-use approval could preface a full rollout by February or March."

-15.723356247567772," Britain gets ready for rollout of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine this week LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is preparing to become the first country to roll out the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine this week, initially making the shot available at hospitals before distributing stocks to doctors’ clinics, the government said on Sunday. Footage posted by the National Health Service (NHS) showed boxes containing doses of the vaccine being delivered to Croydon University Hospital in south London and being stored in a special, securely locked fridge. “This is just so exciting. It’s a momentous occasion,” said Louise Coghlan, joint chief pharmacist at the Croydon health service. “To know that they are here and we are much the first in the country to actually receive the vaccine, and therefore the first in the world, is just amazing. I’m so proud.” The first doses are set to be administered on Tuesday, with the NHS giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents. Britain gave emergency use approval for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech last week - jumping ahead in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history. In total, Britain has ordered 40 million doses. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week. Initial doses that have arrived from Belgium are being stored in secure locations across the country, where they will be quality checked, the health ministry said. The rollout coincides with a crucial and perilous moment in negotiations between Britain and the European Union on a post-Brexit trade agreement. A status quo transition period will end on Dec. 31 and a no-deal scenario would lead to major disruptions in the movement of goods between Britain and EU countries such as Belgium. The Observer newspaper reported on Sunday that, under UK government contingency plans, tens of millions of vaccine doses could be flown to Britain by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit. The government declined to comment on the Observer report. Farming and environment minister George Eustice, asked on Sky News about concerns of Brexit-related disruption and whether the Observer report was true, said there would be no disruption. “A huge amount of work has gone on to maintain the flow of goods at the border in the event of there being a no-deal Brexit and we’ve also got contingency plans in place, including a government-procured ferry that’s on standby and of course the option, should it be needed, to use air freight too,” he said. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge. For that reason, it will first be administered in 50 hospitals. NHS England has written to community doctors, telling them to get ready to start giving vaccinations from Dec. 14. Groups of local doctors will operate more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country, the government said. Boxes of the vaccine contain five packs of 975 doses, but special regulatory approval is needed to split them up. A senior medical official has said that while he was hopeful it would be possible to split the packs and deliver straight to care homes, it was not guaranteed. With high levels of vaccine scepticism worrying public health experts, the Times and Mail on Sunday newspapers reported that Queen Elizabeth, 94, and her husband Prince Philip, 99, would “let it be known” when they had received the shot. The queen is highly admired in British society, and her public backing for the vaccine would be a powerful message to counter anti-vaccination misinformation circulating online."
-15.723356247567772," Pfizer's COVID-19 shots could be shipped within 24 hours after Canadian approval TORONTO (Reuters) - Shipment of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada could start within 24 hours after Canadian health authorities approve the shots, a top official of pharmaceutical company BioNTech told CBC on Sunday, comparing it with the timeline achieved in Britain. A vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech is expected to be the first to secure approval in Canada, though the country has signed supply deals with seven manufacturers. Since Britain approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine last week, taking pole position in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history, the focus has shifted to how quickly other countries could move and when the shots would be available to the public. “If I used the UK as an example, we got approval at 1 a.m. in the morning, we approved the release of the vaccine and shipped it within 24 hours,” Sean Marett, chief business and chief commercial officer for BioNTech told Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC). Health Canada is expected to approve the vaccine within “the next week”, a top official said on Thursday. Canada expects the first 6 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna Inc to arrive in the first quarter of 2021, enough for three million of Canada’s 38 million population. The Pfizer and BioNTech contract with Canada requires the two drugmakers to distribute the vaccine, which needs to be kept at around -75 degrees Celsius. Marett said he does not see distribution of the vaccine as a challenge at that low temperature in countries as vast as Canada or the United States because it is not a new technology. Marett said the transportation is “well mapped out.” “Together with Pfizer, we’ve designed a storage box ... in which the vaccine arrives. And you can use that as a minus 70 (degrees Celsius) freezer,” he said. A second wave of COVID-19 is sweeping Canada, setting daily records for the number of new cases. So far, the country has reported 408,921 cases and 12,589 deaths. That has made vaccine roll-out a top priority for the government. “This is a bit like the biological equivalent of a moon landing,” Marett said. But he added that from the UK experience, “we’ve seen things move pretty, pretty smoothly.”"
-15.723356247567772," Pfizer has sought emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccine in India - government adviser NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has applied for emergency use authorisation of its coronavirus vaccine in India, a top government health adviser said in a TV interview on Sunday, the first to do so in a country with the world’s second-highest number of infections. The U.S. company, whose vaccine was recently approved in Britain, approached Indian authorities on Saturday, V.K. Paul, who is advising the government on COVID-19 matters, said. “We welcome interest from Pfizer to seek emergency licensure in our country,” Paul told NDTV. India’s drugs regulator typically takes up to 90 days to decide on such applications but a decision on Pfizer’s vaccine could come much faster than that, Paul said. “This will be decided, I hope, sooner than later,” he said. The health ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Pfizer’s officials in India could not immediately be reached for comment. Paul had said in November vaccines developed by Pfizer and rival Moderna Inc may not be available in India in big quantities soon.. India is hoping five locally-tested vaccines, including one being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, will help it to control the virus. The Pfizer shot needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below, temperatures that industry experts say many cold storage facilities in India will find it difficult to maintain.

This is false. It follows the announcement on Dec. 1 that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had been approved for use in the UK (here). The post, seen here, shows a document from the UK government that gives advice about the vaccine to healthcare workers. Specifically, it shows a section titled “Fertility, pregnancy and lactation”, which recommends that the vaccine should not be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. “We’ve all heard about the depopulation vaccine”, the caption of the post reads. “Well here is the proof. This ISNT about covid”. Similar claims can be seen in other social media posts. While the document is legitimate, and can be seen (here), this does not show that the vaccine is being used for depopulation. The document recommends that the vaccine should not be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited trial data, and simply notes that there is an absence of data on fertility effects. On Dec. 3, The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government, published a report that says: “There are no data as yet on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy, either from human or animal studies. Given the lack of evidence, JCVI favours a precautionary approach, and does not currently advise COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy” (here). The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) previously told Reuters that it does not anticipate any specific safety concerns from the new vaccines, based on reports from clinical trials (here). False. The document does not show that the vaccine is being used for depopulation. It instead states that it hasn’t been tested on pregnant women and there is currently there is no data on fertility effects.

-13.822222928537558," WHO warns against pandemic complacency amid vaccine rollout GENEVA (Reuters) - World Health Organization officials on Friday warned governments and citizens not to drop their guard over the COVID pandemic now a vaccination was close, saying healthcare systems could still buckle under pressure. Britain approved Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, raising hopes that the tide could soon turn against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally, hammered the world economy and upended normal life for billions. “Progress on vaccines gives us all a lift and we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, WHO is concerned that there is a growing perception that the COVID-19 pandemic is over,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a Geneva news conference. Tedros said the pandemic still had a long way to run and that decisions made by citizens and governments would determine its course in the short run and when the pandemic would ultimately end. “We know it’s been a hard year and people are tired, but in hospitals that are running at or over capacity it’s the hardest it can possibly be,” he said. “The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the COVID-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers.” The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, a year ago since when more than 65 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1.5 million have died. Two promising vaccines could soon receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and some 20 million Americans could be vaccinated this year, helping stem the tide of the virus in the world’s worst hit country. However, the WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan also cautioned on Friday against complacency in the wake of vaccine roll-out, saying that although they were a major part of the battle against COVID-19, vaccines would not on their own end the pandemic. “Vaccines do not equal zero COVID,” he said. Ryan said some countries would have to sustain very strong control measures for some time into the future or they would risk a “blow up” in cases, and a yo-yoing of the pandemic. “We are in a pivotal moment in some countries. There are health systems in some countries at the point of collapse,” he said, without referring to specific countries. The WHO has backed the COVAX global vaccines programme which seeks to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines and to date has seen 189 countries join. The WHO’s chief scientist said she hoped half a billion vaccine doses would be available for distribution by the COVAX scheme in the first quarter of 2021, with an initial plan to vaccinate the 20% of populations at highest risk, including health workers and people aged over 65. “The goal is to get at least 2 billion doses by end of 2021 which will be enough to vaccinate 20% of the populations of countries that are part of COVAX,” chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told the news conference. This would be enough to “bring to an end the acute phase of the pandemic” by reducing mortality and the impact on health systems, she said. COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The United States has not signed up to the scheme, having secured bilateral deals."
-14.29833794499322," With vaccines on the way, Mexico sees 'beginning of the end' of pandemic MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico can see an end to the coronavirus pandemic on the horizon with the first doses of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine scheduled to arrive in weeks, said a top official in charge of the country’s international response to the health crisis. Martha Delgado, a deputy foreign minister tasked with helping to secure vaccine supplies for Mexico, said Pfizer had agreed to deliver doses to the different points of vaccination across the country rather than to a central distribution center. That will significantly reduce a potential logistical nightmare for Mexico, which does not have the super-cold storage facilities needed to distribute the shots. Pfizer’s vaccine is based on a novel technology that uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus and needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. “The super-freezing cold chain this particular vaccine requires would be handled by the company until the point of delivery,” Delgado told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. Mexico has inked an agreement with Pfizer to acquire 34.4 million doses of its two-shot vaccine, and the first 250,000 shots are expected to arrive this month, with deliveries possibly continuing until December of 2021. The government has said it will prioritize vaccinating health workers. The prospect of vaccine delivery is the “beginning of the end” of the pandemic, said Delgado. Pfizer submitted details about its vaccine to Mexico’s health regulator, Cofepris, last month and is awaiting approval. The agreement is for 250,000 doses to be shipped in December once the vaccine is approved. After those shots reach their destination, the delivery of the second doses is triggered three weeks later, Delgado said. The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has also signed a pre-purchase agreement for the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University. Mexico expects enough doses to be delivered between March and August to inoculate 38.7 million people. But a hiccup in that vaccine’s late-stage clinical trial in which some volunteers received a half dose followed by a full dose, instead of two full doses, could delay delivery, said Delgado. The half-dose first pattern was found to be 90% effective in preventing illness, versus a 62% success rate with the two full dose regimen, according to interim data. “Once we have the results of the study confirming (the new data), I think they’ll also tell us if we have a week, two, or I don’t know how many of delay in delivery,” Delgado said. Mexico also has a pre-purchase agreement to supply doses for 35 million people with a vaccine from China’s CanSino Biologics Inc, which is conducting large-scale trials at 19 test centers in the country. Delgado said CanSino’s trial in Mexico has enrolled some 15,000 participants out of a 40,000-volunteer global program, and delivery could happen from early next year through Sept. 2021. Mexico had said first deliveries could happen in December. “Over a third of CanSino’s global clinical trial is happening here in Mexico. So this is very relevant; it also demonstrates technical confidence,” said Delgado, adding that the Chinese firm has invested over $280 million in Mexico. Additionally, Mexico has secured enough vaccines to cover 20% of its population through the global COVAX facility mechanism, led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization to promote equitable access. Mexico has a population of over 120 million and the virus has killed more than 108,000 people. Infections are around peak levels, so hopes are riding high on the vaccines. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel,” Delgado said."
-14.29833794499322," UPDATE 2-German bond yields edge up, biggest weekly rise since Pfizer * German yields slightly up after U.S. jobs data * Set for biggest weekly rise since Pfizer vaccine news * Fitch to review Italy’s credit rating (Adds analyst comment, background) AMSTERDAM/MILAN, Dec 4 (Reuters) - German bond yields edged up on Friday supported by U.S. yields, which jumped to their highest level since March on a weak November employment report. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were up 6 basis points as job data was expected to increase pressure on Washington to pass a new round of stimulus to help the coronavirus-battered economy. A bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in the U.S. Congress on Thursday as conservative lawmakers expressed their support and Senate and House of Representatives leaders huddled. “The U.S. yields jumped and German government bonds are up a bit in sympathy, but way less than one could have expected,” Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING in London, said. German benchmark 10-year bond yields were up 0.5 basis point to -0.54%. Still, up 4.5 basis points this week, German 10-year yields recorded their biggest weekly rise since Pfizer announced three weeks ago that its vaccine was highly effective. Bets that the vaccine would prove key in helping the global economy had pushed safe-haven 10-year Bunds after Pfizer’s announcement to their worst session since March. Italy’s 10-year yield was last up 3 basis points at 0.59%, after having nearly touched record lows in early trade. . Some headlines are likely to have contributed to Friday’s mixed market sentiment. European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the EU would push on with its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.14 trillion) financial package to revive the bloc’s economy even if Hungary and Poland continue trying to veto the project. Meanwhile Hungary and Poland dug in their heels in a dispute with the European Union over efforts to link the disbursement of funds with rule-of-law provisions, dashing tentative hopes that a compromise could soon be agreed. However, the news had little impact on southern European borrowing costs, which have been mostly driven by expectations of additional stimulus at the European Central Bank’s meeting next Thursday. Some investors are focused on a Fitch Ratings review of Italy that is due out later on Friday. In April Fitch cut Italy’s credit rating to one notch above junk at BBB- and has been more proactive than other rating agencies in downgrading sovereigns during the COVID-19 crisis. But analysts don’t expect it to take action now that EU and ECB policy support is firmly in place."

The Gulf Arab state had also approved Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine in November for use by frontline workers. “The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the Kingdom’s national COVID-19 response,” Dr. Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of Bahrain’s National Health Regulatory Authority said in a statement."
-14.29833794499322," Moscow key workers register for jabs of Russian-made COVID-19 vaccine MOSCOW (Reuters) - Muscovites from high-risk groups such as healthcare workers began registering for jabs of a Russian-made COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, two days after President Vladimir Putin called for large-scale vaccinations. Sputnik V, one of two Russian-made vaccines to have received regulatory approval in Russia despite clinical trials being incomplete, requires two injections. Interim trials showed it is 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19. Mass testing for the second Russian vaccine, EpiVacCorona, began on Monday. The online registration service allows Moscow residents in specified high-risk jobs and aged between 18 and 60 to book free vaccination appointments at 70 points around the city, starting from Saturday, the mayor’s website said. “Over the first five hours, 5,000 people signed up for the jab - teachers, doctors, social workers, those who are today risking their health and lives the most,” Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on his personal website. “For other Moscow residents, free vaccination will become available later,” the website said. Moscow has a total population of nearly 13 million. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund which is backing the development and marketing of Sputnik V, told the BBC on Friday that Russia expected to vaccinate around two million people in December. Scientists have raised concerns about the speed at which Moscow has worked, giving the regulatory go-ahead for its vaccines and launching mass vaccinations before full trials to test its safety and efficacy had been completed. Russia has agreed production and supply deals with a number of foreign countries, but the European Union raised concerns when Hungary said it planned to import and possibly use Sputnik V as the vaccine had not been reviewed by the European Medicines Agency. Britain is preparing in the coming days to launch its own mass innoculation programme after becoming the first country worldwide to approve Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine. Russia is currently developing 10 vaccines, TASS news agency cited Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, as saying on Thursday. The decision to take part in Russia’s vaccine trials is voluntary, authorities say, but some public sector workers have told Reuters of pressure to take part. The views of Muscovites on the new vaccination campaign were mixed. “I like it because this is a chance to turn the tide, to reduce the infection rate,” said one resident, Igor Krivobokov. Others were more sceptical. “This process will take a long time. Only a small amount of the vaccine has been produced,” said Sergei Grishin, adding that he did not plan to get the jab himself. Russia has so far recorded 2,402,949 COVID-19 infections, taking fourth place globally behind only the United States, India and Brazil. It has confirmed 42,176 deaths. Russia reported 27,403 new coronavirus cases on Friday, but has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted regional curbs, to cushion the impact on its struggling economy."
-14.29833794499322," Exclusive: FDA chief had 'robust discussion' with White House about vaccine timelines WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s chief had a “robust discussion” with the White House this week about the timeline for coronavirus vaccine approvals and believes vaccinating 20 million Americans this year is realistic, he said on Friday. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn declined to lay out a specific timetable for approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech but said he hoped the regulator would make a decision this month. Many federal officials are expecting a vaccine approval within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of experts, though one FDA official recently said an approval decision could take weeks. “We expect to move quickly,” after that meeting, Hahn told Reuters in an interview. Britain leapt ahead of the United States this week in approving Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, intensifying scrutiny on U.S. regulators as they consider whether to grant emergency use in the country that leads the world in coronavirus infections. Hahn has come under pressure from outgoing President Donald Trump, who is eager to claim credit for a successful vaccine, to speed up the process. The FDA head discussed the situation at a White House meeting with chief of staff Mark Meadows earlier this week to explain the timing and the “balancing act” required to make sure a vaccine is safe and effective. “Mr. Meadows asked for a briefing and we gave it, and it went very well,” Hahn told Reuters. “We had a very robust discussion, and I know that term sometimes is loaded, robust, but we did.” Though he declined to give a specific timeline for vaccine approval, Hahn gave a nod to its likelihood by endorsing the White House’s goal of having 20 million Americans inoculated by the end of the year. “I think given what we know about supplies, it is realistic,” Hahn said of that goal. “It’ll very much depend upon ... the vaccination campaign.” Trump, a Republican who lost the Nov. 3 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden but has declined to concede the race, said last week he deserved credit for the vaccine. Dealing with the virus that has killed more than 276,000 people in the United States as well as the economic fallout from the crisis is one of Biden’s top priorities once he takes office on Jan. 20. Hahn said Biden’s team had not been in touch with him but he would be happy to provide information about the vaccine approval process. The cancer specialist said he had not made plans for a new job after the Biden administration takes over. To get to 20 million people, the FDA would need to approve both Pfizer’s vaccine and the shot developed by Moderna soon so they can go to the states quickly. Data from late-stage trials of Moderna’s vaccine, which uses the same mRNA technology as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, is due to be reviewed on Dec. 17. Based on a scenario in which people get two doses, Pfizer plans to provide the United States with enough vaccine for 12.5 million people and Moderna has said it will have enough for 10 million people this year. Pfizer and Moderna have tested their products as two-shot vaccines given weeks apart, but Hahn said officials at the agency were combing through their data and might consider them as a single-shot if warranted. “I can’t prejudge what our scientists will decide, but we will look at that,” Hahn said. A single shot vaccine would be much easier to manage because it would not require millions of Americans to return for a second shot weeks later, a major logistical challenge for public health officials. Trump’s Operation Warp Speed program has struck deals with several drugmakers in an effort to help speed up the search for effective treatments to fight the global pandemic. Of the vaccines being evaluated, only Johnson & Johnson’s candidate is being tested as a single-shot vaccine. A speedy vaccine approval could be a political win for Trump’s outgoing administration, which has been pushing for effective treatments to help restore a sense of normality to daily life and a hard-hit U.S. economy. Hahn said he would be eager to be inoculated as soon as there is an approval. “I will be first in line and I will encourage my family to take this vaccine,” he said."
-14.29833794499322," Fact check: mRNA vaccines kept at very cold temperatures so that they do not break apart; COVID-19 vaccines will not genetically modify humans With hundreds of thousands of views social media, posts referring to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate claim that “any vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at -80 degrees isn’t a vaccine” but rather “a transfection agent, kept alive so it can infect your cells and transfer genetic material.” Alleging that the vaccine will be used for “genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale,” this claim is false. The claim originated in a Nov. 15 tweet from a user known as “The Disruptive Physician” with the handle @DocEvenhouse (here). Facebook and Instagram sharing screenshots of the tweet can be found here , here and here .   There are currently three COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners: one made by AstraZeneca, one made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and one made by Moderna. As reported here by the Washington Post, AstraZeneca says that its vaccine candidate, developed by Oxford University, is up to 90% effective in clinical trials. Pfizer and Moderna have reported vaccines that are 95% effective.  The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus (here).  Meanwhile, both the Pfizer and Moderna candidates rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus ( here , here ). Each uses synthetic genetic material that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines (here).  Each candidate has different storage temperature requirements. The AstraZeneca vaccine can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute - especially in poor countries (here).   The Moderna vaccine is stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), but can be kept for a month at normal refrigerator temperatures (here).  Referenced in the social media posts, the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below - equivalent to an Antarctic winter (here). As reported here by Sanjay Mishra, project coordinator for the ""COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium"" at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and published on The Conversation, the vaccine will degrade in five days if kept at regular refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing.  The Disruptive Physician’s claim that “any vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at -80 degrees isn’t a vaccine” is false. As Mishra explains here , the biggest challenge in developing an mRNA vaccine is “its inherent instability, because it is more likely to break apart above freezing temperatures.”  Likening the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines’ storage temperatures to “freezing food to keep it from spoiling,” Margaret Liu, a board member of the International Society for Vaccines who specializes in genetic vaccines, told NPR that lower temperatures slow down the pace of chemical reactions, like the enzymes that break down RNA (here). Since the manufacturers do not disclose their specific formulations, it is not yet clear why Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines require different storage temperatures.  Business Insider explains here that it is possible Pfizer’s vaccine “could be fine at temperatures above that, but scientists were in such a rush to create the vaccine that they don't know for sure.”  MRNA VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE “GENETIC MANIPULATION OF HUMANS” The posts’ claim that the Pfizer vaccine is designed for “genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale” has no basis in fact. As Mishra clarifies here , the synthetic genetic material contained in an mRNA vaccine does not mean a patient’s DNA is changed or passed onto their offspring. Instead, the molecule “guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.""   The Reuters Fact Check team previously fact-checked false social media claims that a COVID-19 vaccine involving the injection of the virus’s genetic code would genetically modify humans, visible here .   Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University’s Alliance for Science group (here), debunked the idea that such a vaccine could genetically modify an organism. Lynas told Reuters that no vaccine can genetically modify human DNA.  “That’s just a myth, one often spread intentionally by anti-vaccination activists to deliberately generate confusion and mistrust,” he said. “Genetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don’t do that.” Dr. Paul McCray, Professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology, and Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa (here), previously explained to Reuters via email how a COVID-19 vaccine using a DNA or RNA vector would work:  As is the case with a vaccine that uses an inactivated (dead) virus, “the only modification to the host is to stimulate them to make antibodies and T cells that will prevent infection with the virus or kill any infected cells to prevent or reduce disease severity. This is what happens if you get a virus infection naturally, but the vaccine takes the risk of serious disease out of the equation.” False. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate is stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius because of the mRNA vaccine’s inherent instability – the very cold temperature slows down the chemical reactions that break apart RNA. Though both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain synthetic genetic material, they do not genetically modify humans receiving them. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

-14.29833794499322," Norway to use three vaccines to stop COVID-19 from early 2021 OSLO (Reuters) - Norway plans to use the three vaccines developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and BioNTech in its first push to inoculate its population against COVID-19, Norway’s health minister said on Friday. In the first quarter of 2021, Oslo expects to receive a total of 2.5 million doses, covering 1.25 million people - or 23% of the population, pending approval of the vaccines from European regulators. The doses would roughly cover the 1.3 million people in Norway who are considered in risk groups, Health Minister Bent Hoeie said, while the 340,000 health personnel in contact with patients would have to wait. Non-EU Norway will get access to some of the vaccines obtained by the European Union thanks to Sweden, an EU member that will buy more than it needs and sell them to Norway, right after New Year. “By Easter, we could be in a completely different situation than today,” Hoeie said. Norway is proceeding faster than earlier announced; Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in October she expected vaccinations to start in the first half of 2021. Countries worldwide are trying to vaccinate as quickly as possible as vaccines supplies become available, and decide which population groups should get it first. Britain on Wednesday became the first nation in the Western world to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. In Norway, the first people to get it will be residents of care homes and those “oldest” living at home, followed by people aged 65 or more plus younger adults with pre-existing conditions. Oslo will also provide vaccines free of charge and make them part of the country’s national vaccination programme. (GRAPHIC: Norway weekly COVID-19 infections - ) The number of infections has slowed in recent weeks after the government reintroduced restrictions a month ago. Norway’s 14-day cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was 116.4 as of Friday, fourth-lowest in Europe behind Iceland, Ireland and Finland, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
-14.29833794499322," Analysis: First U.S. delivery of COVID-19 vaccine will leave out many high-risk workers NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s first shipment of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses to be divided among states and federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, will fall far short of protecting high priority groups such as healthcare workers, a Reuters analysis has found. Across the country, state health departments are preparing local hospitals for the first shipments of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorizes it, possibly as early as mid-December. The first shipment is expected to cover inoculations of 3.2 million people, nowhere near enough for the 21 million U.S. healthcare workers. And government officials said initial shipments would also go to five government agencies including the Departments of Defense, State and the Veterans Health Administration. The subsequent two weekly vaccine distributions could cover 7 to 10 million people a week, provided a second vaccine - from Moderna Inc - is authorized early in the second half of December, and Pfizer meets its distribution estimates, according to data provided by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the companies. Federal officials have not disclosed exactly how many doses will be in later shipments. “For the time being, and the foreseeable future, the demand for vaccines is going to exceed the supply by a lot, even for the highest priority groups that are identified,” said Josh Michaud, Kaiser’s associate director of global health policy. States have the final word on how to distribute vaccines to their citizens, but federal officials have said that of some 330 million U.S. residents, healthcare workers and those in nursing homes should be considered first for vaccines. Many states told Reuters that was their plan. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not respond to a request to comment. The Pentagon declined comment. HHS cited public comments from a Tuesday press call, in which officials said the first dose allocation will be the start of a steady stream of vaccine deliveries. With early supplies limited, the federal government is allocating doses based on state populations, rather than the proportion of the populations at high risk. That means some states’ health workers will be better protected than others. Alabama for instance, will receive enough vaccine for around 17% of its healthcare workers, while Illinois could cover only 13%, according to data from state officials. The approach would initially leave out around 190,000 healthcare workers in Alabama and more than 570,000 in Illinois, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data on healthcare workers by state. More than 2 million healthcare workers in California will have to wait as early vaccine supplies are doled out, based on figures provided to Reuters by state officials. This first stage of the rollout illustrates the complexity of the government’s goal to vaccinate most Americans by mid-2021 to stall a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 273,000 U.S. lives, with hundreds of thousands more deaths projected in the next few months. U.S. officials maintain they will distribute 40 million doses by the end of the year - enough to inoculate 20 million people - with millions of shots shipping every week, assuming speedy approvals of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE, told Reuters the United States will receive about half of the 50 million doses it will produce in 2020. Moderna’s vaccine could add at least another 12.5 million doses, federal officials have said. The CDC expects about 5 million to 10 million doses to be shipped per week in the first weeks of the U.S. vaccine distribution effort. States meanwhile are preparing for the first distribution to fall short, as hospitals across the country grapple with record numbers of COVID-19 patients and staffing shortages. “Clinical staff are becoming infected, nurses and doctors. It’s creating a workforce crunch and the beds are filling up,” said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association, an advocacy group for rural hospitals. Arkansas’s state epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha said vaccines are urgently needed to keep up with the surge in patients. “We want to ensure our hospital capacity as much as possible through vaccination for those healthcare workers who are at highest risk for infection,” she said. More than half a dozen states including Alabama, California, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, told Reuters the first allocation estimates they have been given would not be near enough to cover all their healthcare workers, let alone other high-priority residents. The size of initial allocation figures shared with Reuters ranges widely, from around 330,000 in California - the most populous U.S. state - to less than 7,000 in North Dakota, which has 50,000 healthcare workers, according to Kaiser data and figures provided to Reuters by state officials. That means both states can vaccinate less than 20% of their healthcare workforce with the first shots. New York state will receive 170,000 shots initially, enough for roughly 13% of its healthcare workers. The U.S. government expects the number of available doses to increase in January to about 60 million to 70 million. It has made deals for 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for $1.95 billion and 100 million of Moderna’s for $1.5 billion, with options to buy more. It expects vaccines to be free to most Americans."
-14.29833794499322," Nursing homes to get first COVID vaccinations in Sweden STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Around 600,000 residents of nursing homes for the elderly as well as staff and residents’ relatives will be the first in Sweden to be vaccinated against the new coronavirus, the government said on Friday. Sweden has signed up to receive five of the six vaccines to be purchased through the European Union’s common procurement scheme; the first, from Pfizer and BioNTech’s, could be approved by the European Medicines Agency in late December. “First, we need to protect the most vulnerable, then vaccinate the whole population so the pandemic slows and then is stopped,” Johan Carlson, head of the Public Health Agency, told a news conference. Sweden has imposed some of the least stringent social and economic restrictions in Western Europe to tackle the pandemic. Its infection rate and mortality rate are substantially higher than those of its Nordic neighbours, although lower than those of several European countries that opted for lockdowns. A large percentage of deaths in Sweden have occurred at nursing homes, and authorities have been heavily criticised for failing to protect the most vulnerable. Carlson expected vaccinations to begin in the first quarter, depending on the speed of vaccine approval and delivery. Next in line after nursing homes will be healthcare personnel, people over 70 and other high-risk groups. Sweden’s vaccine coordinator said those without symptoms and not in a recognised risk group might not be offered vaccination, which will be free, until after the summer. The government warned, however, that the start of vaccinations would not mean the end of the pandemic. “Early in the pandemic I said this is a marathon race,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said. “We aren’t there yet. Hold on a little more, hold out a little longer.”"

Britain approved Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history. Last month Britain said it expected 10 million doses of the shot in 2020, but the government has said the pace of roll-out will be dependence on delivery. It has ordered 40 million doses in all, enough to vaccinate 20 million people. Sharma said he was confident the first batch of 800,000 doses would be in place to begin roll-out next week, but would not give an exact figure on how much Britain would get before the end of the month. “We are starting initially with 800,000 and then let’s see where we end up by the end of the year in terms of the numbers that we acquire. That will depend on the manufacturing,” Sharma said on Sky News. “I hope we will have some millions by the end of this year but of course what we also always said is that the vast majority of this vaccination programme will take place in the new year.” Britain has used an emergency approval process to jump ahead of the European Union and United States in roll-out plans of the vaccine. Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologised on Thursday for casting doubt on the rigour of the British regulators who approved it, saying he had faith in the quality of their work. Sharma said that Britain’s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was the “gold standard” in the industry."

A bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in the U.S. Congress on Thursday as conservative lawmakers expressed their support. “A deal before the year-end looked almost impossible a while back, but now a package of around $1 trillion seems within reach,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to tweak guidance on its asset-purchase scheme later this month. The European Central Bank looks certain to increase its bond buying next week. MSCI’s world share index ticked up 0.1% towards the previous day’s record high. It is set for a fifth straight week of gains, which have seen it surge 15%. Asian shares hit their own record high overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.82%, surpassing its Nov. 25 high, led by gains in the tech sector. Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.22% on profit-taking. Europe then saw Britain’s FTSE 100 index reach nine-month highs and euro zone stocks at similar levels. German government bond yields - which move inversely to price - struck a three-day low of -0.557%. The British pound changed hands at $1.3116, having hit a three-month high on Thursday with traders hoping for a trade deal between the European Union and Britain. But as talks continued to secure the Brexit deal before a transition period expires at the end of the month, a British minister said on Friday the talks were in a difficult phase, indicating chances of a breakthrough were receding. France could veto a bad deal, a French minister said. In New York, the S&P 500 erased earlier gains after the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer had cut in half the target for rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine because of problems in its supply chain. The damage did not last long, with S&P500 futures gaining 0.19% in early Friday trade. The focus now is on key U.S. non-farm payrolls data at 1330 GMT, forecast to show a rise of 469,000 in November, according to a Reuters poll. The upbeat mood saw the U.S. dollar lose ground to other major currencies. “One of the elements of the better news we are getting, for instance the vaccine, is to increase the attraction of risky assets and that reduces the appetite for the U.S. dollar,” said Eric Brard, head of fixed income at asset manager Amundi. The euro rose 0.12% to $1.2155, near the highest levels since April 2018 it reached the day before and a weekly gain of 1.5%. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies . Emerging markets were continuing their gains. The Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, South African rand, Russian rouble and Polish zloty have all jumped 7% to 11% over the past month, adding to 5%-12% leaps in China, Taiwan and Korea’s currencies since June. In commodities, oil prices got an additional lift after OPEC and Russia agreed to reduce their deep oil output cuts from January by 500,000 barrels per day. They failed to find a compromise on a broader and longer-term policy. The increase means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, would move to cut production by 7.2 million barrels per day, or 7% of global demand from January, compared with current cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day. Brent crude rose as high as $49.92 per barrel, its highest price since early March, and last stood at $49.64, up 1.9%."

After surging earlier in the week on bets that a U.S. stimulus package -- back on the cards -- would help push inflation higher, U.S. Treasuries drifted lower on Thursday in anticipation of the jobs report. German benchmark 10-year bond yields, which had followed Treasuries higher but then retraced much of their rise on Thursday, were down about 1 basis point in early Friday trade to -0.56% “Our economists are looking for a weak payrolls print which should take some momentum out of the U.S. reflation sentiment,” Michael Leister, head of interest rate strategy at Commerzbank told clients. Still, up 3 basis points this week, German 10-year yields were on track for their biggest weekly rise since Pfizer announced three weeks ago that its vaccine was highly effective against coronavirus. Bets that the vaccine would prove key in helping the global economy had pushed safe-haven 10-year Bunds after Pfizer’s announcement to their worst session since March. Other overnight headlines are also likely to have contributed to Friday’s mixed market sentiment. The Wall Street Journal reporting challenges in Pfizer’s supply chain for its COVID-19 vaccine played a role in its decision to slash its 2020 production target, which pushed the S&P 500 lower on Thursday. Some good news came from the European Union’s coronavirus recovery fund, after Poland’s deputy prime minister said it would be ready to drop its veto on the EU budget and the fund if EU leaders endorse an explanatory declaration on the link between disbursements and the rule of law -- the cause of Hungary and Poland’s veto. However, the news had little impact on southern European borrowing costs, which have been mostly driven by expectations of additional stimulus at the European Central Bank’s meeting next Thursday. Some investors are focused on a Fitch Ratings review of Italy that is due out later on Friday. In April Fitch downloaded Italy’s credit rating to one notch above junk at BBB- and has been more proactive than other rating agencies in downgrading sovereigns during the COVID crisis. But analysts don’t expect it to take action now that EU and ECB policy support is firmly in place. Italy’s borrowing costs seem to reflect that view, with its 10-year yield last down 1 basis point to 0.56%."

Tesla surged 5% after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” in the run-up to the electric car maker’s addition to the S&P 500 index. Tesla was Wall Street’s most traded stock by value, with about $25 billion worth of shares exchanged, according to Refinitiv data, more than double Boeing, in second place. The widely followed S&P 500 fell from all-time highs late in the session after the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer faced supply chain obstacles related to the vaccine, sending its stock down 1.7%. Progress in developing a working COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the year has driven Wall Street’s main indexes to record levels in recent days. Despite the economic destruction caused by the pandemic, the S&P 500 has gained about 13% in 2020. “It was the Pfizer news that cut into earlier gains,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “We’re in a year-end Santa rally, but it’s going to be a muted one. Stimulus hopes are back in the market and it looks like we might get something before year-end, which the economy desperately needs.” First-time U.S. claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but remained extraordinarily high at 712,000, while a separate survey showed U.S. services industry activity slowed to a six-month low in November. “I don’t think we will see those numbers start to get back to normal until we start to see a rollout of a vaccine,” said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ. “The market is discounting that and saying we are looking forward to the first or second quarter and a rollout of the vaccine to the general population.” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cited some positive movement in congressional efforts to reach a compromise on a new coronavirus aid bill but gave no hints on when such a deal could be struck. Boeing Co jumped after budget airline Ryanair ordered 75 additional 737 MAX jets with a list price of $9 billion, throwing a commercial lifeline to the embattled U.S. planemaker.

-13.284815493780583," Pfizer says supply chain challenges contributed to slashed target for COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2020 (Reuters) - Challenges in Pfizer Inc’s supply chain for the raw materials used in its COVID-19 vaccine played a role in its decision to slash its 2020 production target, a Pfizer spokeswoman told Reuters. Pfizer has said in recent weeks that it anticipates producing 50 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year. That is down from an earlier target of 100 million doses. Pfizer’s vaccine relies on a two dose regimen, meaning 50 million doses is enough to inoculate 25 million people. A company spokeswoman said the “scale-up of the raw material supply chain took longer than expected.” She also cited later-than-expected results from Pfizer’s clinical trial as a reason for the smaller number of doses expected to be produced by the end of 2020. The spokeswoman added that the modifications to Pfizer’s production lines are now complete and finished doses are being made at a rapid pace. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news. It reported that an unnamed person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine said “some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards,” which caused production delays. Pfizer applied in November for emergency authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine from U.S. regulators. U.S. officials said they expect its vaccine to get regulatory clearance this month. The U.S. government expects its first allocation of the vaccine to include 6.4 million doses, with more to follow. Regulators in the U.K. have already authorized Pfizer’s vaccine for use in that country."
-13.284815493780583," Fauci apologizes for casting doubt over UK's approval of Pfizer vaccine LONDON (Reuters) - Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologized on Thursday for casting doubt on the rigor of the British regulators who approved the Pfizer Inc vaccine against COVID-19, saying he had faith in the quality of their work. Britain announced the approval of the vaccine on Wednesday, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) saying it had rigorously assessed the vaccine data and had cut no corners. It gave the UK the jump in the race to begin mass inoculation against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy. U.S. and European Union regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval. In a CBS interview on Thursday, Fauci suggested the British regulators had failed to scrutinize the data carefully enough and had waved the vaccine through - comments that were prominently reported on the main British TV news channels. He later gave an interview to the BBC in which he said his earlier comments had come out wrong. “There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I’m sorry, and I apologize for that,” he said. “I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community in the UK,” Fauci said. “I did not mean to apply any sloppiness (to the UK regulatory process), even though it came out that way,” he added. Fauci said the point he had been trying to make was that in the U.S. context, with widespread vaccine scepticism, it would not have been appropriate to conduct the process in the same way and at the same speed as what happened in Britain. “If we had for example approved it yesterday or tomorrow, there likely would have been pushback on an already scrutinising society,” he said. “You know, at the end of the day, it’s going to be safe, it’s going to be effective, the people in the UK are going to receive it and they’re going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it and we’re going to do pretty well,” Fauci said. In response to his earlier criticism, the MHRA issued a statement saying it had “rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible without compromising the thoroughness of our review”. The regulator also said its emergency approval had allowed “some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed, but it does not mean steps and the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been bypassed”. Fauci is the most high-profile member of the White House coronavirus task force and has often clashed with President Donald Trump on how to protect Americans from the virus, which has caused about 273,000 U.S. deaths. President-elect Joe Biden said on Thursday he had asked Fauci to be the chief medical adviser on his COVID-19 team when he takes office on Jan. 20. [nW1N2HQ0GG]"

Although Canada has signed supply deals with seven manufacturers, officials say the first decision is set to be on the vaccine Pfizer developed with German partner BioNTech SE. “Things have been progressing really well, and we’re expecting within the next week to 10 days to be making a final decision,” Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser to the top official at the federal health ministry, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, Howard Njoo, later told reporters that “certainly we expect it to be a favorable one”. A second wave is sweeping Canada, setting daily records for the number of new cases. So far, Canada has reported a total of 389,778 cases of COVID-19 and 12,325 deaths. Quebec, the second most populous of the 10 provinces, on Thursday reversed course and said different households would not be able to mix in homes for Christmas gatherings in hotspots like Montreal. “We have a limited number of nurses and our nurses are very tired,” premier Francois Legault told reporters. Quebec had previously said those living in the worst hit zones could host two gatherings of up to 10 people each between Dec 24-27. Njoo said authorities were planning for a total of six million doses of vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna Inc to be administered in the first quarter of 2021. This is enough for three million of Canada’s 38 million population. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told members of his ruling Liberal Party on Tuesday that priority would be given to first responders, workers in long-term care homes, the elderly and members of remote aboriginal communities. Health Canada is also reviewing vaccine candidates from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson."
-13.284815493780583," Britain to cover COVID-19 vaccine side-effects under damages scheme (Reuters) - Britain will pay individuals who suffer any severe side-effects from COVID-19 vaccines under an existing programme, the government said on Thursday, ahead of a rollout of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine in the country following emergency approval. COVID-19 will be added as a ""precautionary step"" to the list of diseases covered for potential liabilities under the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS), the Department of Health and Social Care said. It added that vaccines would be deployed only after stringent checks. (bit.ly/3mEuZ3I) Compensation for any possible side-effects from a COVID-19 vaccine has been the subject of much debate in recent months, as drugmakers and governments around the world have worked in record time to develop and approve vaccines against the illness which has created havoc worldwide. Britain's VDPS was set up in 1979 and covers victims of side-effects caused by common vaccines, such as those against measles, influenza, smallpox and tetanus. In 2009 the vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu was also briefly added to the list. (bit.ly/2KZCB2N) (bit.ly/33GyIXa) Under the scheme, individuals are entitled to a lump sum capped at 120,000 pounds ($161,676) if they can prove to have been seriously disabled as a result of a vaccination. The scheme is meant to dissuade people from seeking compensation through lengthy and costly court proceedings, but has been criticised for the cap and its restrictive conditions. “The current scheme is not really adequate for the current situation. If adverse events occur, the route to compensation is too complicated. It would be much better if the government set up a bespoke scheme for COVID-19,” said Duncan Fairgrieve, of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law.

-13.284815493780583," Fact check: UK plans do not currently include offering COVID-19 vaccine to pregnant women and children Following the announcement on Dec. 1 that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had been approved for use in the UK (here), a Facebook user has misleadingly suggested that plans are in place to give the vaccine to children and pregnant women. A status posted on Dec. 2 and shared hundreds of times makes various allegations beginning with: “The vaccine has NOT been tested on children, pregnant women, people taking medications and individuals with comorbidities (Yet the plan is for all of the above to receive the vaccine)” (here). This is misleading: the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government, published a report on Dec. 3 saying it does not currently advise COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, and that only children at very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes should be offered vaccination (here). “There are no data as yet on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy, either from human or animal studies. Given the lack of evidence, JCVI favours a precautionary approach, and does not currently advise COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy,” the report says. “Women should be advised not to come forward for vaccination if they may be pregnant or are planning a pregnancy within three months of the first dose. “Data are anticipated which will inform discussions on vaccination in pregnancy. JCVI will review these as soon as they become available.” In earlier information for healthcare practitioners, published by Public Health England in November 2020, advice reads: “Although the available data do not indicate any safety concern or harm to pregnancy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. Vaccination should be postponed until completion of pregnancy.” Regarding children, in its Dec. 3 document, the JCVI says: “Following infection, almost all children will have asymptomatic infection or mild disease. There is very limited data on vaccination in adolescents, with no data on vaccination in younger children, at this time. The committee advises that only those children at very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes, such as older children with severe neuro-disabilities that require residential care, should be offered vaccination.” This is reiterated the earlier Public Health England guidance (here, page 11). The Facebook post also alleges that Pfizer has not provided the ingredients list for the vaccine. This is not correct; the ingredients are listed in this government information leaflet for UK recipients of the vaccine (here, p. 4). The post makes various other allegations about testing and side effects of the virus, which are not within the scope of this check. Partly false. The Facebook post is correct that at the time of publishing the Pfizer vaccine had not been tested on pregnant women or young children. However, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has not advised vaccinating these groups, and neither did earlier information from Public Health England. The JCVI says it will review new data as it is released. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here ."

Britain approved Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech, outpacing the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history. Speaking from Copenhagen, Kluge said vaccine supplies would be very limited at first and that countries must decide who gets priority, though the WHO also cited “growing consensus” that first recipients should be older people, medical workers and people with other diseases, as Britain plans. The new coronavirus still had the potential to do “enormous damage”, Kluge said, but “the future looks brighter” as other vaccine candidates, including from Moderna and AstraZeneca, have also delivered positive trial results. “The more candidates we have, the more opportunities for success,” Kluge told a news briefing. “Vaccines, combined with other public health measures, bring the end of an acute phase of the pandemic and the rebuilding of economies within reach.” The EU’s own regulator, in response to the swift British approval of Pfizer’s shot, has said its own, longer procedure was more appropriate and required more evidence. EU and separate U.S. approval could come within days or weeks. A WHO official, asked about the different regulatory processes, said the global health agency and the European Medicines Agency had asked Britain to share documents that it used in its approval to help expedite the other bodies’ own assessments. Sharing could build confidence among people who eventually will be targeted for inoculations, said Siddhartha Datta, WHO programme manager for vaccine preventable diseases, told reporters. “This decision is a big decision by any of the national regulatory authorities, because it will instil trust in the system,” Datta said. “It’s extremely important that this process is robust, the process is based on evidence and a decision is being made and shared in a transparent mode.” The WHO has already received data from Pfizer and BioNTech on the vaccine and was reviewing it for “possible listing for emergency use” that could be a benchmark for other nations’ use."

-13.284815493780583," No guarantee Pfizer vaccine will be distributed direct to English care homes, official says LONDON (Reuters) - There is no guarantee that Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine will be distributed in English care homes but the health service and regulator are working to make it possible, deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said on Thursday. Britain became the first country to approve the vaccine candidate developed by Germany’s BioNTech and Pfizer, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin a crucial mass inoculation programme. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of logistical challenges in distributing the vaccine, which has to be stored at -70C (-94F), across the National Health Service (NHS). Following the emergency approval, roll-out will initially be focussed on hospitals rather than community settings. Although it can be kept for five days in a regular fridge, Van-Tam said there was a limit to how often it can be taken out of a fridge and put back, with implications for its distribution to care homes. “The NHS, the (medicine regulator) MHRA are working really hard, right now, to try and find a solution, so that we can get this into care homes if we possibly can... at this point, there is no absolute assurance of that,” he told ITV’s “This Morning” programme. “One thing we can’t do is... end up with a vaccine that’s been handled incorrectly, and then isn’t properly viable at the end of the distribution chain.” Britain has said that care home residents and their carers are the highest priority to get the vaccine, along with those over 80, although the doctor who chairs the vaccine committee that drew up the list has said operational practicalities will influence the roll-out. NHS England Chief Executive Simon Stevens said on Wednesday that the phased programme of roll-out would see 50 hospital hubs begin to vaccinate those in the highest priority groups. But he added that there needed to be regulatory approval to split up the 975 dose packs that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrives in before they could be delivered to care home directly. “If the MHRA... as we expect they will, give approval for a safe way of splitting these packs of 975 doses, then, the good news is that we will be able to start distributing those to care homes,” he said. Pfizer UK country manager Ben Osborn said the firm had experience in delivering around 1 billion sterile injectables a year to 165 countries and territories. “I sincerely hope that this gives the people of the UK confidence that we’re ready now to deliver the vaccine to all four corners of our nation,” he told journalists on Wednesday. Philipp Rosenbaum, Senior Infectious Diseases Analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData, said that Britain was an “ideal test bed for the delivery of Pfizer’s vaccine.” “The country’s small size, dense population and strong healthcare infrastructure should mean distribution of the vaccine with cold chain should go smoothly,” he said in a note. “If problems do arise, this will not bode well for distribution in countries with longer distances to vaccine distribution centers (or) less developed infrastructure.”"

Here are some reactions to the news: YAZDAN YAZDANPANAH, HEAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT PARIS’ BICHAT HOSPITAL, MEMBER OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT’S SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL. “This is not a 100-meter dash. It’s not because they’ll start next week that they’ll do better than others. I think we should take the time to look at all the data. It’s also important to show everybody -- considering the hesitations (in the public) -- that we’re doing that seriously.” JOHN TREGONING, A READER IN RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: “This is great news and remarkable progress given the first cases were less than a year ago. It shows what progress can be made through science and innovation. The MHRA, the UK drug regulator, will have gone through all the safety data from the trials before approving and will continue to monitor as it is rolled out more widely. The next step will be to get the vaccine to the people who need it the most.” PROFESSOR ARNE AKBAR, PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH SOCIETY FOR IMMUNOLOGY: “It is only 12 months since the first case recorded case of COVID-19 and in that time, researchers around the world have worked tirelessly to increase our understanding of this new disease and develop safe and effective vaccines.” “To achieve this within this timescale is remarkable and the researchers should be applauded. Although development of this vaccine has occurred rapidly, it’s important to emphasise that it will still have gone through all the rigorous safety tests, and validity of the data on effectiveness will have been assessed meticulously by the MHRA.” PETER LIESE, AN EU LAWMAKER WHO IS A MEMBER OF GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL’S PARTY: “I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way. A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine.” AYFER ALI, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT WARWICK BUSINESS SCHOOL WHO SPECIALISES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: “The approval of the Pfizer vaccine is a landmark moment in the UK’s response to the pandemic. However, if we need to vaccinate the whole population, or at least a large portion of it, we need all the vaccines we can get.” “Other vaccines, which have not yet been approved, may have better profiles in terms of protecting different populations, such as the elderly. They may also be easier to administer logistically because they need fewer shots or are easier to store and transport.” “Competition is also good in achieving a better price, especially for lower income countries faced with vaccinated large populations.” MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON: “This is excellent news and a huge landmark in the global efforts to address this pandemic. The regulators have clearly been satisfied with the data presented to them.” “The Pfizer vaccine does require storage at around -70C, which will pose significant logistical challenges for all countries that choose to use it. These are not insurmountable but certainly challenging.” “Other vaccines, such as the Oxford AstraZeneca candidate, require storage at much lesser temperatures and will be simpler to transport. Given we will certainly need more than one licensed vaccine to maximise global coverage, everyone will still be eagerly waiting for further developments from Oxford and Moderna.” LIAM SMEETH, PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POPULATION HEALTH, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL MEDICINE: “The continued progress on vaccines is fantastic news. A route towards a much better situation in the UK is becoming clear. A further circuit breaker in January or possibly February is likely to be needed. But, it is realistic to hope that by March or April the vast majority of older people, care home residents, and those with severe conditions will have been immunised.” “We can then work towards wider immunisation – with ideally much of the population covered in time for next winter. Life won’t ever be the same as it was before Covid-19, but it will feel a whole lot better than now.” “For the foreseeable future - and maybe forever - we are very unlikely to reach the situation we are in with smallpox (gone), polio (almost gone), or measles (controlled in populations with high enough vaccine coverage). Instead, we are going to need to find ways to fairly happily live alongside this virus.” ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL “With 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks. However, we need new independent clinical trials to monitor long-term safety and efficacy.” FRENCH PRIME MINISTER JEAN CASTEX told BFM TV that a European decision was expected towards the end of December. “From what I know, it’s due in the days ahead, more likely towards the end of December than the beginning.” “I will never take the risk of vaccinating people without the having approval to put (the vaccine) on the market by the competent authorities.” JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN STANDARD INVESTMENTS: “Incoming news surrounding the development and distribution of COVID vaccinations continues to be unequivocally positive, and subsequently, is being cheered and welcomed by financial markets that are desperate for good news.” “This morning’s announcement that vaccination in the UK could begin as early as next week saw further gains for sterling following yesterday’s strong performance following the Times Radio report that Brexit negotiations have entered the final and crucial stage. However, these gains have been stopped in their tracks by a subsequent headline suggesting that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told EU ambassadors that there may not be a Brexit deal after all.” SYLVAIN GOYON, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY AT ODDO BHF IN PARIS: “Stock market reactions following the Pfizer and Moderna announcements already reflect bets of a rapid normalization. To this extent the UK registration is somewhat already priced in” MIKE BELL, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: “Approval of a highly effective vaccine may mark the beginning of the end to the Covid-19 economic turmoil and the beginning of a new bull market for equities.” “The scientists have come to the rescue and delivered what investors were hoping for Christmas this year. As this year’s savings are spent next year, the global economy should boom driving corporate profits and equities higher in 2021.” DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: “Exciting news keeps coming, but this really is momentous. Nobody knew how the battle to find effective vaccines would pan out. Now, less than 11 months from the first characterisation of the virus sequence, we have the first emergency approval for use of a really effective vaccine. Truly heroic.” “I don’t think we should get too hung up on ‘the race’ and this as the 1st approval. Over the next several weeks we’ll likely see a number of licenses granted - and we do need them all to get speedily out of this mess.”"
-13.284815493780583," Factbox: UK approves Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine - Who gets it first? LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use and said that it will be rolled out from early next week. The head of the medicines regulator, June Raine, said no corners had been cut. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it had received the first data on the vaccine in June and carried out a rigorous rolling analysis to international standards before giving its approval. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity. Below are details on the manufacturing and storage process, and the British vaccination programme: - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below. - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days. - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius). - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites. - Britain will start vaccinating people early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Belgium. The speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said. - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year. - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality. - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the jab. - 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities. - The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver."
-13.284815493780583," EU criticises 'hasty' UK approval of COVID-19 vaccine BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union criticised Britain’s rapid approval of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, saying its own procedure was more thorough, after Britain became the first western country to endorse a COVID-19 shot. The move to grant emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been seen by many as a political coup for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has led his country out of the EU and faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic. The decision was made under an ultra-fast, emergency approval process, which allowed the British drugs regulator to temporarily authorise the vaccine only 10 days after it began examining data from large-scale trials. In an unusually blunt statement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of approving COVID-19 vaccines for the EU, said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks than the emergency procedure chosen by Britain. The agency said on Tuesday it would decide by Dec. 29 whether to provisionally authorise the vaccine from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE . A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU executive, said the EMA’s procedure was “the most effective regulatory mechanism to grant all EU citizens’ access to a safe and effective vaccine,” as it was based on more evidence. Pfizer UK Country Manager Ben Osborn said, “We have provided complete data packages, the unblinded data, to both regulators. I think what you’re seeing is just the difference in the underlying process and timelines, as opposed to any difference in data submission.” June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said, “The way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards. “Our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and our rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,” she added. The EMA started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6, an emergency procedure aimed at speeding up possible approval, which usually takes at least seven months from reception of full data. The UK regulator launched its own rolling review on Oct. 30, and analysed less data than made available to the EMA. “The idea is not to be first but to have a safe and effective vaccine,” Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference. Asked about the emergency procedure used by Britain, he said EU countries had opted for a more thorough procedure to boost confidence in vaccines. “If you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk,” the EMA’s former head Guido Rasi told an Italian radio. “Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first,” he added. ‘PROBLEMATIC’ EU lawmakers were even more explicit in their criticism of Britain’s move. “I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way,” said Peter Liese, an EU lawmaker who is a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party. “A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine,” said Liese, who represents the centre right grouping, the largest in the EU Parliament. Under EU rules, the Pfizer vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but EU countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine at home for temporary use. Britain is still subject to EU rules until it fully leaves the bloc at the end of the year. “There is an obvious global race to get the vaccine on the market as fast as possible,” said Tiemo Wolken, an EU lawmaker from the socialist grouping, the second largest in the Parliament. “However, I do believe that it is better to take the time and make sure that the quality, effectiveness and safety is guaranteed and matches our EU standards.”"
-13.284815493780583," UK approves Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in world first LONDON (Reuters) - Britain approved Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history. Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted the green light from Britain’s medicine authority as a global win and a ray of hope for the end of the pandemic, though he recognised the logistical challenges of vaccinating an entire country of 67 million. Britain’s move raised hopes that the tide could soon turn against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally, hammered the world economy and upended normal life for billions since it emerged in Wuhan, China, a year ago. Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted emergency use approval to the vaccine developed by Pfizer and German biotechnology partner BioNTech, which they say is 95% effective in preventing illness, just 23 days after Pfizer published the first data from its final stage clinical trial. “Fantastic news,” Johnson told parliament, though he cautioned that people should not get carried away. “At this stage it is very, very important that people do not get their hopes up too soon about the speed with which we will be able to roll out this vaccine.” International drugmakers and researchers have been racing to develop vaccines for months and Britain’s authorisation coming first may be seen as a coup for a government that has faced criticism over its handling of the crisis. U.S. and EU regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval. Britain’s swift decision drew criticism from Brussels where, in an unusually blunt statement, the EU regulator said its longer procedure was more appropriate and based on more evidence. Johnson might be persuaded to take a COVID-19 shot on television to show it was safe, but he would not have one before those in greater need, his press secretary said. Britain said it would start vaccinating those most at risk of dying early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Pfizer’s manufacturing centre in Belgium, and UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said tests on that first batch had been completed. Hours after the British announcement, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian authorities to begin mass voluntary vaccinations next week. Russia will have produced 2 million doses of its own vaccine within the next few days, Putin said. Pfizer vaccine executive Ralf Rene Reinert said other countries were looking to emulate Britain. “The UK is leading, and now let’s see how the other countries move forward. And Pfizer will do everything to exchange all the data packages with every regulatory agency,” he said. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said EU member states could have issued similar emergency approvals, but Europe had decided to move forward as one. “It’s very important we do this to help promote trust and confidence in this authorisation,” he said. Britain is bound by European law until the transition period ends on Dec. 31, but opted for emergency approval anyway. Asked if the speedy approval was a “big Brexit bonus”, Johnson credited global efforts instead. “It’s a truly international thing and very, very moving to see it,” the PM said. ‘NO CORNERS CUT’ Pfizer shares rose almost 4% to their highest since July 2019 and BioNTech’s U.S.-listed shares rose almost 5% after hitting record highs on Tuesday. Global stocks were also higher over optimism the world can turn a corner in curbing the pandemic, although the gains were more muted than those seen in November, when Pfizer published the first trial results. [MKTS/GLOB] Britain’s MHRA approved the vaccine in record time by doing a “rolling” concurrent analysis of data and the manufacturing process while Pfizer raced to conclude trials. “No corners have been cut,” MHRA chief June Raine said in a televised briefing from Downing Street, adding that the first data on the vaccine had been received in June and undergone a rigorous analysis to international standards. “Safety is our watchword.” The emergency use approval does not come with any associated volume cap or threshold, Pfizer UK’s country manager said. “With 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks,” said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Liverpool. U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said the British move should inspire confidence. “For the American people this should be very reassuring. An independent regulatory authority in another country has found this vaccine to be safe and effective for use,” Azar told Fox Business Network. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will make a decision on emergency use authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in days or weeks after a panel of outside advisers meets on Dec. 10 to review the data and make its recommendation to the agency. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it could give emergency approval for the shot by Dec. 29, while the World Health Organization said it was reviewing it for “possible listing for emergency use”. “The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development programme,” said Ugur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech. The company said it expected FDA and EMA to make decisions in mid-December. Johnson said life would not return to normal right away, but there was now certainty that things would improve. He said the vaccines would not be mandatory but strongly encouraged eligible people to take them. The speed of the rollout depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine - and the extreme temperature of -70C (-94F) at which it must be stored. It can be kept for five days in a regular fridge. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots are needed per person to gain immunity."
-13.284815493780583," Australia aims to complete review of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021 SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s pharmaceutical regulator said on Thursday it is on course to review Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021, with the country sticking to a March timetable to start vaccinations. Britain on Wednesday approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history. But John Skerritt, the head of Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said it would likely complete its review by “late January” and has told staff not to plan a holiday to get the work done. “My staff have been told to put away their swimsuits and towels and to work as quickly as we can but also in significant depth,” Skerritt told reporters in Canberra. Pfizer’s is one of the four COVID-19 vaccines Australia has agreed to buy, including from Novavax, AstraZeneca and CSL Ltd should trials prove successful. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the January timetable does not accelerate plans to begin vaccinations. “We are on track for first vaccinations beginning with our health workers and our aged care residents subject to approvals in March,” Hunt told reporters in Canberra. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said getting a vaccine out by then would boost the country’s economy by A$34 billion ($25 billion) compared with earlier assumptions of 2022. Australia is in the fortunate position of being able to allow regulators time to complete checks without the pressure of mounting cases of COVID-19. Its tally of more than 27,800 infections is far fewer than many other developed countries, and until Wednesday gone nearly three weeks without any local transmission of COVID-19. The streak was broken when Australia’s most populous state said a worker at a hotel, where overseas travellers are quarantined for two weeks, tested positive for COVID-19."

-13.284815493780583," EU criticises 'hasty' UK approval of COVID-19 vaccine BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union criticised Britain’s rapid approval of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, saying its own procedure was more thorough, after Britain became the first western country to endorse a COVID-19 shot. The move to grant emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been seen by many as a political coup for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has led his country out of the EU and faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic. The decision was made under an ultra-fast, emergency approval process, which allowed the British drugs regulator to temporarily authorise the vaccine only 10 days after it began examining data from large-scale trials. In an unusually blunt statement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of approving COVID-19 vaccines for the EU, said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks than the emergency procedure chosen by Britain. The agency said on Tuesday it would decide by Dec. 29 whether to provisionally authorise the vaccine from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE . A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU executive, said the EMA’s procedure was “the most effective regulatory mechanism to grant all EU citizens’ access to a safe and effective vaccine,” as it was based on more evidence. Pfizer UK Country Manager Ben Osborn said, “We have provided complete data packages, the unblinded data, to both regulators. I think what you’re seeing is just the difference in the underlying process and timelines, as opposed to any difference in data submission.” June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said, “The way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards. “Our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and our rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,” she added. The EMA started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6, an emergency procedure aimed at speeding up possible approval, which usually takes at least seven months from reception of full data. The UK regulator launched its own rolling review on Oct. 30, and analysed less data than made available to the EMA. “The idea is not to be first but to have a safe and effective vaccine,” Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference. Asked about the emergency procedure used by Britain, he said EU countries had opted for a more thorough procedure to boost confidence in vaccines. “If you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk,” the EMA’s former head Guido Rasi told an Italian radio. “Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first,” he added. ‘PROBLEMATIC’ EU lawmakers were even more explicit in their criticism of Britain’s move. “I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way,” said Peter Liese, an EU lawmaker who is a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party. “A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine,” said Liese, who represents the centre right grouping, the largest in the EU Parliament. Under EU rules, the Pfizer vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but EU countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine at home for temporary use. Britain is still subject to EU rules until it fully leaves the bloc at the end of the year. “There is an obvious global race to get the vaccine on the market as fast as possible,” said Tiemo Wolken, an EU lawmaker from the socialist grouping, the second largest in the Parliament. “However, I do believe that it is better to take the time and make sure that the quality, effectiveness and safety is guaranteed and matches our EU standards.”"

Britain became the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, with 800,000 doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine available for those at high risk starting next week. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is holding its advisory committee meeting next week, while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has said the state’s first delivery, enough for 170,000 residents, is expected on Dec. 15. Hopes that the pandemic, which has so far killed nearly 1.5 million globally, will finally be brought to its knees sparked a risk-on rally in currency markets with Australian and New Zealand dollars advancing against their U.S. counterpart. The dollar index slipped to 2 1/2-year low of 90.987 on Wednesday and last stood at 91.048. “Currency investors are taking on more risk following the latest vaccine breakthroughs, options show,” Morgan Stanley said in a note. Hopes of a fiscal support package in the United States also boosted investor optimism. But share traders were less enthused. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan were barely changed following two straight days of gains. Japan’s Nikkei was 0.2% weaker while South Korea’s KOSPI was flat and Australia’s benchmark index was slightly higher. Chinese shares opened a tad lower, with the blue-chip CSI300 index off 0.03%. “Markets are quite likely to muddle through from here,” said Michael Frazis, portfolio manager at Frazis Capital Partners in Sydney. “The vaccine is increasingly priced in. A couple of months ago, no one knew how deep coronavirus would be, or what the outcome of the election was. Now both sources of uncertainty have been removed.” Worries that the U.S. economy may be decelerating weighed on shares after U.S. private payrolls showed fewer jobs than expected were added in November as growing new COVID-19 infections led to additional business restrictions. Overnight, Wall Street swung between red and green territories but eventually ended a tad firmer. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 gained 0.2% each while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was barely moved. In currencies, the risk-sensitive Aussie hit a more than two-year high of $0.7420 overnight and was last at $0.7399. Its kiwi cousin was last at $0.7062, hovering near the highest since May 2018. The euro fetched $1.2113, having reached its loftiest level since late April 2018 in the previous day’s trade. In commodities, oil prices slipped on Thursday after rising overnight on COVID-19 vaccine hopes and expectations producing countries would keep limits on their output. Brent crude was down 13 cents at $48.11 a barrel while U.S. light crude eased 15 cents to $45.13. Gold was slightly weaker at $1,827 an ounce."

Britain on Wednesday approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine, stoking hopes of rapid COVID-19 inoculations across the world. Still, Morrison said Australia would keep its borders closed to non-Australian citizens and non-permanent residents. “On international borders we’re still some time away from that,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra.

Hajdu posted her comment on Twitter shortly after Britain approved the candidate. Pfizer developed the vaccine with its German partner BioNTech SE. Health Canada is reviewing vaccine candidates from Pfizer, AstraZeneca Plc, Modern Inc and Johnson & Johnson but has yet to approve any of them. “The news that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been approved in the U.K. is encouraging. Health Canada’s review of this candidate is ongoing, and is expected to be completed soon,” Hajdu tweeted. Canada’s Liberal government, which has signed deals with a total of seven vaccine manufacturers, says doses could arrive soon after any approval. A second wave of the virus is sweeping Canada, setting daily records for the number of new daily cases. So far Canada has reported a total of 383,468 cases of COVID-19 and 12,212 deaths. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Ottawa has assured his provincial government that shipments will start arriving by Jan. 4. Kenney announced the formation of a task force to distribute vaccine shipments and said his government was aiming to immunize 435,000 people, or 10% of Alberta’s population, in the first three months next year. Alberta has the second-highest rate of total cases among provinces. On Wednesday it reported another 1,685 new cases and 10 deaths. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported that Alberta had asked the federal government and Canadian Red Cross to supply field hospitals, as its health-care system becomes overwhelmed. Kenney said the inquiry was simply responsible planning and that Alberta was not close to needing such capacity."
-16.974159502651055," Pfizer CEO confident vaccine supply will exceed needs by end of 2021 ATHENS (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said on Wednesday he was confident that by the end of 2021 there would be more vaccine doses than required to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. His remarks came after Britain approved a vaccine produced by Pfizer and its German biotechnology partner BioNTech on Wednesday. The two companies say their vaccine is 95% effective. “I feel very comfortable that by the end of 2021 we’ll have more doses than we will need,” Bourla told a virtual conference hosted in Athens. “We are doing everything we can to increase the manufacturing capacity ... but the challenge is that we need to increase it in the next few months.” The British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted emergency use approval just 23 days after Pfizer published the first data from its final-stage clinical trial. The vaccine is due to be rolled out next week in Britain. U.S. and EU regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval. Bourla said governments need to ensure that other measures are not relaxed in the meantime. “I think that it is important to use the vaccine as one tool,” he said, adding that “undeniably it’s going to be the most effective, with the most permanent impact. “The time that we can go back to normality is not far away, but definitely it is not now,” he said. Bourla, who is Greek, told a roundtable discussion of the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce, which included Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, that the distribution strategy of governments was key. Governments “have to move in a very strategic way and they need to listen to the experts,” Bourla said."
-16.974159502651055," Australia sees no changes to COVID-19 vaccine rollout plans after UK approval SYDNEY, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Australia expects no changes to the timeline for its COVID-19 vaccine rollout plans, Health Minister Greg Hunt said, after Britain approved Pfizer Inc’s vaccine on Wednesday, the first country to do so. Britain said it would start inoculating high-risk people from early next week with the vaccine, developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE. “Our advice remains that the timeline for a decision on approval is expected by the end of January 2021, and our planning is for first vaccine delivery in March 2021,” Hunt said in a statement issued late Wednesday. Pfizer’s is one of the four COVID-19 vaccines the Australian government has agreed to buy for a total projected supply of nearly 135 million doses. It has already committed to buy vaccines from Novavax, AstraZeneca and CSL Ltd should trials prove successful. Australia has largely contained the community transmission of the virus but New South Wales (NSW), its largest state, on Thursday reported a new case for the first time in nearly a month after a hotel quarantine worker tested positive. Five family members of the worker were tested overnight and all returned a negative result for the virus, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told broadcaster Seven News. The report of the new case comes a day after NSW eased a raft of restrictions at weddings, bars and dancing venues marking the biggest lifting of curbs since March when lockdowns were enforced to slow the spread of COVID-19. Australia has reported nearly 28,000 cases of COVID-19 and 908 deaths since the pandemic began but estimates there are fewer than 100 active cases remaining, mostly returned travelers from overseas in hotel quarantine."

The United Kingdom approved Pfizer’s vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin vaccination. In Mexico, Pfizer submitted the details about its vaccine to the country’s health regulator, Cofepris, last month and is still awaiting approval. Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in his regular morning news conference on Wednesday that Cofepris would work “day and night” to grant vaccine approval “as fast as possible.”"

-16.974159502651055," UK PM Johnson might take COVID shot on TV, but won't jump queue: press secretary LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might be persuaded to take a COVID-19 vaccination on television to show it is safe but he would not have one before those in greater need, his press secretary said on Wednesday. Johnson, 56, who spent time in intensive care earlier this year after contracting COVID-19, has hailed the UK approval of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine as a global win and ray of hope amid a pandemic that has hurt the economy and upended normal life. But, like other leaders, Johnson cannot be seen to be jumping the queue for the vaccine, ahead of more vulnerable people. However, he wants to illustrate its safety to try to persuade others to take it when it is more widely available. Asked if the prime minister would take the shot live on television, press secretary Allegra Stratton said she had not asked him directly. “I don’t think it would be something he would rule out,” she said. “But I think we also know that he wouldn’t want to take a jab that should be for someone who is extremely vulnerable, clinically vulnerable and who should be getting it before him.” Johnson has said the shots would be voluntary, and a snap YouGov poll found that 20% of Britons were either not confident or not very confident that it was safe. There was support for the health minister Matt Hancock getting a shot live on TV, with 66% backing the idea. Britain’s government has said the health service will prioritise vaccinations, putting older residents in care homes and their carers first, then all those over 80 and frontline health workers. Johnson has spoken openly of his struggle with COVID-19 in April, saying he fought for his life and that it was 50-50 whether the doctors were going to put him on a ventilator. He said his weight was an underlying condition that made his condition worse and has since spoken frequently about his attempts to lose the pounds. Stratton said she did not know whether his weight might put him in a more vulnerable group, adding that he has been exercising more. Johnson’s spokesman also said it was a matter for Buckingham Palace whether 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth received a vaccination. A palace spokesman declined to comment on whether the queen would get a shot, saying royal medical matters were traditionally kept private. The queen and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, who would be in the second priority tier for a vaccine, have spent national lockdowns this year with a small number of staff at Windsor Castle to the west of London. They are planning to stay there over Christmas, rather than travelling to Sandringham in eastern England as they traditionally do."

-16.974159502651055," Instant View: Britain approves Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, rollout to begin next week (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the COVID-19 vaccine developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and said it will be rolled out from early next week. Here are some reactions to the news: ITALY HEALTH MINISTER ROBERTO SPERANZA (SPEAKING IN PARLIAMENT) “At the moment the EMA has not issued any formal approval... I am still speaking with caution because we demand that EMA carries out all the controls keeping the bar on surveillance very high, because when the vaccine will be administered to people it will certainly have to be a safe vaccine but it will have to be an effective vaccine. YAZDAN YAZDANPANAH, HEAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT PARIS’ BICHAT HOSPITAL, MEMBER OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT’S SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL. “This is not a 100-meter dash. It’s not because they’ll start next week that they’ll do better than others. I think we should take the time to look at all the data. It’s also important to show everybody -- considering the hesitations (in the public) -- that we’re doing that seriously.” JOHN TREGONING, A READER IN RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: “This is great news and remarkable progress given the first cases were less than a year ago. It shows what progress can be made through science and innovation. The MHRA, the UK drug regulator, will have gone through all the safety data from the trials before approving and will continue to monitor as it is rolled out more widely. The next step will be to get the vaccine to the people who need it the most.” PROFESSOR ARNE AKBAR, PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH SOCIETY FOR IMMUNOLOGY: “It is only 12 months since the first case recorded case of COVID-19 and in that time, researchers around the world have worked tirelessly to increase our understanding of this new disease and develop safe and effective vaccines.” “To achieve this within this timescale is remarkable and the researchers should be applauded. Although development of this vaccine has occurred rapidly, it’s important to emphasise that it will still have gone through all the rigorous safety tests, and validity of the data on effectiveness will have been assessed meticulously by the MHRA.” PETER LIESE, AN EU LAWMAKER WHO IS A MEMBER OF GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL’S PARTY: “I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way. A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine.” AYFER ALI, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT WARWICK BUSINESS SCHOOL WHO SPECIALISES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: “The approval of the Pfizer vaccine is a landmark moment in the UK’s response to the pandemic. However, if we need to vaccinate the whole population, or at least a large portion of it, we need all the vaccines we can get.” “Other vaccines, which have not yet been approved, may have better profiles in terms of protecting different populations, such as the elderly. They may also be easier to administer logistically because they need fewer shots or are easier to store and transport.” “Competition is also good in achieving a better price, especially for lower income countries faced with vaccinated large populations.” MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON: “This is excellent news and a huge landmark in the global efforts to address this pandemic. The regulators have clearly been satisfied with the data presented to them.” “The Pfizer vaccine does require storage at around -70C, which will pose significant logistical challenges for all countries that choose to use it. These are not insurmountable but certainly challenging.” “Other vaccines, such as the Oxford AstraZeneca candidate, require storage at much lesser temperatures and will be simpler to transport. Given we will certainly need more than one licensed vaccine to maximise global coverage, everyone will still be eagerly waiting for further developments from Oxford and Moderna.” LIAM SMEETH, PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POPULATION HEALTH, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL MEDICINE: “The continued progress on vaccines is fantastic news. A route towards a much better situation in the UK is becoming clear. A further circuit breaker in January or possibly February is likely to be needed. But, it is realistic to hope that by March or April the vast majority of older people, care home residents, and those with severe conditions will have been immunised.” “We can then work towards wider immunisation – with ideally much of the population covered in time for next winter. Life won’t ever be the same as it was before Covid-19, but it will feel a whole lot better than now.” “For the foreseeable future - and maybe forever - we are very unlikely to reach the situation we are in with smallpox (gone), polio (almost gone), or measles (controlled in populations with high enough vaccine coverage). Instead, we are going to need to find ways to fairly happily live alongside this virus.” ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL “With 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks. However, we need new independent clinical trials to monitor long-term safety and efficacy.” FRENCH PRIME MINISTER JEAN CASTEX told BFM TV that a European decision was expected towards the end of December. “From what I know, it’s due in the days ahead, more likely towards the end of December than the beginning.” “I will never take the risk of vaccinating people without the having approval to put (the vaccine) on the market by the competent authorities.” JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN STANDARD INVESTMENTS: “Incoming news surrounding the development and distribution of COVID vaccinations continues to be unequivocally positive, and subsequently, is being cheered and welcomed by financial markets that are desperate for good news.” “This morning’s announcement that vaccination in the UK could begin as early as next week saw further gains for sterling following yesterday’s strong performance following the Times Radio report that Brexit negotiations have entered the final and crucial stage. However, these gains have been stopped in their tracks by a subsequent headline suggesting that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told EU ambassadors that there may not be a Brexit deal after all.” SYLVAIN GOYON, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY AT ODDO BHF IN PARIS: “Stock market reactions following the Pfizer and Moderna announcements already reflect bets of a rapid normalization. To this extent the UK registration is somewhat already priced in” MIKE BELL, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: “Approval of a highly effective vaccine may mark the beginning of the end to the Covid-19 economic turmoil and the beginning of a new bull market for equities.” “The scientists have come to the rescue and delivered what investors were hoping for Christmas this year. As this year’s savings are spent next year, the global economy should boom driving corporate profits and equities higher in 2021.” DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: “Exciting news keeps coming, but this really is momentous. Nobody knew how the battle to find effective vaccines would pan out. Now, less than 11 months from the first characterisation of the virus sequence, we have the first emergency approval for use of a really effective vaccine. Truly heroic.” “I don’t think we should get too hung up on ‘the race’ and this as the 1st approval. Over the next several weeks we’ll likely see a number of licenses granted - and we do need them all to get speedily out of this mess.”"

-16.974159502651055," Brexit Britain just approved a European vaccine, German health minister says BERLIN (Reuters) - Celebrating Britain’s swift approval of BioNtech and Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine as a benefit of Brexit is misplaced since the vaccine was itself a product of the European Union that Britain has left, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said. Some hailed Britain’s success in being first to approve the vaccine, developed by Pfizer with German biotechnology start-up BioNtech, as a pay-off from leaving the EU’s regulatory orbit. But Spahn told journalists at an EU briefing on Wednesday that, while Britain had been the first to approve the vaccine, he was optimistic that the European Medicines Agency would soon follow. “But a few remarks on Brexit to my British friends,” he said. “BioNtech is a European development, from the EU. The fact that this EU product is so good that Britain approved it so quickly shows that in this crisis European and international cooperation are best,” he said. The head of Britain’s medicines regulator, June Raine, earlier told a televised briefing that Britain’s fast-tracked vaccine approval done under provisions of European law, which the country is required to follow until the end of this month under its transition arrangements for leaving the bloc. Though Spahn has himself said he was proud that a German company, founded by a husband-and-wife team of Turkish immigrant background, had created the vaccine, he was not the only official irritated at Britons celebrating being the first to approve as a national triumph. When British business minister Alok Sharma hailed the approval on Twitter as “the day the UK led humanity’s charge against the disease”, Germany’s ambassador to London fired off a testy response. “I really don’t think this is a national story,” Andreas Michaelis tweeted. “In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution this is European and transatlantic.”"

-16.974159502651055," Explainer: When and how will COVID-19 vaccines become available? NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, jumping ahead of the United States and Europe after its regulator cleared a shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for emergency use in record time. Pfizer, with partner BioNTech SE, and rival Moderna have released trial data showing their COVID-19 vaccines to be about 95% effective at preventing the illness, while AstraZeneca last month said its vaccine was on average about 70% effective. The companies have said distribution could begin almost immediately after any approval, with governments around the world to decide who gets them and in what order. The following is an outline of the process: Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already started manufacturing their vaccines, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be rolled out from early next week in Britain. This year, Pfizer said it would have enough to inoculate 25 million people, Moderna will have enough for 10 million people and AstraZeneca will have enough for more than 100 million people. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will manage distribution in the United States, with some 20 million people expected to be inoculated by the end of the year. Some 60 million to 70 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine could be available per month beginning in January and most Americans will have access to shots by mid-2021, the government said on Tuesday. In the European Union, it is up to each country in the 27-member bloc to start distributing vaccines to their populations. WHO WOULD GET AN APPROVED VACCINE AND WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will make a decision on emergency use authorization on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in days or weeks after a panel of outside advisors meets on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend it. The FDA often but not always follows the panel’s advice. Upon FDA authorization, the CDC is planning that first in line for vaccinations would be about 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents in long-term care facilities. Essential workers, a group of 87 million people who do crucial jobs that cannot be done from home, are the likely next group. This includes firefighters, police, school employees, transport workers, food and agriculture workers and food service employees. Around 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million adults over the age of 65, also considered at higher risk of severe disease, are the next priority. U.S. public health officials said vaccines would be generally available to most Americans in pharmacies, clinics and doctors offices starting in April so that anyone who wants a shot can have one by the end of June. It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children. Pfizer and BioNTech have started testing their vaccine in volunteers as young as 12. Britain will start a roll-out of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this month. The country had ordered 40 million doses - enough for just under a third of the population. Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers. The European Union (EU), Japan, Canada and Australia are all running rapid vaccine regulatory processes. The EU drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, said it could give conditional marketing approval for Pfizer’s vaccine by Dec. 29 and make a decision on Moderna’s by Jan. 12. Most countries in the region have said the first vaccines would go to the elderly and vulnerable and frontline workers. Many of AstraZeneca’s doses this year are expected to go to Britain, where health officials have said that if approved they could begin vaccinating people in December. Countries say they are buying vaccines via the European Commission’s joint procurement scheme, which has deals for six different vaccines and nearly 2 billion doses. Delivery timelines vary and most countries are still drawing up plans for distributing and administering shots. Italy expects to receive the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and AstraZeneca’s shot early next year. Spain plans to give vaccines in January. Hungary’s foreign minister said doses would land in the spring at the earliest. Germany, home to BioNTech, expects to roll out shots in early 2021 with mass vaccination centres in exhibition halls, airport terminals and concert venues. It will also use mobile teams for care homes. COVAX, a programme led by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine group to pool funds from wealthier countries and non-profits to buy and distribute vaccines to dozens of poorer countries, has raised $2 billion. Its first goal is to vaccinate 3% of the people in these countries with a final goal of reaching 20%. It has signed a provisional agreement to buy AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which does not require storage in specialized ultra cold equipment like the Pfizer vaccine. It is expected, but not certain, that less wealthy countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, such as India, will receive vaccines at low or no cost under this programme in 2021. Other countries, such as those in Latin America, may buy vaccines through COVAX. Several are also striking supply deals directly with drugmakers. Vaccine makers and governments have negotiated varying prices, not all of which are public. Governments have paid from a few dollars per AstraZeneca shot to up to $50 for the two-dose Pfizer regimen. Many countries have said they will cover the cost of inoculating their residents."

-16.974159502651055," As U.S. races toward COVID-19 vaccine, Britain takes the lead Dec 2 (Reuters) - Britain leapt ahead of the United States in approving Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, intensifying scrutiny on U.S. regulators as they consider whether to grant emergency use in the country that leads the world in coronavirus infections. A day after top U.S. health officials announced plans to begin vaccinating Americans as early as mid-December, British regulators granted emergency use approval to the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc along with Germany’s BioNTech SE . Dr. Jose Romero, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said U.S. officials will be watching closely to see what they can learn from the British experience with a vaccine that requires extreme refrigeration. “I’m personally interested to see how well they can deliver it and how their transport systems, the dry-ice trays that hold this vaccine, function in the real world,” Romero told CNN. “Does it keep the vaccine cold? Are there any issues involved in getting the vaccine out from a central point into the public sector? We can learn from that and adjust our plans as necessary,” Romero said. The vaccine still faces regulatory hurdles in the United States. A Food and Drug Administration panel of outside advisers will meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is expected to be reviewed a week later, and others are under development. While some U.S. health officials described a timeline that assumed FDA authorization would come within days of the Dec. 10 meeting, the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr. Peter Marks, told patient advocacy groups last week that it might take “a few days to a few weeks.” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, likewise, has said the process could take longer, and the vaccine calls for two separate injections given three weeks apart. “It does take two doses to get the full 95% efficacy, but there’s a possibility that some patients will derive protection after one dose, so the vaccine can start having an immediate impact,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Trump administration and a member of the Pfizer board of directors, told CNBC television. With many Americans still refusing to follow basic public health guidance on wearing masks and avoiding crowds, a vaccine could be crucial to arresting a raging pandemic that killed 10,000 people and infected 1.1 million last week alone in the United States. Another 2,624 new U.S. deaths were reported on Tuesday, raising the cumulative death toll above 270,000 since the pandemic began. More than 13 million have been infected. A record 96,000 COVID-19 patients were reported in U.S. hospitals on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, at a time when exhausted healthcare professionals are short-staffed with many of their colleagues falling sick. Dr. Tom Mihaljevic, president of the renowned Cleveland Clinic, told MSNBC television on Wednesday that his hospital had three and a half times as many coronavirus patients now as it did in April during the first wave of the outbreak. “The hospitals are full,” Mihaljevic said. “Virus is currently everywhere.” He also cautioned against further spread over the year-end holidays, after millions of Americans defied official warnings and traveled for Thanksgiving last week. “This pandemic is spreading in families,” Mihaljevic said. “When people get together with people they know under their own roof, then that is when the guard comes down. This is when the masks are not being worn, when social distancing is not being put in place. And therefore we will have to reconsider how we celebrate this coming holiday season.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use and said that it will be rolled out from early next week. The head of the medicines regulator, June Raine, said no corners had been cut. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it had received the first data on the vaccine in June and carried out a rigorous rolling analysis to international standards before giving its approval. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity. Below are details on the manufacturing and storage process, and the British vaccination programme: - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below. - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days. - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius). - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites. - Britain will start vaccinating people early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Belgium. The speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said. - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year. - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality. - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the jab. - 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities. - The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver."

Here are some reactions to the news: ITALY HEALTH MINISTER ROBERTO SPERANZA (SPEAKING IN PARLIAMENT) “At the moment the EMA has not issued any formal approval... I am still speaking with caution because we demand that EMA carries out all the controls keeping the bar on surveillance very high, because when the vaccine will be administered to people it will certainly have to be a safe vaccine but it will have to be an effective vaccine. YAZDAN YAZDANPANAH, HEAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT PARIS’ BICHAT HOSPITAL, MEMBER OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT’S SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL. “This is not a 100-meter dash. It’s not because they’ll start next week that they’ll do better than others. I think we should take the time to look at all the data. It’s also important to show everybody -- considering the hesitations (in the public) -- that we’re doing that seriously.” JOHN TREGONING, A READER IN RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: “This is great news and remarkable progress given the first cases were less than a year ago. It shows what progress can be made through science and innovation. The MHRA, the UK drug regulator, will have gone through all the safety data from the trials before approving and will continue to monitor as it is rolled out more widely. The next step will be to get the vaccine to the people who need it the most.” PROFESSOR ARNE AKBAR, PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH SOCIETY FOR IMMUNOLOGY: “It is only 12 months since the first case recorded case of COVID-19 and in that time, researchers around the world have worked tirelessly to increase our understanding of this new disease and develop safe and effective vaccines.” “To achieve this within this timescale is remarkable and the researchers should be applauded. Although development of this vaccine has occurred rapidly, it’s important to emphasise that it will still have gone through all the rigorous safety tests, and validity of the data on effectiveness will have been assessed meticulously by the MHRA.” PETER LIESE, AN EU LAWMAKER WHO IS A MEMBER OF GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL’S PARTY: “I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way. A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine.” AYFER ALI, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT WARWICK BUSINESS SCHOOL WHO SPECIALISES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: “The approval of the Pfizer vaccine is a landmark moment in the UK’s response to the pandemic. However, if we need to vaccinate the whole population, or at least a large portion of it, we need all the vaccines we can get.” “Other vaccines, which have not yet been approved, may have better profiles in terms of protecting different populations, such as the elderly. They may also be easier to administer logistically because they need fewer shots or are easier to store and transport.” “Competition is also good in achieving a better price, especially for lower income countries faced with vaccinated large populations.” MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON: “This is excellent news and a huge landmark in the global efforts to address this pandemic. The regulators have clearly been satisfied with the data presented to them.” “The Pfizer vaccine does require storage at around -70C, which will pose significant logistical challenges for all countries that choose to use it. These are not insurmountable but certainly challenging.” “Other vaccines, such as the Oxford AstraZeneca candidate, require storage at much lesser temperatures and will be simpler to transport. Given we will certainly need more than one licensed vaccine to maximise global coverage, everyone will still be eagerly waiting for further developments from Oxford and Moderna.” LIAM SMEETH, PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POPULATION HEALTH, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL MEDICINE: “The continued progress on vaccines is fantastic news. A route towards a much better situation in the UK is becoming clear. A further circuit breaker in January or possibly February is likely to be needed. But, it is realistic to hope that by March or April the vast majority of older people, care home residents, and those with severe conditions will have been immunised.” “We can then work towards wider immunisation – with ideally much of the population covered in time for next winter. Life won’t ever be the same as it was before Covid-19, but it will feel a whole lot better than now.” “For the foreseeable future - and maybe forever - we are very unlikely to reach the situation we are in with smallpox (gone), polio (almost gone), or measles (controlled in populations with high enough vaccine coverage). Instead, we are going to need to find ways to fairly happily live alongside this virus.” ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL “With 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks. However, we need new independent clinical trials to monitor long-term safety and efficacy.” FRENCH PRIME MINISTER JEAN CASTEX told BFM TV that a European decision was expected towards the end of December. “From what I know, it’s due in the days ahead, more likely towards the end of December than the beginning.” “I will never take the risk of vaccinating people without the having approval to put (the vaccine) on the market by the competent authorities.” JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN STANDARD INVESTMENTS: “Incoming news surrounding the development and distribution of COVID vaccinations continues to be unequivocally positive, and subsequently, is being cheered and welcomed by financial markets that are desperate for good news.” “This morning’s announcement that vaccination in the UK could begin as early as next week saw further gains for sterling following yesterday’s strong performance following the Times Radio report that Brexit negotiations have entered the final and crucial stage. However, these gains have been stopped in their tracks by a subsequent headline suggesting that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told EU ambassadors that there may not be a Brexit deal after all.” SYLVAIN GOYON, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY AT ODDO BHF IN PARIS: “Stock market reactions following the Pfizer and Moderna announcements already reflect bets of a rapid normalization. To this extent the UK registration is somewhat already priced in” MIKE BELL, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: “Approval of a highly effective vaccine may mark the beginning of the end to the Covid-19 economic turmoil and the beginning of a new bull market for equities.” “The scientists have come to the rescue and delivered what investors were hoping for Christmas this year. As this year’s savings are spent next year, the global economy should boom driving corporate profits and equities higher in 2021.” DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: “Exciting news keeps coming, but this really is momentous.

-16.974159502651055," EXPLAINER-When and how will COVID-19 vaccines become available? (Updates throughout) NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, jumping ahead of the United States and Europe after its regulator cleared a shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for emergency use in record time. Pfizer, with partner BioNTech SE, and rival Moderna have released trial data showing their COVID-19 vaccines to be about 95% effective at preventing the illness, while AstraZeneca last month said its vaccine was on average about 70% effective. The companies have said distribution could begin almost immediately after any approval, with governments around the world to decide who gets them and in what order. The following is an outline of the process: Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already started manufacturing their vaccines, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be rolled out from early next week in Britain. This year, Pfizer said it would have enough to inoculate 25 million people, Moderna will have enough for 10 million people and AstraZeneca will have enough for more than 100 million people. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will manage distribution in the United States, with some 20 million people expected to be inoculated by the end of the year. Some 60 million to 70 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine could be available per month beginning in January and most Americans will have access to shots by mid-2021, the government said on Tuesday. In the European Union, it is up to each country in the 27-member bloc to start distributing vaccines to their populations. WHO WOULD GET AN APPROVED VACCINE AND WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES? Upon authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the CDC has said first in line for vaccinations would be about 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents in long-term care facilities. The U.S. FDA is set to meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Essential workers, a group of 87 million people who do crucial jobs that cannot be done from home, are the likely next group. This includes firefighters, police, school employees, transport workers, food and agriculture workers and food service employees. Around 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million adults over the age of 65, also considered at higher risk of severe disease, are the next priority. U.S. public health officials said vaccines would be generally available to most Americans in pharmacies, clinics and doctors offices starting in April so that anyone who wants a shot can have one by the end of June. It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children. Pfizer and BioNTech have started testing their vaccine in volunteers as young as 12. Britain could start a roll-out of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this month. The country had ordered 40 million doses - enough for just under a third of the population. Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers. The European Union (EU), Japan, Canada and Australia are all running rapid vaccine regulatory processes. The EU drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, said it could give conditional marketing approval for Pfizer’s vaccine by Dec. 29 and make a decision on Moderna’s by Jan. 12. Most countries in the region have said the first vaccines would go to the elderly and vulnerable and frontline workers. Many of AstraZeneca’s doses this year are expected to go to Britain, where health officials have said that if approved they could begin vaccinating people in December. Countries say they are buying vaccines via the European Commission’s joint procurement scheme, which has deals for six different vaccines and nearly 2 billion doses. Delivery timelines vary and most countries are still drawing up plans for distributing and administering shots. Italy expects to receive the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and AstraZeneca’s shot early next year. Spain plans to give vaccines in January. In Bulgaria, the country’s chief health inspector expects the first shipments in March-April. Hungary’s foreign minister said doses would land in the spring at the earliest. Germany, home to BioNTech, expects to roll out shots in early 2021 with mass vaccination centres in exhibition halls, airport terminals and concert venues. It will also use mobile teams for care homes. COVAX, a programme led by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine group to pool funds from wealthier countries and non-profits to buy and distribute vaccines to dozens of poorer countries, has raised $2 billion. Its first goal is to vaccinate 3% of the people in these countries with a final goal of reaching 20%. It has signed a provisional agreement to buy AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which does not require storage in specialized ultra cold equipment like the Pfizer vaccine. It is expected, but not certain, that less wealthy countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, such as India, will receive vaccines at low or no cost under this programme in 2021. Other countries, such as those in Latin America, may buy vaccines through COVAX. Several are also striking supply deals directly with drugmakers. Vaccine makers and governments have negotiated varying prices, not all of which are public. Governments have paid from a few dollars per AstraZeneca shot to up to $50 for the two-dose Pfizer regimen. Many countries have said they will cover the cost of inoculating their residents."

Morgan Asset Management. “The scientists have come to the rescue and delivered what investors were hoping for Christmas.” Despite the positive news, European stocks struggled to add to their recent surge in early trading but MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe inched up 0.1% to keep it near an all-time high. The dollar was stuck at 2-1/2 year lows against the euro and an index of major currencies as investors sought out the higher risk currencies that had fallen during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Yields on euro zone government bonds edged up to their highest in three weeks at -0.51%. Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month, though a European regulator clouded the schedule when it said it would complete its review of their vaccine by Dec. 29. Deutsche Bank analysts said the early approval and roll-out of the vaccine in Britain “raises the prospect that life could return closer to normal early next year”. Shares in BioNTech surged by more than 8% before trimming gains, though European shares slipped overall by 0.3%, shuffling below recent nine-month highs. Markets were also hoping for more fiscal relief. Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress should include new coronavirus stimulus in a $1.4 trillion spending bill aimed at heading off a government shutdown in the midst of the pandemic. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden told the New York Times his priority is getting a generous aid package through Congress even before he takes office in January. U.S. stock futures declined 0.23% following a record closing high for Wall Street shares. The pound was under some pressure, however, as a senior EU diplomat said UK’s post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union “still hangs in balance”. Sterling fell more than 0.5% to $1.3354. UK blue-chip stocks were steady. In Asia, shares in China recovered from early losses and rose 0.12%. Tokyo stocks were little changed after setting a new 29-year high. Softbank Group shares fell 0.66% after Bloomberg News said the tech investor is winding down its options trades on companies including Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc. Oil prices were also lifted by the vaccine optimism, reversing earlier losses made after OPEC and its allies left markets in limbo by postponing a formal meeting to decide whether to lift output in January. Brent crude futures rose 0.15% to $47.49 per barrel, while U.S. crude was down 0.09% at $44.51 per barrel. Oil has raced up nearly 30% over the last month."
-16.974159502651055," Factbox: Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine days away from UK roll-out (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use and said that it will be rolled out from early next week. Drugmaker Pfizer said last month final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective. Pfizer said efficacy of the vaccine was consistent across age and ethnic groups, and there were no major side effects, a sign that the immunization could be employed broadly around the world. Dozens of drugmakers and research groups have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which has killed more than 1.3 million people, shuttered businesses and left millions out of work around the globe. Below are the main details of the vaccine and progress on supply deals and potential approvals: - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity. - mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. - The new technology has not been approved for any vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA. - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay. - BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last. - The European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that if its experts have received enough data from Pfizer about the candidate vaccine against the coronavirus, the agency would complete its reviews by Dec. 29. - Canada could approve Pfizer’s vaccine “around December”, a senior official at Canada’s drug regulator said on Thursday. - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July. - The European Medicines Agency said in November Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted data from large-scale trial of their potential COVID-19 vaccine for the agency’s rolling review, but had not yet applied for approval. - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April. - Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month. - Trials are continuing globally in 154 locations, including in Germany, Japan, Brazil and in several locations within the United States in participants aged 12 years and older. The global Phase I/II/III trials enrolled about 44,000 volunteers.

-16.974159502651055," European shares dip; FTSE 100 outperforms on UK vaccine approval (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Wednesday as investors took stock following a near 14% rally last month, while shares in BioNTech surged after UK became the first country to approve its COVID-19 vaccine developed with Pfizer. London’s blue-chip index outperformed regional peers, up 0.1% after Britain said the vaccine will be rolled out from next week, and as the pound slid on Brexit trade deal uncertainty. “As vaccines get approved and rolled out, the outlook for the economy should improve,” said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics. The FTSE 100 has been inching towards pre-pandemic levels, having recovered 60% from March lows. BioNtech’s Frankfurt-listed shares jumped 7.5%, compared with a 0.5% fall for Germany’s benchmark DAX index. Data showing a higher-than-expected rebound in retail sales in Europe’s largest economy in October did little to cheer investors. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3%, with auto stocks leading declines as carmaker Volkswagen slipped 2.1% amid uncertainty about top management. “(The moves) come against the backdrop of a few weeks of very sharp rallies in European markets on the vaccine, so it’s not unusual that there will be days when the rally moderates slightly,” Gambarini said. “I certainly don’t think this will be the beginning of a correction, as more positive news will probably be coming our way regarding the vaccines.” Stimulus developments were also on the radar after the New York Times reported that U.S. President elect Joe Biden said his priority was getting a generous coronavirus aid package through Congress even before he takes office in January. Biden added he will not act immediately to remove the Phase 1 trade agreement with China reached by President Donald Trump, according to the report. A tariff war between the world’s two biggest economies had roiled markets and slowed global economic growth. Investors also kept an eye on moves by Britain and the European Union as Brexit trade talks were still stuck. “A deal still hangs in the balance” the EU’s Brexit negotiator said on Wednesday. The bloc had said it would launch contingency measures on Wednesday or Thursday, if unable to reach an agreement by then."

-16.974159502651055," COVID-19 vaccine sprint as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna seek emergency EU approval FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are in a tight race to launch their COVID-19 vaccines in Europe after both applied for emergency EU approval on Tuesday, though there was uncertainty over whether a rollout could begin this year. The applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came a day after Moderna sought emergency use for its shot in the United States and more than a week after Pfizer and BioNTech did the same. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month. “We can start to deliver within a few hours (of an approval),” said Sierk Poetting, head of operations and finance at BioNTech. “We have been stocking up. And everything that is there can really be distributed within a few hours.” The EMA clouded the timeline, however, when it said it would complete its review for that vaccine by Dec. 29 at the latest, and for Moderna’s shot by Jan. 12. It added its schedule may be subject to change as its evaluation proceeds. The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would likely give its final authorization for a vaccine’s rollout days after a recommendation by the EMA. An effective immunization is seen as the main weapon against the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.4 million lives and ravaged economies across the globe. Close to 50 potential vaccines are being tested on volunteers worldwide. Both U.S. biotech firm Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have reported preliminary findings of more than 90% effectiveness - an unexpectedly high rate - in trials of their vaccines, which are both based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. Their work validates that of several biotech experts, who for years have been labouring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory. Both inoculations work by injecting people with customised genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response. Pfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on Nov. 18 that showed their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns. Moderna Inc said on Monday that full results from a late-stage study showed its candidate, mRNA-1273, was 94.1% effective, also with no serious safety concerns. Any clearance in the EU and United States for the vaccines will be “conditional” or for “emergency use”, meaning developers are obliged to continue trials and provide more trial results as they emerge. The European filings complete so-called rolling reviews, initiated by the EMA on Oct. 6 in the case of Pfizer and on Nov. 16 for Moderna, aimed at speeding up the process by doing a real-time assessment of the data as it lands. The EMA said on Tuesday it had started a rolling review of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine candidate after preliminary results showed it triggered production of antibodies and immune cells against the virus. The review will go on until enough evidence is available for a formal marketing authorisation application, the regulator added. The British government said last week that Pfizer and BioNTech had reported the data from their clinical trials to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)."

Lopez-Gatell said the contract with Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE, is expected to be signed by Health Minister Jorge Alcocer, and the Finance Ministry was making plans to ensure Mexico sets aside enough money to pay for the Pfizer and other vaccines. Mexico’s contract with Pfizer will include ways to minimize the challenges associated with its vaccine, which requires that it be transported and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). “The contract that will be signed tomorrow includes provisions for its distribution to be as close to the point of use so that the period of deep freezing is shortened, the distance to be covered is shortened,” Lopez-Gatell said. He said Mexico’s military will help with the vaccination process. Lopez-Gatell also said that Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit has begun its coronavirus clinical trial in Mexico, where it is looking to have up 20,000 subjects. Mexico’s Health Ministry on Tuesday reported 8,819 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 825 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 1,122,362 cases and 106,765 deaths.

Russia will deliver 20 doses of its vaccine to Serbia for laboratory testing by the end of the week, the office of Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said in a statement after speaking via videoconference with Russia’s trade and industry minister Denis Manturov. “Serbia is interested in ... a possibility of a joint production of the vaccine,” the statement said. Russia has said interim trial results show its vaccine to be 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19. The statement also said Brnabic will continue talks with Pfizer on Tuesday. It offered no further details. Before Serbia adopts any vaccine, it must be approved by the country’s Medicines and Medical Devices Agency.

-8.524035789425781," UK says tough tiers needed as PM tries to see off lawmaker backlash LONDON (Reuters) - England needs tough restrictions after its current lockdown ends if hospitals are not to become overwhelmed, a senior minister said, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote to lawmakers to say the measures would end in February to try to quell opposition. Britain upped preparations for a vaccine roll-out on Saturday as Johnson named Nadhim Zahawi as a new health minister to oversee its deployment and the Financial Times reported that the UK is set to approve the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine next week. But despite progress on the vaccine, the government still needs to convince lawmakers to back its new tougher tiered measures which will put 99% of English people into the highest two levels of restrictions when the current national lockdown ends on Dec. 2. Sky News reported that Johnson wrote to lawmakers ahead of their vote on the new measures on Tuesday to say that the tiered approach has “a sunset of 3 February” and they will be reviewed every two weeks before then. Lawmakers will then vote again on Jan. 27, according to the letter. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove wrote in the Times newspaper on Saturday to warn that without further restrictions on most of England’s population hospitals would be overwhelmed. He urged lawmakers to back government plans. More than 20 million people across large swathes of England will be forced to live under the toughest tier of coronavirus restrictions. A growing number of lawmakers in Johnson’s Conservative party have voiced opposition to the tiered restrictions plan. Some argue that the areas they represent have low infection rates but face the toughest rules, while others say the new measures will cause unnecessary economic harm to local businesses. There is also some public opposition to the restrictions. Police in central London said they made 155 arrests during anti-lockdown demonstrations on Saturday. Gove said the level of infection across the country remained “uncomfortably and threateningly high”. “These new tiers, alongside the wider deployment of mass testing, have the capacity to prevent our NHS being overwhelmed until vaccines arrive,” said Gove."

The government asked the regulator on Friday to assess AstraZeneca Plc’s COVID-19 vaccine for a possible rollout. It has secured 100 million doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and has targeted a rollout to begin before Christmas."
-9.067079535804654," Explainer: Will COVID-19 vaccines protect us? Does efficacy equal effectiveness? (Reuters) - The frontrunners in the COVID-19 vaccine race have emerged with different success rates for their shots in clinical trials, but what does that mean for the global fight against the pandemic? U.S. drugmakers Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna have each said their coronavirus vaccines have an efficacy rate of around 95% and a Russian project touted 92% efficacy for its Sputnik V vaccine. Britain’s AstraZeneca announced an average efficacy rate of 70%, still well above the 50% rate that U.S. regulators have said they want to see before approving a COVID-19 vaccine for use. If a vaccine has an efficacy of, say, 80%, it means that if 100 people who have not previously been infected by the coronavirus are given the vaccine, on average 80 of them will not get the disease that the virus causes: COVID-19. These rates relate to vaccines administered and monitored in controlled circumstances, such as clinical trials. DOES THAT MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL’S PROTECTION LEVEL IS THE SAME? No. A person immunised with a vaccine that has, say, 80% efficacy is very likely to be protected from getting the disease with symptoms, especially severe ones. They are also very likely to be protected from asymptomatic disease - but this, depending on the vaccine, may be less certain. Even with 95% efficacy, there is no absolute guarantee of protection for any particular individual. There is a difference between efficacy rates obtained in clinical trials and effectiveness - the real-world protection rate of a vaccine when it is rolled out. “Efficacy says: ‘Does it work?’. Effectiveness says: ‘Can it be applied? Can you carry the efficacy to the people?’,” said Marcel Tanner, an epidemiologist and president of Switzerland’s Academies of Arts and Sciences. In the real world, a vaccine’s effectiveness can be influenced by multiple, unpredictable factors including, for example: the rate of spread of a virus; how many, or few, people adhere to the optimum dosing schedule and timetable; how individuals’ immune systems respond; whether the vaccine was stored at the correct temperature; whether people know, or don’t know, if they’ve been exposed before. Generally, a vaccine’s real-world effectiveness tends to be slightly lower than its efficacy. Experts say this is unlikely. More realistic, they say, is that we will have to live alongside the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Evidence so far suggests that COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna and AstraZeneca will help stop people developing the disease. Only AstraZeneca’s data, so far, shows signs that its shot may also help prevent transmission of the virus. “Protection against illness has a value for an individual,” said Penny Ward,” a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London. She added, however, that vaccines that do not prevent transmission will not halt the pandemic. “Until the vaccination and other measures result in the virus being close to elimination in any particular country, and worldwide, there will still be a need for distancing, masks and hand washing to reduce transmission further than will be achieved by the vaccine alone,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “(A) vaccine is no good until people are vaccinated, and even then, it will not result in a situation where all other protective measures can be immediately abandoned.”"
-9.067079535804654," UPDATE 2-Malaysia secures Pfizer vaccine in a first for Southeast Asia (Adds more details throughout) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Malaysia has agreed to buy 12.8 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to announce a deal with the U.S. drugmaker after some expressed reservations over the need for ultra-cold storage. While final trial data showed that Pfizer’s vaccine is 95% effective, many Asian countries are not betting on it partly due to tropical heat, remote island communities and a lack of ultra-cold freezers. Pfizer’s vaccine, jointly developed with German partner BioNTech, must be stored and transported at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F), although it can be kept in a fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Friday that Malaysia would prioritise “high-risk groups... including frontliners, senior citizens, and those with non-communicable diseases, such as heart diseases and diabetes”. Pfizer will deliver the first one million doses in the first quarter of 2021, with 1.7 million, 5.8 million and 4.3 million doses to follow in subsequent quarters. The deal is expected to cover 6.4 million Malaysians, or 20% of the population, with another 10% to be covered under Malaysia’s participation in the global COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization. Malaysia, which will distribute the vaccine to its people for free, reported 1,109 new COVID-19 infections on Friday. The country is also planning to run a Phase 3 trial of an experimental vaccine developed by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The trial will involve 3,000 participants. Pfizer’s vaccine still requires approvals from regulators including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Malaysia’s Health Ministry before it can be distributed, Muhyiddin said during a televised address. The FDA plans a meeting on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to authorise the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use. Pfizer and BioNTech have supply deals with several countries including the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain. They expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of vaccines in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, with 48 in human trials, the WHO says. This week AstraZeneca said its vaccine developed by Oxford University could be around 90% effective, following positive results from Pfizer, Moderna Inc and Russia’s Sputnik V.

-9.067079535804654," Canada could approve Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine 'around December' (Reuters) - Canada could approve Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine “around December,” about the same time as the United States and the European Union, a senior official at Canada’s drug regulator said on Thursday. Health Canada had said previously that an approval would likely come early in the first quarter, under a new accelerated review process very similar to that in place in the United States. Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine is most advanced in Health Canada’s reviews, Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada, said at a media briefing in Ottawa. Asked whether any Canadians could receive a shot before the end of the year, Sharma said several things are happening at the same time - regulatory reviews, manufacturing, distribution - which makes it difficult to pinpoint dates. “I think the general timelines of authorizations around December, and getting the shipments in January, and getting those moving in January are the best (forecasts) we can give at this time,” she said. Canada is looking at the same data as regulators in the United States and European Union, and has a similar authorization system for use during a public health emergency, Sharma said. “The way that the reviews are progressing is that we are expecting to make a final decision on the vaccine around the same time as both the U.S. FDA and the European Medicines Agency,” she said. The European Medicines Agency is “very hopeful” it will be able to give a positive scientific opinion before Christmas, its executive director said on Wednesday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will hold a meeting on Dec. 10 at which members would discuss Pfizer’s vaccine. The agency declined last week to predict how long its review would take, but both Pfizer and U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar have said the FDA could authorize the vaccine in mid-December."

Pfizer last week applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA will discuss the emergency use authorization on Dec. 10. Once the vaccine is approved in Mexico, Ebrard said it would take about five days for a shipment to arrive in Mexico from laboratories in either the United States or Europe. “It’s good news for Mexico. We’re going to start just with a short gap behind the United States and Germany,” Ebrard told the news conference. Mexico has pre-ordered several different vaccines, both through the WHO-backed COVAX program and bilaterally. While Pfizer may be the first to get approval, AstraZeneca’s offering could end up being more widely distributed since it will be partly made in Mexico and does not require such cold storage. “The logistics of distribution will be more simple relatively,” Ebrard said. Mexico is also conducting large-scale Phase 3 trials at 19 test centers for the Chinese CanSino Biologics Inc candidate, and expects to start similar trials for Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit once the first doses arrive this week and Cofepris authorizes the trial, Ebrard said. The regulator is studying a request by U.S. laboratory Novavax Inc to conduct late stage trials in Mexico, and Germany’s CureVac NV is studying the possibility of Mexican trials, he said."

British drugmaker AstraZeneca followed rivals Pfizer and Moderna on Monday in publishing successful pivotal trial data for its COVID-19 vaccine, giving the world’s fight against the pandemic a third new weapon. “Assuming everything is positive - and we have to look at the data to be sure - but best case, we could have a scientific opinion by the end of the year,” EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke told the Irish Independent newspaper in an interview. “These have been developed very quickly, which is very promising from a scientific perspective, but it means there is a lot of attention on the results and we have to make sure we evaluate those as efficiently as we can without compromising our usual scientific standards.” The newspaper also quoted Cooke as saying that the EMA’s aim was to reach a positive recommendation on a similar timeline to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is expected to have a verdict in mid-December on Pfizer’s proposed vaccine. Cooke added that the agency may recommend the use of vaccines based on results in different groups, such as the elderly or people with underlying health conditions."

Citing government sources, it said British regulators were about to start a formal appraisal of the vaccine, made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, and that the National Health Service had been told to be ready to administer it by Dec. 1. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that it would meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to authorise the vaccine. The UK Department of Health had no comment on Sunday on when the first vaccinations would be administered. A spokesman said the authorisation process by the medical regulator Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is independent of the government and will take as long as they need to review the final data from Pfizer. “An enormous amount of planning has taken place to ensure our health service stands ready to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine,” the spokesman added. Britain formally asked its medical regulator, the MHRA, last week to assess the suitability of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which has been found to be 95% effective in preventing the spread of a virus that has killed more than 1.3 million worldwide and crippled the global economy. Britain’s health minister, Matt Hancock, said the government had taken the step after the two companies applied for emergency use authorisation in the United States. “That has given us the confidence ... formally to start the process here,” he told a news conference. “This is another important step forward in tackling this pandemic,” he said. “If a vaccine is approved it will, of course, be available across the UK from our NHS (National Health Service), free at the point of delivery, according to need, not ability to pay.” See graphic, COVID-19 global tracker: here Hancock said Pfizer-BioNTech have already starting supplying data to the medical regulator and will submit more in the coming days. Pfizer spokesman Andy Widger said that the company is continuing to work closely with the MHRA and is in the process of providing the data to allow the regulator to make a full assessment. The MHRA has launched an accelerated review of the shot, to speed up the process of approving a successful vaccine in the country, by allowing researchers to submit findings in real time, without waiting for studies to conclude. The aim of the “rolling reviews” is to speed up evaluations of promising medicines during the pandemic while maintaining the same standards of safety and effectiveness. Britain expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine, enough to protect 5 million people, by the end of the year if regulators approve it. Health officials stressed that the MHRA was independent and highly regarded. Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said the MHRA would work “at the speed of science”."

The move comes after Pfizer applied for the authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine earlier in the day, the first such application in a major step toward providing protection against the new coronavirus. “While we cannot predict how long the FDA’s review will take, the FDA will review the request as expeditiously as possible,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement. The meeting of Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will discuss the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine candidate. The FDA is not obligated to abide by its advisory panel recommendations, but typically does. (bit.ly/3nDK4Ta) Reuters had reported, citing a source, that an FDA panel tentatively plans to meet between Dec. 8 and 10 to discuss the vaccine. Hahn said the agency has been preparing for the review of emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines for several months and stands ready to do so as soon as a request is submitted. The FDA intends to make background materials available to the public, including the meeting agenda and committee roster, no later than two business days prior to the meeting."
-5.137172295622048," Pfizer files COVID-19 vaccine application to U.S. FDA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N applied to U.S. health regulators on Friday for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first such application in a major step toward providing protection against the new coronavirus. The application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comes just days after Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.DEBNTX.O reported final trial results that showed the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 with no major safety concerns. Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla confirmed the application had been made in a video posted on the company’s website on Friday afternoon. The FDA said on Friday it would hold a meeting of the advisory committee on Dec. 10 at which members would discuss the vaccine. The agency declined to predict how long its review would take, although both Pfizer and U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar have said the FDA could authorize the vaccine in mid-December. Pfizer’s shares closed up 1.4% and BioNTech shares ended 9.6% higher in New York, as the possibility of a vaccine soon raised hopes for the end of a pandemic that has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives in the United States and over 1.3 million worldwide. For an interactive graphic tracking the global spread of COVID-19, open here in an external browser. The application also includes safety data on about 100 children 12-15 years of age. The company said 45% of U.S. trial participants are 56-85 years old. If the data is solid, “we literally could be weeks away from the authorization of a 95% effective vaccine,” Azar said on CBS’s “This Morning.” The companies expect the FDA to grant the EUA by mid-December and said they will begin shipping doses almost immediately. Pfizer has said it expects to have 50 million vaccine doses ready this year, enough to protect 25 million people. The final trial data showed the vaccine provided a similar level of protection across different ages and ethnicities - an encouraging result as the disease disproportionately hurts the elderly and minorities. Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer’s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received only a placebo, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective, far higher than originally expected. The U.S. FDA had set minimum bar for efficacy of 50%. Pfizer said nearly 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants in the Phase 3 study have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. “Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine,” Bourla said in a statement. Moderna Inc MRNA.O is expected to be the next company to seek a U.S. emergency use nod for a COVID-19 vaccine. An initial analysis of data from its late-stage trial showed the vaccine was 94.5% effective. Final results and safety data are expected in the coming days or weeks. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work using a new technology to trigger an immune response known as synthetic messenger RNA that can be produced at scale much more quickly than traditional vaccines. Of dozens of drugmakers and research institutions racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data is expected to come from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L, which is working with the University of Oxford, in November or December. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it expects to have data needed to seek U.S. authorization for its experimental vaccine by February."
-5.137172295622048," Pfizer eyes rapid COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in Latam after U.S. go-ahead BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is hoping to rapidly roll out its experimental COVID-19 vaccine around Latin America soon after it gets emergency authorization in the United States, a senior executive said, which could be as early as next month. Alejandro Cané, the North America chief of scientific and medical affairs for Pfizer’s vaccines division, told Reuters in an interview in Buenos Aires that Latin America and elsewhere in the world should have a “similar timeline” to the United States. “At the beginning the idea is to have the vaccine authorized in the United States,” Cané said. “We are confident that in the next weeks or month we will have the vaccine not only in use in the U.S. and Europe, but also in Latin American countries.” Pfizer is applying to U.S. health regulators on Friday for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first such application, which marks a major step toward providing protection against the deadly virus. “The idea is just to collect all the info from that trial and we are waiting now for feedback from the FDA to have a VRBPAC (Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee) meeting and after that a potential authorization for our emergency use authorization,” he said. “In that way, the vaccine could be used and distributed in the United States,” he added, saying that authorization could come around 1-2 weeks after the VRBPAC meeting. Cané said that Pfizer had supply agreements in Chile, Mexico and Peru and that there were several other conversations ongoing, including in Argentina, where the government has said it could receive 750,000 doses of the vaccine by December. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE have reported final trial results showing the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns. Cané said Pfizer was ready to supply and distribute around 50 million doses of the vaccine, which requires ultra-low temperature storage, before the end of 2020, which would be split between the United States and the rest of the world. The firm was aiming to supply around 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, he said, adding the vaccine had shown high efficacy across different ethnicities. Regarding the need for ultra-low temperatures in the supply chain, which creates complications in less-developed regions, Cané said it was a matter of speed. A hardier second-generation version could be ready by 2022. “We know that it is complicated compared to other vaccines, but we are in the midst of a pandemic situation and we are trying to provide the more efficacious solution in the quickest manner,” he said. Countries around Latin America also have deals in place for vaccine doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, China’s Sinovac Biotech and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine."
-5.137172295622048," Fact check: Misleading comparison between COVID-19 mortality rate and vaccine efficiency Social media users have questioned why a COVID-19 vaccine found to be 90% efficient has been hailed as a breakthrough, when the disease itself has a survival rate of 99%. This comparison lacks context. “How are people ok with a 90% success rate for the Pfizer #vaccine but yet they’re not ok with a 99% survival rate for the virus? Make it make sense please”, posts shared on online read (here) (here) . It should firstly be noted that vaccine efficiency and the survival rate are two separate measures, and so are not directly comparable. The vaccine efficiency is the probability the vaccine will prevent someone from catching COVID-19, while the survival rate is the likelihood that someone who has already contracted the disease will survive. While the exact mortality rate of COVID-19 is still not known, a hypothetical rate of 1% would still result in a massive number of deaths if left to spread unchecked. Even with restrictions such as lockdowns, there have been so far been more than 1.3 million COVID-19 deaths recorded worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University (coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) . Alongside this, the post does not consider that the impact of COVID-19 extends beyond its death toll. “Some UK NHS trusts have around 30% of their beds taken up with COVID-19 patients, and there are around 30000 NHS staff off work due to a COVID-19 infection or self-isolating”, Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told Reuters via email. “Infection control takes up a huge amount of resource, wards have to be closed, and thus COVID-19 has a massive knock-on effect on other care, such as cancer, mental health or stroke patients”. There is also the impact of ‘long COVID’, an ongoing illness after contracting the coronavirus, which Head notes has been emerging as a “significant chronic burden” in the young and healthy or those who had a mild initial infection. Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, this does not make it an ineffective tool for controlling disease and preventing deaths. Flu vaccines, for instance, are between 40%-60% effective but help save lives. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that during the 2018-19 season, the vaccine prevented 3,500 influenza-associated deaths (here) . Head explains that, at time of writing, there are around 1.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in the UK (here) . “If there had hypothetically been a 90% effective vaccine available at the start of the year, then this would hypothetically reduce expected cases to around 150000”, Head said. “And going further, assuming a 99% survival and 1% death rate, then this would show 1500 deaths, rather than around 50000.” Missing context. A 90% efficiency rate for a vaccine would substantially reduce the spread and death toll from COVID-19. A 1% mortality rate, on the other hand, would still lead to a massive number of deaths if the disease was left to spread unchecked. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

Pfizer said it would apply to U.S. health regulators on Friday for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first such application in a major step toward providing protection against the new coronavirus. “Here in the UK, the first step for authorising a vaccine is for the government formally to ask the independent regulator..., the MHRA, to assess its suitability,” Hancock told reporters. “I can confirm that the government has formally asked the MHRA to assess the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for its suitability for authorisation.”"
-5.137172295622048," Exclusive: EU could pay over $10 billion for Pfizer and CureVac vaccines - source BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could pay more than $10 billion to secure hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine candidates being developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac, an EU official involved in the talks told Reuters. The bloc has agreed to pay 15.50 euros ($18.34) per dose for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, according to the official. That would mean an overall price of up to 3.1 billion euros ($3.7 billion) for 200 million doses, rising to 4.65 billion euros if another optional 100 million doses are purchased under the deal, the official said. The pricing information, previously undisclosed, confirms the EU is paying less per dose than the United States for an initial supply of that vaccine, as reported by Reuters last week. The deal includes an insurance for EU countries to get compensation if the companies divert doses to the United States, according to the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The EU has separately agreed to pay 10 euros ($11.84) per dose for an initial supply of 225 million doses of the vaccine candidate from CureVac, a discount from the 12 euros the company set as the price for the shot, the official said. The bloc struck the deal with CureVac this week to secure the supply of up to 405 million doses, of which 180 million are optional. The official said CureVac had committed to starting deliveries by the end of March. It is unclear whether the additional 180 million doses would cost 10 or 12 euros each. Under the 10-euro price, though, the bloc would pay 4.05 billion euros for 405 million doses. A spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, declined to comment on terms and pricing of vaccine contracts because they are confidential. Germany’s BioNTech and CureVac declined to comment. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said it and BioNTech were using a tiered pricing formula based on volume and delivery dates and that the EU deal represented the largest initial order of its vaccine candidate to date. “We are not disclosing further details of this agreement,” it added. Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday that final data showed their shot was 95% effective against COVID-19, and that they could start distributing shots before Christmas should they secure emergency authorisations.. In July the U.S. government agreed with Pfizer to pay $19.5 per dose for 100 million, with an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately. The lower price partly reflects the financial support given by the European Union to BioNTech for the drug’s development, a second EU official told Reuters last week. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac candidates are based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and designed to be administered in two doses. That means, for the EU’s Pfizer shot, it would cost 31 euros to inoculate one person. To secure the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the EU has made a non-refundable down payment. The amount has not been disclosed, but the official said the bloc had paid 700 million euros to the companies. The agreed price of 15.50 euros per dose would only be paid by those European governments willing to buy the shot, and only if it is approved by the EU regulator as safe and effective. In a sign of the global race to secure vaccines, the EU required Pfizer and BioNTech to accept a “breach of contract clause” if they diverted doses to the United States, the source said. In that eventuality, EU states would be reimbursed 50% of the money they had paid, the official said. This clause was requested by the EU, the official added, despite the companies planning to produce the doses for Europe in Belgium and Germany."

-3.8003320506505465," Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine deliveries could start 'before Christmas' (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech 22UAy.DE could secure emergency U.S. and European authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmakers said on Wednesday. The vaccine’s efficacy was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately hurt the elderly and certain groups including Black people. Tracking the vaccine race tmsnrt.rs/3nEc4Gz The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant emergency-use by the middle of December, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV. Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added. “If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,” he said. The success rate of the vaccine developed by the U.S. drugmaker and German partner BioNTech was far higher than what regulators had said would have been acceptable. Experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic. Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer’s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received a placebo and not the vaccine, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe COVID-19, one had received the vaccine. “A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,” said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. “Today is a special day.” BioNTech’s Sahin said U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) would be applied for on Friday. An FDA advisory committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10 to discuss the vaccine, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. The final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc MRNA.O on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness. “We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving its EUA, U.S. officials said, with states ready to begin distribution within 24 hours. The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life. The news was especially welcome with the virus again running rampant around the world, setting records for new infections and hospitalizations almost daily. The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over age 65, a particularly high-risk group. “This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,” said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool’s department of pharmacology. Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the soaring infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. Moderna shares fell 3.6%. Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future. Pfizer said it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country. On Wednesday, Pfizer said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses in the first half of 2021. It also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world. Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box. Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36°-46°F). Pfizer said vaccine was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue (3.8%) and headaches (2%) after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events. “These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,” said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge. Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it is on track to deliver data this year. Authorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under age 18 and as young as 12. Moderna and J&J have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger people soon."

On Wall Street, Pfizer Inc PFE.N shares gained 0.78% after the drugmaker said its COVID-19 vaccine was 95% effective and the company would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days. Pfizer's announcement came on the heels of a similar report from Moderna Inc MRNA.O on the effectiveness of its vaccine. Still, with many major equity indexes at or near record levels, analysts caution additional stimulus measures are needed to buttress the economy until a vaccine can be widely distributed, and gains evaporated late in the session. “It’s a confused market because portfolio managers don’t know which time period to focus on,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “It’s this trade-off between the near term over the six to nine months of continued spread of the virus and the period after that when everyone’s vaccinated and the virus is eradicated.” Underscoring the growing pandemic, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city’s school district, the largest in the country, will halt in-person learning on Thursday. Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said allowing the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending programs to sunset on Dec. 31 could pose risks to financial markets, especially as the pandemic is escalating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 344.93 points, or 1.16%, to 29,438.42, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 41.74 points, or 1.16%, to 3,567.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 97.74 points, or 0.82%, to 11,801.60. After a sluggish start, European shares closed higher as vaccine optimism and a round of takeover deals helped offset concerns over fresh lockdown measures to slow the spread of the virus in the region.

-3.810659699475226," U.S. dollar weakens for fifth day on vaccine optimism NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slipped for a fifth straight session on Wednesday, sliding to a more than one-week low, as positive vaccine news offset the surge in coronavirus cases and tighter economic restrictions across the United States and Europe. The market showed a little more appetite for risk-taking, with gains in currencies that rise in times of improving sentiment such as sterling, the New Zealand dollar, and Norwegian crown. Pfizer announced that the final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective, giving relief to a pandemic-weary market. That followed news that Moderna Inc released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing 94.5% effectiveness. That said, the number of reported global daily deaths from the coronavirus stood at 10,816 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest single-day death count. The United States, the worst-affected country worldwide, has reported about 11.38 million infections and 248,574 deaths since the pandemic started. “A spike in COVID cases is generally good for the dollar and other safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc, but the positive vaccine news roughly counters that,” said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The dollar as a safe haven is expected to weaken overall as global economies improve once the vaccine gets widely distributed. That said, TD Securities believes the dollar has further room to rally in the short term given that the market is overestimating the “timing and scalability” of vaccine distribution. In the latest research note, TD Securities senior FX strategist Mazen Issa recommended taking a defensive posture in the coming weeks, noting that “broad market optimism has overshot reality and that the good news related to the vaccine race is already in the price.” In afternoon trading, the dollar index slipped 0.1% to 92.312, after dropping to 92.207, its lowest since Nov. 9. Bitcoin, sometimes regarded as a safe haven, or at least a hedge against inflation, rose to more than $18,000 for the first time in nearly three years. It last stood around $17,590, down 0.4%. The euro was little changed on the day at $1.1864. On Wednesday, Poland and Hungary blocked the European Union’s 1.8 trillion-euro ($2.14 trillion) financial package to revive an economy depressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sterling, meanwhile, rose 0.2% versus the dollar to $1.3279 in the wake of a report from the Sun newspaper that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was told by British negotiators to expect a Brussels trade deal early next week, with “a possible landing zone” as soon as next Tuesday. The dollar though fell 0.3% against the yen to 103.865, with the Japanese currency recouping much of the losses it suffered last week after Pfizer announced it had developed a working COVID-19 vaccine."
-3.810659699475226," Pfizer offers Brazil deal for millions of vaccine doses BRASILIA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the first half of 2021, amid evidence the coronavirus is spreading more rapidly in South America’s largest country. “Pfizer made a proposal to the Brazilian government, in line with deals we closed in other countries - including in Latin America, that would permit the vaccination of millions of Brazilians in the first half, subject to regulatory approval,” the company said in a statement. Brazil has the third-worst outbreak of coronavirus in the world by number of cases, after the United States and India. On Tuesday, the Imperial College London released data showing that the rate of infection in Brazil had accelerated to 1.1, meaning every 100 people with coronavirus infect 110 people. That is the first time in weeks the figure has been above one. Brazil's Health Ministry said it met with Pfizer on Tuesday and would buy the vaccine if proven safe and if health regulator Anvisa registered it. The ministry said it will also meet this week with Johnson & Johnson J&J.N, India's Bharat Biotech and the makers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine as it draws up immunization plans. Anvisa has signed off on rules to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine approvals, according to a notice published in the government gazette on Wednesday. The new rules allow labs to present data to Anvisa continuously as it is generated rather than waiting for all documentation to be complete. Regulatory impact analyses and public consultations that are normally required will also be waived."
-3.810659699475226," Pfizer, Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be authorized for use within weeks: U.S. official (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc could be ready for U.S. authorization and distribution within weeks, setting the stage for inoculation to begin as soon as this year, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Wednesday. States and territories are prepared to begin distributing the vaccines within 24 hours of receiving regulatory authorization, officials said on a call with reporters, adding that complex cold storage requirements will not be an impediment to all Americans being able to access the vaccines. “We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,” Azar said during his briefing on the government’s Operation Warp Speed program for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Around 40 million doses of the two vaccines, both of which require two shots about four weeks apart, will be available by the end of the year, officials said. The companies will be able to produce more than 40 million doses a month for Americans every month thereafter, they added. The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving an emergency use authorization (EUA). Full formal approval is likely to follow the EUAs by around three months, they said. In addition, U.S. officials said two more vaccines will likely have early data ready within the coming weeks. U.S. COVID-19 vaccine program head Moncef Slaoui said there will not be any constraints on who gets what vaccine. Government officials and private companies are ready to distribute the vaccines - both were about 95% effective in major trials - to all parts of the country, he said. Much of the actual vaccine distribution will be overseen by a team that will be put in place by President-elect Joe Biden, who is set to take office on Jan. 20."

Breakthrough vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna have yet to win final approval, but the drugmakers, their logistics and cargo providers are not waiting for a green light to activate freight plans. Air France-KLM, which has decades of experience shipping medicines and vaccines in temperature-controlled conditions, is preparing a test run in coming days to fly out dummy vaccine shipments from KLM’s Amsterdam-Schiphol hub. The task is complicated by the conditions required by the Pfizer and Moderna shots - with respective storage temperatures of minus 80 Celsius and minus 20C. “It’s going to be a major logistics challenge,” said Air France cargo chief Christophe Boucher, citing the “massive” volume of vaccines to be distributed globally. “Another difficulty is the temperature control,” Boucher said in an interview at Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport - where cargo specialists were preparing to load consignments of super-cooled rabies vaccines bound for Brazil. The COVID-19 airlift is being planned amid a partial shutdown of global air travel. Airlines have warned that travel curbs could hamper the effort, since around 45% of global cargo typically travels in passenger plane holds.

On Wall Street, Pfizer shares gained 2.14% after the drugmaker said its COVID-19 vaccine was 95% effective and the company would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days. Pfizer’s announcement came on the heels of a similar report from Moderna on the effectiveness of its vaccine. But the Dow showed a stronger move higher, as Boeing climbed 1.53% after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ended the flight ban on the planemaker’s 737 MAX jet. A better than expected earnings report from Target, up 1.5285%, also helped eased concerns about a slowing economy. “With earnings announcements coming in better than expected from the retail space and the positive news on Boeing, it should drive interest in cyclicals,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, New York. “It is sort of a mad rush because the thinking is that the economy is going to be in better shape six months to a year from now.” A report on U.S. homebuilding showed the housing market continues to be a bright spot even as other parts of the economy are showing signs of strain from rising coronavirus cases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96.17 points, or 0.32%, to 29,879.52, the S&P 500 gained 5.33 points, or 0.15%, to 3,614.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.45 points, or 0.1%, to 11,886.89. After a sluggish start, a round of takeover deals helped offset concerns over fresh lockdown measures in the region. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.41% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.19%. While the U.S. dollar moved off its earlier lows following the housing data, the greenback was still on pace for its fifth straight decline as the Pfizer news gave investors an appetite for some risk taking. The dollar index fell 0.167%, with the euro up 0.06% to $1.1868. The weaker dollar also helped lift sterling, along with hopes Britain will be able to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union before its departure from the EU’s customs union and single market in January. Sterling was last trading at $1.3305, up 0.48% on the day. The increased risk appetite on the vaccine news also helped oil prices advance, along with hopes OPEC and its allies will delay a planned increase in oil output. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 0.8652%, from 0.872% late on Tuesday as investors weighed the vaccine news against the ability of the economy to rebound amid rising cases. U.S. crude recently rose 0.82% to $41.77 per barrel and Brent was at $44.27, up 1.19% on the day. Safe haven gold, meanwhile, added 0.2% to $1,881.92 an ounce.

Pfizer said efficacy of the vaccine was consistent across age and ethnic groups, and that there were no major side effects, a sign that the immunization could be employed broadly around the world. The final analysis of the vaccine from U.S. company Pfizer and German partner BioNTech comes one week after initial results from the trial showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Dozens of drugmakers and research groups have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which has killed more than 1.3 million people, shuttered businesses and left millions out of work around the globe. Below are the main details of the vaccine and progress on supply deals and potential approvals: - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity. - mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. - The new technology has not been approved for any vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA. - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay. - BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last. - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July. - The European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday that Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted data from large-scale trial of their potential COVID-19 vaccine for the agency’s rolling review, but had not yet applied for approval. - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April. - Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month. - Trials are continuing globally in 154 locations, including in Germany, Japan, Brazil and in several locations within the United States in participants aged 12 years and older. The global Phase I/II/III trials enrolled about 44,000 volunteers.

Pfizer announced that the final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective. But that had little effect on the dollar amid concern more monetary stimulus is to be expected from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday there was “a long way to go” to economic recovery and a retail sales report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed spending decelerating. “Markets are mindful that the Fed is in play”, said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased 0.1% to 92.327 after dropping as low as 92.207, its lowest level since Nov. 9. Bitcoin, sometimes regarded as a safe haven, or at least a hedge against inflation, rose to more than $18,000 for the first time in nearly three years. It last stood around $18,200, up over 3%. The euro was rising about 0.1% at $1.186, apparently unconcerned that Poland and Hungary are blocking the European Union’s 1.8 trillion-euro ($2.14 trillion) financial package to revive an economy depressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. “It seems likely that in December ... the EU will accept a compromise on the breach of the rule of law so that both countries can then save face and still accept the EU budget and the recovery fund”, Commerzbank strategist Antje Praefcke said. “And all will live happily ever after – and therefore no reason to sell the euro.” Budapest and Warsaw vetoed the adoption of the 1.1 trillion- euro 2021-2027 EU budget and the 750 billion-euro recovery fund on Monday because the budget law included a clause that makes access to money conditional on respecting the rule of law. On the Brexit front, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said Britain hoped to get a Brexit trade deal but that the EU had to understand it was dealing with a sovereign nation. The statement came after the Sun newspaper reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was told by British negotiators to expect a Brussels trade deal early next week, with “a possible landing zone” as soon as next Tuesday. Sterling was rising about 0.2% to $1.3277, near peaks reached in early September. British inflation picked up by more than expected in October, pushed higher by prices for clothing and footwear and food as coronavirus restrictions tightened in much of the country. Amid the uncertainty over the global economic recovery, the safe-haven Japanese yen climbed to a one-week high. At 103.95 per dollar, the yen came back to its Nov. 9 levels, recouping much of the losses it suffered last week after Pfizer announced it had developed a working COVID-19 vaccine. China’s yuan held near a 29-month high against the dollar, finishing at its highest since June 26, 2018, despite dollar buying by major state-owned banks in what some traders suspected was an effort to slow the Chinese currency’s advance towards 6.5-per to the dollar.

-3.810659699475226," Q&A: Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race? (Reuters) - Drugmakers and research centers around the world are working on COVID-19 vaccines, with large global trials of several of the candidates involving tens of thousands of participants well underway. The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 1.34 million lives worldwide: Who is furthest along? U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX.O22UAy.DE released final late-stage trial data on Wednesday that showed their shot was 95% effective at stopping COVID-19, the highest efficacy rate so far. The companies are the first to publish final Phase III efficacy and safety data and plan to apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the United States within days. On Monday, another U.S. pharmaceutical company, Moderna Inc MRNA.O, released interim data showing that its vaccine worked in a large, late-stage clinical trial with a 94.5% efficacy rate. Interim late-stage trial results for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine published on Nov. 11 showed the shot is 92% effective. The next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N says it is on track to deliver data this year. What happens in these trials? The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot. What were pharma companies waiting for to release data? The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with the coronavirus, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data. Early in the trials, infection rates were low. With a surge in infections around the globe in October and November, trial participants became infected more quickly. Pfizer’s final results were based on 170 cases within its trial involving more than 43,000 participants. Moderna conducted its interim analysis after 95 participants developed COVID-19 while Russia’s examination was conducted after 20 volunteers developed the disease. AstraZeneca said two weeks ago that a slowdown in infections during the summer is delaying data analysis for its UK trial. How well are the vaccines supposed to work? The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy in trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants at least 50% - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The European Medicines Agency has said it may accept a lower efficacy level. When will regulators rule on safety and efficacy? Pfizer/BioNTech plan to submit an EUA application in the United States within days. Moderna aims to file an application in the coming weeks once it has the two months of safety data on half the trial participants, as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That should happen in the second half of November. That means an FDA decision is unlikely before December. Regulators for Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada are considering data as it becomes available. It is not clear when companies will submit efficacy data or when the agencies would make a decision. Could these be the first widely available coronavirus vaccines? Yes, although China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people. At least four Chinese vaccines are far along including those from China National Biotec Group [CHNAPF.UL] (CNBG), CanSino Biologics 6185.HK and Sinovac Biotech SVA.O. Sinovac said on Wednesday mid-stage trial results showed its CoronaVac vaccine triggered a quick immune response but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the disease. CNBG has said to expects early trial data as soon as November. Russia has also given the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute to 10,000 members of the general population considered at high risk of contracting the virus."

-3.810659699475226," Airlines scramble to prepare for ultra-cold COVID-19 vaccine distribution PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airlines are scrambling to prepare ultra-cold shipping and storage facilities to transport COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna, whose doses, which require deep freezing, are likely to be among the first to be distributed. A recent survey by an air cargo association and a drug shippers' group found only 15% of industry participants felt ready to transport goods near the minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94°F) required by the Pfizer Inc PFE.N vaccine, while around 60% could meet Moderna Inc's MRNA.O less stringent -20°C requirement. Typically, airlines use containers with cooling materials such as dry ice to transport pharmaceutical products, but some don’t have temperature controls, making products susceptible to unforeseen events such as flight delays. Airlines are now considering options ranging from a large plug-in freezer that can cost about as much as a small car to a multi-layered canister that uses liquid nitrogen to ship vaccines requiring a deep freeze. The potential demand for such high-end packaging has helped shares of cold container specialists such as Cryoport Inc CYRX.O and Germany-based va-Q-tec VQTG.DE more than double in recent months. ""With direct contracts with five temperature-controlled container manufacturers, Korean Air has secured sufficient quantities of containers. For now, we are in the process of signing contracts with other container manufacturers,"" a Korean Air 003490.KS spokesperson said. Air France-KLM AIRF.PA said it was gearing up for a test run with one of the drugmakers - it declined to say which - that will see dummy samples shipped at ultra-low temperatures, likely via Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. The drill will use boxes carrying as many as 5,000 doses each, all cooled by dry ice, Air France-KLM special cargo manager Béatrice Delpuech told Reuters. Later shipments may also use larger ultra-cold containers rented from va-Q-tec. “They need to validate the entire logistics chain from end to end, including the air freight segment,” Delpuech said. “We have a dedicated task force examining every step of the process with all our teams, to make sure there are no hitches anywhere.” But one difficulty with vaccine transport is that airplanes can only carry a limited amount of dry ice - frozen carbon dioxide - as it turns into gas over time, displacing the breathable air in the cabin. All widebody planes can carry a maximum of around 1 tonne of dry ice in refrigerated and insulated containers, according to a DHL white paper on vaccine transport. “Depending on the type of aircraft, there are usually not more than a few containers on board at the same time,” said Joachim von Winning, chief executive of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt. For an alternative, Deutsche Post AG's DPWGn.DE DHL has been using Cyroport's capsule containers, which use liquid nitrogen to keep goods as cool as -150C for up to 10 days to support clinical vaccine trials, said Patricia Cole, DHL Global Forwarding's global head of temperature management solutions. Although it is relatively a small-scale solution, with only hundreds of vials in each container, broader preparations have already begun. Pfizer, which is working with DHL, FedEx Corp FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N for vaccine distribution in the United States, said on Monday it has launched a pilot delivery programme in four states to help it refine its nationwide and global shipping plan. The U.S. drugmaker has also developed temperature-controlled and GPS-enabled boxes that use dry ice to keep its vaccine at around -70C for up to 10 days. But cold-chain solutions providers such as Sweden’s Envirotainer say so-called active containers, which use electric motors to cool their contents, are safer and more cost-effective. A Envirotainer spokesman said that its fleet of active temperature-controlled containers was twice that of its competitors and that it was preparing to increase its capacity by 50%. Va-Q-tec also said this month that it would significantly expand its container fleet over the coming months in anticipation of orders COVID-19 vaccine transport. Airlines have become more reliant on cargo for revenue this year as passenger numbers plunged amid pandemic-related travel restrictions. Accenture’s Seabury Consulting estimates the global roll-out of a vaccine will generate 65,000 tonnes of air freight, which is five times the air vaccine trade in 2019. But airlines think the potential for the vaccine to allow a return to normal travel is most important, KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event on Nov. 11. “I think overall for the entire industry, the vaccine is going to be much more important than the cargo revenues it would bring,” he said."

The MSCI World index was up 0.1% at 1013 GMT, just shy of the previous session’s record high. After opening lower, European shares crawled back into the black, with the STOXX 600 index up 0.3%, tracking overnight gains in Asia where China stimulus hopes helped MSCI’s broadest regional gauge rise 0.7%. U.S. stock futures also pointed to firmer open on Wall Street, up 0.2%, after soft U.S. retail sales data, a rise in COVID-19 cases and uncertainty over fresh stimulus measures in the world’s largest economy had sapped sentiment. While the release of two successful coronavirus vaccine trial data over the last week had buoyed markets, the still-high infection rate globally had acted to trim gains, said Jane Shoemake, London-based fund manager at Janus Henderson. “People can see light at the end of the tunnel now and the markets clearly responded to that, but it’s not going to go up in a straight line because we’ve still got to get through the winter... (and) that is going to continue to temper some of the exuberance people feel.” Concern about the still-high infection rate in the United States acted to crimp dollar demand, with the greenback sliding against a basket of currencies to its lowest since Nov. 9. That had followed weak retail sales data overnight and comes as hopes for fresh U.S. stimulus remain hampered by political gridlock, pinning near-term hopes on action from the U.S. central bank. Strong corporate earnings in the third quarter also continued to underpin the positive stock market sentiment, said analysts at Barclays, with firms “confident on the outlook and in control of costs”, they said in a note to clients. “This reinforces the case for a strong earnings rebound and pick-up in corporate activity in 2021, as the cyclical recovery unfolds.” Cormac Weldon, Head of U.S. Equities at UK asset manager Artemis said while the overall picture for investors was brighter, the recovery was likely to be uneven. “Low inventories and the need to manufacture and distribute goods are likely to be the first drivers of the recovery, with the re-emergence of consumer demand adding a powerful second phase.” With stocks still well supported, other risk markets also took heart, with U.S. crude futures and Brent crude futures both up just over 1%, bolstered by hopes OPEC will delay a planned increase in production. Safe haven gold, meanwhile, was down 0.3% at $1,872.6 an ounce, with U.S. gold futures also slightly lower. In Europe’s debt markets, Germany saw its benchmark 10-year government bond yield fall to its lowest since Pfizer announced its COVID-19 vaccine update a week and a half ago. “Yields continue to grind lower as more warning signs flash about the near-term outlook,” said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING. “Euro zone spreads appear to have eyes only for QE (quantitative easing), shrugging off volatility and EU setbacks,” he said, referring to news this week that Hungary and Poland have blocked the adoption of the 2021-2027 budget and recovery fund by European Union governments."
-3.810659699475226," Column: Vaccine trials temper hedge funds' oil pessimism LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds raced to buy back short positions in crude and products last week after Pfizer’s announcement of a successful coronavirus vaccine trial prompted hope for a recovery in consumption next year. Fund managers purchased the equivalent of 114 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts in the week to Nov. 10, position records from regulators and exchanges showed. Purchases were at the fastest rate since the middle of April, when Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to end their volume war, causing funds to buy 122 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/3f8LIJE). For the most part, portfolio managers last week purchased crude and products to close out previous bearish short positions (+89 million barrels) rather than initiating new bullish long positions (+25 million). Buying was broadly spread across Brent (+36 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (+23 million), U.S. gasoline (+18 million), U.S. diesel (+15 million) and European gasoil (+22 million). In almost all cases, except U.S. gasoline, buying was concentrated on repurchasing of previous short positions rather than opening new long ones. Pfizer’s announcement increased the probability of a business cycle upturn and a resumption of international passenger aviation next year, weighted towards the second half. It therefore eased some of the extreme pessimism that had swept across the market in the second half of October and early November, as the number of coronavirus cases accelerated worldwide. Even after the short-covering rally, however fund positioning remained cautious, reflecting concern about the time it will take to deploy a vaccine and the possibility for a virus-driven winter recession in the meantime.

-3.810659699475226," Yen claws back ground as looming winter chills vaccine cheer SYDNEY (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen sat near a one-week high and a steady U.S. dollar held commodity currencies in check on Wednesday, as worries about rising coronavirus cases tempered optimism around promising vaccine trials. At 104.14 per dollar, the yen has recouped more than half of the steep losses it suffered last week after Pfizer announced it had developed a working COVID-19 vaccine. Bitcoin, sometimes regarded as a haven asset or at least a hedge against inflation, has surged to a three-year high against the dollar and the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were a fraction softer, along with stocks. “The slight cooling of equity sentiment has put a cap on currencies,” said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer. “We know we’ve got a vaccine. Now it’s about distribution and how quickly it can start to make a difference, which is going to be quite a few months away.” Before then, a tough winter looms. Surging cases have driven record hospitalisations and fresh restrictions on gathering in the United States, while new outbreaks vex authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that there was “a long way to go” to economic recovery. The Australian dollar slipped 0.3% on Tuesday and was a shade weaker still on Wednesday at $0.7288. The New Zealand dollar was 0.1% softer at $0.6889. The euro was steady at $1.1862 and against a basket of currencies the dollar held at 92.439 - a little softer than earlier in the week as a slight bond rally has knocked the shine off U.S. Treasury yields. “It’s back to pondering short-term negatives vs longer-term vaccine positives, and that’s creating volatility,” ANZ analysts said in a note. “Vaccine deployment isn’t an immediate fix ... expect things to remain mixed and messy.” Elsewhere sterling edged higher as traders hoped for a Brexit trade deal breakthrough. Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson to expect a Brussels trade deal “early next week”, The Sun newspaper reported, with “a possible landing zone” as soon as next Tuesday. As soft economic data in the United States weighed on dollar sentiment, strong industrial output in China kept the yuan’s barnstorming run alive, sending it to an almost 29-month high of 6.5457 per dollar in offshore trade. The Chinese yuan has gained nearly 9% against the dollar since late May, despite the central bank taking various actions to temper its strength. Later on Wednesday British inflation figures are due and several U.S. Fed members make speeches. In emerging markets, focus is on a Bank of Thailand meeting, though most economists expect rates to be kept on hold."
-3.810659699475226," Brazil to receive China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, eyes Pfizer candidate BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Sao Paulo state is set to begin importing the first of 46 million doses of China’s Sinovac vaccine against COVID-19 this week, while the federal government takes a more cautious approach with a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. Federal health officials met with Pfizer representatives on Tuesday as Brazil seeks to secure vaccine supplies. The Health Ministry said in a statement that it would buy the Pfizer vaccine, currently in Phase 3 trials, if it was proven safe and was registered with health authority Anvisa. As it draws up immunization plans, the ministry will also meet this week with Johnson & Johnson, India’s Bharat Biotech and the makers of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Brazil has the third-highest coronavirus case count in the world, leading many pharmaceutical companies to do trials of their vaccines in South America’s largest country. State health authorities have taken a more aggressive stance than their federal counterparts on securing vaccine supplies. The director of Sao Paulo state’s Butantan Institute biomedical center, Dimas Covas, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that Butantan expected to have 46 million doses of Sinovac ready in January to be used if approved by Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa. Butantan is organizing the Phase 3 trials of the vaccine in Brazil, with Covas saying preliminary results indicate it has an excellent safety profile. Covas said 10,000 volunteers had already received about 19,000 shots of the two-dose vaccine, and 2,000 other people had still to be included in the trials. Anvisa suspended the trials for a day and a half last week after the death of a volunteer, which police reported as a suicide and Butantan said had no relation to the vaccine. The temporary halt had no affect on the clinical trials, Covas said, adding that Butantan had a “very good understanding” with Anvisa. Butantan and Anvisa have sent experts to China where they are in a two-week quarantine before they can visit vaccine facilities, they said."

It may have been very important for the president but not for us,” Bourla said at New York Times event. “I didn’t receive any pressure per se on me to do something that was not appropriate ... I would never do something like that,” he said. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine was more than 90% effective at preventing COVID-19, based on an initial analysis. [L1N2HV0TR] Bourla had originally suggested the companies would have vaccine results by the end of October, but did not release the findings until Nov. 9, nearly a week after the election. U.S. President Donald Trump, who lost his re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden, had repeatedly assured the public that his administration would likely identify a successful vaccine in time for the election. The president later tweeted that Pfizer “didn’t have the courage to” announce its results before the election. Bourla also said the company has already hit the required safety milestone for the vaccine’s Phase III trial, which is two months of follow-up data from around half of the study’s roughly 44,000 participants. He said Pfizer is currently preparing that data for submission to health regulators."

It is the first timeline for distribution of a vaccine that Ottawa has provided since Pfizer Inc last week and Moderna on Monday reported that their inoculation candidates had been extremely effective in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Canada has signed agreements here for millions of doses of each of these potential vaccines, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said could start arriving in the country in the first quarter of next year for distribution to the highest risk and most vulnerable people. Canada's population is about 37.7 million, according to United Nations data. But Canada has five more agreements for potential vaccines, and those could also become available next year after regulatory approval, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Howard Njoo told reporters, adding that it was an optimistic projection. “If all goes well... we’ll have a suite of vaccines available, and if we get delivery of those vaccines, I certainly can anticipate that as the year goes on ... (Canadians) will be able to be vaccinated and have a large part of the population covered by the end of the year,” Njoo said. It may take longer for Canadians to get the vaccine than Americans. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said this week that he expects mass inoculations to occur in May and June. The Bank of Canada predicted last month, before Pfizer and Moderna preliminary test results were released, that “vaccines and effective treatments will be widely available by mid-2022”."
-2.1377547874290537," Pfizer to start pilot delivery program for its COVID-19 vaccine in four U.S. states (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N has launched a pilot delivery program for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in four U.S. states, as the U.S. drugmaker seeks to address distribution challenges facing its ultra-cold storage requirements. Pfizer’s vaccine, which was shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data, must be shipped and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46°F). “We are hopeful that results from this vaccine delivery pilot will serve as the model for other U.S. states and international governments, as they prepare to implement effective COVID-19 vaccine programs,” Pfizer said in a statement on Monday. It picked Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico, and Tennessee for the program after taking into account their differences in overall size, diversity of populations, immunization infrastructure, and need to reach individuals in varied urban and rural settings. The four states will not receive vaccine doses earlier than other states by virtue of the pilot, nor will they receive any differential consideration, Pfizer said. The company expects to have enough safety data on the vaccine from the ongoing large scale late-stage trials by the third week of November before proceeding to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA). Pfizer and its partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F have a $1.95 billion deal to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. government, which has an option to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses. Earlier on Monday, rival Moderna Inc MRNA.O said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, boosting hopes that vaccines against the disease may be ready for use soon. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA to activate the immune system against the virus."

Global stocks hit a new record high on Monday as positive data for a potential COVID-19 vaccine came from Moderna, following similarly upbeat data from rival Pfizer. Investors surveyed by BofA expect a “credible vaccine” by January. The euphoria sent investors’ cash levels down to 4.1% in November, from 4.4% last month, to pre-COVID-19 levels last seen in January, according to the survey of 190 fund managers with $526 billion in assets under management. With global economic growth and profit expectations running at a 20-year high among the investors surveyed, the “reopening rotation” into oversold business sectors is likely to continue in the fourth quarter, BofA said. But the bank advised clients: “We say ‘sell the vaccine’ in coming weeks/months as we think we’re close to ‘full bull’.” Meanwhile, in U.S. Treasuries, 73% of the investors surveyed were expecting steeper yield curves -- rates on longer-term U.S. Treasury securities rising faster than short-term rates. Expectations were far higher than after the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy, 2013 taper tantrum and 2016 elections. For 2021, investors named ""long"" emerging market assets, S&P 500 .SPX and oil as their favourite trades. Nearly half of the investors surveyed by BofA said they expect emerging markets to outperform in 2021. (Graphic: Global stocks: )"
-2.1377547874290537," We can stop COVID-19: Moderna vaccine success gives world more hope (Reuters) - Moderna Inc's MRNA.O experimental vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, the company said on Monday, becoming the second U.S. drugmaker to report results that far exceed expectations. Together with Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine, which is also more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available this year. The vaccines, both developed with new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), represent powerful tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million. Unlike Pfizer’s vaccine, Moderna’s shot can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, which should make it easier to distribute, a critical factor as COVID-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns. “We are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview. Moderna’s interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received the vaccine or a placebo. Only five infections occurred in volunteers who received the vaccine mRNA-1273, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart. “The vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert said. He urged Americans not to let their guard down and to continue washing hands and being vigilant about social distancing. Even with fast authorization, the vaccines will not come in time for most people celebrating the U.S. Thanksgiving and end-of-year holidays, when families and friends come together - just the types of gatherings public health officials warn against. Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and expects to file for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the coming weeks. The company's shares, which have more than quadrupled this year, jumped 8%, while European and U.S. stocks rose. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX rose 1%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX climbed 1.3%. [MKTS/GLOB] Shares in Pfizer and its partner BioNTech BNTX.O, whose vaccine must be transported at far colder temperatures, fell 4.3% and 16.4% respectively, while Britain's AstraZeneca AZN.L, which has yet to release any results from its late-stage vaccine trials, was down 1%. (For graphic on U.S. biotech shares: ) Moderna’s data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and attacks. Moderna expects the vaccine to be stable at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C. Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at -70C, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. It can be stored for up to five days at standard refrigerator temperatures, or for up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box. The data from Moderna’s trial involving 30,000 volunteers also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe COVID-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna’s trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo. Moderna, part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce about 20 million doses for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made and is ready to ship if it gets FDA authorization. “Assuming we get an emergency use authorization, we’ll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,” Hoge said. “So it could start being distributed instantly.” The 95 cases of COVID-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups. “We will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress, said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The trials were designed to measure whether the vaccines stop people from getting sick rather than whether they prevent transmission, which remains to be tested. “It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don’t yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, Moderna said. “These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,” said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London. The U.S. government, faced with the world’s highest known number of COVID-19 cases, could have access next year to more than 1 billion doses from Moderna and Pfizer, more than needed for the country’s 330 million residents. The Trump Administration has mainly relied on the development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The government has an option for another 400 million doses. The company hopes to produce between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites, depending in part on demand. Europe's health regulator said on Monday it had launched a real-time ""rolling review"" of Moderna's vaccine, as it has done for vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca AZN.L. Brussels also said it was in talks with Moderna about securing doses. Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations. Russia licensed its Sputnik-V COVID-19 vaccine for domestic use in August before it started large-scale trials. It said on Nov. 11 that its vaccine was 92% effective based on 20 infections in its large trial."

-2.1377547874290537," Factbox: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine stability eases distribution challenges (Reuters) - Moderna Inc's MRNA.O experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more stable than expected at temperatures that ordinary refrigerators can provide and can be distributed using existing cold-chain shipping and storage infrastructure. That opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage. Here are details of how it could be distributed. Moderna’s vaccine is stable for up to six months at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), about home freezer levels, when shipped and stored. The company said it expects the vaccine to be stable when kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days, up from an initial projection of 7 days. The vaccine will be distributed in 10-dose vials and can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours after thawing. By comparison, Pfizer’s vaccine can be transported and stored for up to 6 months at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). It can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days. Moderna’s vaccine will be distributed by the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program. U.S. health officials have said that at first they are most likely to distribute vaccines to healthcare workers, people who are in nursing homes, first responders and those with health conditions who are high-risk. Most Americans will be inoculated in May or June, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. Under Operation Warp Speed’s distribution plan, the first group of shots will likely be distributed to and administered in closed settings, like hospitals and nursing homes. After January, as supply increases, those shots will start to be available in pharmacies, doctors offices and clinics as well as mobile clinics, the plan shows. Health officials have said it will be easier to use Moderna’s vaccine in these settings than Pfizer’s. Moderna on Monday said its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 based on early results from large studies. That is similar to Pfizer’s which the U.S. drugmaker has said is more than 90% effective. Moderna data also showed the vaccine was capable of helping prevent severe cases of COVID-19, and it represented volunteers from diverse communities."

-0.9884290705080141," Breakthrough COVID vaccine tech could help defeat other diseases ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Breakthrough technology that transforms the body into a virus-zapping vaccine factory is poised to revolutionise the fight against COVID-19 but future pandemics and even cancer could be next, scientists say. The initial success of so-called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines in late-stage trials by Moderna as well as Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech is the first proof the concept works. Both experimental vaccines had efficacy rates above 90% based on interim findings, which was far higher than expected and well above the 50% threshold U.S. regulators insist upon for vaccines. Now scientists say the technology, a slow-motion revolution in the making since the discovery of mRNA nearly 60 years ago, could speed up the development of new vaccines. The traditional method of creating vaccines – introducing a weakened or dead virus, or a piece of one, to stimulate the body’s immune system – takes over a decade on average, according to a 2013 study. One pandemic flu vaccine took over eight years while a hepatitis B vaccine was nearly 18 years in the making. Moderna’s vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days. With BioNTech and Pfizer’s COVID-19 candidate on a similar trajectory, both could win regulatory approval this year, barely 12 months since the coronavirus first emerged. Other companies are pursuing the technology such as Germany’s CureVac also has an mRNA vaccine candidate, though has yet to start a late-stage trial and is hoping it will get the green light after July 2021. “We’ll look back on the advances made in 2020 and say: ‘That was a moment when science really did make a leap forward’,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, which is backed by the Wellcome Trust. Discovered in 1961, mRNA carries messages from the body’s DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes like digestion or fighting disease. The experimental vaccines from Moderna as well as Pfizer and BioNTech use lab-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus’s spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus.Back in 1990, scientists managed to get mice to generate proteins by injecting mRNA, an early sign of the technology’s potential. But early proponents such as Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian-born scientist and senior vice president at BioNTech, were hampered by obstacles such as mRNA’s instability in the body and its propensity to cause inflammatory responses. A breakthrough came around 2005 when Kariko, along with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, figured out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive. Still, it took another 15 years - and a pandemic that brought the world’s economy to its knees - to reach the cusp of success. Kariko said her years of dogged pursuit once made her the butt of jokes for some university colleagues. “The last time they laughed at me and ridiculed me was when they learned that I was going to join BioNTech seven years ago and they realised this company (didn’t) even have a website,” she told Reuters. “But now, they learn of BioNTech and that we can do good things.” Kariko said her life’s work could pay dividends, not just against COVID-19, but other diseases. “It could be easier sailing for the next anti-viral product, a vaccine for influenza and other infectious disease,” said Kariko, whose daughter is a U.S. Olympic gold medalist rower. Moderna and BioNTech, for example, are also applying mRNA technology to experimental cancer medicines. Biontech is testing an anti-melanoma mRNA with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche in a Phase II trial. Among Moderna’s most advanced projects, besides its COVID-19 vaccine, are mRNA compounds to treat ovarian cancer or Myocardial ischemia, which are also in the second test phase. None of the potential mRNA cancer therapies have reached the critical large-scale Phase III trials, however, and Kariko acknowledges that cancer presents a bigger challenge. While a virus is a foreign intruder, cancer cells, however malignant, come from within the body, making them tougher to seek out and expose so they can be attacked. “Sometimes cancer is just caused by gene and chromosome duplication and then everything about it looks normal and the cell is just dividing more than it should,” she said. For vaccines against infectious diseases, the pharmaceutical industry’s traditional approach has been to whip them up in large bioreactors, a time-consuming, expensive process in facilities that can cost up to $700 million to build. By contrast, Zoltan Kis, an Imperial College London researcher who models vaccine manufacturing, estimates that one five-litre bioreactor inside a $20 million facility could make a billion doses of some kinds of mRNA vaccines a year. Drug manufacturer Lonza, enlisted to make ingredients for 400 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine annually at U.S. and Swiss sites, is due to start production this year with manufacturing lines costing $60 million to $70 million each. “We are producing mRNA at smaller scales and in smaller facilities when compared to traditional larger-scale equipment and facilities,” Andre Goerke, Lonza’s global lead for the Moderna project, told Reuters. “The manufacturing ramp-up is quicker and more economical.” ‘ULTRA-FAST RESPONSE’ Raymond Schiffelers, of University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who heads a European Union programme for mRNA therapeutics, said the major advantage of the technology was that vaccine developers could mount an “ultra-fast response”. “Within weeks, testing can start, a major advantage over conventional vaccines,” he said. The moment a pathogen’s genomic sequence is known, synthetic mRNAs can be designed that encode key parts of the virus, such as the coronavirus’s potentially lethal spike protein. Risks and challenges for mRNA remain. Some candidates must be stored at extremely cold temperatures, making delivery potentially difficult in countries with limited infrastructure. They also may be fragile to transport, Schiffelers said. BioNTech’s vaccine, for example, must be transported at minus 70 degrees Celsius, though Moderna said on Monday it can ship its candidate in normal refrigerators. Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), which funded Moderna’s vaccine development, also said mRNA vaccines may not be a silver bullet for flu, since it mutates so swiftly that reaching 90% efficacy is unlikely. But for COVID-19, Collins said mRNA is likely to be a revolution. “It’s clearly several months faster than any of the other methods,” Collins said. “In a crisis moment, several months really matter.”"

Moderna said on Monday its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second developer to report results that far exceeded expectations, after Pfizer and BioNTech said last week their vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The EU has been in talks with Moderna for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine at least since July, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows. Reuters first reported the negotiations in July. A deal might be reached in the coming days, the senior official involved in the talks said, adding that discussions were mostly focusing on the legal wording of the contract, but faced no major hurdles on issues such as price or liability. The price being negotiated was below $25 per dose, said the official, who declined to be more specific and asked for anonymity as the talks were confidential. Moderna was not immediately available to comment. The United States paid Moderna $15 per dose to secure 100 million vaccines in a $1.5 billion deal in August. That was on top of $1 billion in funding for Moderna’s vaccine, effectively bringing the combined price to $25, according to the publicly released terms of the deal. Washington has an option to buy another 400 million doses for an undisclosed price. Moderna’s vaccine is administered with a two-shot course. NEW DEALS ‘COMING SOON’ EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on Twitter that Moderna’s results were “encouraging” and that new EU deals with vaccine makers were to “come soon”. “Negotiations with the company are ongoing. We have not yet concluded or signed a contract,” Kyriakides told EU lawmakers in a regular hearing on Monday. A spokesman for the Commission did not respond to questions on price and the timing of a possible deal with Moderna. On Aug. 24 the Commission, which conducts talks with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, said preliminary talks with Moderna had been concluded with the aim of signing a contract for the supply of 80 million doses of its vaccine, with the option of buying another 80 million. Last week, the Commission reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech on the supply of their potential COVID-19 vaccine hours after the companies announced their positive results, EU officials said, adding that the timing was a coincidence. The formal signing of that contract is expected later this week. An official told Reuters the EU had agreed to pay less than $19.50 per shot to Pfizer and BioNTech, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug’s development. The EU has also struck supply deals with AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi for their experimental COVID-19 vaccines. It announced on Monday a new deal with German biotech firm CureVac .

-0.9884290705080141," Factbox: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine stability eases distribution challenges (Reuters) - Moderna Inc's MRNA.O experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more stable than expected at temperatures that ordinary refrigerators can provide and can be distributed using existing cold-chain shipping and storage infrastructure. That opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage. Here are details of how it could be distributed. Moderna’s vaccine is stable for up to six months at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), about home freezer levels, when shipped and stored. The company said it expects the vaccine to be stable when kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days, up from an initial projection of 7 days. The vaccine will be distributed in 10-dose vials and can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours after thawing. By comparison, Pfizer’s vaccine can be transported and stored for up to 6 months at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). It can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days. Moderna’s vaccine will be distributed by the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program. U.S. health officials have said that at first they are most likely to distribute vaccines to healthcare workers, people who are in nursing homes, first responders and those with health conditions who are high-risk. Most Americans will be inoculated in May or June, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. Under Operation Warp Speed’s distribution plan, the first group of shots will likely be distributed to and administered in closed settings, like hospitals and nursing homes. After January, as supply increases, those shots will start to be available in pharmacies, doctors offices and clinics as well as mobile clinics, the plan shows. Health officials have said it will be easier to use Moderna’s vaccine in these settings than Pfizer’s. Moderna on Monday said its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 based on early results from large studies. That is similar to Pfizer’s which the U.S. drugmaker has said is more than 90% effective. Moderna data also showed the vaccine was capable of helping prevent severe cases of COVID-19, and it represented volunteers from diverse communities."

-0.9884290705080141," Trump briefly admits election defeat, clings to flailing legal strategy WASHINGTON/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday briefly acknowledged losing the U.S. election in a morning Twitter post but then backtracked, saying he concedes “nothing” and vowing to keep up a court fight that election-law experts say is unlikely to succeed. President-elect Joe Biden focused on the coronavirus pandemic, setting meetings with vaccine developers as the crisis intensifies. The number of U.S. coronavirus cases passed 11 million on Sunday, a million more new cases than a week ago and the fastest increase since the pandemic began. Biden defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election by the same 306-232 margin in the state-by-state Electoral College that Trump proclaimed a “landslide” when he won it in 2016. The Democratic former vice president also won the national popular vote by at least 5.5 million votes, or 3.6 percentage points, with some ballots still being counted. Trump, pursuing long-shot litigation to contest election results in several states, made conflicting comments on Twitter. He initially appeared to admit for the first time publicly that Biden won, then reversed course. Trump also repeated unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud. “He won because the Election was Rigged,” Trump wrote, not referring to Biden by name, adding a list of complaints about vote counting. About 90 minutes later, Trump wrote: “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING!” After golfing at a club he owns in Virginia, Trump said on Twitter he would soon file “big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election.” Trump’s campaign has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results in multiple states, without success. Legal experts have said the Trump litigation stands little chance of altering the election’s outcome, and election officials of both parties have said there is no evidence of major irregularities. “Donald Trump’s Twitter feed doesn’t make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that,” Ron Klain, Biden’s choice as White House chief of staff, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” More than a week after Biden was declared the victor by major news organizations based on state-by-state vote counts, the General Services Administration still has not recognized him as president-elect, preventing his team from gaining access to government office space and funding normally afforded to an incoming administration to ensure a smooth transition. Without explicitly mentioning the transition, Trump praised the GSA administrator he appointed, Emily Murphy, writing on Twitter: “Great job Emily!” Klain said Murphy’s agency must formally recognize Biden, saying it is critical to ensure the president-elect receives intelligence briefings before taking office and to facilitate coordination with the White House coronavirus task force. Klain urged Congress to pass bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation by year’s end. Talks on such legislation have stalled. Some congressional Republicans and former members of Trump’s administration have also called on the White House to allow Biden’s transition team access to more information to prepare to govern. VACCINE CHALLENGE The health crisis will be a paramount concern for Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. Klain said Biden's scientific advisers would meet with Pfizer Inc PFE.N and other drugmakers starting this week to prepare for the ""giant logistical project"" of widespread vaccination against a virus that has killed more than 245,000 Americans and thrown millions more out of work. Pfizer said last week its vaccine candidate proved more than 90% effective in initial trials, giving hope that widespread vaccination in the coming months could help get the pandemic under control. Other companies also are in advanced stages of developing promising vaccines. “It’s great to have a vaccine, but vaccines don’t save lives. Vaccinations save lives,” Klain said. “And that means you’ve got to get that vaccine into people’s arms all over this country.” Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert and a White House task force member, underscored the importance of a smooth transition in pandemic control efforts. “It would be better if we could start working with them,” Fauci said of coordination between the existing task force and Biden’s team. Biden’s campaign said it had raised $10.5 million of its target of $30 million for a “Biden Fight Fund” aimed at election defense efforts, according to a fundraising plea sent on Sunday. A laborious hand recount is under way in Georgia, where Biden has been projected the winner and holds a lead of more than 14,000 votes. Patrick Moore, a Biden campaign legal adviser, said the recount had so far shifted vote totals “almost imperceptibly,” and in Biden’s favor, and there had been no evidence of widespread irregularities. Control of the U.S. Senate will be decided by two January runoff elections in Georgia, which will be important for the fate of Biden’s ambitious legislative agenda. Klain said Biden may campaign in Georgia ahead of the runoffs."
-4.212872974194019," U.S. states race to buy ultra cold vaccine freezers, fueling supply worries LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. states, cities, and hospitals are scrambling to buy ultra-cold freezers that can safely store Pfizer Inc's PFE.N COVID-19 vaccine, ignoring advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to hold off. The push reveals a lack of infrastructure to support a super cold vaccine campaign, including equipment to store millions of doses of Pfizer’s vaccine at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46°F). Some specialty freezer makers warn of months-long waits for units. It also marks widespread wariness of the advice from the CDC, which on Aug. 26 urged healthcare providers not to purchase ultra low temperature (ULT) freezers, saying it was working on solutions for Pfizer’s “very complex storage and handling requirements.” A CDC spokeswoman on Thursday said the agency expects the first vaccine doses will be in limited quantities and rapidly deployed, reducing the need to store them in specialized freezers. But the news on Monday that initial results from a pivotal trial of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F showed it to be more than 90% effective has turned attention to eventual shipping and storage logistics. That has thrown a spotlight on makers of the niche freezers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N, Luxembourg's B Medical Systems, Helmer Scientific and Stirling Ultracold, who are adding labor and expanding capacity. “I would estimate that a third of states are purchasing ultra cold storage equipment,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit representing state and local public health officials who handle vaccines. The specialized freezers required by Pfizer’s vaccine can cost $5,000 to $15,000. Moderna Inc MRNA.O is close to releasing efficacy results for its similar vaccine, which requires an easier to accommodate storage temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4°F). At least half a dozen states, including California, Rhode Island and New Mexico, said in published comments to the CDC that they expect to face challenges due to limited supplies of ULT freezers. A similar number told Reuters or said in public filings that they are purchasing units in anticipation of the vaccine rollout. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear on Thursday called for federal funding for cold storage and said he hopes other vaccines with less onerous storage requirements get approved. Earlier this year, due to lack of a coordinated federal response to the pandemic, states were forced to compete against each other for everything from protective N95 masks for healthcare workers to ventilators and testing equipment. While demand for ULT freezers is climbing, it has not entered the early pandemic’s ventilator panic phase where “we had lead times of 18 months,” said Rebecca Gayden, who oversees sourcing of freezers and other capital equipment at Vizient, a purchasing group used by more than 5,000 not-for-profit health systems and affiliates. Northwell Health, New York state’s largest hospital system, said it has leased around 20 ultra cold freezers for the Pfizer vaccine, and that manufacturers now had waiting lists. Thermo Fisher said it built up inventory ahead of demand, and is unaffected by capacity crunches. Some smaller manufacturers, however, acknowledged issues due to the surge in demand. Indiana-based Helmer Scientific said production of new orders has pushed into next year. Ohio's Stirling Ultracold, which sold a 6,000-dose portable, cooler-sized ULT to North Dakota as well as large freezers for United Parcel Service Inc's UPS.N freezer farms, said delivery waits could now extend up to two months. George Gerhardt, emergency preparedness program representative for North Dakota, where the virus is now running rampant, said his state started shopping for freezers this summer. “If we wait till the last day, everybody’s going to want one,” Gerhardt said at the time, before purchasing 10 ULT units. The Wyoming Department of Health was not so lucky. Its ULT freezer is on “back order” until late December, said public information officer Kim Deti. Cities and states are searching university labs, hospitals and other facilities for available ULT freezer space. Philadelphia is spending about $19,000 on two B Medical freezers scheduled to be installed later this month, and is working with local healthcare systems to secure additional capacity. Pfizer’s vaccine could get regulatory approval within weeks with distribution to begin almost immediately. It will be transported in dry ice-filled, suitcase-sized containers that can only be opened twice a day and last a maximum of two weeks. Dry ice has also been offered as a potential solution for nations without access to ULT storage in vaccination centers. “Waste is a major concern,” said Soumi Saha, vice president of advocacy at Premier Inc, which coordinates purchases for thousands of U.S. hospitals and health systems. “Do you turn a patient away because you can’t open it a third time that day?”"

Pfizer confirmed that it had finalised a critical supply agreement with Israel “that will provide the Israeli people with a COVID-19 vaccine once approved by regulatory authorities,” the company’s Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said. The deal needs approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Israel’s health ministry, Israeli officials say. Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Pfizer is expected to apply for approval at the end of November. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE's 22UAy.DE potential vaccine is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment, meaning that 8 million doses would cover 4 million of Israel's 9 million population. In televised remarks, Netanyahu said the supply agreement marked “a great day for Israel” and added: “The goal is for the vaccine supply to start in January and increase in the months thereafter”. Pfizer on Monday announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, a potential major victory in the war against a virus that has killed more than a million people and battered the world economy. In addition to its new deal with Pfizer, Israel has an agreement with Moderna Inc MRNA.O for the future purchase of its potential vaccine.

-4.212872974194019," Take Five: A shot in the arm (Reuters) - The world economic outlook is suddenly a little bit brighter after upbeat news on the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Hopes of a strong “V” or even a “U” -shaped recovery faded after a second wave of infections forced major economies to lock down again, setting them up for a double-dip “W” growth path. Upcoming readings on Chinese and U.S. industrial output will show whether a speedy economic rebound is still possible. But even if a vaccine rollout happens sooner than expected, pandemic damage won’t be easily undone. W, V, or whatever the shape of recovery, central bank stimulus will stay in place. Graphic: W-shape recovery? - After months of slumber, U.S. Treasury yields have sprung to life and Wednesday’s record-sized auction may show which way they might head. Pfizer’s encouraging update on its COVID-19 vaccine sent 10-year borrowing costs to the highest since March and drove the yield curve to its steepest in more than two years. Those moves have since been offset by the resurgent coronavirus and doubts the Federal Reserve will permit yields to rise too far. Demand at the Treasury’s Nov 12 sale of $27 billion in 30-year bonds was below this year’s average. Unexceptional results at the upcoming $27 billion in 20-year bonds could become another factor pushing yields higher.

On Thursday Nov 19, the central bank must show that its policymaking really has changed as much as President Tayyip Erdogan’s recent moves suggest. What it means is that new central bank chief Naci Agbal has no choice but to deliver what markets want -- a 400-575 basis points interest rate hike. Anything below 350 may seen as a cop-out. More importantly, any rate hike needs to stick -- and for that investors need to see proof Erdogan has overcome his oft-stated hostility to high borrowing costs.

With debt running at three times annual GDP, this market is prone to letting off steam. This time, as monetary reins tighten and the pandemic impact starts to show, companies such as property developer Evergrande and BMW’s state-backed parent Huachen Automotive Group are in the crosshairs. China's new 'three red lines' indebtedness rules may to a degree help alleviate solvency concerns. But the latest jitters and the extent of government support may give pause to investors thronging to the world's second-biggest bond market.

But the U.S. Q3 profit drop is expected at just 7.8%. That’s because of the larger European exposure to cyclical sectors such as travel or luxury or banks, which are more closely tied to the state of the economy. The upside is that a credible vaccine could help Europe Inc roar ahead. Indeed, recent vaccine news induced investors to up forecasts for Europe to 30% for the first 2021 quarter -- double the S&P500's rate. Graphic: Europe vs U.S. earnings -"
-4.212872974194019," Switzerland starts 'rolling review' of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland has begun a rolling review of Moderna's MRNA.O, COVID-19 vaccine candidate so it can give it a speedy approval should it pass muster in clinical trials, the country's drug regulator said on Friday. Regulator Swissmedic is already scrutinizing the progress of experimental vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca AZN.L as well as Pfizer PFE.N and BioNTech SE BNTX.O in similar rolling reviews. So-called rolling reviews allow drug companies to submit applications for COVID-19 medicinal products before development work is concluded and prior to the availability of complete supporting documentation. U.S. drugmaker Moderna said this week that it has enough data for a first interim analysis of its late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial, raising hopes that initial results will be released soon. Interim trial data from Pfizer and BioNTech released on Monday indicated that its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. “Swissmedic can thus obtain an initial picture of the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine candidates before the authorisation studies are completed,” Swissmedic said in a statement about the rolling review. “This accelerates the review process while at the same time preserving the same level of careful checking of all requirements relating to safety, efficacy and quality.” As part of the review, Swissmedic said it was working with other drug regulators around the world. Switzerland has already set aside 400 million Swiss francs ($437 million) to buy COVID-19 vaccines and reserved a total of about 16 million doses of the shots being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech."

The GAVI alliance said on Friday that the funds for an advance market commitment (AMC) will allow the COVAX facility to buy an initial one billion vaccine doses for 92 eligible countries which would not otherwise be able to afford them. “We’ve seen sovereign and private donors from across the world dig deep and meet this target and help ensure that every country will get access to COVID vaccines, not just the wealthy few,” GAVI chief Seth Berkley told reporters, adding that there was an “urgent need” to also finance treatments and diagnostics. The European Commission, France, Spain, South Korea, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and others had in recent weeks pledged another $360 million to the AMC, the alliance said, bringing total funding over the $2 billion target for this year. Another $5 billion will be needed in 2021 to procure COVID-19 vaccine doses as they come through development and are approved by regulators, GAVI said in a statement. Berkley also welcomed the U.S. presidential election outcome, adding he expected to have talks with president-elect Joe Biden’s team about the COVAX plan. “It’s positive that the incoming administration has already established a COVID-19 task force filled with many scientists we know are believers in science and moving this forward,” he said. “The U.S. is already one of GAVI’s biggest supporters, they care enormously about vaccines for the developing world. And I suspect that we will have continuing conversations about how we can collaborate with them,” he added. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer PFE.N and its partner BioNTech 22UAy.DE, who this week said their experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 90% effective in initial trials, had expressed an interest in supplying doses to the COVAX facility, Berkley said. “We continue to advance negotiations with a number of manufacturers in addition to those we’ve already announced who share our vision of fair and equitable distribution of vaccines,” he added. Berkley said $5.3 billion was also still needed for diagnostics and $6.1 billion for therapeutics by the end of 2021.

-4.212872974194019," Give me a W, V, and a K: describing the post-COVID economic outlook LONDON (Reuters) - What appeared to be a sharp V-shaped growth rebound from the first pandemic lockdown, now seems like a “W” -- these are among the myriad of letters and signs economists are using to describe the outlook for a world turned upside down by COVID-19. Global coronavirus cases now exceed 50 million but encouraging news on Pfizer’s experimental vaccine could be a game-changer for world growth. Here are some shapes being used to describe the outlook during extraordinary times. 1. “W” A growth double-dip is viewed as the likely scenario for major economies such as the United States and Europe, many of which are facing another coronavirus wave and activity curbs. That trajectory is captured by a “W”, largely replacing the “U” shaped rebound projected by some earlier this year. For instance, a euro zone Q3 economic bounce caused by economies reopening from the first set of lockdowns, is expected to turn into another contraction in the fourth quarter. But the second leg of the double-dip should be shallower than the first because restrictions are less harsh, while consumers and firms are better prepared.

And a “V” trajectory remains the base case for Asia, which has not been hit as hard by a coronavirus second wave. China will be the only major economy to expand this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, which expects 1.9% growth in 2020 and 8.2% in 2021. For an interactive version of the graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs/3k8nzUo. 3. Square root “√” The mathematical square root sign conveys a dip, followed by a recovery, which then flatlines. More bullish than the double-dip W-shape, but less bullish than a V, the square root is meant to illustrate that while renewed lockdowns will limit growth they won’t necessarily result in a further growth decline. “We’ve been trying to go with more the square root, or in golfing there’s a term called the ‘dogleg’ which seems appropriate – which is more that it goes down, and then up, and then tapers off,” said Wells Fargo Asset Management senior investment strategist Brian Jacobsen. Square root shape recovery for UK 4. Greek “μ” If euro zone growth contracts less severely than feared, the path could take the shape of the Greek letter “μ” -- an outlook that is slightly less harsh than the double dip captured by a “W”. The economy expanded 12.7% in the July-September period, after contracting 11.8% in the previous quarter. This bigger-than-anticipated bounce should lift average 2020 and 2021 growth, blurring the impact of any fourth-quarter contraction. Gilles Moec, chief economist at Axa Investment Managers, expects a 4-5% shock to Q4 zone GDP, bringing this year’s overall decline to around 8%. “But it would still be a very special form of “W” trajectory, since the second leg would be significantly shallower than the first one,” Moec said. “The best analogy we would find is with the Greek letter μ.” Euro area GDP in a 'μ' shape 5. “K” Another shape under consideration is “K” in which sectors take divergent paths. In this scenario, some businesses such as manufacturing bounce back sharply as restrictions ease, while others such as services sector firms struggle until a vaccine is rolled out. “I increasingly like this to describe the outlook... it means there will be sectors that thrive from the lockdown and those that are under pressure for instance travel, leisure, and aviation,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro for ING Research.

-4.212872974194019," Global stocks flatline, bond yields slide as caution replaces vaccine euphoria LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares flat-lined on Friday as rising U.S. and European COVID-19 hospitalisations tempered the euphoria over a promising vaccine, though Wall Street looked set for a firmer open on news president-elect Joe Biden was set to cement his election win. U.S. futures rose 0.5% by 0.830 GMT after Edison Research projected Biden to capture the battleground state of Arizona, further weakening President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election. However, the pan-European Stoxx 50 was down 0.2%, just above its opening levels. MSCI’s all-country equity index slipped 0.1% “You had the news overnight in the U.S. on COVID, which is not that good and that ... provides an opportunity for investors to book some profit post-Pfizer and post-U.S. elections,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. Thursday saw Wall Street end lower on news of rising coronavirus infections and as investors weighed up the schedule for rolling out effective vaccine. Several U.S. states have introduced stricter social distancing rules following reports of record hospitalisations In Europe, too, the number of hospitalisations are now higher than at the peak of the first wave and officials said measures to control infections must continue. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine was welcome news but near-term economic risks remain, underscoring the likely need for additional government stimulus. World stocks are up 1.3% for the week, however. They reached record highs on Monday when pharma giant Pfizer announced its vaccine had been effective in 90% of cases. Russia followed up by reporting its vaccine trial, too, had shown promise. European markets lost 0.1% to 0.7%, but the STOXX pan-regional index is set for a second week of big gains. It’s up 5% so far this week as the vaccine news induces more investors to buy shares in banks and travel firms. Earlier, Chinese blue-chips lost 1% after the Trump administration said it would ban U.S. investments in firms linked to the Chinese military. A series of high-profile bond defaults by state-owned enterprises also weighed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.57%. Some investors saw the pullback as a buying opportunity. “My view is this is the dark just before dawn,” said Michael Frazis, portfolio manager at Frazis Capital Partners in Sydney. “You’ve got the second wave of coronavirus, new sets of shutdowns, clear problems around the world, travel dropping off again ... But at the same time, we have the strongest possible evidence that we do have a vaccine.” One sticking point for markets has been the inability of U.S. lawmakers to agree an adequate spending package. The need for this stimulus was highlighted by Thursday data showing a slower pace of jobs recovery and weak inflation. While Democrats in Congress urged negotiations over a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus plan, top Republicans rejected that as too expensive. U.S. Treasury yields slid further, with 10-year yields down around one basis point at 0.87%, well off the seven-and-a-half month high of 0.98% hit on Monday. The yield curve, a gauge of growth and inflation expectations, has flattened, too . “That (snapback in bond yields) got a further nudge from the softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data for October which were released yesterday, and which tally with a weaker economic reality,” ING Bank analysts said. Germany’s 10-year yield slipped 1.5 bps at -0.54%, moving off this week’s two-month highs. Oil prices remained on track for a second week of gains, but the COVID-19 surge and higher U.S. crude stockpiles pushedBrent futures 1% lower to $43 a barrel"
-4.212872974194019," EXPLAINER-Shot in the dark: Early COVID-19 vaccine efficacy explained (Repeats Thursday story with no change to text) ZURICH, Nov 12 (Reuters) - This week has seen a flurry of good news from COVID-19 vaccine developers, with Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE trumpeting early data indicating their mRNA candidate is more than 90% effective. A Russian project came out a day later, touting 92% efficacy for the Sputnik V candidate, named after the Soviet-era satellite, based on a smaller data set. In Pfizer’s case, it waited until 94 volunteers in its late-stage clinical trial of more than 43,500 people - half got the vaccine, the other half got a placebo - tested positive after developing symptoms. For 90%-plus efficacy, no more than eight people among those who tested positive had received the vaccine, with the rest having received the placebo. “Roughly speaking, it’s probably around eight to 86 cases in the treated and placebo groups,” David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge professor of risk and an expert in statistics, told Reuters. “You don’t need a lot of fancy statistical analysis to show that this is deeply impressive. It just hits you between the eyes.” In Russia, Sputnik V-developer Gamaleya Institute reached its preliminary 92% efficacy figure based on 20 illnesses in 16,000 volunteers as its late-stage trial progresses. It aims to reach 40,000 people. Of the 16,000 people, about quarter got the placebo. “It suggests that there is some effect, but it’s insufficient to estimate the magnitude of it,” Spiegelhalter said. Some experts say that, ideally, 150 to 160 people in a trial of tens of thousands of participants must get sick before making a reliable assessment of a vaccine’s efficacy. That’s a bit of a rule of thumb, though, open to interpretation. “There is no such regulatory standard requiring X number of events for making a reliable decision,” the government-funded Swiss Clinical Trial Organisation said. “The amount of (infections) has to be seen in relation to the disease and its risk profile. It’s rather a case-by-case evaluation.” Typically, regulators strive to have at least 95% certainty that the trial read-out is not the result of random variations with nothing to do with the tested compound. For trial sponsors there is safety in numbers as a large enough trial can ensure that 95% reliability hurdle is cleared. But the larger the underlying clinical benefit, the fewer trial participants needed to create that clarity. In Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial, they planned a final analysis when 164 people had become sick, with multiple, pre-planned interim analyses along the way. They skipped an analysis at 32 patients, and once they were ready to release a look at the 62-person mark, 94 had come down sick. Details from the Russian trial are unclear, without access to its protocol. HOW DO THESE RESULTS STACK UP TO OTHER DRUGS, OR VACCINES FOR OTHER ILLNESSES? In normal drug trials, for diseases like terminal cancer, benefits of new medicines may be less apparent, with survival benefits of just a few months sometimes revolutionary for patients at death’s door. For vaccines, however, marginal protection is inadequate, and the World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy in trials, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants at least 50%. The 90% efficacy reported in the Pfizer and Russian trials beats those, and appears to exceed that of typical flu vaccines, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate reduce the risk of sickness by 40%-60%. For other shots, the CDC estimates the efficacy of a two-shot measles vaccine at 97%, and a two-dose chicken pox vaccine at 90%. Two doses of polio vaccine are 90% effective, rising to nearly 100% with a third. Pfizer acknowledged on Monday that its final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. Still, Spiegelhalter said the study’s design seems likely to generally hold up, based on the 94 sick participants. “In this case, the effect is so huge, even if there is a little bit of fallback - if the effects become slightly smaller over time - that is very unlikely to be significant.” WHAT ABOUT REAL-WORLD EFFICACY, SHOULD THE VACCINES BE APPROVED? The interim data is promising, since it appears to demonstrate that a vaccine can be effective in preventing COVID-19. The jump to mass vaccinations, however, presents new hurdles, in particular for an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech’s that must be stored and shipped at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94°F). Moreover, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two doses, ideally 21 days apart. If people do not stick to the timetable, it may affect the vaccine’s efficacy. Protection against the mumps, for instance, drops from nearly 90% to 78%, if people don’t get a follow-up shot. Swiss epidemiologist Marcel Tanner, president of Switzerland’s Academies of Arts and Sciences and one of the government’s top COVID-19 science advisers, expects possible variations in efficacy among older people, whose immune systems wane with time, or those with immune disorders. “Efficacy says, ‘Does it work?’ Effectiveness says, ‘Can it be applied? Can you carry the efficacy to the people?’” Tanner said. “But no question: 90% efficacy, at that stage, is a pretty good result.”"
-1.4833928643166368," Pfizer in talks with Brazil to supply COVID-19 vaccine by early 2021 RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The head of Pfizer Inc in Brazil said on Thursday the drugmaker is negotiating with the South American nation to supply its potential COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021. “We are working strongly with the Brazilian government to try to fast-track the availability (of the vaccine) in Brazil as fast as possible,” Carlos Murillo said during an online event. In Brazil, some 3,100 people are participating in a late-stage clinical trial of the experimental vaccine Pfizer is developing with German partner BioNTech. Pfizer earlier this week said initial data from its late-stage trials showed the vaccine to be more that 90% effective, putting it in the lead among major pharmaceutical companies racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine to help stop the pandemic that has claimed over 1.2 million lives globally. The vaccine, however, needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a potential barrier in developing countries where finding the necessary storage chain could be an obstacle. Murillo said Pfizer has developed a way to keep the vaccine in good condition using only dry ice. “It’s not a simple issue and it does not resolve the logistics, but it changes the paradigm that a country would need an ultrafreezer in each vaccination center, that’s not the case,” Murillo said. The vaccine will be sold with three different price tags, one for affluent countries, one for middle income countries like Brazil and another for low income nations, he said. So far, Brazil’s federal government’s main bet for a potential coronavirus vaccine is with AstraZeneca Plc, with which it has already signed a supply contract."

-1.4833928643166368," French PM says easing COVID-19 lockdown now would be 'irresponsible' PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Jean Castex said there would be no easing for at least two weeks of the country’s second COVID-19 lockdown, with the number of people in hospital with coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave. As officials across Europe warned against COVID-19 complacency following this week’s announcement by Pfizer of a potentially effective vaccine, Castex said his government intended to intensify policing of the lockdown in Paris. “It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now,” the prime minister told a news conference on Thursday. “The gains are fragile.” Shortly after Castex spoke, French health authorities said the number of people hospitalised with the disease increased by 737 to reach an all-time high of 32,638, almost 350 higher than the previous April 14 peak of 32,292. And the number of COVID-19 fatalities rose by 425, to 42,960, meaning the seven-day moving average, at 560, was beyond the 500-threshold for the fourth day in a row, a level last seen during the first lockdown in the second half of April. However, the daily number of new infections was more than 2,500 lower than on Wednesday, at 33,172, and the seven-day moving average of new cases, at 42,478, was down for the fifth day in a row. The cumulative number of cases now stands at 1,898,710, the fourth-highest in the world. Castex said a quarter of current deaths in the country were due to the virus, and that while the ‘R’ rate that measures the spread was now below 1 it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures. Castex said France could start to loosen restrictions from Dec. 1 if the case numbers permitted, first by allowing shops to re-open. But he said bars and restaurants would not be permitted to resume operating until later still. Asked if citizens could buy train tickets to travel at Christmas, he replied: “It’s a bit too early to say.” If the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week. But Castex added he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread quickened once more. “The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously,” Castex said, adding one person was hospitalised every 30 seconds somewhere in France as a result of the virus. When President Emmanuel Macron put the country back into lockdown, he said new infections needed to be hauled down to 5,000 per day for the curbs to be lifted. After achieving a large degree of control over the pandemic following blanket lockdowns earlier in the year, governments across Europe have imposed new curbs to halt an alarming rise in case numbers in recent weeks, while trying to keep economies running as far as possible. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire offered landlords an increased tax credit on commercial rents from small and mid-sized companies if they did not collect payment in November."
-1.4833928643166368," Europe 'must grit teeth' on COVID-19 as vaccine euphoria fades PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - European officials warned against COVID-19 complacency on Thursday and said measures to control a surge in infections as winter approaches must continue despite hopes that new vaccines can bring the pandemic under control. This week’s announcement by Pfizer Inc of a potentially effective vaccine spurred optimism that an end to months of crisis could be in sight, sending financial markets soaring and fuelling public longing for a nearly normal Christmas. But health authorities and leaders across the region urged people to continue complying with lockdowns as it became clear that vaccines would not come soon enough for many COVID-19 sufferers and shrinking economies. “It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now,” French Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference, warning that, despite signs of a slowdown in infections, gains were fragile. France has the highest number of cases in Europe. “The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously,” Castex said, adding that lockdown measures imposed at the end of October would continue until at least Dec. 1. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech will only be able to produce enough vaccine this year to treat 25 million people, if approval is secured - not nearly enough to ease the winter strain on health systems. In Italy, which reported 623 deaths on Wednesday and passed 1 million cases, and in Germany, which has also seen infections climb back to levels seen earlier in the crisis, officials said any return to normal would take time. “We really must grit our teeth for a couple more months,” said Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. The dire situation facing Italy, the country at the centre of the first wave of the pandemic, was underlined by a video on social media showing a corpse sprawled in a hospital lavatory, after the patient apparently died while waiting for a test. After achieving a degree of control over the pandemic with blanket lockdowns earlier in the year, governments across the region have now imposed new restrictions to try to curb a fresh surge in infections, but have yet to see improvements of the required scale. “Infections went down fast last week, but we need to make more progress,” Ernst Kuipers, head of the Dutch national hospital association LNAZ, told reporters. “We keep stressing the importance of following the rules.” As the euphoria that followed Pfizer’s announcement faded, European shares slipped back from their eight-month highs, with poor economic data from Britain adding to doubts about the rebound from the brutal slump caused by the first lockdowns. Its economy lost steam in September, hardening expectations that it will shrink again as 2020 ends. Britain passed 50,000 COVID-19 deaths this week, and the 33,470 new cases registered on Thursday were its highest daily tally to date. “Dealers are starting to realise that, even though a drug has a very high success rate in late-stage trials, the process of obtaining approval and getting it rolled out could take a long time,” said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets UK. As the crisis has ground on and jobless numbers have risen, public support for countermeasures has fractured. There have been protests in several countries, and observance of bans on public gatherings or requirements to wear masks or avoid social contact can be patchy. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said countries should not pin all their hopes on rapid vaccination. “We may be tired of COVID-19 but it is not tired of us,” Tedros told the Paris Peace Forum, an annual event focused this year on fostering global cooperation to beat the pandemic. “European countries are struggling, but the virus has not changed significantly, nor the measures to stop it.”"

-1.4833928643166368," Fed, ECB heads give COVID-19 vaccine cautious welcome FRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The heads of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank welcomed the encouraging results in trials of a vaccine candidate for the novel coronavirus but stressed that the economic outlook will remain uncertain. Fed chair Jay Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde said the economy was still in for a tough time even if the development of a potential vaccine by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer PFE.N and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX.O was reason for some optimism further ahead. “From a huge river of uncertainty, we see the other side now,” Lagarde said in a panel discussion with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. “But I don’t want to be exuberant about this vaccination because there is still uncertainty” about the production and distribution of the vaccine, she said. Powell echoed her, saying the vaccine results were “good and welcome news” but it was “too soon to assess with any confidence the implications...for the near term”. With the euro zone likely heading back into recession this quarter, the ECB has already said it would provide more stimulus in December, most likely through its pandemic emergency bond buying programme and through more favourable loans to the bank sector. The U.S. economy has recouped just over half the 22 million jobs lost since businesses began reopening after the first shutdowns in March, supported both by extraordinarily easy Fed policy and the first tranche of about $3 trillion in pandemic relief. But the recovery has been uneven, and the subsequent waves of the virus threaten to make it more so."

-1.4833928643166368," Sterling slips as Britain's economy struggles to maintain recovery LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling weakened on Thursday after news that Britain’s economy grew by a slower-than-expected 1.1% between August and September, a pace that leaves the UK lagging other rich nations attempting to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The number was all the more disappointing because the period measured was before the latest COVID-19 restrictions on businesses took effect. GDP figures showed that in the July-September quarter, the economy grew by a record 15.5% from the previous three months. Still, this number marginally missed expectations as well, as economists polled by Reuters were looking for 15.8% growth. “The weaker than expected print will put the brakes on the recent sterling rally and will provide a reality check for the market and will highlight lingering headwinds for the pound in the form of ongoing Brexit negotiations and the growing economic impact of the pandemic,” said Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank. Britain reached a bleak milestone in its battle with the coronavirus on Wednesday as the official death toll passed 50,000, casting a shadow on news about the effectiveness of a potential vaccine announced on Monday. Finance minister Rishi Sunak said steps to restrict the spread of COVID-19 were likely to have slowed economic growth since September. The pound was down by 0.6% against the dollar at $1.3139 and by 0.9% against the euro, last trading at 89.88 pence. Uncertainty and volatility in trade of the British currency have grown on the back of rising coronavirus cases and a lack of clarity about whether Britain will exit the European Union single market in January with a trade deal in hand. An EU-UK trade pact is unlikely to come together this week and negotiations might go into the next, an Irish minister said on Wednesday, confirming a Reuters report that the sides were now set to miss their mid-November deadline. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said on Thursday the entire world was watching Brexit negotiations, including U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who was looking forward to a Brexit trade deal being clinched. Still, Britain has been working hard throughout the trade negotiations with the bloc to secure a deal, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the top trade representatives for Brazil and the UK held a videoconference on Wednesday to discuss strengthening trade and investment links, including a possible post-Brexit bilateral trade deal. Market makers were deliberating whether the Bank of England would lower interest rates into negative territory if the impact of coronavirus on the economy gets worse and Britain fails to sign a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said that he didn’t have a “precise date in mind” when the findings of the BoE’s consultation with banks on negative rates would come out. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, wrote that this meant negative rates were “in the toolkit but he (Bailey) had got no plans to go down that way for now”. “A vaccine cannot come soon enough for the British economy - and for those cyclical components of the market that rely on broad economic activity returning,” Wilson said. Market participants are for now pricing in rates going below zero in the UK next June."
-1.4833928643166368," Fauci stresses on need for equitable access of COVID-19 vaccines (Reuters) - U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Thursday vaccine developers should push to make billions of their COVID-19 vaccines to ensure access to all parts of the world, instead of focusing on the rich countries. Fauci’s comments come days after Pfizer Inc said its COVID-19 vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective based on initial results from a large-scale trial, securing a lead in the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the respiratory illness. Pfizer has a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year, as well as a deal with the European Union to supply up to 300 million doses. “Now a number of different companies are talking about the ability to make billions of doses. That’s what we need. We don’t need hundreds of millions for the rich countries,” Fauci said at a webinar conducted by British think tank Chatham House. “We need billions (of vaccine doses), so whether you live in the darkest part of the developing world, or if you live in London, you should have the same access.” Experts have also raised doubts about access to the vaccine, especially in the developing countries, as it needs to be stored at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below, posing infrastructure challenges. “Certainly it is not going to be pandemic for a lot longer, because I believe the vaccines are going to turn that around,” Fauci said, while adding that there may be a need to re-vaccinate people intermittently, if COVID-19 becomes endemic. Fauci said efforts were underway in the United States to push for the development of antivirals and other therapies for early intervention during the course of the COVID-19 respiratory illness."

-4.716878597722244," Russia says its Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is 92% effective MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 according to interim trial results, the country’s sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday, as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drugmakers in the race for a shot. Russia's results are only the second from a late-stage human trial, following on swiftly from data released on Monday by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech BNTX.O, which said their shot was also more than 90% effective. While experts said the Russian data was encouraging and reinforced the idea the pandemic could be halted by vaccines, they warned that the results were only based on a small number of trial volunteers who had contracted COVID-19. The analysis was conducted after 20 participants developed the virus and examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. That is significantly lower than the 94 infections in the trial of the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. “I assume there was political pressure after the press release from Pfizer and BioNTech earlier in the week to now draw level with their own data,” said Bodo Plachter, deputy director of the Institute of Virology at the Mainz University. “What is missing for now is an analysis of statistical significance.” To confirm the efficacy rate of its vaccine, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has been backing Sputnik V’s development, said the Russian trial would continue for six months. Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute which developed the vaccine, said the interim results demonstrated that Sputnik V was effective and mass vaccinations would be rolled out in Russia in the coming weeks. In later comments, aired by Rossiya-24 state TV channel, he said at least 1.5 million people in Russia were expected to receive the shot by the end of the year. He added that around 40,000 to 45,000 Russians had already been vaccinated. European stocks and U.S. stock futures extended their gains slightly after Russia’s announcement though the reaction was far more muted than after Pfizer’s results. China’s Sinopharm, which is running large-scale late-stage clinical trials for two COVID-19 vaccine candidates, said on Wednesday that its data was better than expected, though it did not give further details. ‘NOT A COMPETITION’ Successful vaccines are seen as a crucial to restoring daily life around the world by helping end the pandemic that has killed more than 1.26 million people, shuttered businesses and put millions out of work. However, experts said knowledge about the Russian trial’s design was sparse, making it hard to interpret the data. Scientists have raised concerns about the speed at which Moscow has worked, giving the regulatory go-ahead for the shot and launching mass vaccinations before full trials to test its safety and efficacy had been completed. “This is not a competition. We need all trials to be carried out to the highest possible standards and it is particularly important that the pre-set criteria for unblinding the trial data are adhered to avoid cherry picking the data,” said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. “Anything less than this risks a public loss of trust in all vaccines, which would be a disaster.” The results are based on data from the first 16,000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two-dose vaccine. “We are showing, based on the data, that we have a very effective vaccine,” said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev, adding that it was the sort of news that the vaccine’s developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren. The so-called Phase III trial of the shot is taking place in 29 clinics across Moscow and will involve 40,000 volunteers in total, with a quarter receiving a placebo shot. The chances of contracting COVID-19 were 92% lower among people vaccinated with Sputnik V than those who received the placebo, the RDIF said. That’s well above the 50% effectiveness threshold for COVID-19 vaccines set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The RDIF said data from the study would be published in a leading medical journal following a peer review. The results of the early-stage Russian trials were peer reviewed and published in September in The Lancet medical journal. Experts said that as with the Pfizer results, it was not yet clear how long immunity would last after taking the Russian vaccine, nor how efficient it would be for different age groups. “We certainly need longer-term observations to draw valid conclusions about efficacy and side effects. The same goes for Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s numbers,” said Plachter in Mainz. As Moscow seeks partners abroad to boost output, China's Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding 600211.SS announced a deal soon after the results to released to make, sell and test the shot in China. The Russian drug is named Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race, a nod to the project’s geopolitical importance for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia registered the vaccine for public use in August, the first country to do so, ahead of the start of the large-scale trial in September. So far, it has inoculated 10,000 members of the public considered at high risk of contracting COVID-19 such as doctors and teachers, outside of the trial. The vaccine is designed to trigger a response from two shots administered 21 days apart, each based on different viral vectors that normally cause the common cold: human adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad26. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles. Russia is also testing a different vaccine, produced by the Vector Institute in Siberia, and is on the cusp of registering a third, Putin said on Tuesday, adding that all of the country’s vaccines were effective. RDIF said as of Nov. 11 no serious side effects had been reported during the Sputnik V Phase III trial. Some volunteers had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection site, flu-like syndrome including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache, it said. In late October, the vaccination of new volunteers was temporarily paused due to high demand and a shortage of doses. Russia’s deputy prime minister said on Wednesday that the Vector Institute vaccine was expected to start post-registration trials on Nov. 15. She also said that Russia would produce 500,000 doses of Sputnik V in November, lower than a previous forecast of 800,000 doses given by Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov. Russia reported 19,851 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours and a record high of 432 deaths. At 1,836,960, its overall case tally is the fifth largest in the world, behind the United States, India, Brazil and France."

Pfizer PFE.N said on Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered the global economy and upended daily life. Numerous countries have signed deals with the company already to receive millions of doses of its candidate vaccine. Netanyahu said in a statement that he had spoken with the company’s Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla. “After this conversation, which was very practical and to the point, I am convinced that we will complete the contract with Pfizer,” said Netanyahu. Israel already has an agreement with Moderna Inc MRNA.O for the future purchase of its potential vaccine and has been in talks with other companies as well. It has also started human trials on its own vaccine candidate."

This could become a challenge for transporting such vaccines in countries that do not have the cold storage capacity. Pfizer recently announced its vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results."
-4.716878597722244," With scant power or freezers, Pfizer vaccine brings little cheer to coronavirus-hit India NEW DELHI, Nov 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Despite hopes raised by Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, it will take huge efforts for India to defeat the coronavirus, with its 1.3 billion population and the world’s second-highest caseload. Pfizer Inc’s Monday announcement that initial trials showed their experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective sparked cheer across the world, scarred by a pandemic has killed 1.2 million people and infected 50.7 million. But the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at temperatures matching an Antarctic winter - a logistical nightmare for India with heatwaves exceeding 50 degrees Celsius (122°F), few ultra-cold freezers, patchy power and a largely rural population. “The new two-shot vaccine from Pfizer has to be maintained at minus 80°C - nowhere on the planet does the logistical capacity exist to distribute vaccines at this temperature,” said Toby Peters, a professor at Britain’s University of Birmingham. “This is a new challenge to be urgently managed,” Peters, an expert in cooling technologies who is studying plans to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. About 100 drug development teams worldwide are racing to develop coronavirus vaccines, with the hope of distributing them globally on a scale never before witnessed. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 70% of the global population must be inoculated to end the pandemic. India will be critical to this effort - with 8.6 million COVID-19 cases, second only to the United States. The South Asia nation has been scrambling to secure 500 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by July from various manufacturers, in addition to developing its own government-backed COVID-19 vaccine COVAXIN. India also plans to manufacture up to 200 million doses of candidate vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Novavax Inc next year, with funding from the GAVI vaccines alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. India has a strong record on vaccination, with the world’s largest programme distributing 400 million vaccines a year, said Peters. But nearly half of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates need cold storage as low as minus 80°C, researchers say, requiring seamless cold chain distribution from manufacturers to airports to remote villages. “The success of any COVID-19 vaccination programme will critically depend on robustness of the cold chain,” said Peters. “The key challenge for COVID-19 immunisation will likely be the last mile distribution and ensuring that each vaccination site is equipped with both adequate fixed and outreach cooling equipment to maintain efficacy of the valuable ... vaccine.” He said this would require investment in new cold chain systems and could include innovative approaches like using drones and new mobile rechargeable micro-chillers. India’s health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. To ease distribution, Pfizer has announced that it will provide a “dry ice pack” container for its vaccines that is able to maintain a temperature of minus 70°C for up to 10 days. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, head of India’s biopharmaceutical company Biocon Ltd, which developed a drug to treat patients with COVID-19 complications, voiced concerns over storage of the new vaccine. “The Pfizer vaccine is unlikely to make its way to India because the ultra-cold chain that it requires ... is something that we may not be in a position to handle,” she told CNBC-TV18 television news. “We might be able to deal with such a cold supply chain in some parts of India, in the cities, but certainly it’s not something that will be conducive for India.” She said it was important to watch out for cheaper alternatives to Pfizer’s vaccine, which would not need ultra-cold storage and be better suited to cover wider populations. Although vaccines could prove a gamechanger for the pandemic, wealthy nations have already bought up more than half the future supply of leading contenders, Oxfam has said. While India is in talks with Pfizer, according to the financial daily Mint, the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Britain have already signed supply deals with the U.S. drugmaker, which aims to make up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. “India will not be able to ... get this (Pfizer) vaccine so soon given there are advanced bookings,” said Sunil Nair, head of Snowman Logistics, India’s largest cold chain services company. But other potential vaccines, such as those from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc, can be stored at 2 to 8°C, the temperature of a regular refrigerator. And Randeep Guleria, who is part of the Indian government’s COVID-19 vaccine panel, told local media that India’s vaccines would be kept at a temperature of minus 20°C. Nair said storage and transport of vaccines at up to minus 30°C would be “no problem”. “To meet the huge demand that we foresee, (we) will need as many vaccine candidates as possible for use across a range of populations and settings,” said Olly Cann, a GAVI spokesman."

-4.716878597722244," Cold storage challenges could hamper distribution of Pfizer, Moderna COVID-19 vaccines - Fauci (Reuters) - Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Wednesday said it would be challenging to distribute vaccines that use messenger RNA based technology in developing countries, owing to their cold storage requirements. The comments come days after Pfizer Inc said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results and that it expects to file for U.S. emergency authorization this month. The vaccine candidate uses synthetic messenger RNA to activate the immune system against the virus and needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. “It does have cold-chain challenges as it were. In a country like the UK and the United States we can address them and it still would be challenging. But, probably much more challenging in countries in the developing world,” Fauci said at the Financial Times’ global pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference. Moderna Inc’s experimental vaccine, which is on track to report early data from a late-stage trial later this month, also uses mRNA technology and needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F). “That’s the reason why when we put together our plan ... we want to have a diversity of what we call vaccine platforms. It is not just mRNA ... there are three separate platforms that are being looked at in the United States,” Fauci said."

The experimental drug, developed in conjunction with Germany’s BioNTech, is the frontrunner in a global race to produce a vaccine, with interim data released on Monday showing it was more than 90% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 in a large-scale clinical trial.. Under the EU deal, 27 European countries could buy 200 million doses, and have an option to purchase another 100 million. The bloc will pay less than $19.50 per shot, a senior EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug’s development. The official requested anonymity as the terms of the agreement are confidential. The United States agreed to pay $19.50 per shot for 100 million doses, a smaller volume than the EU. But it has an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately, and the price it will pay is unclear. BioNTech signalled this week that order size would impact the per-dose price in the developed world and said it would differentiate pricing between countries or regions for its potential vaccine. The EU official said the EU had agreed a price that was closer to $20 than to $10 but declined to give a precise figure. Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment on the pricing. A spokesman for the EU Commission, which negotiates vaccine agreements on behalf of EU states, also declined to comment. In June, the European Investment Bank, the EU’s financial arm, granted a 100-million-euro ($118 million) loan to BioNTech for the development and manufacturing of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was followed in September by another 375-million-euro funding by Germany’s research ministry. “With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase,” the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said, announcing the Pfizer deal. The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson for their experimental COVID-19 shots, and is talking with Moderna, CureVac and Novavax to secure their vaccines. Under the EU’s deals with vaccine makers, the bloc offers a non-refundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a pre-agreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator. The Commission did not disclose the down payment made to Pfizer and BioNTech. ‘NO COPY PASTE’ ON LIABILITY TERMS The prices agreed by the EU in previous deals with vaccine makers have partly been influenced by liability terms, which could cause large additional legal costs if inoculated people developed unexpected conditions because of the shots. Asked about liability clauses in the Pfizer contract, which have been a bone of contention between EU negotiators and drugmakers, the EU official said conditions were different from those the EU agreed with other companies, and also different from those Pfizer had with the U.S. government. There was “no copy paste” on liability terms from previous contracts, the official said. French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner, has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros ($11.8) per dose and did not get any liability waiver, while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 2.5 euro per dose, an official told Reuters in September. Bad side-effects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed. The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval."

Switzerland, which has 8.6 million people and hopes to start vaccinating some time in the first half of 2021, had previously reserved nearly 10 million doses of prospective vaccines from Moderna and AstraZeneca and has now set aside 400 million Swiss francs ($435.92 million) for purchases. Pfizer and BioNTech said on Monday their COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, prompting governments to rush to secure a share. Data from separate trials of Moderna’s and AstraZeneca’s candidates are due later this year. A Russian vaccine project on Wednesday also said that its candidate’s efficacy topped 90% in a small sampling of trial participants. Global health officials estimate about 60-70% of the population must be inoculated against the new coronavirus to get the pandemic under control. While the figure is four times the number of Swiss who get an annual flu shot, Health Minister Alain Berset said the situations aren’t comparable, citing polls he said show “a large percentage of the population is ready to get a shot”. “We’re confronted with a worldwide pandemic that has inflicted massive damage on the economy and society,” Berset said at a news conference. “The situation in which we’re living in today isn’t what we want.” Swiss coronavirus infections rose by 8,270 cases on Wednesday, with confirmed cases in Switzerland and neighbouring principality Liechtenstein increasing to 243,472 and the death toll rising by 86 to 2,769, as some hospitals report their intensive care units are full.

-4.716878597722244," U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations surge to record of just over 59,000 patients: Reuters tally (Reuters) - There were just over 59,000 COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the United States on Monday, the country’s highest number ever of in-patients being treated for the disease, with new infections at record levels for the sixth consecutive day. The harsh statistics tallied by Reuters cemented the United States' position as the nation worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, even as drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N provided some hope with successful late-stage tests of its vaccine. President-elect Joe Biden hailed Pfizer’s progress, but urged Americans to wear masks as he noted a vaccine may not be widely available for many months. The number of Americans with COVID-19 currently hospitalized has surged around 73% over the past 30 days to at least 59,008 - a record level that surpasses the previous high of 58,370 on July 22. Daily new infections, meanwhile, exceeded 100,000 for the sixth consecutive day. Hospitalizations are a key metric of how the pandemic is progressing because, unlike case counts, they are not influenced by the number of tests performed. Texas reported the highest number of hospitalized patients with 6,103, followed by Illinois with 4,409 and California with 3,668 patients, according to the Reuters tally. Biden, who spent much of his election campaign criticizing President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic, pledged over the weekend to make tackling the pandemic a top priority. Mask wearing has become a political issue in the United States, with Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask during the campaign and many conservatives contending masks infringe on their individual freedom. Politics aside, the data shows that the United States is experiencing its worst phase so far of the outbreak. It has reported more than a million new cases in the past 10 days, according to the Reuters tally, the speediest surge in infections since the country reported its first COVID-19 cases, in Washington state, 294 days ago. More than 770,000 new cases were diagnosed in the week ended Nov. 10, up 34% over the previous seven days, according to the tally. The country has reported a total of around 10.13 million cases. Deaths over the week to Nov. 10 increased 15%, or more than 6,600 people, over the previous week. That was the highest one-week total since mid-August, taking the overall death toll for the pandemic to more than 238,000. Worryingly for officials, health experts say the death toll tends to spike four to six weeks after a surge in infections. In Texas, which became the first U.S. state to surpass one million cumulative coronavirus cases on Saturday, authorities in the El Paso county on Monday said they were bringing in 10 temporary refrigerated morgue trailers in anticipation of further fatalities.

-4.716878597722244," Pfizer vaccine trial success signals breakthrough in pandemic battle (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's PFE.N experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, the drugmaker said on Monday, a major victory in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world's economy. Scientists, public health officials and investors welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that could help turn the tide of the pandemic if the full trial results pan out. However, mass roll-outs, which needs regulatory approval, will not happen this year and several vaccines are seen as necessary to meet massive global needs. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected to seek U.S. emergency use authorization this month, raising the chance of a regulatory decision as soon as December. If granted, the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. “Today is a great day for science and humanity,” said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, noting the data milestone comes with “infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.” Experts said they wanted to see the full trial data, but the preliminary results looked encouraging. “This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general,” said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford. There are still many questions, such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long immunity may last. “But the bottom line is, as a vaccine it’s more than 90% effective, which is extraordinary,” top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN. Pfizer expects to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need two months of follow-up safety data to assure no side effects crop up. That is expected to be available in the third week of November. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it would take several weeks for U.S. regulators to receive and process the data before a potential approval. The prospect of a vaccine electrified world markets with the S&P 500 and Dow hitting record highs. JPMorgan said on Monday it expected the S&P 500 index to hit 4,000 points by early 2021 and called Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine and called Pfizer Inc’s PFE.N COVID-19 vaccine update “one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years.” Stock of theme park and film company Walt Disney rose 12% and movie chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings was up 51%. Shares in companies that have thrived during lockdowns, such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O and conferencing platform Zoom Video ZM.O tumbled. Gun stocks sold off on higher hopes for a return to normal and a lack of civil unrest. Pfizer shares jumped more than 8% to their highest since July last year, while BioNTech’s stock hit a record high. Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan forecast the vaccine may generate sales in excess of $8.5 billion for Pfizer in 2020-2021 alone. Shares of other vaccine developers in the final stage of testing also rose with Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N up nearly 4% and Moderna Inc MRNA.O, whose vaccine uses a similar technology as the Pfizer shot, up more than 8%. Britain's AstraZeneca AZN.L, however, fell 2%. Moderna is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month. “It’s likely that we’re going to have more than one vaccine that’s effective,” Fauci said. William Schaffner, infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, called the Pfizer results better than most anticipated. “The study isn’t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.” U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed the test results, and the market boost: “STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!” he tweeted. President-elect Joe Biden said the news was excellent but did not change the fact that face masks, social distancing and other health measures would be needed well into next year. The World Health Organization called the results very positive but warned there was a funding gap of $4.5 billion that could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. There are other challenges as well that could affect less affluent countries. The Pfizer vaccine must be shipped and stored at an extremely cold temperature, which requires necessary infrastructure. Even many U.S. hospitals lack these super cold storage units, which may impact when and where the vaccine becomes available in many U.S. rural areas as well. That highlights the need for more traditional vaccines in development, such as J&J’s candidate. ‘NEAR ECSTATIC’ Still, there was cause for jubilation. “I’m near ecstatic,” Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer’s top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. “This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we’re now in.” Between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated to break the dynamic of the spread of COVID-19, said Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn, adding that he did not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021. The European Union said on Monday it would soon sign a contract for up to 300 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The companies have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They did not receive research funding from the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine program. The drugmakers have also reached supply agreements with the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. The interim analysis, conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. Pfizer did not provide that detail, but over 90% effective implies that no more than 8 of the 94 had received the vaccine, administered in two shots about three weeks apart. The efficacy rate, which could drop once full results are available, is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine. Shortly after Pfizer’s announcement, Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine was also more than 90% effective, based on data collated from inoculations of the public. To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases among volunteers. Bourla told CNBC on Monday that could be before the end of November. Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain’s University of Warwick, noted that the data may show the vaccine keeps people from getting sick but not necessarily from becoming infected. “And the subtlety there ... is if you’re infected then you can still transmit the virus.” Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday exceeded 50 million cases since the new coronavirus first emerged late last year in China. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. The technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles. The Trump administration has said it will have enough vaccine doses for all of the 330 million U.S. residents who want it by the middle of 2021."
-4.716878597722244," Why Pfizer’s ultra-cold COVID-19 vaccine will not be at the local pharmacy any time soon (This November 9 story corrects to clarify in the 24th paragraph that the Association of Immunization Managers is not a lobbying group) NEW YORK (Reuters) - Work to distribute the experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech SE BNTX.O is gearing up after the companies announced successful interim data earlier on Monday, but it will not be coming to local pharmacies for the general public any time soon. The data, which sent U.S. stocks to record highs [.N], showed that the two companies’ experimental vaccine is 90% effective at preventing COVID-19. They are still awaiting data on safety, which could come later this month. Pfizer and BioNTech need to get regulators to sign off on the shot before it can start shipping vaccines to those considered most in need by government. Healthcare workers and people living in nursing homes will likely top that list. But the vaccine’s complex and super-cold storage requirements are an obstacle for even the most sophisticated hospitals in the United States and may impact when and where it is available in rural areas or poor countries where resources are tight. The main issue is that the vaccine, which is based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. “The cold chain is going to be one of the most challenging aspects of delivery of this vaccination,” said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “This will be a challenge in all settings because hospitals even in big cities do not have storage facilities for a vaccine at that ultra-low temperature.” Indeed, one of the most prestigious U.S. hospitals, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it does not currently have that capability. “We’re talking about a vaccine that needs storage at minus 70 or 80. That’s a tremendous logistical issue not only in the U.S. but outside the Western world,” said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic. “We’re a major medical center and we don’t have storage capacity like this. That will be true for everybody. This is a logistical obstacle.” Pfizer spokeswoman Kim Bencker said the company was working closely with the U.S. government and state officials on how to ship the vaccine from its distribution centers in the United States, Germany and Belgium around the globe. The detailed plan includes using dry ice to transport frozen vaccine vials by both air and land at their recommended temperatures for up to 10 days, she said. See graphic on COVID-19 global tracker: here State and local healthcare providers are responsible for storing and administering vaccines once delivered. They can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2-8 degrees C – a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals, Bencker said. The Pfizer storage units can also be refilled with ice for up to 15 days, she said. But shots will spoil in around five days at normal refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing. BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters the companies are analyzing if they can extend that for two weeks. The vaccine of Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is working on a vaccine based on similar technology, does not need to be stored at such a low temperature. Other vaccines including ones from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Novavax Inc NVAX.O can be stored at 2-8 degrees C, the temperature of a regular refrigerator. Northwell Health, a major hospital system in New York, is expanding its ultra-cold storage capacity. Although it is possible to deploy the vaccine before it spoils, Northwell Chief Pharmacy Officer Onisis Stefas said the hospital decided the freezer access would ensure a smooth rollout. The cold storage requirements could impede Pfizer’s ability to reach rural healthcare systems and nursing homes, or less wealthy nations, which may not have the funds for the refrigeration units, experts said. “If Pfizer’s is the only vaccine to be authorized in the next few months, we do worry about equity when it comes to spreading it to rural areas,” said Claire Hannan, executive director at the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit organization representing state and local public health officials who handle vaccines. Ultra-cold freezer supplies are already limited as hospitals scramble to stock up, Stefas said. Some states have said they have a shortage of ultra-cold freezers, according to public documents that states filed with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. New Hampshire has purchased extra ultra-cold freezers and like other states is lobbying the Trump administration for additional funds, the documents show. California has also said ultra-cold freezer supplies are limited and roughly half of the states’ health departments are looking in to purchasing or leasing additional cold storage supplies. It has proposed building a distribution network of ultra-cold freezers, including mobile vaccination clinics, to reach underserved areas around the state. California said it will not provide vaccine supplies to facilities without adequate cold-storage capabilities. Without the extra equipment, doctors will have a dilemma: store vaccines in standard refrigerators and deploy all 975 doses in each Pfizer vaccine container in less than five days or restock them with dry ice and open them only twice a day to extend the vaccines’ life span, Hannan said. “I think it will be difficult, but based on the task and how important it is, people will do the best to their ability to make that happen,” Stefas said."

Traders stampeded to the riskier plays in equities, foreign exchange and bond markets after Pfizer Inc PFE.N released positive data on its vaccine trial, while rotating out of safe havens such as technology stocks, Japanese yen JPY= and top-rated bonds. “Volumes (are) also surging as programmes and baskets go to work to either correct portfolio balances or address margin calls,” said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities, highlighting a jump in volumes in the airlines and banking sectors. In the United States, nearly $500 billion worth of trades went through stock markets on Monday, one of the busiest days since March, when coronavirus lockdown fears rattled financial markets. Europe saw $120 billion traded, according to Refinitiv data. Value stocks, typically companies that are more sensitive to economic cycles, notched their best one-day performance against their growth-focused peers ever in the United States after Monday’s news of an effective vaccine against the coronavirus. A similar trend was noticed in the bond and currency markets where volumes matched the panic trading seen during the depths of the market mayhem in March and double that of April when the coronavirus pandemic slammed into markets. Total turnover for the 33 currency pairs on CLS, a major settler of trades in the currency markets, totalled $627 billion on Monday. Average daily turnover was $707 billion in March and $380 billion in April. Bond market turnover also jumped. Nearly 170,000 contracts changed hands on the popular front-month German bund futures contracts </FBTPc1>, 1.5 times this year’s average, according to Refinitiv data. Total turnover on German government bonds on Monday totalled nearly 9 billion euros ($10.63 billion), more than the average since the start of October, according to data from Marketaxess, a major trading platform. “Turnover was about three times the 30-day average daily volumes in cash and very active in the futures space,” said Jimmy Conway, head of EMEA equity trading strategy at Citibank.

-4.306373435689051," Dollar flat, yen near three-week lows after vaccine news NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was steady on Tuesday and the yen stayed near three-weeks lows, as investors remained optimistic about progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine and the currency markets digested Monday’s big moves. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX.O said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 - news which drove renewed appetite for risk that lifted global markets. The dollar’s rise on Monday of 0.5%, analysts said, was caused by investors quitting long positions in other major safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies, near its previous session’s highs, as market participants declined to push it further in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out. U.S. Treasury yields held their Monday increases, and the spread between two-year and 10-year notes widened slightly, in choppy trading. Major U.S. and European stock indexes at midday Eastern Time were also holding steady with most of their gains from Monday. “Today is a little bit of a cool-off from what we’ve seen in this past couple of days,” said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. “I don’t mind a little bit of a breather. November has been very, very interesting.” Neil Jones, head of FX sales for financial institutions at Mizuho, said he expected the risk-on moves to hold. “We need more clarity in terms of the distribution, quantities, timeline, and to whom,” Jones said. “On balance, that optimism will remain for now.” The dollar had lost around 1.4% this month until Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential election became apparent over the weekend. The Japanese yen, which had its biggest one-day fall since March after the vaccine announcement, was little changed Tuesday at 105.28 JPY=D3 yen to the dollar. The yen had initially clawed back some of its losses from the day before. The Swiss franc CHF=EBS gained marginally, with the dollar rising 0.1% to 0.914 franc after Monday's 1.5% gain. “Following a euphoric market reaction such as that, the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,” wrote Commerzbank FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients. Possible catalysts for future changes in exchange rates include new talks in Washington on another round of government spending to stimulate the economy, said Trang of Silicon Valley Bank. “That’s the next topic that most people will be focusing on in the next six months,” he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday afternoon that he did not see a need for a giant coronavirus relief bill. “It seems to me that snag that hung us up for months is still there,” the Republican told reporters. Euro-dollar was broadly flat at $1.1823. In the previous session, it rose to as high as $1.192, but went no further, which Mizuho's Jones said could be due to the European Central Bank having signaled its awareness of the downsides of rapid euro strength EUR=EBS.

-4.306373435689051," Colombia hopes for COVID-19 vaccine in first half of 2021, working on cold storage BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia hopes to have supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc or other drugmakers in the first half of next year, the government said on Tuesday, and is working on “ultra freezing” units in five cities to store the doses. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech said this week their experimental COVID-19 vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results. COVID-19 has killed over a million people and battered the world’s economy. Just under 33,000 people have died in Colombia, which held more than five months of national quarantine earlier this year. “Colombia is working on the development of ultra-freezing in five cities,” Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said in a statement. “Nevertheless, the mechanism that Pfizer is using for these vaccines includes ultra-frozen delivery until the point of application.” The vaccine, stored in “specialized boxes”, can be used for an average of between 10 and 20 days once it reaches its application location, the statement added. The government and Pfizer held a meeting to discuss freezing and transport, which will be supplied by the company, the ministry said. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously said it has detailed plans and tools to support vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring. Colombia, which provides 22 vaccines free of charge and will include COVID vaccinations under the same scheme, said last month ultra cold-storage vaccines could present distribution challenges. Immunizing remote populations in the Andean nation’s mountains and jungles sometimes requires transportation by river or on horseback, journeys that could prove difficult if extremely low temperature storage is needed. Officials have raised similar concerns for countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America grappling with tropical heat, remote communities and lack of infrastructure. Even wealthier nations like Japan and South Korea say storage will be logistically complex. Colombia initially wants to vaccinate 15 million people - more than a fifth of its population - who are older than 60, have pre-existing conditions or work in healthcare. The global COVAX initiative will provide for 10 million people and the country is seeking the remainder in talks with drugmakers. “COVAX is committed to delivering vaccines from the second half of 2021. With the bilaterals, Pfizer and the rest, we will seek to buy vaccines to have availability in the first half of 2021,” Ruiz said. Pfizer and BioNTech have said pending regulatory approval they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year and produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021."
-4.306373435689051," Spain hopes to receive first Pfizer vaccines in early 2021: minister MADRID (Reuters) - Spain stands to receive its first vaccines against COVID-19 developed by Pfizer PFE.N and its partner BioNTech 22UAy.DE in early 2021, the health minister said on Tuesday, under a deal being negotiated by the European Union. The EU hopes to sign a contract soon for millions of doses of the vaccine, the European Commission announced on Monday, hours after the two companies said it had proved more than 90% effective, in what could be a major victory in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Spain would initially get 20 million vaccine doses, enough to immunize 10 million people, Health Minister Salvador Illa said on state broadcaster TVE, adding that the vaccination would be free. Enough people would be vaccinated by April-May, so that the fight against the pandemic in Spain would move to another stage, Illa added. A total of 39,756 people have died of the virus in Spain, many regions of which are back under lockdown restrictions to stem the spread of the disease. The death toll on Tuesday rose by 411 - the largest daily tally in the country’s second wave. Spain recorded 17,395 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, health ministry data showed, retreating from highs of more than 20,000 recorded last week and bringing the total to just below 1.4 million - one of the highest in western Europe. Pfizer has offered to help with the logistics to distribute the vaccine, which has to be kept deep frozen to be effective, Science Minister Pedro Duque told a news briefing. Spain’s central and regional governments will make a decision on who will have priority based on “medical criteria”, Duque said. Illa said the Spanish government would act to convince a substantial portion of the population which public opinion polls suggest are wary of any vaccine against COVID-19. “We will tell the truth, which is that vaccines save lives,” Illa said."
-4.306373435689051," Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine ""very promising"" but has cold chain issues -WHO GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief said on Tuesday it hopes to have a COVID-19 vaccine by year-end and that Pfizer’s experimental remedy is “a very promising one”, with more expected. But the vaccine, based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, comes with special challenges as it needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below - equivalent to an Antarctic winter. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated the United Nations agency’s call for an equitable distribution of vaccine doses once they are available. Pfizer said on Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective as it disclosed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test. The safety data on its vaccine with BioNTech SE could come later this month. “As we have been predicting, we will have a vaccine at the end of this year. And the Pfizer one is a very promising one,” Tedros told the WHO’s annual ministerial meeting. “And we will also expect more and more,” he added.

-4.306373435689051," 'It seems too early' - in Europe, safety concerns dampen excitement over COVID-19 vaccine LISBON (Reuters) - Some Europeans on Tuesday injected a dose of caution into the excitement which greeted news that Pfizer’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective in initial trials, expressing doubts about whether they would have the shot. Scientists and public health officials on Monday welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that could help turn the tide of the pandemic if the full trial results pan out. But reaction from the streets of Rome, London and Madrid, as well as on social media, revealed that hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine extended beyond staunch ‘anti-vaxxers’ as even those who have been vaccinated for other diseases considered skipping this one, for now. “I think it’s good news if it’s effective, but I think it’s very difficult because it’s very early,” nursing assistant Maite Flores, 64, from Madrid told Reuters. “I’m fully vaccinated, and so are both of my children. I’m not anti-vax but I still wouldn’t touch it,” mother-of-two Charlotte Bordewey, 31, of Hereford, England, said on Facebook. “It’s the time scale. For something to be squeezed out this fast, without knowing long-term effects, is difficult to go with. There are too many unknowns at this point,” she told Reuters. Others, while not ruling out having a COVID-19 vaccine, said they would need more information before deciding. “I do not trust it yet, we have to wait,” pharmacist Carla Consalvo said in Rome. “It seems to be too early to have discovered it.” “I’d be paying attention to learn more about it before I got the whole family straight in there,” said organisational design consultant Peter Brownell in London. While the interim results are encouraging, Pfizer and partner BioNTech still have to disclose safety data for their experimental vaccine before seeking regulatory approval. Other COVID-19 vaccine developers are in the final stage of testing. In September, drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence, pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards even as they work at break-neck speed in a quest for a shot. Regulators around the world have said speed will not compromise safety, as quicker results would stem from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence. A global poll by the World Economic Forum this month showed 73% of people would be willing to have a vaccine against COVID-19, a four-point fall since August. The World Health Organization says 70% would need to have it in order to break transmission. Among those not intending to have the vaccine, the most common reasons were worry about possible side effects and the speed with which they were moving through clinical trials. But for most the news was welcome relief, bringing hope for an end to the pandemic which has killed more than a million people and battered the world’s economy. “The truth is the situation is untenable and I believe that taking some risk is always convenient in this situation,” 75-year-old Madrid pensioner Rafael Fernandez said. “I think that’s what we needed to hear. It gives you a boost to think that there’s a way out of this and that it’s happening soon,” said Asa Vaid, a counsellor from England."

-4.306373435689051," Biden hails progress on COVID-19 vaccine, White House seeks credit WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden hailed Pfizer Inc’s progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine on Monday but urged Americans to wear masks because it may not be widely available for many months, as President Donald Trump’s administration tried to claim credit. Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective here as it disclosed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test. That was major progress in the quest for a vaccine to combat a pandemic that has killed more than 237,000 Americans, thrown millions more out of work and contributed to Trump's defeat in last Tuesday's election. The drugmaker developed its vaccine outside of the White House’s Operation Warp Speed program, although the U.S. government placed an initial order in July for 100 million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses for $1.95 billion and can acquire up to 500 million additional doses. Operation Warp Speed pumped billions of dollars into six other pharmaceutical companies intended to accelerate development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer also was one of a number of companies to be part of a public-private partnership launched by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in April to speed COVID-19 vaccine and treatment options. Vice President Mike Pence on Twitter credited a “public-private partnership” forged by Trump for Pfizer’s vaccine development progress. Biden, who said his advisers had been told of the breakthrough on Sunday night, in a statement called Pfizer’s announcement “great news” but said it would be “many more months” before widespread vaccination is available in the United States. “As we work toward a safe and effective vaccine, we know the single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID is wear a mask,” Biden, who made his criticism of Trump’s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign, told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware. The United States has been registering record-high infection numbers in recent days. Mask wearing has become a political issue in the United States, with Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask during the campaign and many conservatives contending masks infringe on their individual freedom. Biden spoke two days after clinching election victory over Trump, who has not conceded defeat and is pursuing legal challenges to the results while making unsubstantiated claims of fraud. Trump on Twitter celebrated the vaccine announcement and resultant stock market gains: “STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!” Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., without evidence accused pharmaceutical companies of deliberately holding back clinical trial results until after the election. “They all knew it but kept it from the public on purpose,” Trump Jr. said on Twitter. “Big Pharma hates Trump for taking on the gouging of Americans with drug pricing while offering the same drugs elsewhere in the world for pennies in the dollar.” Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE were the first drugmakers to release successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. ‘I IMPLORE YOU’ Biden, set to take office on Jan. 20, conferred by video with a 13-member task force he has asked to devise a blueprint on combating the pandemic, headed by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University healthcare equity expert Marcella Nunez-Smith. “We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives. American lives,” Biden said, adding that “it won’t be forever.” “So please, I implore you: Wear a mask. Do it for yourself. Do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together,” Biden added. Biden during the campaign accused Trump of panicking and surrendering to the pandemic. Trump promoted unproven medicines, assailed public health experts, failed to signal empathy or compassion as the death toll mounted and disregarded advice on mask wearing and social distancing, ending up hospitalized in October receiving treatments for COVID-19. Housing Secretary Ben Carson and David Bossie, the lawyer charged with leading Trump’s post-election legal challenges, became the latest people in Trump’s orbit to test positive for COVID-19, just days after White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Biden cleared the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency on Saturday after four days of ballot counting. “This election is over,” Biden told reporters. “It’s time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric that is designed to demonize one another.” But senior Republican lawmakers continued to refuse to recognize Biden as the election winner. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump was fully within his rights to look into alleged voting irregularities, and in a Senate speech did not acknowledge Biden as president-elect. Trump’s re-election team asked for patience on Monday to pursue allegations of voter fraud. “This election is not over, far from it,” Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters at a briefing in what she said was her capacity as a Trump campaign adviser. Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging Pennsylvania’s mail-in voting system lacked the oversight and verification given in-person voting and seeking an emergency injunction to stop state officials from certifying Biden’s victory in the state. The Trump campaign and Republicans have brought numerous lawsuits alleging election irregularities. Judges have already tossed cases in Georgia and Michigan. Trump, apparently intent on settling scores within his administration in the aftermath of the election, announced on Twitter on Monday he had “terminated” Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Trump has been talking with his advisers about possibly running for president in 2024, a source familiar with the discussions said."
-4.306373435689051," METALS-Vaccine hopes hold copper near 29-month highs (Updates prices) LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Copper prices on Tuesday edged back towards 29-month highs as encouraging prospects of an effective coronavirus vaccine bolstered hopes for economic recovery and copper demand. European equities and oil prices rose for a second day after Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results. But U.S. stocks slipped and weak inflation data in China, the biggest metals consumer, dragged down equities there. The dollar also recouped some of Monday’s losses, pressuring metals by making them more expensive for buyers with other currencies. Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.3% at $6,936.50 a tonne at 1715 GMT after touching $7,054 on Monday, the highest since June 2018. Prices of the metal used in power and construction should move above $7,000 over the coming months as the dollar weakens and optimism builds that the coronavirus will be contained, said ING analyst Wenyu Yao. “Looking at the fundamentals, there is clearly after this pandemic a speed up of the pivot to renewable energy and decarbonisation, which is good for copper demand,” she said. VACCINE: While Pfizer reported success, Brazil suspended a clinical trial for China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine, one of the world’s front-runners, citing a severe adverse event. CHINA: China’s factory-gate prices fell at a sharper-than-expected pace in October, a sign of economic weakness that contrasts with brisk growth in exports and manufacturing activity. POSITIONING: Speculators are betting on higher copper prices, with a net long on the LME equivalent to 6.3% of active contracts as of Thursday, brokers Marex Spectron said. CHINA OUTPUT: Copper cathode output at China’s biggest copper smelters fell by 5.4% year-on-year in October due to maintenance at two major plants, researchers Antaike said. COLUMN: China’s copper import boom leaves other metals cold, writes Andy Home. OTHER METALS: LME aluminium was up 0.9% at $1,910.50 a tonne, zinc was 0.4% higher at $2,652, nickel rose 1% to $15,915, lead gained 1.8% to $1,865 and tin was 0.1% up at $18,300."
-4.306373435689051," Analysis: Will this time be different? Investors question the Treasury yield surge NEW YORK (Reuters) - A spurt higher in Treasury yields has investors wondering whether this time, the momentum will keep going. Investors rotated out of Treasuries, a popular safe-haven asset, and into sectors that could benefit from an economic upswing such as bank stocks and high-yield credit after Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective. That sent the benchmark 10-year yield to its highest since March, edging close to 1%, and the yield curve sharply steeper. Previous moves higher in yields, however, have petered out as the Federal Reserve’s near-zero interest rate policy has kept Treasury trading in a tight range. Some investors say this time may be different. “This was the ‘vaccine’ moment the rates market had waited for,” said analysts at ING. The “big difference here from previous moves is that we won’t need to take this back.” Higher Treasury yields can translate into higher borrowing costs and thus can slow growth. But the boost can also help savers and retirees who may rely on fixed income. Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance, said if people actually start getting vaccinated and COVID-19 case counts drop, “I would expect the Fed to start thinking about changing their 2023 outlook to 2022 or maybe even the last half of 2021 to start raising rates.” The eurodollar curve from 2022-2024, a proxy for the market’s expectation of rate hikes, surged on Monday, noted Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. That was striking, he said, as it suggested a vaccine “may in fact be much more important in disrupting the Fed’s ‘zero forever’ policy than fiscal stimulus might ever be.” Still, there is skepticism that the move higher in yields would be sustained in the long run. There remains the possibility of gridlock in Washington that might hold up the passage of a stimulus bill. What’s more, it isn’t clear how long it might take for a vaccine to be approved by regulators and then rolled out. “I still believe we are range-bound and will drift lower in yields over the next year,” said Scott Burg, chief investment officer at hedge fund Deer Park Road. That was seen to some extent in derivatives trading on Monday with bets on the TLT exchange-traded fund, which tracks longer-dated Treasuries, according to Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Investment Group. There had been TLT bets “both ways” on Monday, he said, including a buyer of a call spread “looking for TLT higher and yields lower, saying that this is an over-reaction and things are not going to progress as quickly as the market is all of a sudden thinking.” That was a contrast to last week, when traders pulled out of bearish bets that long-dated Treasury yields would rise, when it seemed clear Joe Biden had won the presidency but that his Democratic party would face a divided Congress. That drove volume in put options on TLT to the highest since June 2019 on Wednesday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert. The prospect of gridlock in Washington is one argument for little movement on fiscal policy, and therefore, little movement in U.S. Treasury yields, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. While a divided Congress is still likely to pass a coronavirus stimulus bill, investors say the amount may be smaller than was expected if there had been a broad Democratic victory. “The election result seems like it will take between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion out of fiscal stimulus. So that’s going to push pretty heavily on the Fed,” said Ablin. Purves said the risk to the market is if Congress coalesces around a lower fiscal package thinking that a vaccine is around the corner, but ultimately vaccine news disappoints. That would make the rotation trade into more economically sensitive assets more vulnerable. “Let’s see if we get follow-through on this rotation and Treasury sell-off,” said Purves. “We have our doubts.”"
-4.306373435689051," BioNTech to price vaccine below market rates, differentiate between regions FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech, first in the race to disclose interim data from a large-scale trial showing a highly effective COVID-19 vaccine, is planning to price the two-shot regimen below “typical market rates” and would differentiate pricing between countries or regions. Speaking at a Financial Times online event, the German biotech firm’s strategy head Ryan Richardson said the price tag of the vaccine, which is co-developed with Pfizer and which has yet to win regulatory approval, would reflect the financial risks that its private-sector investors have incurred. “We’ve tried to pursue a balanced approach that recognises that innovation requires capital and investment so we plan to price our vaccine well below typical market rates reflecting the situation that we’re in and with the goal to insure broad-based access around the world,” Richardson said at the FT event. “I expect there to be differential pricing in certain regions of the world,” he added, declining to elaborate on the different price tags. The vaccine was on Monday shown to be 90% effective, based on preliminary trial results, a key milestone in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world’s economy. In July Pfizer had agreed with the U.S. government the supply of 100 million doses of its potential vaccine at a price of $39 for a two-dose immunisation, or $19.5 per dose, with the option to sell another 500 million doses under conditions to be negotiated separately. Later on Tuesday, Richardson signalled that order size would impact the per-dose price in the developed world. The European Commission will discuss on Wednesday the adoption of a supply contract with Pfizer and BioNTech. The bloc earlier this week said a contract for up to 300 million doses was close to being signed, without providing financial terms. In the FT briefing, Richardson also said that the two partners’ goal to supply 1.3 billion doses in 2021 would be the result of a ramping-up of efforts well into the second half of next year. While there would be “significant supply” during the first half, scaling up output would continue throughout 2021. BioNTech’s strategy chief stressed that, even though the German group had received public-sector backing, the risks taken by its investors would merit some financial rewards from a future vaccine. “We incurred considerable financial risk. We have raised capital in the capital market,” he said. Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), said at the FT event that the Pfizer and BioNTech project was the only one among the 10 leading vaccine developers that had not received “substantial public sector financing”. In June the European Investment Bank, the EU’s financial arm, awarded BioNTech 100 million euros in debt financing for its COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing. Germany’s research ministry in September granted BioNTech 375 million euros, subject to meeting certain milestones, also to ramp up vaccine development and production."
-4.306373435689051," COVID vaccine breakthrough raises hopes, poses logistical headache BERLIN (Reuters) - Monday’s potential breakthrough in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine has left governments scrambling to meet the logistical challenge of distributing hundreds of millions of doses once it becomes available in coming months. Interim trial data showed the experimental vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.DE was 90% effective, spurring hopes of an end to a pandemic that has cost more than a million lives and crashed the world's major economies. With the two groups expecting to produce some 50 million doses by the end of the year and 1.3 billion doses next year, assuming regulatory approval, German Health Minister Jens Spahn, said the vaccine was a “light at the end of the tunnel”. Both the United States and the European Union have agreements to secure hundreds of millions of doses of the drug, but authorities will need sophisticated planning and logistics to ensure they are distributed effectively. BioNTech said it was planning to price the two-shot regimen below “typical market rates” and would differentiate pricing between countries or regions. But the vaccine must be shipped and centrally stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, putting it out of reach for the moment of many poor countries in Asia and elsewhere which lack the necessary refrigeration equipment. Needing temperatures matching an Antarctic winter, it is likely to need centralized vaccination locations, Swiss health experts said on Tuesday. “The exciting news yesterday (Monday) of a possible effective vaccine becoming available presages significant cold chains challenges for African countries by the type of vaccine that that is,” Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa, told a ministerial assembly. “Which will need to be factored into the support to be provided.” Thermal boxes would preserve the ultra-low temperatures for up to 10 days for ambient temperatures of up to 25 Celsius without opening them and up to 15 days if the boxes are opened and then re-iced, BioNTech said in presentation slides. As previously announced, the vaccine can be kept for up to five days at fridge temperatures. ‘TOO MANY UNKNOWNS’ U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said on Tuesday the United States, which has a $2 billion contract for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, could receive 20 million doses per month starting at the end of this month if Pfizer moves as quickly as expected to secure regulatory approval. For its part, the European Commission, which is negotiating with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, is expected to sign off on a deal on Wednesday to secure 300 million doses of the vaccine. Britain, which expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine available by the end of the year, asked the National Health Service to be ready to deploy any COVID vaccine from the start of December. European logistics specialists said they were capable of meeting the challenge of ultra-cold storage. ""Distribution will not fail because of logistics,"" Frank Appel, chief executive of Germany's Deutsche Post DWPGn.DE, told journalists. The group said it was already talking to pharmaceutical companies and governments on the details, including the need for cooling. Deutsche Post said its contract logistics division operates in more than 180 locations worldwide, tailored to the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, where sensitive medical products can be stored and packaged at different temperatures. With Germany expecting to receive 100 million doses of the vaccine, authorities in Berlin also expect to draw on the military to help manage storage. A government source in Italy said the army was also likely to be called on to help manage storage and distribution. Some Europeans however injected a dose of caution into the general euphoria about the vaccine. “I think it’s good news if it’s effective, but I think it’s very difficult because it’s very early,” nursing assistant Maite Flores, 64, from Madrid told Reuters. “I’m fully vaccinated, and so are both of my children. I’m not anti-vax but I still wouldn’t touch it,” mother-of-two Charlotte Bordewey, 31, of Hereford, England, said on Facebook. “It’s the time scale. For something to be squeezed out this fast, without knowing long-term effects, is difficult to go with,” she told Reuters. “There’s too many unknowns at this point.”"
-4.306373435689051," Swiss plan for centres to deliver deep-chilled COVID vaccine ZURICH (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate is likely to need centralized vaccination locations, Swiss health experts said on Tuesday, as it must be stored at temperatures matching an Antarctic winter. U.S.-based Pfizer PFE.N and Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.DE said on Monday their mRNA vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective based on initial results, giving global markets an unexpected boost. However, health experts have cautioned such a vaccine comes with special challenges because the genetic material it consists of must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. This could complicate any inoculation programme, particularly in regions such as parts of Asia or Africa where the climate is warm, distances vast and the required infrastructure may be lacking. The World Health Organization called the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine data “exciting,” but said it “presages significant cold chain challenges for African countries”. Thomas Steffen, Basel’s cantonal doctor and a board member of the Swiss Doctors Association, said groups considering distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine are working with different scenarios, including for one like Pfizer’s. “We have to have a solution if we need to chill the vaccine to minus 70 degrees, and in that case organise the distribution ... differently than if it were stored at a temperature of a refrigerator,” Steffen told a Bern briefing, adding that this was likely to mean using centres. Switzerland, whose neighbour Germany has already said it is planning centralized inoculation centres, on Tuesday reported nearly 6,000 new coronavirus infections and 107 new deaths. The Swiss have reserved nearly 10 million doses of vaccine candidates that both AstraZeneca AZN.L and MRNA.O Moderna are developing, should they pass trials. And the country is in talks with other manufacturers, including Pfizer and BioNTech, over extra agreements, a Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force member has told Reuters."
-4.306373435689051," BioNTech says vaccine pricing benchmark is for similar volumes FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech BNTX.O on Tuesday signalled that order size would impact the per-dose price for its potential COVID-19 vaccine in the developed world. “The price for the U.S. for the first 100 million doses was $19.50 per dose,” said BioNTech’s Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Richardson in an analyst call after the release of third-quarter results on Tuesday. He was referring to a July deal struck by partner Pfizer PFE.N with the U.S. government for the supply of the vaccine. “You can think about that as a benchmark for how we would price the vaccine to the developed world for similar volumes,” he added. The vaccine was on Monday shown to be 90% effective, based on preliminary trial results, a major milestone in the war against a virus that has killed more than a million people and battered the world’s economy. Richardson said at an earlier event on Tuesday that even though the German group had received some public-sector funds, the product price would partly reflect the risks taken by its investors. The company on Tuesday also said it would use special thermal shipping boxes to transport vials once they are taken out of ultra-low temperature storage. The vaccine, which belongs to a class known as messenger RNA, will have to be shipped and centrally stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said on Monday.The thermal boxes would preserve the ultra-low temperatures for up to 10 days for ambient temperatures of up to 25 degrees Celsius without opening them and up to 15 days if the boxes are opened and then re-iced, BioNTech said in presentation slides. As previously announced, the vaccine can be kept for up to five days at fridge temperatures. During the analyst call on Tuesday, Sahin said participants on placebo in a control group could at some point no longer be denied the vaccine when its efficacy is further confirmed. But for lack of a placebo group, longer-term insight could still be gleaned afterwards by using general infection statistics among the non-vaccinated population as comparison. “This might give us indirect evidence ... by comparison of epidemiological data, how this long-term protection could evolve,” he said."
-4.306373435689051," How Pfizer vaccine could be cold comfort for some Asian nations TOKYO/SEOUL/MANILA (Reuters) - With tropical heat, remote island communities and a dearth of ultra-cold freezers, many Asian countries aren’t betting on Pfizer’s experimental vaccine solving their COVID-19 crisis any time soon. The world cheered on Monday when Pfizer Inc announced its shot, jointly developed with BioNTech SE, was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results. Yet health experts cautioned that the vaccine, should it be approved, was no silver bullet - not least because the genetic material it’s made from needs to be stored at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below. Such requirements pose a particularly daunting challenge for countries in Asia, as well as in places like Africa and Latin America, where intense heat is often compounded by poor infrastructure that will make it difficult to keep the “cold chain” intact during deliveries to rural areas and islands. That is a problem for everyone in the world, given the World Health Organization estimates about 70% of people must be inoculated to end the pandemic, and Asia alone is home to more than 4.6 billion - or three-fifths of the global population. Some Asian countries are prioritising containing the novel coronavirus rather than looking to stockpile vaccines, while others are looking for alternatives to the messenger RNA technology used by Pfizer that requires such ultra-cold storage. “On the cold chain requirement of -70 degrees, that is a hefty requirement. We do not have such facility,” Philippines’ Health Secretary Francisco Duque told Reuters. “We will have to wait and see for now,” he added. “The technology Pfizer is using is new technology. We don’t have experience with that, so risks can be high.” Pfizer told Reuters that it had developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring. “We have also developed packaging and storage innovations to be fit for purpose for the range of locations where we believe vaccinations will take place,” it said. ‘VACCINE IS STORY FOR FUTURE’ Yet even wealthier nations like South Korea and Japan are managing expectations. “Storage is going to be a big challenge for us,” said Fumie Sakamoto, infection control manager at St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo. “I’m not sure how well prepared our government is with regards to maintaining the cold chain. Hospitals in Japan usually do not have ultra-cold freezers, but I think it’s high time we started thinking about the logistics for the vaccine.” Japan is among three countries in Asia Pacific that have announced supply deals for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It has signed a deal for 120 million doses, while Australia has secured 10 million doses and China’s Fosun has secured 10 million doses for Hong Kong and Macau. Japan’s PHC Corp, which supplies medical freezers, told Reuters that demand had shot up 150% this year and that they were increasing production to meet demand. Kwon Jun-wook, an official at South Korea’s Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), said it wanted to see how vaccination progressed in other countries first and would thoroughly review its supply chain. The country had recently experienced the problems of cold storage when it had to discard about 5 million doses of flu vaccines because they were not stored at recommended temperatures. A 2018 study commissioned by the agency found that only a quarter of 2,200 private clinics it surveyed had medical refrigerators, with 40% using household refrigerators. For some countries, it’s still very early days. Indonesia, whose 273 million people are scattered over more than 17,000 islands, is considering a variety of vaccines, but the Pfizer one is not yet among them, said Airlangga Hartarto, who heads the country’s COVID-19 response team. Vietnam, which successfully contained its outbreak through aggressive mass testing and strict border controls, said it would continue to focus on containment effort. “The vaccine is a story for the future,” Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, told a government meeting on Friday. “Demand is far higher than supply, and we have to pay large deposits to secure our position, which I see as very high risk and a waste of money and time.”"

Italy, one of the European countries hardest hit by the pandemic, will be allocated 13.6% of the first 200 million doses made available to the European Union, the source said. The European Commission will approve a contract for the supply of the COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the two companies, its President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement on Tuesday. The EU bloc is set to secure 200 million doses with an option for another 100 million. “Under the common framework agreement, Italy will receive some 13.6% of the first 200 million doses, with 3.4 million doses expected as early as in January, provided the European Medicine Authority approves the vaccine in December,” the source said. The initial supply would immunize 1.7 million people as the vaccine requires an initial shot followed by a booster 21 days later. On Monday, Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, in a major victory in the fight against the global pandemic.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 - news which lifted global markets with a wave of risk appetite, which subsided somewhat overnight before re-igniting on Tuesday. The dollar rose after the announcement. Although the dollar is a safe-haven, and so typically falls on positive news, analysts said the move was caused by investors quitting long positions in other major safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar edged up slightly and stayed close to the previous session’s highs, as market participants tempered their initial pro-risk reaction, in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out. Neil Jones, head of FX sales for financial institutions at Mizuho, said he expected the risk-on moves to continue. “I don’t think it’s over and don’t think the foreign exchange market will become completely skeptical,” he said. “It will not write off the prospect of a vaccine – even though we need more clarity in terms of the distribution, quantities, timeline, and to whom,” he said. “On balance, that optimism will remain for now.” At 1229, the dollar was at 92.792 against a basket of currencies, slightly up on the day. The dollar has lost around 1.4% this month as Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential election provided a major boost to market sentiment. The Japanese yen, which had its biggest one-day fall since March after the vaccine announcement, clawed back some of its losses but was still relatively weak at 105.155 at 1220 GMT. “Following a euphoric market reaction such as that the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,” wrote Commerzbank FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients. “Even if the news of a vaccine could be a game changer, we urge caution, as the massive euphoria could be followed by some disenchantment,” she said. Euro-dollar was broadly flat on the day at $1.1815. In the previous session it rose to as high as $1.192, but went no further, which Mizuho’s Jones said could be due to the European Central Bank having signalled its awareness of the downsides of rapid euro strength. “The market is a little bit concerned about repeat verbal intervention in the euro around the 1.20 area so I think sellers maybe dropped their offers down lower than that 1.20, thinking that that might be the limit of the upside,” Jones said. The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - was broadly flat on the day versus the dollar, as its jump in the immediate aftermath of the vaccine news proved short-lived. The New Zealand dollar was up 0.2%, in its seventh consecutive session of gains. The Norwegian crown, which also benefited from the vaccine news, extended its gains versus the euro on Tuesday, up 0.4% on the day at 10.644. China’s offshore yuan, which has been gradually strengthening since May, hit new 2.5-year highs versus the U.S. dollar on Monday but eased some gains on Tuesday, up 0.2% on the day at 6.6028 at 1228 GMT. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to push ahead with legal challenges to the presidential election results and will hold a series of campaign-style rallies to build support."

Pfizer Inc’s announcement that its vaccine was more than 90% effective in tests come as Senate Republicans and House Democrats are in a standoff over the health of the economy and investors are closely watching any movement over talks. Democrats have pushed for a $2 trillion package, with support for state and local governments that are facing steep layoffs, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pushed back, arguing Congress should enact a smaller coronavirus stimulus package highly targeted at the pandemic’s effects. “You have to assume in general that whatever level stimulus you would have received will probably be less because policy makers will say that the economy will mend,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. Equity Strategist for Credit Suisse. The vaccine news came after the United States became the first country to cross more than 10 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally. New Jersey joined some other U.S. Northeast states on Monday by reimposing economic restrictions such as closing indoor dining by 10 p.m. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO, cautioned that stimulus relief was still required to minimize the pandemic’s economic and social effects. The “inclination is to argue that the fiscal support is no longer needed. That would be wrong,” he tweeted. Talks for another stimulus bill will likely be affected by polls for two open U.S. Senate seats at play in the Jan. 5 run-off elections in Georgia, said Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, who cautioned that the U.S. economy remains weak. “Even with a vaccine we need stimulus,” she said, adding that the risk is that any further relief bills will “be about politics and not about need.” While another stimulus bill would likely extend the market rally, the lack of a relief package now will not sink stocks or investor sentiment as much as before Pfizer’s news, said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co. “The downside risk of what does a world looks like in a no-stimulus scenario is frankly less disastrous to the market than it was yesterday,” he said. “We now appear to have blue skies ahead if all of this is as positive as it looks.” As investors moved into riskier assets on Monday, stocks hit record peaks while benchmark 10-year Treasury rates jumped to their highest since March, when the U.S. economy froze under lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. Expectations for an imminent vaccine will likely push interest rates higher as investors price in an economic rebound next year, said Jabaz Mathai, head of U.S. rates strategy at Citigroup, wrote in a note Monday. “Nevertheless, a stimulus package would be ideal to create a bridge for the economy.” Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said a vaccine reduced the need for a stimulus but said if it was not available to the general public until March or April, “we might need something to bridge that.” Markets could continue to rally even if new stimulus is pushed to next year, said Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. The dollar -- which is considered to be a safe haven and so typically falls on positive news -- rose after the announcement, as investors quit their long positions in safe currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The safe-haven Japanese yen tumbled to a 20-day low versus the dollar. But these moves eased on Tuesday, with the yen and franc clawing back some of their losses , as market participants tempered their initial pro-risk reaction, in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out. “Following a euphoric market reaction such as that the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,” wrote Commerzbank FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients. “Even if the news of a vaccine could be a game changer, we urge caution, as the massive euphoria could be followed by some disenchantment,” she said. But Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said that despite the uncertainties “it is still an important step forward to exit the COVID crisis and provides a reminder not to bet against human ingenuity”. “It supports our baseline assumption behind our FX Outlook that effective vaccines will be implemented next year,” he added. “Further positive progress on vaccines will allow currencies which have been hit hard by the COVID crisis to continue to rebound.” At 0813 GMT, the dollar index was at 92.730, broadly flat on the day and up around 0.3% since Pfizer’s announcement on Monday . The dollar has lost around 1.4% this month as Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential election provided a major boost to market sentiment. Euro-dollar was up around 0.1% at $1.18315, having fallen as the dollar strengthened in the previous session. The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - was up just 0.1% versus the U.S. dollar as the boost from the vaccine news proved short-lived. The New Zealand dollar was up 0.2%, in its seventh consecutive session of gains. The Norwegian crown, which also benefited from the vaccine news, extended its gains versus the euro on Tuesday, up 0.3% on the day at 10.652.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. While a jump in longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields helped push the yen to its biggest loss overnight since March, analysts said the currency pared losses as some traders took profit on the dollar. In afternoon Asian trade, the yen firmed to 104.97 against the dollar. Against the Australian dollar, the yen fetched 76.43, having lost more than 2% overnight. “What’s important about the overnight movement is that it overturned the current trend of the U.S. dollar falling, instead of the yen, when the market turns risk-on,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. “The yuan and euro have been rising against the dollar as equities jumped on Joe Biden’s election win... But the overnight movement flipped things back to the way it is when markets usually turn risk-on: U.S. Treasury yields rise and the yen depreciates more than the dollar.” The vaccine news comes as the global tally of COVID-19 infections reached 50.68 million on Monday, stoking worries of more lockdown measures across the globe. But markets got a bit over-excited following the vaccine news considering the trial results are still preliminary, said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. Indeed, many questions about the vaccine are yet to be answered, such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long immunity may last. “Perhaps the market did over-react to the vaccine, given there’s still some way to go prove that it’s safe,” said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer. “What they’ve shown is that it’s reasonably effective, safety is another stage. Once the market looked into the finer print of what these results were, maybe they backed off the trade a bit.” Riskier currency such as the Australian dollar steadied at $0.7281 against its U.S. counterpart, near a seven-week high touched on Monday as traders digested the vaccine news. Across the Tasman sea, the New Zealand dollar last sat at 0.6833 per U.S. dollar, up 0.23% in Asian trade. The euro was moderately higher at 1.1834, after dropping more than 0.4% overnight. The prospects of a Biden presidency has boosted risk sentiment as many believe it could boost international trade relations and maintain an easy monetary policy. Still, incumbent Donald Trump has made no sign of conceding and his campaign is planning a series of rallies to build support for legal fights challenging the election results. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said President Donald Trump was completely within his rights to look into “irregularities” from the election. Trump also said he had “terminated” Defense Secretary Mark Esper, signalling he may use his final months in office after defeat at the polls to settle scores within his administration. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar held steady at 92.65, slightly above Monday’s 10-week trough of 92.12. Sterling firmed 0.21% to $1.3187 against the greenback, near a nine-week high it touched in the previous session.

-4.306373435689051," Olympics: Organisers say fears of virus banished by success of test event TOKYO (Reuters) - Organisers of a weekend international gymnastics meet in Tokyo, seen as a major test ahead of next year’s postponed Olympic Games, lauded on Tuesday the success of the event, saying the athletes’ fear of the coronavirus had been replaced by joy. Adding to the optimism was news that Pfizer Inc’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective, based on initial trials, though Olympics organisers have said their Games do not depend on a vaccine. Sunday’s event, involving athletes from Japan, China, Russia and the United States, went off largely without a hitch as the Federation International de Gymnastique (FIG) and the Japanese Gymnastics Association (JGA) tested various measures against the novel coronavirus. All athletes and staff took daily PCR tests during their time in Japan and their movements were heavily restricted. Likewise, the 2,000 fans allowed into the Yoyogi National Gymnasium on Sunday had their temperatures checked upon entry. The JGA confirmed on Tuesday that there had been no positive tests among athletes or staff. FIG President Morinari Watanabe praised the athletes’ attitude and said their confidence had been bolstered. “When they arrived in Japan, you could see fear in their eyes,” Watanabe said,, following a meeting with Tokyo 2020 organisers. “They were worried they might be infected and you can see that fear deep into their eyes. But each day that they spent time in Japan, they managed to ease their fears.” “At the end of the day you could see the joy in their eyes.” Watanabe said he had been contacted by organisers of the Paris 2024 Games, who had expressed their encouragement. Tokyo 2020 organisers also welcomed the news about Pfizer Inc’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine. “I heard about the vaccine and I think we all felt positive and a sense of relief at this news, all of us at Tokyo 2020 too,” said Games Delivery Officer Hidemasa Nakamura. However, Olympics organisers have long stressed a vaccine is not needed for next year’s Games to go ahead and Nakamura said the vaccine has not been used yet and so was not part of the preparations."
-4.306373435689051," Australian dollar dips, traders cautiously welcome vaccine news SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian dollar traded slightly lower against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday while the New Zealand dollar was marginally higher, as traders weighed news about progress in the development of a coronavirus vaccine. The Aussie was trading 0.03% lower at $0.7277 AUD=D3 on Tuesday Sydney time, having hit its highest level in two months in late intraday trading on Monday at $0.7340 after Pfizer Inc PFE.N said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. The currency later lost some of its gains to close flat on Monday. Pfizer’s vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, the drugmaker said on Monday. But even if it gets regulatory approvals, mass rollouts will not happen this year. “Perhaps the market did overreact to the vaccine, given there’s still some way to go prove that it’s safe,” said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer. “What they’ve shown is that it’s reasonably effective, safety is another stage. Once the market looked into the finer print of what these results were, maybe they backed off the trade a bit.” The New Zealand dollar was 0.18% higher to $0.6830 NZD=D3 on Tuesday, which was also lower than the intraday high of $0.6854 on Monday when traders reacted to Joe Biden's clinching of the U.S. presidency over the weekend and the vaccine news. The antipodean currencies had weakened in recent weeks as their central banks signalled further monetary policy easing to rescue their economies from the coronavirus crisis. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this month cut and vowed to maintain its cash rate at 0.10% and shifted to quantitative easing (QE), while its counterpart in New Zealand is expected to announce a cheap funding facility for banks on Wednesday and cut rates below zero next year. Australian yields had been falling after the RBA’s bond-buying announcement, but bonds were now tracking the direction of U.S. rates, which were sold off following Pfizer’s findings. On Tuesday, ten-year Australian bond yields AU10YT=RR were 13 basis points higher at 0.91%, while three-year bonds AU3YT=RR were half a tick higher at 0.11%. The mirroring dynamic was likely to continue while the trajectory of yields in the near term was uncertain, analysts said. Control of the U.S. Senate won’t be known until January, and rolling out an effective vaccine to enough people is unlikely to be quick enough to prevent further restrictions on activity and movements. “It seems likely that more stimulus – monetary and fiscal – is likely to come. With COVID-19 cases reaching new highs in the U.S., it is hard to see the services sector growing strongly in the near term,” Australia and New Zealand Banking Group strategists said. “[But] the combination of a slowing recovery and possible lacklustre fiscal support will likely lead to the Fed providing more stimulus, most likely through more bond purchases. This should cap the upside in yields.”"
-4.306373435689051," Pfizer, BioNTech initial vaccine results impress, but scientists remain cautious CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday said initial trial results for Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine far outpaced their expectations for protection against a completely new disease, but that many questions remain unanswered. The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus. The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine. The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19. Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people. “It gives you more power and more confidence,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. “When you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it’s much more likely to be real.” Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly. They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results. ‘REALLY ENCOURAGING’ BUT EARLY “These are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,” said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The full study is designed to show the vaccine is effective after 164 people fall ill. Pfizer said that may happen in the first or second week of December, when a panel of outside advisors to the Food and Drug Administration reviews the study results and decides whether to recommend authorizing its use. Gruber said he did not yet have a breakdown of how many of the first 94 infections occurred among Black or Latino participants, two communities hit hard by the disease. He also did he know exactly how many elderly people in the trial got sick. Older people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 So far, none of the 94 people in the initial analysis developed severe COVID-19. The FDA initially had requested that the interim data include at least five severe cases, but recently relaxed that requirement, Gruber said. “If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University. Gruber expects there will be some cases of severe disease before the trial ends. “Bottom line is we’re going to have to use the data we have and the high efficacy to give us confidence that we’re going to prevent severe infection,” he said. Scientists also want to understand whether the Pfizer vaccine fully prevents people from getting infected with the new coronavirus - a huge advantage in reducing transmission - or if it simply reduces the degree to which they become ill. “Ideally, we want to be able to completely protect from infection, but I think we all accept that these so-called first generation vaccines are more likely to prevent disease,” said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain’s University of Warwick. “And the subtlety there, which is important, is if you’re infected then you can still transmit the virus.” Pfizer intends to seek a broad approval for individuals aged 16 to 85, but the FDA and an advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make decisions about who should be first in line to get the initial doses, which will be scarce. If Pfizer wins emergency use authorization, Gruber said the company feels ethically bound to inform eligible trial participants who received a placebo that they are not protected against infection, and to offer them the vaccine in hopes of keeping them from dropping out of the trial."
-4.306373435689051," Pfizer, BioNTech initial vaccine results impress, but scientists remain cautious CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday said initial trial results for Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine far outpaced their expectations for protection against a completely new disease, but that many questions remain unanswered. The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus. The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine. The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19. Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people. “It gives you more power and more confidence,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. “When you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it’s much more likely to be real.” Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly. They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results. ‘REALLY ENCOURAGING’ BUT EARLY “These are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,” said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

-4.306373435689051," Expert Views: Pfizer, BioNTech say their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study, a major victory in the fight against the pandemic. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. Following are reactions to the news. Scientists’ reactions ALEXANDER GINTSBURG, DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW’S GAMALEYA INSTITUTE WHICH DEVELOPED RUSSIA’S MAIN VACCINE CANDIDATE, SPUTNIK V “We welcome the progress shown by our foreign colleagues in the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus. The more vaccines are available in the world, the better people will be protected. “People at high risk of infection - primarily medical workers - are already being actively vaccinated in our country. Production is being scaled up and new production sites are joining the process. In the near future we expect to publish interim results of the post-registration trial of the vaccine Sputnik V, the so-called Phase III trials. I am sure that its effectiveness level will also be high.” CLEMENS WENDTNER, CHIEF PHYSICIAN OF INFECTIOLOGY AND TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEAD OF THE SPECIAL UNIT FOR HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS LIFE-THREATENING INFECTIONS, MUNICH SCHWABING CLINIC, GERMANY “This is remarkable, as many ongoing vaccination studies on COVID-19 currently only assume a success rate of at least 50%. In addition, it should be emphasized that a sharp end point has been defined - infection yes or no. Alternatively, with less high expectations of a vaccine, already attenuated disease courses, so-called mitigated courses, could be considered a success. In addition, the mRNA vaccination appears to be effective after only four weeks, which means that one does not have to wait long for protection.” WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, UNITED STATES “This is a hint that these mRNA vaccines are likely to work, and there’s at least one other. And they’re likely to be safe, at least from this trial. So that’s highly encouraging. The other thing that’s highly encouraging is that science can now create a vaccine in a relatively short amount of time and test it, which gives a lot of hope for the future when these things happen again.” ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, BRITAIN “This vaccine needs to be stored at -80c. This could create major logistical challenges for mass treatment outside major urban areas and in low or middle income countries.” “However, overall this is a huge step forwards in the fight against COVID-19. We will need to see whether updated versions of this vaccine are needed to protect people against new strains of the virus which might emerge in future.” RICHARD HATCHETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CEPI COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS “These are hugely positive and encouraging interim results and are testament to the ingenuity and skill of the scientific community in advancing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. We commend Pfizer/BioNTech on this historic interim result and the speed at which they have advanced through clinical development. “We believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.” PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BRITAIN “This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general. “Of course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.” ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, BRITAIN “At face value, this is exceptionally good news: a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 and with millions of doses available by the end of the year. “However, the full data set on which the claim is based has not yet been released and so we don’t know exactly what has been found.” LAWRENCE YOUNG, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, BRITAIN “It’s hard to interpret the interim analysis, but it does appear very encouraging.” “In this... preliminary analysis there is a significant reduction in the COVID-19, and I interpret that to mean that ... individuals are not developing disease, but it doesn’t tell us anything about whether people are getting infected or not.” JOHN MOORE, PROFESSOR AT WEILL CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY “I can see nothing problematic.” As for what this means for other vaccines, Moore said: “Moderna’s is likely to work as well given the similar design and performance, and Novavax also, as it seems more potent. It’s harder to judge about the other candidates.” MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, BRITAIN “This cautiously sounds like an excellent result from the phase 3 trials, but we should remain a little cautious. The provisional findings are made available in a press release, and the study is ongoing. However, if the final results show an effectiveness of anywhere near 90% with response in elderly and ethnic minority populations, that is an excellent result for a first generation vaccine. “This has been seen before – the rapidly-produced ebola vaccine generated very high levels of effectiveness and exceeded all expectations. Equally, billions of dollars and numerous clinical trials have struggled to produce any form of vaccination against HIV. Science can be unpredictable.” AZRA GHANI, CHAIR IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON “These new results represent the first demonstration of substantial efficacy of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19 disease which is very welcome news. It is important to bear in mind that these are early results based on a relatively small number of cases. In addition, the efficacy estimate is based on seven days of follow-up of participants following the second dose; further data in the coming weeks and months will provide a better picture of longer-term vaccine efficacy.” WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES EXPERT AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES “The efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated. I would have been delighted with efficacy of 70% or 75%. 90% is very impressive for any vaccine. The study isn’t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.” IAN JONES, PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF READING, BRITAIN “Of all the vaccines currently in development the BioNtech product always looked like the most bang-per-buck as it is entirely focused on the part of the virus that binds to the human cell, the receptor binding domain. “The only things we will not know for some time is the longevity of the response in all age groups, but assuming antibody titres are high that should be at least as good as any other vaccine currently in trial.” JOHN BELL, REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO SITS ON THE UK GOVERNMENT’S VACCINE TASKFORCE, TOLD BBC RADIO: “I’m really delighted with this result for no other reason than it shows you you can make a vaccine against this little critter. As you know, there are many pathogens where we’ve tried for decades and never managed to get a vaccine, you know, malaria, HIV.” “Distribution of this is going to be challenging, and there’s a lot of complexities associated with that. But... that’s not the headline here. The headline is, we’ll solve those things if we need to. But... it rolls the pitch for other vaccines because I can’t see any reason now why we shouldn’t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease. “Our (Oxford’s) first interim analysis is also likely to be available in the very near future, and by that I mean weeks, not months. So, I’m pretty optimistic that given this result, we’ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well.” “When you look at the immunological responses you get from the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the ones from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and indeed even the Moderna vaccine. They all look about the same. So, I’m optimistic that that probably reflects similar levels of efficacy.” FLORIAN KRAMMER, PROFESSOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, USA “These are fantastic results. The efficacy could be higher than expected, and this probably means that - at least in the U.S. - there will be an application for approval very soon. Of course, it would be better to see age-specific data, but I suspect that these will be published soon. Frankly, this is the best news I have received since Jan. 10.” MARYLYN ADDO, HEAD OF TROPICAL MEDICINE SECTION, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER EPPENDORF (UKE), HAMBURG, GERMANY “These are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases. Primary data are not yet available and a peer-reviewed publication is still pending. We still have to wait for the exact data before we can make a final assessment. At present, there are still few details about the exact data, for example regarding different age groups and in which groups the 94 cases occurred exactly.” BERND SALZBERGER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL REGENSBURG, GERMANY “In the Pfizer/Biontech press release, the Phase II/III placebo-controlled observer-blinded study with the vaccine BNT162b2 reported a vaccine efficacy of over 90%. Although only a few events - a total of 94 cases - have been observed in the study so far, this is a very good result. No serious side effects have been reported - overall a very positive result, which will probably lead to an early approval.” GERD FAETKENHEUER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, CLINIC I FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COLOGNE, GERMANY “These are great and promising data. It is incredible that in such a short period of time this progress with the development of a vaccine and clinical trials within a few months has been achieved. The results on efficacy and safety so far are excellent. “I think this will have a major impact on our handling of the pandemic and I hope that large quantities of the vaccine will be available quickly. The researchers involved can only be congratulated”. DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON In terms of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, “it’s good news, but it’s not ‘overnight success’ good news”. Altmann cautioned that this and other potentially successful vaccines would still need to be approved and delivered to people across the world, and this will still take many months. He added, however: “I always felt optimistic, and my optimism remains strong.” Government reaction “Today’s news about the anti-COVID vaccine is encouraging. But caution is still needed. Scientific research is the real key to overcoming the emergency. In the meantime, we must never forget that the behaviour of each of us is essential to bend the curve.” “We welcome every advance made by the global efforts to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government is working intensively to as quickly as possible to give the Swiss people access to a safe and effective vaccine. We’ve signed two contracts already, with Moderna and AstraZeneca, and we’re currently in negotiations with additional, promising vaccine makers.” Corporate reaction LUCIO ROVATI, CEO OF ITALY’S ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, WHICH IS WORKING WITH TAKIS BIOTECH ON A COVID-19 VACCINE “This is important news. Nothing that was not expected. Anyway, great, great. The problem remains that the data is limited in duration, 28 days after the first inoculation. The problem will be to see how long the coverage lasts. But in any case it is already very important to know that there is an effective vaccine, also because it seems a vaccine well tolerated in the medium term. At the end of November data at two months will be available, as required by regulatory agencies, and so at the end of November (the vaccine) could already be approved.” “Congratulations to our Pfizer colleagues. We feel energized to move on and bring more vaccines to the world to fight against this pandemic.” Market reaction RUSSELL SILBERTSON, CO-HEAD OF DEVELOPED MARKET FX & RATES AT ASSET MANAGER NINETY ONE “If the bearish view embedded in markets was that there was no effective vaccine any time soon priced in, clearly that needs significant repricing now. “You couple (this morning’s news) with the sheer weight of all the stimulus in markets, and that’s a very strong economic upside scenario.” NIKESH PATEL, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, KEMPEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LONDON “This is the first news that allows governments to start planning ahead to when economies can properly start to reopen from lockdowns. That gives them more visibility and concreteness about what fiscal policy they can take. “Monetary policy can only go so far at this point and it needs to be a fiscal response for a real recovery and this kind of news is great as it allows governments to make that fiscal response without fear of endless support.” “Whilst we are not there yet, news that this vaccine could be highly effective is the best thing markets could hope for. Public health officials will remind us there is a long road ahead, and many challenges will be faced along the way, but there is an enormous sense of optimism today – light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s just hope the vaccine deniers won’t get in the way, but 2021 just got a lot brighter.” “The COVID-19 vaccine news adds to the positive risk tone in stocks and underpins high beta currencies vs the U.S. dollar. Any positive news on a vaccine is good news for the world economy and offers perspective for rebound/normalisation in 2021 growth.” “The bigger driver of the economic outlook is from the outside factors. Right now that means the development of a vaccine, which is why we are following news on this front closely.” “The base case we have already is that we are likely to get a vaccine by year-end and that it will be rolled out. So we do see news like this as positive. The worrying sign would be if we get negative news say on testing, that would hurt how we view the economic outlook.”"
-4.306373435689051," Factbox: Development of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech on Monday became the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said the vaccine was more than 90% effective and they have so far found no serious safety concerns, priming it for possible speedy regulatory approvals. Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. emergency use authorisation in the U.S. of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85 in coming weeks. To do so, it will need to have collected two months of safety follow-up data on around half of the study’s roughly 44,000 participants, expected in late November. Pfizer and BioNTech, which already collaborate to develop mRNA-based vaccines for influenza, currently expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine in 2020 - enough to protect 25 million people - and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Below are the main details of the vaccine and Pfizer’s progress on supply deals and potential approvals: - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay. - BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunisation effect of the vaccine would last for a year although that was not certain yet. - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July and the vaccine showed promise in second early trial. - The company has said it could file for emergency approval in the United States in November. - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and target clinical trials in April. - Testing of vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month."

-4.306373435689051," Oil prices drop as near-term demand concerns overshadow COVID-19 vaccine hopes MELBOURNE, Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices fell in early trade on Tuesday as concerns over demand in the near term in coronavirus-hit economies in Europe and the United States returned to haunt the market after an overnight surge on progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 81 cents, or 2%, to $39.48 a barrel at 0029 GMT, having jumped 8% on Monday, its biggest daily gain in more than five months, after drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said an experimental COVID-19 treatment was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results. “A viable vaccine is unequivocally game-changing for oil - a market where half of demand comes from moving people and things around,” JP Morgan said in a note “But as we have written previously, oil is a spot asset that must first clear current supply and demand imbalances before one-to-two-year out prices can rise.” Rystad Energy said lockdowns in Europe could result in the loss of a further 1 million barrels per day of oil demand by the end of this year, while it would take several more months before a vaccine would be available. “The fast-tracking of multiple vaccines doesn’t mitigate the risk that many U.S. states will have to return to some form of lockdown this autumn/winter,” Rystad Energy’s head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen said. Tuesday’s decline was tempered by comments from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, who said on Monday that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, together known as OPEC+, could take more oil off the market if demand slumps before the vaccine is available. OPEC+ agreed to cut supply by 7.7 million barrels per day from August through December to help support prices and then ease the cut to 5.7 million bpd from January.

-4.95063147460711," UK expects to get 10 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine this year LONDON (Reuters) - Britain expects to have 10 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s candidate COVID-19 vaccine available by the end of the year, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said there were several hurdles to go after its positive clinical trial results. Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a big gain in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people and battered the world’s economy. Johnson said Britain had now ordered 40 million doses of the candidate vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech BNTX.O, enough to give protection to a third of the population. His spokesman said 10 million doses were due by the end of 2020 pending regulatory approval. Johnson has said that the prospects of a vaccine are one cause for optimism that the situation will improve by spring, but said new lockdown rules in England still needed to be obeyed even though scientific progress was on the horizon. “We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used,” Johnson said, referring to the need to see safety data and for approval by regulators. “We absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution. The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment.” Johnson - who himself was hospitalised earlier this year after being stricken with COVID-19 - said that once the vaccine was approved, Britain would be ready to start using it. The health service woud lead a programme of distribution, with the elderly and frontline workers first in line. “I am hopeful, but not yet certain, that we could begin to see some vaccine by Christmas,” said England’s Deputy Chief Medical Office Jonathan Van-Tam. In all, the government has signed six supply deals for vaccine candidates, including Pfizer/BioNTech's and one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca AZN.L. John Bell, regius professor of medicine at University of Oxford who sits on the government’s vaccine taskforce, told BBC Radio he could not see “any reason now why we shouldn’t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease”. He added that he was “optimistic that given this result, we’ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well,” referring to Oxford’s own late-stage trial results he said would come in “weeks not months”. Asked if life would be returning to normal by the Spring, Oxford’s Bell said: “Yes, yes, yes.” “I’m probably the first guy to say that but...I will say that with some confidence.”"
-4.95063147460711," Vaccine news gives U.S. value stocks their big day NEW YORK (Reuters) - Value stocks notched their best one-day performance against their growth-focused peers ever, by one measure, after Monday’s news of an effective vaccine against the coronavirus sent investors into shares of companies expected to benefit the most from an economic recovery. Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a potentially major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, hammered the world’s economy and upended daily life. Shares of companies that have struggled for months under coronavirus-fueled lockdowns surged, with the S&P 500 index .SPX closing just shy of a record, and some investors believe the moves may have further to run if the vaccine news continues to be favorable. Value stocks tend to be companies that are more sensitive to the economy’s fluctuations. Here’s a look at today’s market action, as well as how value and growth have stacked up through the years. (GRAPHIC: Valuable day - ) Monday's percentage gain for the Russell 1000 Value Index .RLV exceeded that of the Russell 1000 Growth Index .RLG by 7.48%, the largest margin in history, driven by bets that the prospects of a working vaccine some time in the next few months could help industries that have suffered under coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions.

-4.95063147460711," Simon Property's results miss due to unpaid rents, retail bankruptcies (Reuters) - America's largest mall operator Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N on Monday missed quarterly estimates for earnings and lease income, as retailers ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic shut stores, paid lower rents or delayed payments. The company’s shares, which closed up nearly 30% following the success of drugmaker Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine raising hopes that shoppers could return to malls, were down about 5% after the closing bell. Simon’s properties, that include malls and lifestyle centers in the United States, were forced to close during pandemic-led lockdowns and the company was left behind with months of unpaid rents and bankruptcy of some of its biggest tenants. “We still have some unresolved amounts with certain larger national tenants who unfortunately are refusing to pay their contractual rent even though they are open and operating,” Chief Executive Officer David Simon told analysts. The company sued some retailers, including Gap Inc GPS.N, earlier this year for having failed to pay rents. Simon said the leasing environment was improving, with the mall operator signing long-term and pop-up lease deals with leading brands, including names like Prada, Ferrari and UGG. For the third quarter, however, mall and premium outlet occupancy was 91.4%, down from 92.9% recorded in the previous quarter, largely due to bankruptcies of some of its biggest tenants. Consumers wearing masks and following safety protocols were beginning to return to malls, Simon said, but warned that there were no guarantees the trend would continue as coronavirus cases hit new records in the U.S. Lease income fell about 24% to $993.8 million, compared with the estimate of $1.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Funds from operations was at $2.05 per share, well below the estimate of $2.28."

-4.95063147460711," COVID-19 vaccine could help fundamentally change pandemic's arc: WHO GENEVA (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday. Bruce Aylward told the WHO's annual ministerial assembly that interim results from Pfizer Inc's PFE.N late-stage vaccine trial were ""very positive"". “There is still much work to be done, this is just interim results...but some very positive results coming today which should hold great promise hopefully for the entire world as we move forward,” Aylward told the 194-member state forum. “By March as a result of the extraordinary work happening globally we could be in a position to fundamentally change the direction and the dynamic of this crisis,” he added. Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, raising hope as the pandemic accelerates with over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also welcomed the “encouraging vaccine news” in a tweet. The Pfizer-BioNTech candidate was not among the original nine vaccines forming part of a WHO-run “COVAX” facility to finance and distribute them fairly around the world. However, the companies have expressed interest in supplying the programme. The WHO has said more vaccines are under consideration. Pfizer and BioNTech said they expected to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine, raising the possibility of a regulatory decision as soon as December. Aylward gave an upbeat assessment of overall prospects. “In diagnostics we are in a position to massively expand testing globally, in therapeutics we have sufficient tools right now to substantially reduce the risk of dying from this disease and in the area of vaccines - with the news of today especially - we are on the verge of having the readiness in place to roll out doses for high-risk populations in the late first quarter, early 2nd quarter.” However, he warned that an “acute funding gap” of $4.5 billion could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries."

Speaking at a Financial Times online conference on healthcare on Monday, AstraZeneca senior executive team member, Ruud Dobber, said the first set of efficacy data from a large-scale study made him optimistic that AstraZeneca too would be able to follow up on positive results from early-stage trials. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer PFE.N and BioNTech's 22UAy.f experimental vaccine was shown to be more than 90% effective based on initial late-stage trial results, the companies said earlier in the day. British drugmaker AstraZeneca, working with the University of Oxford, expects to report late-stage trial data on its COVID-19 immunisation, another frontrunner, before year-end. “What we have seen in Phase I and Phase II - whether it is Pfizer or AstraZeneca with our Oxford vaccine - is that if you are able to generate neutralising antibodies and a good T-cell response that you can make the virus less hostile,” Dobber said. “The efficacy shown earlier today is incredibly promising and I really hope that more vaccine producers will showcase more or less the same results sooner rather than later,” he added. The Pfizer/BioNTech results were hailed by many as a gamechanger, including U.S. President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden, who have both taken very different approaches to tackle the pandemic and general healthcare. Dobber’s message to Biden and his administration was this: “Embrace innovation, be critical, but embrace innovation ... Let’s find a dialogue and let’s not fight too much about the political colour.” Biden on Monday said a coronavirus vaccine approval process must be guided by science, warning that a vaccine likely will not be available for months. Dobber also added that he foresees a strengthening of the Affordable Care Act under Biden, who has been very vocal of the benefits of the program implemented in 2010 when he was vice president in the Obama administration."

America dryness * Grain markets await USDA supply/demand update on Tuesday (Adds closing prices, USDA crop-progress data) CHICAGO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures reached a new four-year high on Monday as the first successful data from a late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial fueled hopes of the economy recovering quickly from the pandemic-driven crisis. Broad optimism about Pfizer’s vaccine trials added support to a soybean market already buoyed by strong Chinese demand and weather risks in South America. The “positive ramifications of Pfizer news today cannot be overstated,” said Rich Feltes, a grain analyst and head of market insights for U.S. futures brokerage RJ O’Brien. The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) ended up 9 cents at $11.10-1/2 per bushel. It earlier rose to $11.18 a bushel, its highest price since July 2016. Most-active corn futures crawled 3/4-cent higher to $4.07-1/2 per bushel, while wheat slid 4-1/2 cents to $5.97-1/2 per bushel at the CBOT. Traders adjusted positions in the markets before the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues a monthly report on Tuesday that is expected to trim the government’s estimates for domestic soybean and corn yields and inventories. An uptick in demand for U.S. farm products from China, the world’s top soybean importer, has helped to draw down U.S. ending stocks. The USDA, in a daily reporting system for export sales, said on Monday that exporters sold 123,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to unknown destinations. The deal is “a continuation of post-election buying,” Feltes said, after the USDA on Friday announced separate U.S. soybean export sales to China and unknown buyers. The USDA, in a weekly report released after the market closed on Monday, said the U.S. soybean crop was 92% harvested and corn was 91% harvested, compared with expectations for 94% and 91%, respectively. The agency rated 45% of the nation’s winter wheat crop as good or excellent, compared with expectations for 44%."

The vaccine developer expects that data from the trial could support U.S. authorization and approval for its experimental coronavirus vaccine, NVX-CoV2373. Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is among a handful of companies testing their experimental coronavirus shots in late-stage studies, has said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective, citing early data. Maryland-based Novavax, which is testing the drug in a late-stage study in the UK, last month postponed the start of the U.S. trial by roughly a month, due to delays in scaling up the manufacturing process. The company aims to include at least 15% Black or African Americans, 10% to 20% Latinos and 1% to 2% Native Americans in its large-scale COVID-19 vaccine study in the United States and Mexico. NVX-CoV2373 uses a technology known as recombinant nanoparticle to produce antigens - molecules that are designed to spur the immune system into action. Novavax has signed separate deals to supply its shot to the United States, the UK, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and India.

Oil prices soared and pushed up energy stocks while safe-haven U.S. Treasuries sold off after U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said a large-scale trial of their vaccine showed it was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. Saturday’s news that Joe Biden had won the U.S. presidential election was also a reassuring confirmation of what investors had already been counting on by the end of last week, according to market strategists. “Election uncertainty is fading into the rearview mirror. Now we have this boost of investor enthusiasm after the vaccine news,” said to Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “All the types of companies that would benefit from us returning to a pre-COVID world are the big winners today.” Sectors such as energy, travel and financials which were among the hardest hit by lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus were some of the biggest percentage gainers on Monday. While the vaccine study is still ongoing and requires approval, Pfizer and BioNTech said they had found no serious safety concerns so far and expected to seek U.S. emergency use authorization later this month. “It’s not that we’re out of the woods with COVID. It’s that the vaccine starts to remove the worst case scenario that we surge out of control and go back into a national lockdown,” said Antonelli. “The market’s looking into the future, to the first and second quarter of next year.” Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 839.61 points, or 2.96%, to 29,163.01, the S&P 500 gained 44.25 points, or 1.26%, to 3,553.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 162.91 points, or 1.37%, to 11,732.32. The S&P energy index led gainers among the S&P 500’s 11 major sectors and registered its biggest daily percentage gain in months as investors bet demand would climb again when people become more comfortable with the idea of traveling as the health crisis subsides. Also, bank shares, often seen as a proxy for the broader economy, soared. The companies hit hardest by months of travel bans and lockdowns surged. The NYSE airlines index was up 19% while plane maker Boeing Co jumped 15%. Cruise line operator Carnival Corp was up more than 32%. In contrast, the technology sector and specific companies that had outperformed during the pandemic as they were seen as “stay-at-home” winners were making smaller gains or declining. Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc declined while Zoom Video and exercise bike maker Peloton Interactive Inc PTON.O> tumbled to limit the Nasdaq’s advance. “Stocks like tech are being served up as a form of proceeds to fund the purchase of pro-cyclical stocks that would stand to benefit from the economic reopening that could be accelerated by way of a vaccine,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Stocks around the world had already been gaining ground before the vaccine data pushed equities even higher as expectations of better global trade ties and more monetary stimulus under U.S. President-elect Biden was already lifting demand for risky assets. Pfizer shares closed sharply higher after soaring as much as 15.4% during the session. But another drugmaker Biogen Inc slumped as a panel of experts to the U.S. health regulator voted against the drugmaker’s experimental Alzheimer’s treatment.

Pfizer vaccine appears highly effective An experimental COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech SA 22UAy.DE appears to be more than 90% effective, based on data analyzed midway through a gold-standard clinical trial, the companies announced on Monday. The trial has enrolled 43,538 participants so far, including many from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. Pfizer said researchers had analyzed 94 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in trial participants and found the vast majority of the infections were in volunteers in the placebo group. The trial is expected to continue until 164 confirmed cases of COVID-19 are available for analysis. BioNTech's co-founder and chief executive said he was optimistic that the protective effect of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine would last for at least a year. (reut.rs/3p80uoJ; reut.rs/36pRJxM; bit.ly/36i8lr8) New study adds to COVID-19 symptom list Fever, coughing, and shortness of breath are known symptoms of COVID-19, but other warning signs can include weakness, poor blood sugar control and gastrointestinal complaints, according to a new study published on Saturday in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Researchers analyzed nearly 12,000 visits by adult patients to emergency departments at five New York City hospitals. They found COVID-19 in 57.5% of patients who went to the hospital because of weakness, falls, or altered mental status, in 55.5% of those who came in because their blood sugar was out of control, and in 51.4% of patients whose chief complaint was a gastrointestinal problem. Patients over the age of 65 tended to have more atypical complaints such as diarrhea, fatigue and weakness. Patients with dehydration, altered mental status, falls and high blood sugar were at higher risk for death in the study. The new findings can help hospitals provide better care and are ""also important for family members and people that work with the elderly to better identify possible warning signs of COVID-19 infection,"" coauthor Dr. Christopher Clifford of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai told Reuters.

The heart pumps blood by sending electrical signals through its ""conducting cells"" to tell ""muscle cells"" to contract. Normally, each conducting cell activates the one next to it in a domino effect to ensure smooth contractions. An autopsy of a COVID-19 patient found the virus had infected her heart in an unusual patchy pattern, ""with small islands of infected cells here and there,"" Dr. Jay Schneider of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota told Reuters. Upon further study in the laboratory, his team realized the spike protein on the surface of the new coronavirus can create holes between neighboring cells, causing them to fuse together. So instead of orderly electrical signal transmission and a steady heart rhythm, the signals flow like ""a tsunami tidal wave"" through the fused cells.

-4.95063147460711," Oil soars 8% on promising COVID-19 vaccine results NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil surged about 8% on Monday, its biggest daily gain in more five months, after Pfizer announced promising results for its COVID-19 vaccine. Brent crude LCOc1 settled at $42.40 a barrel, up $2.95, or 7.48%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled at $40.29 a barrel, rising $3.15, or 8.48%. Oil markets also rose after Saudi Arabia suggested it and other oil producers could adjust its current supply-cut pact, perhaps taking more barrels off the market if demand slumps in the winter as infections rise and before the vaccine is widely available. Fuel demand is down worldwide as a result of the pandemic, and with infections now surpassing 50 million globally, numerous nations, especially in Europe, are reimposing lockdowns to slow the virus’s spread. The vaccine news gave traders hope that the pandemic could be tamped down next year, which would help people resume normal life, boosting demand. “Oil particularly reacted to the news because of what it means,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. “The pandemic is hitting transportation terrifically and 80% of crude oil barrels go to transportation fuel, so I think this is a logical response.” Both contracts rose more than $4 earlier in the session as traders sought to unwind bearish bets. Brent and WTI traded 148% and 139% of last session’s volumes, respectively. Pfizer said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on initial data, a victory in the battle against a pandemic that has forced lockdowns around the world. The OPEC+ group, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, could adjust their deal to balance the market, the kingdom’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said. OPEC+ is currently cutting 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd), and considering reducing those cuts to 5.7 million bpd from January. If OPEC+ maintains the current curbs on output, it would tighten supply and lead to higher prices. Key members of OPEC are wary of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden relaxing measures on Iran and Venezuela, which could mean an increase in oil production that would make it harder to balance supply and demand. “While a Biden presidency increases the likelihood of Iranian oil supply returning to the market, this is not something that will happen overnight, and we still believe it’s more likely an end of 2021/2022 event,” ING said in a note.

-4.95063147460711," Pfizer, BioNTech initial vaccine results impress, but scientists remain cautious CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday said initial trial results for Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech's 22UAy.F coronavirus vaccine far outpaced their expectations for protection against a completely new disease, but that many questions remain unanswered. The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus. [nL1N2HV0TR][nL1N2HV067] The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine. The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19. Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people. “It gives you more power and more confidence,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. “When you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it’s much more likely to be real.” Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly. They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results. ‘REALLY ENCOURAGING’ BUT EARLY “These are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,” said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The full study is designed to show the vaccine is effective after 164 people fall ill. Pfizer said that may happen in the first or second week of December, when a panel of outside advisors to the Food and Drug Administration reviews the study results and decides whether to recommend authorizing its use. Gruber said he did not yet have a breakdown of how many of the first 94 infections occurred among Black or Latino participants, two communities hit hard by the disease. He also did he know exactly how many elderly people in the trial got sick. Older people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 So far, none of the 94 people in the initial analysis developed severe COVID-19. The FDA initially had requested that the interim data include at least five severe cases, but recently relaxed that requirement, Gruber said. “If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University. Gruber expects there will be some cases of severe disease before the trial ends. “Bottom line is we’re going to have to use the data we have and the high efficacy to give us confidence that we’re going to prevent severe infection,” he said. Scientists also want to understand whether the Pfizer vaccine fully prevents people from getting infected with the new coronavirus - a huge advantage in reducing transmission - or if it simply reduces the degree to which they become ill. “Ideally, we want to be able to completely protect from infection, but I think we all accept that these so-called first generation vaccines are more likely to prevent disease,” said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain’s University of Warwick. “And the subtlety there, which is important, is if you’re infected then you can still transmit the virus.” Pfizer intends to seek a broad approval for individuals aged 16 to 85, but the FDA and an advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make decisions about who should be first in line to get the initial doses, which will be scarce. If Pfizer wins emergency use authorization, Gruber said the company feels ethically bound to inform eligible trial participants who received a placebo that they are not protected against infection, and to offer them the vaccine in hopes of keeping them from dropping out of the trial."
-4.95063147460711," Vaccine news catapults investors' economic-recovery bets SYDNEY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - News of an effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus is fueling bets that a global economic recovery will buoy wide swaths of the market that have struggled under nearly nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a potentially major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered the world’s economy and upended daily life. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE expect to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine, raising the possibility of a regulatory decision as soon as December. Investors piled into banks stocks, airlines and other economically-sensitive companies that had been battered by months of coronavirus-led lockdowns and travel bans, pushing major U.S. stock indexes to fresh record highs, while havens like gold and the Japanese yen sold off and the U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened. For months, many investors viewed the development of an effective vaccine against COVID-19, which has killed 1.2 million people globally, as the most important catalyst for healing the global economy and bringing about the next major shift in financial markets. The prospects of a working vaccine sometime in the next few months could force investors to reevaluate a range of recent bets, from how big of a fiscal stimulus lawmakers may need to provide to whether the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near historic lows for as long as previously expected. It may also dent the allure of the big technology and momentum stocks, whose revenues have proven durable during the pandemic. Some of those huge stocks, such as Amazon.com AMZN.O, were underperforming on Monday. “I think this really takes two big uncertainties - the health impact of COVID and the economic impact of COVID - and creates a pathway now that I think investors can see to progress and to the restoration of our health and the economy,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. To be sure, obstacles remain before achieving broad protection against the coronavirus. Pfizer is waiting for more complete safety data before seeking emergency U.S. approval for the vaccine. Should the vaccine be authorized, logistical challenges potentially could undermine distribution while many Americans carry skepticism about vaccines that could prevent widespread inoculation. “There’s a long road ahead still,” said Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, in an note to investors. “I would urge investors to remain optimistically cautious and avoid the ‘buy everything’ mindset.” Investors have anticipated that an effective vaccine could be a catalyst for industries that have been crippled by economic shutdowns designed to control the coronavirus pandemic. Those include airlines, cruise ships, hotels, casinos, all of which were surging on Monday, in addition to economically-sensitive sectors such as energy, financials and industrials. Many of those groups fall into the ""value"" segment of the stock market, which had significantly lagged its ""growth"" counterparts this year. On Monday, that trend ran in reverse, with the Russell 1000 value index .RLV recently up over 5%, while the Russell 1000 growth index .RLG gaining only 0.5%. Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, has in recent months been buying the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD.P while reducing exposure to the Technology Selector Sector SPDR Fund XLK.P. “Technology has become the de facto, stay-at-home conservative play,” Nolte said. If the vaccine works, “there’s the opportunity at least for people getting together again, and that is beneficial to a lot of those industries that have suffered through the last six months or so.” Past rebounds in value have often come at the expense of momentum stocks, according to research from Solomon Tadesse, head of quantitative equities strategy for North America at Societe Generale. One such move came during a three-month period in 2009, when value stocks notched a 25% gain while momentum names lost about 30%, Tadesse said. Positive vaccine news, along with a globally synchronized economic expansion and possible legislative gridlock stemming from the U.S. election, “should mark a breakout point for Value stocks, which have been beaten down due to COVID crisis,” JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note Monday. Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management in Wisconsin, said ahead of the vaccine news that industrials offered broad exposure to a rebound in confidence in areas from building products to aviation. Some global investors had also set up plays before Monday that would benefit from a potential shift in market leadership that a vaccine could bring. Shinji Naito at Japan's SPARX Asset Management, which has $12 billion under management, hopes a vaccine could trigger a payoff from shorts in stocks pumped up by the pandemic, such as some technology firms, while helping long investments such as realtor Tokyo Tatemono 8804.T, he said before Monday's news."
-4.95063147460711," CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-Chilean president hails Pfizer success, and his country's vaccine purchase agreement (Corrects to amend erroneous Pfizer manufacturing timeline reported by Chilean science minister in paragraph 9) SANTIAGO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera said on Monday his country was in a “privileged and opportune” position to be able to roll out a COVID-19 vaccination campaign early next year after Pfizer Inc announced an experimental vaccine that was more than 90% effective. Pinera said Pfizer’s trial vaccine was among a number for whom he had already signed purchase deals and had logistical and distribution plans in place to roll out, once they receive international and domestic regulators’ approval. “I expect that, in the final analysis, it will be seen that Chile was hit hard by the pandemic and the global recession but managed to face it with unity, will and results that put Chile in a privilege position not only in the context of Latin America but also the world,” said Pinera. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to release successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. Chile has a deal to buy 10 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and also to purchase 14.4 million doses from AstraZeneca, and 60 million over three years from Sinovac, both of whom are testing for COVID-19 vaccines in the country. It has also signed up for 7.6 million doses through the global vaccine distribution scheme COVAX, co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the WHO. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks and produced at more rapid scale than conventional vaccines. Chilean science minister Andres Couve told Reuters the deal with Pfizer had a delivery schedule starting from next year but added the use of messenger RNA was an emerging and modern technology, and therefore must be analyzed very carefully. He said the U.S. could designate the emergency roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine for its own 331 million-person population as soon as November. “Pfizer has indicated that manufacturing has begun and that there could be 50 million doses of this vaccine this year and up to 1.3 billion by 2021,” he said. “As a country, we have been working for a long time on a comprehensive strategy for a safe and timely vaccine. The Ministry of Health is ready to implement vaccination plans once we have the necessary approvals to start with this treatment in the shortest time possible.” Russia’s health ministry said also on Monday its own COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, was more than 90% effective, citing data collated from vaccinations of the public rather than from an ongoing trial. In an interview on Friday, Couve told Reuters that Chile’s scientific advisory team had met with Sputnik’s developers but decided it was “not among the most promising” products available. “Vaccines take a long time, often the first version of a vaccine is not necessarily the one that is most effective, it requires rounds of improvement,” he said. “We are keeping these conversations open with developers who could offer opportunities in the future.” (Reporting by Aislinn Laing Editing by Chris Reese)"

Citi said it favored Australian and UK equity markets due to their exposure to business sectors that outperform when nominal yields are rising. “More than any fiscal spending package or central bank lending program, a healthcare solution to COVID has the greatest potential to restore economic activity to its full potential, lifting deeply-depressed ‘social-close’ industries,” said Jeffrey Sacks, Citi Private Bank’s EMEA Investment Strategist.

-4.95063147460711," AstraZeneca says Pfizer results encouraging for vaccine developers Nov 9 (Reuters) - An AstraZeneca executive said he felt encouraged by “incredibly promising” large-scale COVID-19 vaccine trial results unveiled by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Monday. Speaking at a Financial Times online conference on healthcare, Astra senior executive team member Ruud Dobber said the first efficacy data release made him optimistic that Astra too would be able to follow up on positive results from early-stage trials. Pfizer and BioNTech’s experimental vaccine was shown to be more than 90% effective based on initial late-stage trial results, the companies said on Monday. AstraZeneca, working with the University of Oxford, expects to report late-stage trial data on its COVID-19 immunisation before year-end. “What we have seen in Phase I and Phase II - whether it is Pfizer or AstraZeneca with our Oxford vaccine - is that if you are able to generate neutralising antibodies and a good T-cell response that you can make the virus less hostile,” Dobber said. “The efficacy shown earlier today is incredibly promising and I really hope that more vaccine producers will showcase more or less the same results sooner rather than later,” he added.

-4.95063147460711," We may soon have a COVID-19 vaccine. But will enough people take it? ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - With COVID-19 vaccine trial results looking positive, governments and pharmaceutical firms face their next daunting challenge: convincing the world to get inoculated. Public resistance to vaccines has been much discussed this year, but the issue became very real on Monday when Pfizer and BioNTech announced their candidate was more than 90% effective in large trials - hoisting an actual shot onto the horizon. Numerous opinion polls carried out before and during the pandemic showed confidence is volatile, and that political polarization and online misinformation threatens uptake. Many people have concerns about the accelerated speed of COVID-19 vaccine development. The World Health Organization estimates about 70% of people must be inoculated to break transmission of the virus. Since it is unlikely a vaccine, once approved, will be immediately available for the masses, experts said getting medical workers on board will be critical. “We should have really targeted discussions and engagement with healthcare providers,” Heidi Larson, director of the global Vaccine Confidence Project, told Reuters. “Not only are they going to be the first ones expected to get a vaccine - if not required to - they’re also going to be the ones on the frontlines facing the onslaught of questions from the public.” While about 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development globally, with dozens in human clinical trials, no shot has actually crossed the finish line and been approved, though the one from Pfizer-BioNTech appears to be on track. The high rate of efficacy in the Pfizer-BioNTech interim results could help boost confidence, Cornell University government Professors Douglas Kriner and Sarah Kreps said. Their recently published research showed that if an initial COVID-19 vaccine was about as effective as a flu shot, uptake by the American public may fall far short of the 70% level needed to achieve “herd immunity”. “However, if the vaccine was 90% effective it would significantly increase Americans’ willingness to vaccinate by more than 10%, critical to ensuring enough public acceptance to help the U.S. eventually get closer to herd immunity,” said Kreps. Experts are also cautioning any conversation over a vaccine’s risks and rewards must be frank. A return to normal life will still take time, with no one shot likely to be a silver bullet. And many questions are likely to remain, including how long a vaccine will provide protection. The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, a non-profit that supports the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has been holding focus groups to gauge the public mood and is now crafting campaign messages to help tackle concerns. Its chief executive, Susan Winckler, said more than a dozen focus groups of 150 people in total held since August - some in person, some by video - had unearthed numerous concerns. “We heard distrust of both government and the healthcare system,” Winckler said. “Many didn’t want to be first in line for the shot.” It’s a global phenomenon; a survey from early November, carried out by the World Economic Forum and covering 18,526 people in 15 countries, showed 73% of people willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, a four-point fall since August. Regulators and the drug industry have taken pains to reassure the public they won’t cut corners on safety, with a top U.S. drug agency official saying he would quit if an unproven vaccine were rubber stamped. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, a drug industry group, also plans a campaign by 2021, while the U.S. Council for International Business, with 300 multinational corporations as members, is also getting behind a campaign pushing for workforce take-up of eventual COVID-19 vaccines. Some studies show government and employer recommendations will help convince people to get vaccinated. Scott Ratzan, co-leader with Larson of ‘CONVINCE’, an initiative supporting communication and engagement for vaccine uptake globally, stressed the importance of medical workers getting inoculated, saying others would then be more likely to follow suit. “If we don’t have the medical folks signed on ... we’ll lose the early battle,” he added. “The only way to get back to normal is if we can get enough workers or employees covered.”"

The benchmark German 10-year yield rose 11.5 basis points to -0.507%, staging its biggest rise since March. Other core euro zone bond yields jumped while peripheral yields surged off new record lows to trade higher. The Pfizer announcement surprised investors, who sent stocks soaring. Markets have been waiting for weeks on news about any effective vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to massive economic shutdowns. Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said they expect to seek U.S. emergency use authorisation later this month. “If the bearish view embedded in markets was that there was no effective vaccine any time soon priced in, clearly that needs significant repricing now,” said Russell Silbertson from asset manager Ninety One. “You couple (this morning’s news) that with the sheer weight of all the stimulus in markets, and that’s a very strong economic upside scenario.” U.S. Treasury yields soared, with the 10-year yield up 13.4 basis points on the day at 0.954% and 30-year yields up 14.8 bps on the day at 1.746%. Prior to the news, Italian and Greek bond yields had hit new record lows as investors cheered rating agency reviews of their credit ratings and Joe Biden’s presumed victory in the U.S. presidential election boosted sentiment. But they changed direction after the announcement of the vaccine. By 1600 GMT, the Italian 10-year yield was 11 basis points higher at 0.724%, staging its biggest rise since May. European Central Bank bond buying has kept euro zone yields pinned lower or in tight ranges, but development of a successful vaccine has the potential to boost sentiment significantly and lift yields as investors seek out riskier assets. “The good news on the vaccine was always the upside risk for markets and if it is developed and rolled out quickly, then that does support the recovery and reflation narrative,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. “But we have to be careful that the number of patients reporting results are still very low. So we need to be perhaps cautiously optimistic about this news and look at a lot more results.” The EU has hired banks for its second bond sale to back its SURE unemployment scheme, according to Refinitiv IFR. It will sell five and 30-year bonds “in the near future, subject to market conditions”, according to a statement debt management offices usually use the day before a sale."

We’re seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,” he told a news conference. Canada has a deal with Pfizer for a minimum of 20 million doses. The doses could be distributed during the first quarter of next year to high priority groups, Trudeau said. Canada may get the vaccine after the United States and Britain, but at about the same time as the European Union and others, a government source said. While Trudeau said other vaccine candidates are expected to perform well, he said Canada was looking to secure more doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE. “As for Pfizer, I know we have secured several million doses ... and obviously if it works we will buy more when they become available,” he said. Trudeau added that there were logistical challenges to distributing the vaccine since it must be stored at very low temperatures. “We don’t have the infrastructure in place now to store the vaccine but I’m confident it will be in place in January,” said the government source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. “We won’t be able to get supplies into every pharmacy, certainly not immediately.” As is the case in many countries, a second wave of the novel coronavirus is sweeping across Canada, which is setting daily records for new infections. Canada has recorded 264,113 cases and 10,522 deaths so far, forcing some provinces to reimpose restrictions on gatherings and movement. “We need to hang on - the next months are critical,” Trudeau said. Canada has agreements with a number of major companies to access up to 358 million doses of their vaccine candidates.

The remark was made hours after the two companies said their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective, in what could be a major victory in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The European Commission, which is negotiating with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, had said in September it had concluded exploratory talks with U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech over the supply of 200 million doses of their potential COVID-19 shot, with an option to buy another 100 million. However, a deal has not been announced yet. “EU Commission to sign contract with them soon for up to 300 million doses,” von der Leyen wrote on Twitter. Minutes earlier, a prominent centre right lawmaker in the EU Parliament had said a deal was imminent. “According to my information, the respective contract is about to be signed,” Peter Liese said. The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca AZN.L, Sanofi SASY.PA and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N for their potential COVID-19 shots. The United States, Japan and Britain have announced supply deals with Pfizer/BioNTech. Data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been assessed since early October by the EU drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), under an extraordinary rolling review meant to speed up the possible approval of the shot. The EMA said in an email to Reuters on Monday it had not received the latest results from large-scale trials, but it had evaluated non-clinical data. It added that it was currently assessing a second batch of data on the quality of the vaccine, including those related to its ingredients and the way it is produced."

We’re seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,” he told a news conference. Canada has a deal with Pfizer for a minimum of 20 million doses of the vaccine. A second wave of the coronavirus is sweeping across Canada, which is setting daily records for new infections. Canada has recorded 264,113 cases and 10,522 deaths so far, forcing some provinces to reimpose sweeping restrictions. “The vaccine won’t help you or your family if you catch COVID now. We need to hang on - the next months are critical,” Trudeau said. Canada has signed agreements with a number of major companies to access up to 358 million doses of their different COVID-19 vaccine candidates."
-4.95063147460711," UPDATE 2-EU to sign shortly supply deal for Pfizer COVID vaccine (Adds EU Commission President) BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The European Union will soon sign a contract for millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday. The remark was made hours after the two companies said their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective, in what could be a major victory in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The European Commission, which is negotiating with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, had said in September it had concluded exploratory talks with U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech over the supply of 200 million doses of their potential COVID-19 shot, with an option to buy another 100 million. However, a deal has not been announced yet. “EU Commission to sign contract with them soon for up to 300 million doses,” von der Leyen wrote on Twitter. Minutes earlier, a prominent centre right lawmaker in the EU Parliament had said a deal was imminent. “According to my information, the respective contract is about to be signed,” Peter Liese said. The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca , Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson for their potential COVID-19 shots. The United States, Japan and Britain have announced supply deals with Pfizer/BioNTech. Data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been assessed since early October by the EU drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), under an extraordinary rolling review meant to speed up the possible approval of the shot. The EMA said in an email to Reuters on Monday it had not received the latest results from large-scale trials, but it had evaluated non-clinical data. It added that it was currently assessing a second batch of data on the quality of the vaccine, including those related to its ingredients and the way it is produced.

-4.95063147460711," Instant view: Pfizer, BioNTech say their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study, a major victory in the fight against the pandemic. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. Following are reactions to the news. Scientists’ reactions: ALEXANDER GINTSBURG, DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW’S GAMALEYA INSTITUTE WHICH DEVELOPED RUSSIA’S MAIN VACCINE CANDIDATE, SPUTNIK V “We welcome the progress shown by our foreign colleagues in the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus. The more vaccines are available in the world, the better people will be protected. “People at high risk of infection - primarily medical workers - are already being actively vaccinated in our country. Production is being scaled up and new production sites are joining the process. In the near future we expect to publish interim results of the post-registration trial of the vaccine Sputnik V, the so-called Phase III trials. I am sure that its effectiveness level will also be high.” CLEMENS WENDTNER, CHIEF PHYSICIAN OF INFECTIOLOGY AND TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEAD OF THE SPECIAL UNIT FOR HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS LIFE-THREATENING INFECTIONS, MUNICH SCHWABING CLINIC, GERMANY “This is remarkable, as many ongoing vaccination studies on COVID-19 currently only assume a success rate of at least 50%. In addition, it should be emphasized that a sharp end point has been defined - infection yes or no. Alternatively, with less high expectations of a vaccine, already attenuated disease courses, so-called mitigated courses, could be considered a success. In addition, the mRNA vaccination appears to be effective after only four weeks, which means that one does not have to wait long for protection.” WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, UNITED STATES “This is a hint that these mRNA vaccines are likely to work, and there’s at least one other. And they’re likely to be safe, at least from this trial. So that’s highly encouraging. The other thing that’s highly encouraging is that science can now create a vaccine in a relatively short amount of time and test it, which gives a lot of hope for the future when these things happen again.” ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, BRITAIN “This vaccine needs to be stored at -80c. This could create major logistical challenges for mass treatment outside major urban areas and in low or middle income countries.” “However, overall this is a huge step forwards in the fight against COVID-19. We will need to see whether updated versions of this vaccine are needed to protect people against new strains of the virus which might emerge in future.” RICHARD HATCHETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CEPI COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS “These are hugely positive and encouraging interim results and are testament to the ingenuity and skill of the scientific community in advancing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. We commend Pfizer/BioNTech on this historic interim result and the speed at which they have advanced through clinical development. “We believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.” PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BRITAIN “This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general. “Of course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.” ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, BRITAIN “At face value, this is exceptionally good news: a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 and with millions of doses available by the end of the year. “However, the full data set on which the claim is based has not yet been released and so we don’t know exactly what has been found.” LAWRENCE YOUNG, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, BRITAIN “It’s hard to interpret the interim analysis, but it does appear very encouraging.” “In this... preliminary analysis there is a significant reduction in the COVID-19, and I interpret that to mean that ... individuals are not developing disease, but it doesn’t tell us anything about whether people are getting infected or not.” JOHN MOORE, PROFESSOR AT WEILL CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY “I can see nothing problematic.” As for what this means for other vaccines, Moore said: “Moderna’s is likely to work as well given the similar design and performance, and Novavax also, as it seems more potent. It’s harder to judge about the other candidates.” MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, BRITAIN “This cautiously sounds like an excellent result from the phase 3 trials, but we should remain a little cautious. The provisional findings are made available in a press release, and the study is ongoing. However, if the final results show an effectiveness of anywhere near 90% with response in elderly and ethnic minority populations, that is an excellent result for a first generation vaccine. “This has been seen before – the rapidly-produced ebola vaccine generated very high levels of effectiveness and exceeded all expectations. Equally, billions of dollars and numerous clinical trials have struggled to produce any form of vaccination against HIV. Science can be unpredictable.” AZRA GHANI, CHAIR IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON “These new results represent the first demonstration of substantial efficacy of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19 disease which is very welcome news. It is important to bear in mind that these are early results based on a relatively small number of cases. In addition, the efficacy estimate is based on seven days of follow-up of participants following the second dose; further data in the coming weeks and months will provide a better picture of longer-term vaccine efficacy.” WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES EXPERT AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES “The efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated. I would have been delighted with efficacy of 70% or 75%. 90% is very impressive for any vaccine. The study isn’t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.” IAN JONES, PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF READING, BRITAIN “Of all the vaccines currently in development the BioNtech product always looked like the most bang-per-buck as it is entirely focused on the part of the virus that binds to the human cell, the receptor binding domain. “The only things we will not know for some time is the longevity of the response in all age groups, but assuming antibody titres are high that should be at least as good as any other vaccine currently in trial.” JOHN BELL, REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO SITS ON THE UK GOVERNMENT’S VACCINE TASKFORCE, TOLD BBC RADIO: “I’m really delighted with this result for no other reason than it shows you you can make a vaccine against this little critter. As you know, there are many pathogens where we’ve tried for decades and never managed to get a vaccine, you know, malaria, HIV.” “Distribution of this is going to be challenging, and there’s a lot of complexities associated with that. But... that’s not the headline here. The headline is, we’ll solve those things if we need to. But... it rolls the pitch for other vaccines because I can’t see any reason now why we shouldn’t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease. “Our (Oxford’s) first interim analysis is also likely to be available in the very near future, and by that I mean weeks, not months. So, I’m pretty optimistic that given this result, we’ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well.” “When you look at the immunological responses you get from the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the ones from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and indeed even the Moderna vaccine. They all look about the same. So, I’m optimistic that that probably reflects similar levels of efficacy.” FLORIAN KRAMMER, PROFESSOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, USA “These are fantastic results. The efficacy could be higher than expected, and this probably means that - at least in the U.S. - there will be an application for approval very soon. Of course, it would be better to see age-specific data, but I suspect that these will be published soon. Frankly, this is the best news I have received since Jan. 10.” MARYLYN ADDO, HEAD OF TROPICAL MEDICINE SECTION, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER EPPENDORF (UKE), HAMBURG, GERMANY “These are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases. Primary data are not yet available and a peer-reviewed publication is still pending. We still have to wait for the exact data before we can make a final assessment. At present, there are still few details about the exact data, for example regarding different age groups and in which groups the 94 cases occurred exactly.” BERND SALZBERGER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL REGENSBURG, GERMANY “In the Pfizer/Biontech press release, the Phase II/III placebo-controlled observer-blinded study with the vaccine BNT162b2 reported a vaccine efficacy of over 90%. Although only a few events - a total of 94 cases - have been observed in the study so far, this is a very good result. No serious side effects have been reported - overall a very positive result, which will probably lead to an early approval.” GERD FAETKENHEUER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, CLINIC I FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COLOGNE, GERMANY “These are great and promising data. It is incredible that in such a short period of time this progress with the development of a vaccine and clinical trials within a few months has been achieved. The results on efficacy and safety so far are excellent. “I think this will have a major impact on our handling of the pandemic and I hope that large quantities of the vaccine will be available quickly. The researchers involved can only be congratulated”. DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON In terms of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, “it’s good news, but it’s not ‘overnight success’ good news”. Altmann cautioned that this and other potentially successful vaccines would still need to be approved and delivered to people across the world, and this will still take many months. He added, however: “I always felt optimistic, and my optimism remains strong.” Government reaction: “Today’s news about the anti-COVID vaccine is encouraging. But caution is still needed. Scientific research is the real key to overcoming the emergency. In the meantime, we must never forget that the behaviour of each of us is essential to bend the curve.” “We welcome every advance made by the global efforts to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government is working intensively to as quickly as possible to give the Swiss people access to a safe and effective vaccine. We’ve signed two contracts already, with Moderna and AstraZeneca, and we’re currently in negotiations with additional, promising vaccine makers.” Corporate reaction: LUCIO ROVATI, CEO OF ITALY’S ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, WHICH IS WORKING WITH TAKIS BIOTECH ON A COVID-19 VACCINE “This is important news. Nothing that was not expected. Anyway, great, great. The problem remains that the data is limited in duration, 28 days after the first inoculation. The problem will be to see how long the coverage lasts. But in any case it is already very important to know that there is an effective vaccine, also because it seems a vaccine well tolerated in the medium term. At the end of November data at two months will be available, as required by regulatory agencies, and so at the end of November (the vaccine) could already be approved.” “Congratulations to our Pfizer colleagues. We feel energized to move on and bring more vaccines to the world to fight against this pandemic.” Market reaction: RUSSELL SILBERTSON, CO-HEAD OF DEVELOPED MARKET FX & RATES AT ASSET MANAGER NINETY ONE “If the bearish view embedded in markets was that there was no effective vaccine any time soon priced in, clearly that needs significant repricing now. “You couple (this morning’s news) with the sheer weight of all the stimulus in markets, and that’s a very strong economic upside scenario.” NIKESH PATEL, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, KEMPEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LONDON “This is the first news that allows governments to start planning ahead to when economies can properly start to reopen from lockdowns. That gives them more visibility and concreteness about what fiscal policy they can take. “Monetary policy can only go so far at this point and it needs to be a fiscal response for a real recovery and this kind of news is great as it allows governments to make that fiscal response without fear of endless support.” “Whilst we are not there yet, news that this vaccine could be highly effective is the best thing markets could hope for. Public health officials will remind us there is a long road ahead, and many challenges will be faced along the way, but there is an enormous sense of optimism today – light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s just hope the vaccine deniers won’t get in the way, but 2021 just got a lot brighter.” “The COVID-19 vaccine news adds to the positive risk tone in stocks and underpins high beta currencies vs the U.S. dollar. Any positive news on a vaccine is good news for the world economy and offers perspective for rebound/normalisation in 2021 growth.” “The bigger driver of the economic outlook is from the outside factors. Right now that means the development of a vaccine, which is why we are following news on this front closely.” “The base case we have already is that we are likely to get a vaccine by year-end and that it will be rolled out.

We commend Pfizer/BioNTech on this historic interim result and the speed at which they have advanced through clinical development. “We believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.” PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BRITAIN “This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general. “Of course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.” ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, BRITAIN “At face value, this is exceptionally good news: a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 and with millions of doses available by the end of the year. “However, the full data set on which the claim is based has not yet been released and so we don’t know exactly what has been found.” LAWRENCE YOUNG, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, BRITAIN “It’s hard to interpret the interim analysis, but it does appear very encouraging.” “In this... preliminary analysis there is a significant reduction in the COVID-19, and I interpret that to mean that ... individuals are not developing disease, but it doesn’t tell us anything about whether people are getting infected or not.” JOHN MOORE, PROFESSOR AT WEILL CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY “I can see nothing problematic.” As for what this means for other vaccines, Moore said: “Moderna’s is likely to work as well given the similar design and performance, and Novavax also, as it seems more potent. It’s harder to judge about the other candidates.” MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, BRITAIN “This cautiously sounds like an excellent result from the phase 3 trials, but we should remain a little cautious. The provisional findings are made available in a press release, and the study is ongoing. However, if the final results show an effectiveness of anywhere near 90% with response in elderly and ethnic minority populations, that is an excellent result for a first generation vaccine. “This has been seen before – the rapidly-produced ebola vaccine generated very high levels of effectiveness and exceeded all expectations. Equally, billions of dollars and numerous clinical trials have struggled to produce any form of vaccination against HIV. Science can be unpredictable.” AZRA GHANI, CHAIR IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON “These new results represent the first demonstration of substantial efficacy of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19 disease which is very welcome news. It is important to bear in mind that these are early results based on a relatively small number of cases. In addition, the efficacy estimate is based on seven days of follow-up of participants following the second dose; further data in the coming weeks and months will provide a better picture of longer-term vaccine efficacy.” WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES EXPERT AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES “The efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated. I would have been delighted with efficacy of 70% or 75%. 90% is very impressive for any vaccine. The study isn’t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.” IAN JONES, PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF READING, BRITAIN “Of all the vaccines currently in development the BioNtech product always looked like the most bang-per-buck as it is entirely focused on the part of the virus that binds to the human cell, the receptor binding domain. “The only things we will not know for some time is the longevity of the response in all age groups, but assuming antibody titres are high that should be at least as good as any other vaccine currently in trial.” JOHN BELL, REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO SITS ON THE UK GOVERNMENT’S VACCINE TASKFORCE, TOLD BBC RADIO: “I’m really delighted with this result for no other reason than it shows you you can make a vaccine against this little critter. As you know, there are many pathogens where we’ve tried for decades and never managed to get a vaccine, you know, malaria, HIV.” “Distribution of this is going to be challenging, and there’s a lot of complexities associated with that. But... that’s not the headline here. The headline is, we’ll solve those things if we need to. But... it rolls the pitch for other vaccines because I can’t see any reason now why we shouldn’t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease. “Our (Oxford’s) first interim analysis is also likely to be available in the very near future, and by that I mean weeks, not months. So, I’m pretty optimistic that given this result, we’ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well.” “When you look at the immunological responses you get from the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the ones from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and indeed even the Moderna vaccine. They all look about the same. So, I’m optimistic that that probably reflects similar levels of efficacy.” FLORIAN KRAMMER, PROFESSOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, USA “These are fantastic results. The efficacy could be higher than expected, and this probably means that - at least in the U.S. - there will be an application for approval very soon. Of course, it would be better to see age-specific data, but I suspect that these will be published soon. Frankly, this is the best news I have received since Jan. 10.” MARYLYN ADDO, HEAD OF TROPICAL MEDICINE SECTION, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER EPPENDORF (UKE), HAMBURG, GERMANY “These are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases. Primary data are not yet available and a peer-reviewed publication is still pending. We still have to wait for the exact data before we can make a final assessment. At present, there are still few details about the exact data, for example regarding different age groups and in which groups the 94 cases occurred exactly.” BERND SALZBERGER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL REGENSBURG, GERMANY “In the Pfizer/Biontech press release, the Phase II/III placebo-controlled observer-blinded study with the vaccine BNT162b2 reported a vaccine efficacy of over 90%. Although only a few events - a total of 94 cases - have been observed in the study so far, this is a very good result. No serious side effects have been reported - overall a very positive result, which will probably lead to an early approval.” GERD FAETKENHEUER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, CLINIC I FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COLOGNE, GERMANY “These are great and promising data. It is incredible that in such a short period of time this progress with the development of a vaccine and clinical trials within a few months has been achieved. The results on efficacy and safety so far are excellent. “I think this will have a major impact on our handling of the pandemic and I hope that large quantities of the vaccine will be available quickly. The researchers involved can only be congratulated”. DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON In terms of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, “it’s good news, but it’s not ‘overnight success’ good news”. Altmann cautioned that this and other potentially successful vaccines would still need to be approved and delivered to people across the world, and this will still take many months. He added, however: “I always felt optimistic, and my optimism remains strong.” Government reaction: “Today’s news about the anti-COVID vaccine is encouraging. But caution is still needed. Scientific research is the real key to overcoming the emergency. In the meantime, we must never forget that the behaviour of each of us is essential to bend the curve.” “We welcome every advance made by the global efforts to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government is working intensively to as quickly as possible to give the Swiss people access to a safe and effective vaccine. We’ve signed two contracts already, with Moderna and AstraZeneca, and we’re currently in negotiations with additional, promising vaccine makers.” Corporate reaction: LUCIO ROVATI, CEO OF ITALY’S ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, WHICH IS WORKING WITH TAKIS BIOTECH ON A COVID-19 VACCINE “This is important news. Nothing that was not expected. Anyway, great, great. The problem remains that the data is limited in duration, 28 days after the first inoculation. The problem will be to see how long the coverage lasts. But in any case it is already very important to know that there is an effective vaccine, also because it seems a vaccine well tolerated in the medium term. At the end of November data at two months will be available, as required by regulatory agencies, and so at the end of November (the vaccine) could already be approved.” “Congratulations to our Pfizer colleagues. We feel energized to move on and bring more vaccines to the world to fight against this pandemic.” Market reaction: RUSSELL SILBERTSON, CO-HEAD OF DEVELOPED MARKET FX & RATES AT ASSET MANAGER NINETY ONE “If the bearish view embedded in markets was that there was no effective vaccine any time soon priced in, clearly that needs significant repricing now. “You couple (this morning’s news) with the sheer weight of all the stimulus in markets, and that’s a very strong economic upside scenario.” NIKESH PATEL, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, KEMPEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LONDON “This is the first news that allows governments to start planning ahead to when economies can properly start to reopen from lockdowns. That gives them more visibility and concreteness about what fiscal policy they can take. “Monetary policy can only go so far at this point and it needs to be a fiscal response for a real recovery and this kind of news is great as it allows governments to make that fiscal response without fear of endless support.” “Whilst we are not there yet, news that this vaccine could be highly effective is the best thing markets could hope for. Public health officials will remind us there is a long road ahead, and many challenges will be faced along the way, but there is an enormous sense of optimism today – light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s just hope the vaccine deniers won’t get in the way, but 2021 just got a lot brighter.” “The COVID-19 vaccine news adds to the positive risk tone in stocks and underpins high beta currencies vs the U.S. dollar. Any positive news on a vaccine is good news for the world economy and offers perspective for rebound/normalisation in 2021 growth.” “The bigger driver of the economic outlook is from the outside factors. Right now that means the development of a vaccine, which is why we are following news on this front closely.” “The base case we have already is that we are likely to get a vaccine by year-end and that it will be rolled out. So we do see news like this as positive. The worrying sign would be if we get negative news say on testing, that would hurt how we view the economic outlook.” (Reporting by Kate Kelland, Caroline Copley, Julie Steenhuysen, Josephine Mason, Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee, Tom Arnold, Tommy Wilkes, Francesco Guarascio, Angelo Amante, Michael Erman, Emilio Parodi, Polina Ivanova, John Miller and Alistair Smout)"
-4.95063147460711," Breakingviews - Pfizer jolt delivers taste of post-Covid markets LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - It turns out preventing Covid-19 is a bigger deal for markets and the global economy than the drawn-out election of a new U.S. president. News that a vaccine in the works from Pfizer and BioNTech may be over 90% effective gave stocks and government bond yields an injection of adrenalin on Monday. The prospect of a return to normality is a potent market stimulant. European stocks popped higher, and E-Mini S&P 500 Futures traded up nearly 4%. Shares of oil groups like Royal Dutch Shell and BP, heavily dependent on a rebound in economic activity, surged over 10%. AMC Entertainment, the U.S.-listed global cinema operator under huge pressure from pandemic-related closures, saw its stock jump more than 70% at one stage in pre-market trading. The optimism is understandable. It’s hard to overstate how good the vaccine looks based on Pfizer and BioNTech’s statement. That level of effectiveness is sufficiently high to snuff out the pandemic via herd immunity. It is also high enough to hint that having only one of two planned doses may offer decent protection, which might allow more people to be inoculated sooner. Manufacturing capacity presents the biggest challenge. Pfizer reckons it can make perhaps 50 million doses this year and up to 1.3 billion next year, only enough for about a sixth of the world’s population. There’s likely to be a tussle over which countries and demographic groups will get first dibs. Although capacity will ramp up quickly for any successful remedy, the pandemic won’t simply evaporate as soon as regulators give a vaccine the nod. Meanwhile, Pfizer has yet to release all its clinical data, and vaccines can be tricky things. The company says no serious safety concerns have emerged, but it’s still collecting information. Pfizer’s drug also needs to be stored at ultra-low temperatures that most doctors’ offices can’t provide. Dozens of rival vaccines are in the works and many rely on more conventional medical technology and distribution methods. Pfizer’s success probably means others have a shot at working as well. Once readily available, though, enough people need to get inoculated. Fewer than two-thirds of Americans say they would, for example, according to a recent Ipsos poll. Increasing that number is just one challenge for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden. Investors may find it pays not to get carried away by good scientific news."
-4.95063147460711," UK says expects to receive 10 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine this year LONDON (Reuters) - Britain expects to have 10 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s candidate COVID-19 vaccine available by the end of the year if regulators approve it, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Monday, following positive clinical trial results. The spokesman said that Britain had now ordered 40 million doses of the candidate vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech BNTX.O, enough to give protection to 20 million people. Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered the world’s economy and upended daily life. “In total we have procured 40 million doses of the Pfizer candidate vaccine with 10 million of those doses being manufactured and available to the UK by the end of the year if the vaccine is approved by the regulators,” the spokesman said. In all, the government has signed six supply deals for vaccine candidates, including Pfizer/BioNTech's and one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca AZN.L, which is also considered expected to post late-stage trial results this year. “I can’t see any reason now why we shouldn’t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease,” John Bell, regius professor of medicine at University of Oxford who sits on the UK government’s vaccine taskforce, told BBC Radio, adding that it augured well for Oxford’s own vaccine. “I’m pretty optimistic that given this result, we’ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well,” he said, referring to Oxford’s late-stage trial results he said would come in “weeks not months”. Johnson has placed England under a second national lockdown to contain a new wave of COVID-19 infections, but he has said that the prospects of a vaccine are one cause for optimism that the situation will improve by spring. His spokesman said that though the government was “optimistic of a breakthrough, we must remember there are no guarantees,” adding that only once safety data was published would licensing authorities consider making it available to the public. “In the meantime the NHS (National Health Service) stands ready to begin the vaccination programme for those most at risk once a COVID-19 vaccine is available, before being rolled out more widely,” he said. Oxford’s Bell went further. Asked if life would be returning to normal by spring, he said: “Yes, yes, yes.” “I’m probably the first guy to say that but... I will say that with some confidence.”"
-4.95063147460711," BoE's Haldane hopes vaccine news will be quick game-changer for economy LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said he was hopeful that the announcement of a breakthrough in the search for a COVID-19 vaccination would deliver a quick boost of confidence to the economy, even before vaccines are widely available. “I’m not close enough to know how credible today’s Pfizer announcement is, but let’s hope it is. That would shift expectations I think very decisively among both people and among companies,” Haldane said in a speech to the Reform think tank. Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective. Haldane said the roll-out of a useable vaccine would probably take months but news of a breakthrough would eliminate fears of a string of stop-start cycles of lockdown for the economy which would hammer businesses. “Whether it’s next quarter or next year matters much less than the fact that you now have a way of preventing the prolongation of this stop-start cycling,” he said. “That is all the difference in the world, between having a viable business and not having a viable business, and making that investment and not making that investment, in psychological scarring that persists and deepens or the sense that things are going to get better at some point in the foreseeable future.”"

The remark was made hours after the two companies said their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective, in what could be a major victory in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic . The European Commission, which is negotiating with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, said in September it had concluded exploratory talks with U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech over the supply of 200 million doses of their potential COVID-19 shot. However, a deal has not been announced yet. “According to my information, the respective contract is about to be signed,” said Peter Liese, the EU lawmaker who leads on health matters for the largest grouping in the European Parliament, comprising centre-right lawmakers. “There is an agreement that Europeans will be provided with hundreds of millions of vaccines,” he added in an emailed statement. A spokesman for the Commission declined to comment on whether Pfizer’s announcement on the efficacy of its vaccine would speed up the signature of a supply deal. The Commission has said previously that the 27 EU states could also have an option to order another 100 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The Scandinavian currencies and the Japanese yen were amongst the biggest movers, while the offshore Chinese yuan hit its strongest in 28-months. A Biden presidency is expected to boost international trade relations and the prospect of a successful coronavirus vaccine is seen as a major tailwind, with global cases continuing to rise. Simon Harvey, currency analyst at broker Monex Europe, said although markets were already trading with “an air of optimism”, Pfizer’s findings, based on initial data from a large study, had boosted risk appetite further. “Although premature to solidify expectations of a widely available vaccine in the coming months, (the news) helped boost global growth expectations which took a substantial knock only weeks ago with second wave concerns,” Harvey said. That was benefitting higher beta currencies such as the Norwegian and Swedish crowns, boosting oil prices and “unravelling” dollar/yen, he added. The dollar stabilised against a basket of currencies having touched a 10-week low of 92.12 and was last up 0.2% at 92.31. The Swedish crown rose to a 28-month high of 8.5845 versus the U.S. dollar and to a 22-month high of 10.20 against the euro. Its Norwegian counterpart rose 1.6% against both the dollar and the euro to hit two-month highs against each of 9.0025 and 10.7030 respectively.. The Australian dollar was up 2.4% at 76.85 against the Japanese yen, a seven-week high. The yen also fell 1.6% against the U.S. dollar to 105. The offshore Chinese yuan was not far behind, hitting a peak of 6.5501 against the dollar and last up 0.3% at 6.5729. The Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar both rose 0.8% versus the U.S. dollar with the latter hitting a seven-week high and the former a nine-month high. “The removal of global uncertainty, a shift to dollar funding, and virus divergence against the U.S. all favour a weaker dollar into the end of the year,” said George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank’s currency analyst. Saravelos expects the broad trade-weighted dollar to potentially drop by another 3% to 5% into the end of the year with euro/dollar convincingly breaking 1.20 and dollar/yen reaching 100. U.S. dollar selling was being held in check, however, by the virus worries and because incumbent President Donald Trump has made no sign of conceding while fighting legal battles to overturn the result. The prospect of more gridlock in Washington, with Republicans appearing likely to have retained control of the Senate -- although the final makeup may not be clear until runoff votes in Georgia in January -- means that expectations for a massive U.S. fiscal stimulus package have been lowered, sending bond yields down in anticipation of less borrowing and more quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve. Euro/dollar - the most traded currency pair in the world - was up 0.1% on the day at $1.1892. German exports rose by more than expected in September, and foreign trade gave Europe’s largest economy a boost going into the fourth quarter as it struggles to avoid slipping into a double dip contraction."
-4.95063147460711," Germany encouraged by Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine news, cautious on timeline BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's health minister is encouraged by a Pfizer PFE.N announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine proved effective in a late-stage trial but still does not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021, he said on Monday. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech BNTX.O said on Monday their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study, a major victory in the fight against the pandemic. “If this should prove true ... then it would be a good signal because it shows that this vaccine makes a difference,” Jens Spahn told a news conference, but added he was cautious on the timeline because there can always be setbacks. To break the dynamic of the spread of the coronavirus, between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated, Spahn said. However, the first vaccines are only expected to be available in limited amounts. Germany plans to set up centralised vaccination centres to inoculate priority groups in the first instance, which will be supported by mobile teams. First in line for vaccines should be those who are at risk due to their age or pre-existing conditions, particularly people living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, the German research centre Leopoldina and the Ethics Council said in a position paper on priorities for vaccine delivery on Monday. The second group should include those exposed to the virus through their jobs, such as front-line healthcare workers, who could also spread infections to vulnerable people. For the third group, the experts proposed those who are needed to maintain public life, including health authority officials, police and security staff, firefighters and teachers. Detailed recommendations will only be possible once late-stage data on the characteristics of vaccines is available, the experts said. The German health ministry expects seven potential vaccines to complete testing this year or next, and is anticipating the first approvals in the first quarter of 2021, according to a copy of its national vaccine strategy paper seen by Reuters. Vaccination will not be mandatory. The German government will pay for the vaccines, while the cost of setting up vaccination centres will be borne by the states and public and private health insurers where appropriate. To get an overview on the effectiveness of the vaccines, Germany will collect non-personal data including information on age, sex, place of residence, vaccination date, vaccine product and vaccination dose administered, the ministry paper says."
-4.95063147460711," BioNTech hopes COVID-19 vaccine will immunize for at least a year FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech's BNTX.O co-founder and chief executive said he was optimistic that the protective effect of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine, co-developed with Pfizer PFE.N, would last for at least a year. The two companies earlier on Monday became the first drugmakers to release successful trial data, saying their vaccine was shown to be more than 90% effective, a major victory in the fight against the pandemic. “We should be more optimistic that the immunisation effect can last for at least a year,” CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters. While it was not yet known how long the protection would last, he said research on recovered patients had shown that those with high antibodies levels to begin with have not experienced a sharp drop in those levels, and the same would likely go for vaccinated people. Highlighting the logistical challenge of distributing the vaccine, which belongs to a class known as messenger RNA, the arrangement for the first three months would be that the genetic compound would have to be shipped and centrally stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. For transport to and at the site of administration it can be kept for up to five days at fridge temperatures, Sahin said, adding he was confident logistics would work very well. “By December we expect more data (on the molecular stability), and if those results allow us to keep the vaccine in a fridge for longer than five days, maybe two weeks, that would again simplify things.”"

The companies said the vaccine was more than 90% effective and they have so far found no serious safety concerns, priming it for possible speedy regulatory approvals. Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. emergency use authorisation in the U.S. of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85 in coming weeks. To do so, it will need to have collected two months of safety follow-up data on around half of the study’s roughly 44,000 participants, expected in late November. Pfizer and BioNTech, which already collaborate to develop mRNA-based vaccines for influenza, currently expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine in 2020 - enough to protect 25 million people - and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Below are the main details of the vaccine and Pfizer’s progress on supply deals and potential approvals: - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay. - BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunisation effect of the vaccine would last for a year although that was not certain yet. - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July and the vaccine showed promise in second early trial. - The company has said it could file for emergency approval in the United States in November. - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and target clinical trials in April. - Testing of vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month."

Below are the main details of the vaccine and Pfizer’s progress on supply deals and potential approvals: - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay. - BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunisation effect of the vaccine would last for a year although that was not certain yet. - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July and the vaccine showed promise in second early trial. - The company has said it could file for emergency approval in the United States in November. - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and target clinical trials in April. - Testing of vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month."

-4.95063147460711," REFILE-Pfizer, BioNTech say their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective (Refiles to attach correct story) Nov 9 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Monday said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study, a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed over 1 million people, roiled the world’s economy and upended daily life. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said they have so far found no serious safety concerns and expect to seek U.S. emergency use authorization later this month. If authorized, the number of vaccine doses will initially be limited. Many questions also remain including how long the vaccine will provide protection. However the news provides hope that other vaccines in development against the novel coronavirus may also prove effective. “Today is a great day for science and humanity,” Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.” Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. emergency use authorization of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need to have collected two months of safety data on around half of the study’s roughly 44,000 participants, expected in late November. “I’m near ecstatic,” Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer’s top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. “This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we’re now in.” Pfizer said the interim analysis was conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examining how many of them received the vaccine versus a placebo. The company did not break down exactly how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine. Still, over 90% effectiveness implies that no more than 8 of the 94 people who caught COVID-19 had been given the vaccine, which was administered in two shots about three weeks apart. The efficacy rate is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine. To confirm its efficacy rate, Pfizer said it will continue the trial until there are 164 COVID-19 cases among participants. Given the recent spike in U.S. infection rates, that number could be reached by early December, Gruber said. The data have yet to be peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. Pfizer said it would do so once it has results from the entire trial. Pfizer and BioNTech have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They have also reached supply agreements with the European Union, the UK, Canada and Japan. To save time, the companies began manufacturing the vaccine before they knew whether it would be effective. They now expect to produce up to 50 million doses or enough vaccine to protect 25 million people this year. Pfizer said it expects to produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021. The global race for a vaccine has seen wealthier countries forge multibillion-dollar supply deals with drugmakers like Pfizer, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson Inc , raising questions over when middle income and poorer nations will get access to inoculations. The U.S. quest for a vaccine has been the Trump administration’s central response to the pandemic. The United States has the world’s highest known number of COVID-19 cases and deaths with more than 10 million infections and more than 237,000 fatalities. President Donald Trump repeatedly assured the public that his administration would likely identify a successful vaccine in time for the presidential election, held last Tuesday. On Saturday, Democratic rival Joe Biden was declared the winner. Vaccines are seen as essential tools to help end the health crisis that has shuttered businesses and left millions out of work. Millions of children whose schools were closed in March remain in remote learning programs. Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday exceeded 50 million infections since the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year in China. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. Moderna Inc, whose vaccine candidate employs similar technology, is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month. The mRNA technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles. Pfizer alone will not have the capacity to immediately provide enough vaccines for the entire United States. The Trump administration has said it will have enough supply for all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021. The U.S. government has said the vaccines will be provided for free to Americans, including the insured, uninsured and those in government health programs such as Medicare."

1.9217853447395308," Argentina agrees deal for 22 million doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina has struck a deal with drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc to receive around 22 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine being developed with the University of Oxford, with the aim to start deliveries in the first half of next year. The drugmaker, one of a number developing vaccines worldwide to fight the novel coronavirus, said in a statement circulated by the government on Saturday that the delivery time-frame depended on ongoing trials being successful and obtaining necessary approvals by regulatory authorities. Argentina, which is starting to see new cases slow, is hoping to receive some 10 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine and a smaller number of doses of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine between December-January. Argentina is among the world’s hardest hit countries, despite imposing a strict lockdown back in March. It has logged 1.23 million cases of the disease and 33,136 deaths. Regulators have yet to approve a vaccine for COVID-19 but large global trials are well underway and early results are expected in November and December. Argentina is helping to produce the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine for Latin America."

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act units of the Justice Department and the U.S. SEC had sought documents relating to its Chinese operations, the company said in its filing, adding that it is producing records pursuant to these requests. In 2012, the drugmaker had agreed to pay $26.3 million to the top U.S. securities regulator as part of a settlement with the U.S. government following a probe into its use of illegal payments to win business overseas including Russia, Bulgaria, China, and Italy.

2.2425866061406334," COVID vaccine deliveries on ice as AstraZeneca awaits trial data (Reuters) - A summer dip in UK coronavirus infections has pushed back test results for AstraZenca’s potential COVID-19 vaccine, leading the drugmaker to delay deliveries of shots to the UK government. Britain’s vaccines chief said on Wednesday it would receive just 4 million doses of the potential vaccine this year, against initial estimates for 30 million by Sept. 30. AstraZeneca AZN.L said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from late-stage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelf-life of supplies. It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers, and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval. “We are a little bit late in deliveries, which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form,” CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call. However, he added AstraZeneca was “fully” prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready, adding the company’s weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans. AstraZeneca and its partner on the project, the University of Oxford, said data from late-stage trials should land this year. If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said. The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world’s best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives. Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval. The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this. While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs. On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe. For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations. However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts’ expectations of 98 cents. Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive. The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage."
2.2425866061406334," Britain prepares for COVID-19 vaccine as Oxford forecasts result this year LONDON (Reuters) - Late-stage trial results of a potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca could be presented this year as the British government prepares for a possible vaccination rollout in late December or early 2021. A vaccine is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.2 million people worldwide, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people. There are more than 200 candidates under development and the vaccine being developed by Oxford and licensed to British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L is seen as a front-runner. “I’m optimistic that we could reach that point before the end of this year,” Oxford Vaccine Trial Chief Investigator Andrew Pollard said of the chances of presenting trial results. Pollard told British lawmakers that establishing whether or not the vaccine worked would likely come this year, after which the data would have to be carefully reviewed by regulators and then a political decision made on who should receive it. “Our bit - we are getting closer to but we are not there yet,” Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said. Asked if he expected the vaccine would start to be deployed before Christmas, he said: “There is a small chance of that being possible but I just don’t know.” The National Health Service (NHS) in England is preparing to start distributing possible COVID-19 vaccines before Christmas in case one is ready by the end of the year. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to be submitted for regulatory approval, along with Pfizer PFE.N and BioNTech's 22UAy.F candidate. “If I put on my rose-tinted specs, I would hope that we will see positive interim data from both Oxford and from Pfizer/BioNTech in early December and if we get that then I think we have got the possibility of deploying by the year end,” Kate Bingham, the chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, told lawmakers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was the prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of 2021. AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday. ‘GAME CHANGER’ Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees. The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again. If Oxford’s vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality. Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: “Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement. “It’s a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,” he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system. But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were “very slim”. “(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,” Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer."

3.6269714700667914," Germany readies exhibition halls, mobile teams for COVID-19 vaccination BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is scouting trade fair halls and airport terminals to use as potential mass vaccination centres, as it draws up plans to inoculate the nation as soon as the first coronavirus shot gains European approval, state health officials told Reuters. Berlin expects the first COVID-19 vaccines to be available in early 2021 and has given the country’s 16 states a Nov. 10 deadline to detail the addresses of 60 facilities that could serve as delivery centres for manufacturers. Under the national vaccine strategy, approved by its cabinet last week, Germany has asked the states to identify central vaccination centres which will be supplemented by mobile teams who go into care homes. The centralised approach underscores the potential logistical challenges facing governments, including limited supplies, multi-dose vials and complex storage requirements. Some of the most advanced vaccines in human testing are so-called mRNA vaccines being developed by Moderna and the team of BioNTech and Pfizer Inc. The BioNTech/Pfizer candidate needs to be stored at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit). That may give a slight edge to Moderna, whose vaccine is stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), roughly the same as home freezer temperatures. In smaller, city states such as Hamburg and Bremen, authorities are scouting for central locations that are easy to reach like exhibition halls, where vaccinations could be stockpiled. “We are on the lookout for larger locations that are centrally located and spacious. This could well be the airport or trade fair,” a spokesman for Hamburg’s health ministry said, adding no final decision has been taken. Bigger, more rural states like Baden-Wuerttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein plan to distribute shots from a centralised delivery site into districts and towns, spokespeople for the health authorities said. Germany has asked the Robert Koch Institute’s vaccine committee to identify which vulnerable population groups should get the shots first, although front-line workers are expected to be a priority. In a second phase, when more vaccines are widely available in single-dose vials, Germany hopes to administer shots for the broader population at doctors’ practices. An electronic register will record who has been vaccinated, while an app is being developed to allow people to record potential side effects. The scale of Germany’s planning contrasts with Italy where authorities intend to use existing infrastructure, including 50,000 general practitioners, 14,000 paediatricians and vaccination centres for local public health offices. “With these channels we normally administer around 30 million vaccinations per year to both children and adults, so we believe that this is an adequate infrastructure for the future COVID vaccine as well,” a health ministry spokesman said. France has also been mulling plans for nationwide storage and distribution of vaccines, but no firm details were yet available, a source close to the health ministry said."

3.0985497456384516," S&P 500, Dow slip on earnings worries, stimulus uncertainty (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow fell on Tuesday, dragged down by a string of earnings disappointments and doubts about a coronavirus stimulus package before Election Day, although Nasdaq rose ahead of results from mega-cap technology companies. Caterpillar Inc fell 3.1% and 3M Co slipped 1.8% after both the industrial companies reported a fall in quarterly earnings. Investor sentiment sagged after the White House said a potential deal on COVID-19 relief could come in “weeks,” casting doubt on whether an accord could be struck with Congress before the Nov. 3 election. “Stimulus is now pushed back to after the election and the market is digesting that today,” said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. Sectors sensitive to economic growth took a hit. The S&P 500 banks index and the S&P energy sector shed about 1% each. The three major U.S. stock indexes fell to near four-week lows on Monday as investors fretted about record number of new coronavirus infections in the United States and some European countries and an elusive fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s fear gauge hovered at its highest level in nearly two months on jitters over the outcome of the election. Democratic challenger Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in national polls but the race is much tighter in battleground states which determine the election outcome. At 12:34 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 122.58 points, or 0.46% to 27,562.80, the S&P 500 index lost 3.57 points, or 0.10% to 3,397.40 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 54.87 points or 0.48% to 11,413.81. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose as Microsoft Corp firmed 1.2% in the run-up to its results after the closing bell. Apple Inc, Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook Inc, which together account for about a fifth of the S&P 500’s total value, also report results this week. The NYSE FANG+TM Index was up 1.4%. Analysts expect the tech sector to post a 0.4% increase in third-quarter earnings from a year earlier, while overall S&P 500 profit is forecast to fall 16.2%, according to Refinitiv data. Concerns over a rise in U.S. coronavirus cases are weighing on the market although technology sector, in particular, seems to be the least exposed, said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “A focus on big technology companies may move this market to rally despite the problems the virus is creating.” Insurer American International Group Inc gained 0.4% after its board named Peter Zaffino as chief executive officer and approved a plan to separate the life and retirement business from the rest of the company. Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc fell 4.1% as it agreed to buy Xilinx Inc in a $35 billion all-stock deal. Xilinx shares soared about 8.2%, while those of AMD-rival Intel fell 2.3%. Merck & Co Inc gained 0.3% as it raised its full-year earnings forecast. In contrast, drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co fell about 5.5% after its quarterly profit took a hit from increased costs to develop a COVID-19 treatment. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.6-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 0.8-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 11 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and 48 new lows."

Pfizer said earlier on Tuesday it was not yet ready to release data from the late-stage trial of the COVID-19 vaccine."
3.0985497456384516," Pfizer says no COVID-19 vaccine data yet, could be week or more before it reports (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Tuesday it does not yet have data from the late-stage trial of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany's BioNTech SE 22UAy.F, and provided a timeline that makes its release unlikely ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.Pfizer said there had not yet been enough infections in the 44,000-volunteer trial to trigger an analysis of whether or not the vaccine works. An independent panel will conduct the first analysis when it reaches 32 infections. Chief Executive Albert Bourla said after it has enough data for the analysis, it typically takes 5 to 7 days before the company can publicly release the data, meaning it is likely to happen after the election. U.S. President Donald Trump had said a vaccine could be available before the Nov. 3 election, but in recent weeks his administration has emphasized that one will be ready this year. Bourla has previously said the company could release data on whether or not the vaccine works as early as this month. “For us, the election is an artificial milestone,” Bourla said on a conference call for the company’s earnings. “This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democrat vaccine. It will be a vaccine for the citizens of the world.” Pfizer shares were flat at $37.92. Pfizer hopes to be the first U.S. drugmaker to unveil successful data from a late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial, ahead of rival Moderna Inc MRNA.O. Pfizer and BioNTech launched their phase 3 study in late July. The data monitoring board is scheduled to make its first assessment of the vaccine’s performance after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. Healthcare investor Brad Loncar said it was difficult to draw a positive or negative conclusion from the fact that the trial has not yet had its first interim analysis. “I think this means that the overall infection rate is a lot lower than Pfizer initially estimated,” Loncar said. Dr. David Boulware, professor of medicine at University of Minnesota, said the study’s participants may be more adherent to social distancing guidelines than the general population. “Who the vaccine trials really need are the people who don’t wear masks, who are going out to bars, who go to crowded events, who are singing in church choirs - those are the high risk people,” he said. Boulware said that a data monitoring board could still review the data relatively quickly - perhaps in less than a day - once the trial hits its first interim point. As the pandemic crimps demand for certain Pfizer therapies and damages global economies, investors are keenly focused on seeing the late-stage study data of the vaccine candidate being developed with BioNTech. The company also said that if the trial is successful, it still expects to file for emergency authorization of the vaccine candidate from U.S. regulators shortly after it has enough safety data in late November. It expects to have manufacturing data ready to submit to those regulators before then. Pfizer reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates by one cent, helped by lower-than-expected costs. Sales fell 4.3% to $12.13 billion in the third quarter due to a sharp drop in revenue from its off-patent pain drug Lyrica, as well as a $500-million hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts estimates of 71 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Caterpillar Inc fell 2.2% and 3M Co slipped 1% after both the industrial companies reported lower quarterly earnings. Investor sentiment sagged after the White House said a potential deal on COVID-19 relief could come in “weeks,” casting doubt on whether an accord could be struck with Congress before the Nov. 3 election. “Stimulus is now pushed back to after the election and the market is digesting that today,” said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. Sectors sensitive to economic growth took a hit. The S&P 500 banks index and the S&P energy sector shed about 1% each.

Apple Inc, Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook Inc, which together account for about a fifth of the S&P 500’s total value, also report results this week. Analysts expect the tech sector to post a 0.3% fall in third-quarter earnings from a year earlier, while overall S&P 500 profit is forecast to fall 18.4%, according to Refinitiv data. Concerns over a rise in U.S. coronavirus cases are weighing on the market although technology sector, in particular, seems to be the least exposed, said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “A focus on big technology companies may move this market to rally despite the problems the virus is creating.” Insurer American International Group Inc gained 2% after its board named Peter Zaffino as chief executive officer and approved a plan to separate the life and retirement business from the rest of the company.

3.0607502896741816," Pfizer says earliest U.S. filing for COVID-19 vaccine would be late November (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Friday it could file in late November for U.S. authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing, suggesting that a vaccine could potentially be available in the United States by the end of the year. That timeline makes it unlikely, however, that a vaccine will be available before the U.S. election, as President Donald Trump has promised. Pfizer, which is developing the vaccine with German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F, said that it may confirm if the vaccine is effective as soon as this month but that it also needs safety data from a 44,000-person clinical trial that will not be available until next month. The Pfizer news, published in a letter from its chief executive on its website, lifted the U.S. stock market and the company's shares. Shares fell slightly of rival vaccine maker Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is close to Pfizer in its vaccine development. “So let me be clear, assuming positive data, Pfizer will apply for Emergency Authorization Use in the U.S. soon after the safety milestone is achieved in the third week of November,” Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said, noting that he published the letter to provide greater clarity on the timeline for the vaccine. People around the world are counting on a vaccine to control the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than a million people and ravaged the global economy. Fears of delays were raised after trials for two rival vaccines were put on hold in the United States in recent weeks. Trump has said repeatedly that there would be a vaccine available before the Nov. 3 election. When asked about the Pfizer news, White House spokesman Judd Deere said, “The president continues to be optimistic that we will have one or more vaccines very soon, before the end of the year.” The U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program has spent billions of dollars on development of vaccines and treatments. It has signed a deal to buy Pfizer vaccine shots if they work. But the rush to develop a vaccine has raised concerns that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, acting in haste, might not conduct an adequate review. U.S. health officials have sought to assuage those concerns. Earlier this month, the FDA formalized a requirement that the vaccine-makers collect two months of safety data on one-half of trial participants. Pfizer has been trying to demonstrate that its decision-making is being driven by science rather than politics, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan said. “Just getting it to the market is only a small part of it,” Divan said. “People should actually be willing to take it.” Rival vaccine-maker Moderna could also apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) this year. It has said that it may have interim data on its 30,000 person trial as soon as November. Both companies are also applying for approval in Europe, where they are racing against AstraZeneca PLC AZN.L. AstraZeneca's U.S. trial has been on hold since September, while another U.S. trial of a candidate from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N was paused earlier this week. After the FDA announced the two-month requirement on Oct. 6, which was approved by the White House but undercut the likelihood of a vaccine before voters go to polls, Trump called the move a “political hit job.” In addition to safety and efficacy, the FDA will also examine Pfizer’s manufacturing operations for the vaccine. A BioNTech spokeswoman confirmed the time frame for the possible EUA application to the FDA. Pfizer’s shares were up 3.5% in afternoon trading, while BioNTech’s U.S.-listed shares were up 3.9%. Moderna shares fell 1.5%."

Last week, the drugmaker said it will soon apply for a real-time review of mRNA-1273 in Europe, days after the European Union health regulator launched rolling reviews of shots from AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech. Real-time reviews could speed up the process of approving a successful vaccine by allowing researchers to submit findings in real time, without having to wait for studies to conclude. Moderna, one of the furthest along in the U.S. race for a COVID-19 vaccine, said last week the ongoing U.S. trial of mRNA-1273 was on track for a data readout by November."
6.368517581401037," Pfizer to enroll kids as young as 12 in COVID-19 vaccine study (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will enroll participants as young as 12 in its large, late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial to understand how it works in a wider age group. While severe COVID-19 symptoms are extremely rare in infected children, they can pass on the virus to high-risk groups such as the elderly. That makes determining the effectiveness of a potential vaccine in children crucial, as vaccines work differently in kids and adults, the FDA said in its guidelines here in June. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted permission to the drugmaker and German partner BioNTech SE to enroll younger participants this month, according to an update on the U.S. company's website here on Monday. Last month, Pfizer scaled up its trial to about 44,000 participants, from up to 30,000, to enroll people as young as 16 and those with chronic, stable HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. The company said on Tuesday it would enroll children in its study based on satisfactory safety data in older adolescents and young adults, but did not specify a timeline. Pfizer is racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the new coronavirus with rivals such as Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson. Late-stage vaccine trials initiated by Moderna, J&J and Novavax Inc are testing their respective candidates only in adults. AstraZeneca’s U.K. vaccine trial, targeting more than 12,000 volunteers, will have one out of 11 subgroups with children 5 to 12 years of age. Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said last month that tests on children had not yet started."

7.525082955428959," New Zealand signs deal with Pfizer, BioNTech for COVID-19 vaccine SYDNEY (Reuters) - The New Zealand government signed a deal on Monday to buy 1.5 million COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.F, with delivery potentially as early as the first quarter of 2021. The government did not disclose financial terms of the deal, its first vaccine purchase, which will provide enough doses to vaccinate 750,000 people. Officials said talks were continuing with other drug companies to secure more vaccine supplies for the country of 5 million people and further announcements were expected next month. “The additional agreements will ensure that once the portfolio is completed, we will have sufficient COVID-19 vaccines for the whole population,” Research Minister Megan Woods said in a statement. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is one of the leading candidates in the race to be the first to get regulatory approval in the United States and Europe. New Zealand appeared to have stamped out community transmission of COVID-19 earlier this year following a tough nationwide lockdown. A renewed outbreak in the city of Auckland in August was also brought under control with fresh lockdown measures.

7.468031819515318," Pfizer's breast cancer drug Ibrance fails late-stage study (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday its cancer drug Ibrance did not meet the main goal in a late-stage trial in patients with a type of breast cancer, the latest setback in the company’s attempt to expand the use of the drug to treat early stages of the disease. The latest development comes after an independent data monitoring committee said in May a similar trial comparing Ibrance plus an endocrine therapy to a standalone endocrine therapy to treat early-stage breast cancer was unlikely to meet the main goal. Ibrance is already approved in the United States to treat certain adult patients with advanced breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body. The drug has not yet been approved for treating early stages of the disease. This puts the drug at a relative disadvantage to rival Eli Lilly and Co, which in June posted data showing that its drug Verzenio, met the trial goal of reducing the risk of early-stage breast cancer from recurring. “Today’s data leaves Lilly’s Verzenio as the clear winner in the adjuvant space for now, giving Verzenio a blockbuster opportunity in a potential early breast cancer indication,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said. In the late-stage trial, Ibrance failed to meet the main goal of increasing the amount of time patients survived without their cancer returning. Lilly’s shares were up 1% at $155.10 in pre-market trading, while Pfizer’s stock was flat at $36.90."

Speaking at a symposium conducted by the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington, Slaoui said data readouts from leading vaccine developers are expected to come in three waves over the next several months. The first wave would be coming from Pfizer and Moderna, both of which are developing mRNA-based vaccines for the coronavirus, he said. Slaoui said efficacy data on one or two vaccines will be available within the next month or two, for which there will be enough doses to immunize 30 million people between November and December. Commenting on AstraZeneca’s vaccine program, Slaoui said while the company’s U.S. study remains on hold, data readouts on the vaccine’s effectiveness may be expected somewhere in late October or November from ongoing studies in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. “At that time, we will have very few doses to be able to, if the decision was to approve the vaccine, immunize,” he said, adding that efforts are in place to scale up manufacturing and stockpiling of the vaccine."

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Tuesday its human medicines committee was evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, and would continue to do so until enough data is available for a final decision. (bit.ly/34mAHiI) Pfizer and BioNTech said in a joint statement the start of the review is based on data from laboratory and animal testing, as well as early testing on humans, while continuing talks to submit data as it emerged. The EMA is using “rolling reviews” to speed up evaluations of vaccines during the pandemic by studying data as it is submitted, rather than waiting for all data to be made available along with a formal application. Last week, it began reviewing AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine, AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, increasing chances of the British vaccine becoming the first to be approved in the region for the disease which has killed more than a million people globally. While AZD1222 uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus to build immunity against COVID-19, Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, called BNT162b2, uses ribonucleic acid, a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins. When injected in people, BNT162b2 instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the novel coronavirus, which the body recognizes as a foreign invader and mounts an immune response against it.

7.923337533518017," U.S. FDA to tighten coronavirus vaccine authorization standards ahead of election - paper (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to soon announce new, more stringent standards for an emergency authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine, lowering the chances that one might be cleared for use before the Nov. 3 election, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. The agency is issuing the guidance to boost transparency and public trust as health experts have become increasingly concerned that the Trump administration might be interfering in the approval process, the newspaper said. According to the report, the FDA is expected to ask vaccine manufacturers seeking an emergency authorization to follow trial participants for a median of at least two months after they receive a second vaccine shot. It also said the agency is asking that trials identify a specific number of severe cases of COVID-19 in patients who received a placebo in the trials. Few vaccine developers were expected to have definitive trial results before the presidential election. Pfizer Inc had been the exception, although its timetable could slip with the new guidance. Moderna Inc has said it is unlikely to have data in October. AstraZeneca Plc’s trial in the United States is halted while investigators try to determine whether a serious neurological problem suffered by one participant in the company’s U.K. trial was caused by the vaccine. Moderna and Pfizer began their late-stage trials on July 27, and took about a month to enroll 15,000 people, the halfway point for their initial planned enrollment. The trials are designed for people to receive their second shot either three or four weeks after the first. Two months of follow-up would make it unlikely the companies would have enough data before mid-November. Pfizer said on Tuesday that based on current infection rates it still expects to know whether or not their vaccine works as early as the end of October. Pfizer’s trial protocol calls for an early look at the data after just 32 participants become infected. “We anticipate providing FDA with safety data, including the median of two months safety data after the second dose, on a rolling basis to help inform FDA’s ultimate determination of authorization or approval,” the drugmaker said in an emailed statement."

The drug combination also doubled patients’ median length of time before their cancer began to worsen to 16.6 months compared to progression-free survival of 8.3 months for patients treated with the chemotherapy sunitinib, an older Pfizer Inc drug sold under the brand name Sutent. “There is no doubt in my mind that this will be a major player” as an initial treatment for advanced kidney cancer, said lead researcher Dr. Toni Choueiri from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He noted that the oncology community is already familiar with both drugs and that the combination demonstrated positive results on all the study’s goals. The Phase III study of 651 patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma was being presented as part of the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting being held virtually this year. A brief summary of the data, known as an abstract, was released on Friday. Researchers said the safety of the combination was manageable and consistent with the side effect profile of the two drugs when used individually. Opdivo is one of Bristol’s top-selling drugs, with analysts forecasting nearly $7 billion in sales this year. The new data could help boost sales that have slowed in recent years as Opdivo was eclipsed by Merck & Co’s rival drug Keytruda."
9.5363005542013," Pfizer vaccine trial bets on early win against coronavirus, documents show (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is betting that its coronavirus vaccine candidate will show clear evidence of effectiveness early in its clinical trial, according to the company and internal documents reviewed by Reuters that describe how the trial is being run. In recent weeks, Pfizer has said it should know by the end of October whether the vaccine, developed together with Germany’s BioNTech SE, is safe and effective. If the vaccine is shown to work by then, Pfizer has said it would quickly seek regulatory approval. It has not said what data it would use. President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election, has said a vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic is possible before the Nov. 3 U.S. vote, raising concerns over political interference. Scientists have questioned whether drugmakers will have enough evidence to achieve success by that time. Pfizer’s clinical trial protocol outlines for the company, scientists and regulators how the drugmaker could show that its vaccine meets efficacy and safety standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A company’s protocol is submitted to the FDA for review and is overseen by an independent panel of experts known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The protocol calls for a first assessment of the vaccine’s performance by the monitoring board after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. So far, more than 29,000 people have enrolled in the trial that started in July, some receiving the vaccine and the others receiving a placebo. The FDA has said that a coronavirus vaccine must prove to be at least 50 percent more effective than a placebo in a large-scale trial to be considered for approval. However, a smaller sample of infections in a clinical trial changes the calculation of how that standard is met, according to researchers. Pfizer’s vaccine would need to be at least 76.9% effective to show it works based on 32 infections, according to its protocol. That would mean that no more than six of those coronavirus cases would have occurred among people who received the vaccine, the documents showed. If the drugmaker’s vaccine does not meet the 76.9% efficacy target at this first interim analysis, it would face tougher statistical significance thresholds during subsequent interim assessments, biostatisticians who reviewed the protocol said. Pfizer said its interim analyses were designed to show conclusive evidence “as quickly as possible amid the devastating pandemic if our vaccine meets the stringent standards set by FDA.” Pfizer would not say whether it would use an interim analysis as the basis for seeking approval. The FDA declined to comment on whether it would consider such data sufficient for approval. Interim analyses typically are used by data and safety monitoring boards to determine whether an experimental drug appears safe and effective enough to continue a trial, or whether it should be stopped if a safety problem arises. But if a vaccine meets FDA benchmarks at an interim analysis without any serious safety problems, it could make sense to use it as a basis for authorization to help curb a pandemic that has killed about 940,000 people globally, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Moderna Inc, another front-runner in the vaccine race, told Reuters it would seek emergency FDA authorization to use its vaccine in high-risk groups if an interim assessment of its trial showed its vaccine was at least 70 percent effective. Moderna, which made its protocols public on Thursday, said its first interim analysis of 53 infections is likely to come in November. Some vaccine experts have said drugmakers should wait to reach their final analyses of more than 150 cases before seeking FDA approval. They note the speed at which vaccines are being developed for COVID-19, compressing what can be a decade-long process into months. Relying on the more limited interim analyses could overstate a vaccine’s effectiveness simply because not enough trial participants fell ill, they have said. Moving more quickly through the trial process also means a drugmaker could miss potential side effects that could materialize if trials were given more time. “These interim analyses have a flashing sign of short cuts,” said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. “You miss safety issues and you may very well exaggerate the benefits.” In addition to Pfizer and Moderna, Reuters reviewed the clinical trial protocols for vaccine candidates developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson. AstraZeneca set its first interim analysis when about 40 coronavirus infections are reported among participants. Its U.S. trial is currently on hold after a patient fell ill. J&J’s first analysis would begin at 20 infections, according to the protocol of their large-scale trial due to begin on Sept. 21. AstraZeneca and J&J declined to comment."
9.983297465569395," BioNTech buys German site from Novartis to boost vaccine output FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech is buying a production site for the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Pfizer, aiming to boost output by several hundred million doses next year, and hopes to have the shot ready to file for approval in October. It is buying the facility, in the German city of Marburg, from Swiss drugs giant Novartis. The site is part of a complex started in 1904 by pioneering immunologist and Nobel laureate for medicine Emil von Behring, who used the prize money for the investment. BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said its experimental vaccine could be reviewed by regulators in late October or early November, among the first in the western world. “A good vaccine should have an immunisation effect of at least 70% to 75% and that is also the yardstick that we have set ourselves in order to have a vaccine that can stop the pandemic in a significant way,” Sahin said. His remarks were in response to a request to comment on Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, who said in August he would like a vaccine be at least 75% effective. Germany’s BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker Pfizer have previously said this would be possible as early as late October. The transaction with Novartis, for which the price tag was not disclosed, is part of a push to prepare for a global roll-out of the pair’s experimental vaccine, based on so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. The facility in Marburg will be converted to be fully on stream in the first half of 2021 with an annual production capacity up to 750 million doses of the inoculation. BioNTech and Pfizer were previously aiming to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of this year and an additional 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Chief Financial Officer Sierk Poetting said the 2021 output volume target should be increased by several hundred million doses and a precise number would depend on the timing of the production launch and ramp-up speed. The biotech firm said the facility, with its 300 staff that will join BioNTech, will be one of the largest mRNA manufacturing sites in Europe, alongside two of BioNTech’s existing vaccine production sites. Pfizer said it had at least four production sites in the United States and Europe. BioNTech said the infrastructure and qualified staff would allow for a quick retooling to make its mRNA vaccine, but the new site would also support its main cancer drug development programme."

9.552809798236817," Trump says coronavirus vaccine could be weeks away: ABC News town hall PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a vaccine against the deadly coronavirus could be three or four weeks away, despite cautionary notes sounded by some U.S. public health officials about that accelerated timeline. Trump, speaking at a town hall hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia, defended his handling of the coronavirus crisis, and said a vaccine could be ready for distribution before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3. “We’re very close to having a vaccine,” he said. “If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals. And we’re within weeks of getting it... Could be three weeks, four weeks.” Earlier this month, top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN that most experts believe a vaccine will be ready by November or December. “It is conceivable that you can have it by October, though I don’t think that that’s likely.” Other experts say a scientifically credible vaccine will not be available until early 2021. Trump bristled at tough questions from uncommitted voters and ABC News host George Stephanopoulos during the town hall meeting, arguing that his decision to impose travel bans on China and Europe had saved thousands, if not millions, of lives. He also defended Americans who have shunned face masks and social distancing guidelines, and said even experts like Fauci had changed their views about those practices during the crisis. Trump has faced criticism for holding large-scale campaign events in Nevada and other states - events that his adviser Fauci has described as “absolutely” risky. His Democratic challenger, former vice president Joe Biden, last week accused Trump of “dereliction” of duty in dealing with the pandemic, which has cost millions of jobs. The United States has reported nearly 6.6 million cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, the highest number worldwide, and nearly 195,000 deaths. That accounts for 20% of the cases worldwide, although the United States has just 4% of the world’s population. Trump said the United States had a number of cases because it did more testing that other countries. He also repeated his claim from early in the pandemic that the virus would disappear on its own, and denied understating the threat of the disease when asked by an audience member why he would “downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities.” “Yeah, well, I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it, in terms of action. My action was very strong,” the Republican president, who is seeking reelection on Nov. 3, said. Trump also provoked mockery on Twitter when he spoke about “herd mentality” instead of “herd immunity,” a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when enough people have become immune through vaccination or previous infections. “It would go away without the vaccine ... but it’s going to go away a lot faster with it,” he said. “You’ll develop ... a herd mentality.”"

Data as of Aug. 27 showed that fatigue was the most common side effect in patients enrolled in the trial, Pfizer executives said on an investor conference. The company has enrolled more than 29,000 people in its 44,000-volunteer trial to test the experimental COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with German partner BioNTech."
11.525791964330349," Germany grants BioNTech, CureVac $745 million to speed up COVID-19 vaccine work BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany awarded $745 million in funding to biotech firms BioNTech and CureVac on Tuesday to speed up work on COVID-19 vaccines and expand German production capacity. In a warning against political pressure to rush the process, Research Minister Anja Karliczek stressed that safety should remain the utmost priority to ensure vaccines will be accepted by the broader population. “Even when the world is waiting for a vaccine - we won’t take risky short-cuts here,” she told a news conference in Berlin. Concerns have grown that safety and efficacy standards might slip in the race to find a vaccine against the virus which has so far infected more than 29 million people and claimed over 926,000 lives globally. Vaccine developers around the world have yet to produce large-scale trial data showing actual infections in participants, yet Russia granted approval to a COVID-19 vaccine last month, prompting some Western experts to criticise a lack of testing. Karliczek said she does not expect a vaccine to be available for the broader population until the middle of 2021. The ministry awarded BioNTech 375 million euros ($445 million) and CureVac 252 million euros in funding, subject to meeting certain milestones, after they applied under a scheme announced in July. Both BioNTech and CureVac are among the leading developers of experimental COVID-19 vaccines, based on molecules carrying a genetic code called messenger RNA (mRNA). The ministry said it was still in talks to provide funding to a third company, IDT Biologika, which produces vaccines for other pharmaceutical companies and is working on its own so-called viral vector vaccine. Health Minister Jens Spahn said it was important to have a broad portfolio of vaccines and that Germany would look to secure more doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines in advance than its population size. It has already secured 54 million doses of AstraZeneca’s potential vaccine candidate as part of a European Union deal with the drugmaker for 450 million doses, he said. Along with the funding for BioNTech and CureVac, Germany has contributed money to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to bolster the testing of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. Spahn said the government was due to decide this week whether to contribute to the “COVAX” global vaccine allocation plan, co-led by the World Health Organization, that aims to help buy and fairly distribute the shots. The deadline to join the programme is Friday."

Gold jumped almost 1% as the dollar slid and bond yields were stable as investors gauge how the U.S. Federal Reserve will put its new approach to monetary policy into practice and keep its dovish stance at this week’s policy meeting. Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE on Saturday proposed expanding their Phase 3 pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial to about 44,000 participants, while increasing the diversity of the trial population. Drugmaker AstraZeneca said over the weekend it has resumed British clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development, after getting the green light from safety watchdogs. “The market reacts positively to any vaccine news,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “We’re going to see a lot more vaccines come out, and that is what really is helping the markets.” The World Health Organization reported a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases on Sunday, with the total rising by 307,930 in 24 hours. The biggest increases were from India, the United States and Brazil. “There is still some caution in markets because U.S. virus numbers appear to be picking up again in some states,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “The vaccine news is positive but there is a lot of skepticism about when they become widely adopted,” Shah said. Plans by Nvidia Corp to buy UK-based chip designer Arm from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp for as much as $40 billion, a deal expected to reshape the global semiconductor landscape, also drove sentiment. Nvidia shares, which have more than doubled this year, added 5.1%. Oracle surged 4.9% as the cloud services company said it would team up with China’s ByteDance to keep TikTok operating in the United States, beating Microsoft Corp in a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale. MSCI’s benchmark for global equity markets rose 1.17% to 572.56.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.21%, the S&P 500 gained 1.34% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.75%. U.S. stocks had notched two straight weeks of losses as investors sold the technology shares that fueled the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs in a dramatic recovery from March lows spawned by the pandemic-induced downturn. Overnight in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9% to its highest in almost a week.

The initial target figure for the trial was up to 30,000 participants, which the companies said they expect to reach by next week. The proposed expansion would also allow the companies to enroll people as young as 16 and people with chronic, stable HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B, they added. Drugmakers racing to develop a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine pledged in July to ensure their larger clinical trials would include diverse sets of volunteers. “Diversity in clinical trials is a priority for Pfizer and is critical given that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts communities of color in the U.S.,” Pfizer’s Chief Business Officer John Young said in a U.S. congressional hearing in July. If the study is successful, the companies could submit the vaccine for regulatory approval as early as October, putting them on track to supply up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. “As stated previously, based on current infection rates, the companies continue to expect that a conclusive readout on efficacy is likely by the end of October,” the companies added in the joint statement on Saturday. The vaccine candidate utilizes chemical messenger RNA to mimic the surface of the coronavirus and teach the immune system to recognize and neutralize it.

24.64449080271801," How drugmakers can keep their pledge and still deliver an October vaccine surprise (This Sept 9 story corrects Pfizer executive’s title in 17th paragraph) NEW YORK (Reuters) - As questions mount over whether the United States will authorize a coronavirus vaccine ahead of November elections, experts say there is a slim chance that enough evidence will be available to prove one is safe and effective in that time frame. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said a vaccine is possible before the Nov. 3 election, and accused a “deep state” within the nation’s top health regulator of trying to slow pivotal clinical trials to hamper his chances at a second term. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration denied that claim, saying its decisions will be guided by data alone. Drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence amid political squabbles on Tuesday pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards in their quest for a vaccine. Vaccine safety was in focus on Wednesday after AstraZeneca PLC said that it had put a pause on its coronavirus trial on the vaccine with Oxford to review the safety data of an unexplained illness in the U.K. trial. It described the move as routine and said it would restart trials when an independent committee recommended it do so. Other companies have recently made comments suggesting they could have an answer on whether their vaccines work before November. “It would really be an amazing vaccine to show that,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters. Fauci said initial trial results are likely to become available in November or December, but late October remains a possibility. “It is conceivable that if there are enough infections documented early on that you might get that answer earlier,” he said. Vaccines must demonstrate they are at least 50% more effective than a placebo to be considered for approval. To prove that, government officials have said, at least 150 COVID-19 infections must be recorded among trial participants with at least twice as many occurring among the placebo group. If a vaccine is especially effective, companies could have their answer sooner. Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, whose U.S. vaccine trials have enrolled thousands of people and are the most advanced, say they may have proof after just a few dozen subjects become infected. Independent panels of experts called data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB) will review trial data at pre-specified points. These boards can recommend companies stop the trials if the evidence is overwhelmingly positive or negative. For Pfizer, the first interim look occurs when 32 trial volunteers get infected. Experts interviewed by Reuters cautioned that information gleaned from a limited number of subjects could miss important safety issues that letting the trial fully play out might reveal. ‘ABSOLUTELY INSUFFICIENT’ Pfizer’s trial calls for four interim analyses by the DSMB, the first after just 32 recorded infections. “We may have enough data to be able to share the first analysis by October,” said Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts. Moderna’s first interim analysis will come after 53 trial subjects become infected, the company told investors last month. Basing a decision on 53 cases, is “an absolutely insufficient number,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who has served on FDA vaccine advisory panels. “You would know very little about safety.” To halt the trials due to positive results, vaccines would likely have to exceed the 50% efficacy threshold. Pfizer has not disclosed what standard will be used for stopping its trial early. William Gruber, senior vice president of Pfizer vaccine clinical research and development, said “the standard would be evidence of very high efficacy.” A senior official with the U.S. effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development said companies have created appropriate trials to hold interim analyses that could detect especially effective vaccines earlier. Although both drugmakers began vaccinating people in their respective 30,000-subject trials on July 28, Pfizer is in position to generate results earlier in part because it is administering the second shot of its two-dose vaccine a week earlier than Moderna. Moderna also slowed enrollment to ensure greater participation of at-risk minorities in its study. Pfizer’s trial also begins collecting data on infections that occur a week after it administers its second shot. Moderna has a two-week lag between the second shot and when it will begin collecting infection data in earnest. Both trials are on pace to be fully enrolled soon. Dr. Henry Miller, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute think tank and former director of the FDA’s office of biotechnology, said an emergency use authorization based on a small number of infections would not deliver an adequate answer on the safety of a vaccine intended for use by millions of healthy people. Some side effects could take four to six months to occur, he said. Dr. Gregory Glenn, research chief for Novavax Inc, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, said the October timeline remains possible. But he believes Americans will likely be waiting longer. “I just think humility is a good thing right now,” he said. “The FDA set out some pretty strict criteria for success. So that’s going to take a pretty good vaccine to do that.”"
23.17171058972666," EU enters final talks for BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had entered final stage talks with BioNTech-Pfizer to purchase up to 300 million doses of a potential vaccine against COVID-19. This is the sixth potential vaccine for which the European Union executive has struck or plans to strike an advance purchase agreement. The envisaged contract with Germany’s BioNTech and U.S.-based Pfizer would lead to an initial purchase of 200 million doses, with an option to buy a further 100 million, the Commission said after the conclusion of exploratory talks. All EU members would have the possibility to buy the vaccine and could donate to poorer nations or redirect to other European countries. EU supply would be produced by BioNTech’s sites in Germany and Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium, with deliveries starting by the end of the year, the companies said in a statement. They added they were on track to seek regulatory review of their potential vaccine in October and, subject to approval, plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The proposed agreement with the European Commission would be the largest initial order of doses for Pfizer and BioNTech to date, they said. The companies are developing a new variety of vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA), which makes the human body create viral proteins, prompting the immune system to produce a defensive response. The Commission reached a first agreement last month with AstraZeneca for at least 300 million doses of its potential vaccine, mirroring moves by the United States and other wealthy states to secure stock of effective COVID-19 vaccines. It has also concluded exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK, Johnson & Johnson, CureVac and Moderna to buy upfront their potential COVID-19 vaccines and is in discussions with other manufacturers."

Germany’s vaccines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, gave the approval for the Phase 2/3 trial of the experimental vaccine known as BNT162b2, BioNTech and its partner Pfizer said in a statement. The global trial was initiated in July, with a view to including about 120 sites globally and seeking up to 30,000 participants in total. More than 25,000 participants have been enrolled, BioNTech said, adding it remained on track to seek approval for BNT162b2 as early as next month."
17.278612357089496," Pfizer sees COVID-19 vaccine data in thick of U.S. election fight ZURICH (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer should know in October if a COVID-19 vaccine it is developing works, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Thursday, potentially placing it at the centre of bitter U.S. presidential politics ahead of the Nov. 3 election. Pfizer would submit the candidate for approval immediately if data shows the vaccine, developed with partner, Germany’s BioNTech, proves safe and effective, Bourla said at an online briefing sponsored by drug industry group IFPMA. The race for vaccines with Moderna, AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and Chinese and Russian competitors comes as President Donald Trump seeks re-election, after committing billions of federal dollars to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, which has killed more than 180,000 Americans. Trump, facing Democratic challenger Joe Biden, hopes to deliver a win on vaccines by Election Day, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already asking states to prepare a distribution plan for high-risk groups as soon as late October. The timing of Pfizer’s study’s data depends on how quickly scientists work, as well as on the severity of COVID-19 infections in its study locations in the United States, Argentina and Brazil, Bourla said. “Based on our calculations, we are expecting that to be in October,” Bourla said, adding Pfizer has enrolled 23,000 patients, so far, with recruitment progressing ahead of original plans. Rival Merck also confirmed aims to start human trials on one COVID-19 vaccine candidate “fairly soon,” with trials of second candidate also likely later this year, Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said at the IFPMA event. Both Merck’s Frazier and Pfizer’s Bourla pledged to only seek authorization if safety and efficacy data from large groups of people warrants it. People fear politicization of science could lead to a vaccine to be submitted or withheld for political gain, Bourla acknowledged, calling it “the worst situation society can be in”. “We will never ourselves submit for authorization or approval any vaccine before we feel it is safe and effective,” Bourla said. “We will not cut corners.”"

Last week, the company said it had enrolled more than 11,000 volunteers in the trial."
0.020415363458461268," Exclusive: Nearly a fifth of enrollees in Pfizer, BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine study are Black or Latino (This August 21 story has been corrected to rectify percentages of people with fever in trial in the fourth from last paragraph) CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly a fifth of 11,000 people enrolled so far in a 30,000-volunteer U.S. trial testing a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer PFE.N and German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F are Black or Latino, groups among the hardest hit by the coronavirus virus pandemic, a top Pfizer executive said. “Between Latinx and Black or African American populations, we’re running at about 19 percent or so,” Dr. Bill Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told Reuters in an interview. “We’re trying to push even higher than that.” Black and Latino Americans are infected with COVID-19 at more than twice the rate of white Americans, with Native Americans infected at even higher rates, research has shown. The groups are historically underrepresented in clinical trials. The companies’ vaccine has quickly advanced into late-stage testing, with some participants already getting their second of two doses. Physicians and scientists have been urging companies testing coronavirus vaccines to include Black, Latino and indigenous Americans in COVID-19 vaccine trials in hopes of building trust among at-risk populations. “We have a lot of campaigns to reach out to those communities because they are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 illness, so we are very keen to have those individuals as part of our trial,” Gruber said on Thursday. “They have higher attack rates and they are most likely to benefit.” According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May, only half of Black Americans said they were somewhat or very interested in taking a COVID-19 vaccine. Gruber did not disclose the number of Native Americans enrolled in the trial, but said Pfizer plans to draw on ties from its Prevnar 7 pneumococcal vaccine tests in the southwestern United States. “I’m hopeful we’ll be able to make further inroads in that community as well,” he said. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have data sufficient for an emergency use authorization (EUA) or to start a full submission in October, according to Gruber. The company does not need to finish recruiting the full 30,000 patients planned for the trial in order to have enough data to support an EUA, he said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said COVID-19 vaccine trials need to have a safety database of at least 3,000 individuals for each of the younger and elderly populations in which it is tested. Ultimately, the speed with which the vaccine can be approved depends on how quickly patients in the placebo arm become infected with the virus, starting about a week after the second dose is administered. That began this week. “We won’t really know until we get a little farther,” Gruber said. “We’re following the rules that assure rigor,” he added, saying the company was taking no short cuts. “I can’t tell you what will happen politically,” Gruber said, when asked about concerns the Trump administration might pressure companies and regulators to announce progress before the November election. Gruber said the companies were now in talks with the FDA about how to begin testing the vaccine in children, a group the regulatory agency itself is eager to gather data on. Vaccines work differently in children and adults. Gruber said vaccine tests often progress in stages, first in older adolescents, then younger adolescents, and finally in children. But younger adults have higher rates of reactions, such as fevers and sore arms, to Pfizer’s vaccine than older adults do, Gruber said. Roughly 17% of adults between the ages of 18-55 in Pfizer’s most recent trial had fevers after being given the vaccine, most of them mild, compared with 8% among those aged 65-85. There is a risk those reactions could be even more heightened in younger populations, he added. “Younger children - maybe that’s not going to be tolerated. Maybe we’re going to have severe fevers,” he said. “That’s why we’re adopting a very thoughtful, graduated approach. Children are not just small adults.” Gruber said the company is submitting safety data to the FDA and working out a testing plan for children, which he expects to start soon."

Pfizer has said repeatedly since June that it was targeting October for its application and the companies started a large late-stage study last month of the candidate vaccine, one of the few globally in later stages of development. On Thursday they reported data from previous early-stage trials of the vaccine, BNT162b2, that showed it induced similar immune responses and had milder side effects than prior data on another candidate. Pfizer stock, down 1% this year, has trailed the stellar rises in value of major pharmaceutical companies this year. Moderna and Britain’s AstraZeneca are among those to have moved into late-stage trials. Raymond James European Strategist Chris Bailey said the Pfizer/BioNTech release had contributed to a more optimistic mood on stock markets on Friday. Pfizer shares rose 1% while those of BioNTech were 6% higher before the bell."
-4.358015419430357," Pfizer to make Gilead's COVID-19 treatment remdesivir (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Friday it signed a multiyear agreement to make COVID-19 treatment remdesivir for developer Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O, which is under pressure to increase tight supplies of the antiviral drug. Gilead is aiming to make enough of the drug by the end of the year to treat more than 2 million COVID-19 patients, and agreed to send nearly all of its remdesivir supply to the United States through September. But hospital staffers and politicians have complained about difficulties in gaining access to the drug, which is one of only two to have demonstrated an ability to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials. There are also fears of shortages outside the United States, and separately on Friday, Britain's Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc HIK.L said it has started manufacturing remdesivir at its Portugal plant. Gilead said its manufacturing network for the drug had grown to more than 40 companies in North America, Europe and Asia to add capacity. Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of U.S. state attorneys general urged the federal government to allow other companies to make Gilead’s remdesivir, to increase its availability and lower the price of the antiviral drug. Pfizer will provide contract manufacturing services through its McPherson, Kansas, plant, the drugmaker said. It was not immediately clear if Pfizer would supply only for the U.S. market. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Pfizer in 2017 saying that the process for manufacturing sterile injectable drugs at the Kansas plant was “out of control” and put patients at risk. The FDA said several products were contaminated with multiple foreign particulates but a subsequent FDA inspection found that the issues had been resolved. Pfizer, with Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.F, is also rushing to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus. Pfizer has helped other drugmakers manufacture their products before. It makes Epipen emergency allergy treatments through its Meridian Medical Technologies business and also operates a contract manufacturer called Center One."

-4.384287905510665," Moderna prices COVID-19 vaccine at $32-$37 per dose for smaller volume deals (Reuters) - Moderna Inc MRNA.O said on Wednesday smaller volume agreements for its experimental coronavirus vaccine have been priced in the range of $32 to $37 per dose, higher than the price set by the U.S. deal for Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine candidate. As the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines reach a decisive stage, with several candidates being tested in pivotal late-stage studies, pricing has come under increasing scrutiny. “We will be responsible on price well below (its) value during the pandemic,” Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said on a conference call, adding that larger volume agreements for its vaccine will be priced lower. Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experiment vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F that secures enough vaccine to inoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person. Moderna's two-dose vaccine regimen would cost between $64 and $74 per person. Moderna, which has no drugs on the market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government under a plan to speed up vaccine development. It has not struck a supply agreement with the United States. The company said on Wednesday it was in talks with several countries for supply agreements for its vaccine, adding that it had already received about $400 million in deposits for eventual supply. Moderna said enrolment for its late-stage vaccine study that aims to include 30,000 people is on track to be completed in September. The company’s vaccine candidate is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing. Effective vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide. Moderna said last month it plans to price its coronavirus vaccine in a way that ensures broad access and that it did not intend to conduct late-stage trials of the vaccine outside the United States. Moderna shares fell 5% in early trading on Wednesday."

There are no approved vaccines for COVID-19, but 19 vaccines are being tested in humans around the world. “We all want a silver bullet but unfortunately that’s not the case,” Anand told a news conference. Other measures would be needed, such as buying more protective equipment and investing in medicines to alleviate the symptoms of sufferers. Moderna will provide its mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate. Pfizer - working with German biotech firm BioNTech SE - said separately it planned deliveries of the BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine candidate over the course of 2021. The deals open a new front in Canada’s vaccine push. The federal government has funded several local projects, including one by Quebec’s Medicago that is in an early stage trial. It has also approved a local trial for a leading Chinese candidate, from CanSino Biologics. All potential vaccines will require Health Canada regulatory approval, Anand said, adding that her ministry was procuring the equipment supplies needed to perform the final manufacturing and packaging in Canada. “Any potential vaccine candidate will take time to develop, properly test, mass manufacture and properly distribute,” she said, declining to say how much the deals were worth. Separately, Moderna said smaller volume agreements had been priced in the range of $32 U.S. to $37 per dose while larger volume agreements would be priced lower. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Ottawa was investing C$56 million ($42 million) to support clinical trials by VBI Vaccines Inc."

-9.259267595061521," Pfizer says it will charge other developed countries on par with U.S. for vaccine deals (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N on Tuesday said other developed countries would not get a lower price for its coronavirus vaccine than what it will charge the United States under a contract announced last week, and suggested that people may need multiple vaccinations in order to remain protected. The U.S. government agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and German biotech BioNTech SE 22UAy.F to inoculate 50 million people at a price of $39 for a two-dose treatment course. “All the countries that are developed right now will not receive a lower price for the same volume commitment than the U.S.,” Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on a conference call. Pfizer executives said they expect people will need to receive continued vaccinations for a number of years to maintain herd immunity globally, either because immunity may diminish over time or the virus will mutate. The mRNA technology employed in the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine “is ideal for both: you can boost and boost and boost without losing efficacy,” Bourla told Reuters. “And also, you can move very fast from one type of vaccine to another by simply modifying the (genetic) code.” The vaccine’s price could change once the pandemic period ends, compared with its initial decision aimed at ensuring broadest access. Pfizer is one of many companies racing to bring COVID-19 vaccines to market, seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 655,000 lives globally. BioNTech and Pfizer on Monday began a large, late-stage trial of their vaccine candidate to demonstrate its efficacy. Bourla said Pfizer was in concurrent talks with the European Union and several of its member states on supplying them with the vaccine. A deal with the EU “would be much easier,” he said. “But also we are having extensive discussions with several member states, just in case we can’t find agreement with the EU.” European efforts to secure potential COVID-19 vaccines are mired in wrangles over price, payment method and potential liability costs, three EU officials told Reuters over the weekend. Bourla called an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last week that would tie what Medicare pays for drugs to lower prices in other countries “an enormous distraction at a time where the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment.” The CEO said Pfizer could rethink U.S. expansion plans if the Trump order were to be implemented. On Tuesday, Pfizer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, as the U.S. drugmaker predicted a recovery in vaccination rates and doctor visits. The company took a roughly $500 million hit to total sales in the second quarter as the drop in visits to hospitals and doctors’ offices curtailed demand for several products. The impact was offset somewhat by demand for blood thinner Eliquis, which has been used to help treat COVID-19 patients. Pfizer now expects 2020 adjusted profit of $2.28 to $2.38 per share, raising both ends of the range by 3 cents. Pfizer shares rose 4% to $39.07."

-8.26120424544088," Moderna, Pfizer start decisive COVID-19 vaccine trials, eye year-end launches (Reuters) - Moderna Inc MRNA.O and Pfizer Inc PFE.N launched two 30,000-subject trials of COVID-19 vaccines that could clear the way for regulatory approval and widespread use by the end of this year, the companies said on Monday. The trials, both announced on Monday, are the first late-stage studies supported by the Trump administration’s effort to speed development of measures against the novel coronavirus, adding to hope that an effective vaccine will help end the pandemic. Moderna stock rose 9%. Pfizer shares rose 1.6% in afterhours trade and its partner BioNTech22UAy.F, which developed the vaccine, rose 4.2%. Both vaccine candidates rely on a new technology that allows for faster development and manufacturing than traditional vaccine production methods but does not have an extensive track record. So-called mRNA, or synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), teaches the immune system to recognize and neutralize the coronavirus by mimicking its surface. Moderna, which has never brought a vaccine to market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government, which is helping bankroll several vaccine candidates under its Operation Warp Speed program. Pfizer has an agreement to sell vaccines for 50 million people to the U.S. government for around $2 billion, if the vaccine is effective. More than 150 coronavirus vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with some two dozen prospects already conducting human testing. Johnson and Johnson is launching clinical trials in the U.S. this week and could start a larger, late-stage trial as early as September. British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L said it will begin large-scale U.S. trials this summer of its vaccine under development with Oxford University researchers. “Having a safe and effective vaccine distributed by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but it’s the right goal for the American people,” National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins said in a release announcing the start of Moderna’s large Phase III trial. Manufacturers are ramping up production while testing is underway in order to respond as soon as possible to virus, which is still spreading rapidly around the world. COVID-19 has killed nearly 650,000 people worldwide and battered economies. Moderna could have tens of millions of doses ready when and if the vaccine is deemed safe and effective, Collins told reporters on a call. Pfizer said that if the trial was successful, it could seek regulatory approval as soon as October and supply vaccines for 50 million patients, at two doses each, by the end of the year. Pfizer aims for about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, and Moderna aims for 500 million-1 billion doses a year, beginning 2021, Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said on the call. The late-stage trials are designed to evaluate the safety of vaccines and determine if they can prevent symptomatic COVID-19. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, said a readout from the Moderna trial could come by November or even earlier. Fauci said he was “not particularly concerned” about the vaccine’s safety after seeing data from earlier, smaller trials. He also said he had briefed President Donald Trump about the trial the Oval Office on Monday. As other companies ready inoculations, the COVID-19 Prevention Network, a U.S. government-funded program formed by the NIH, said it plans to roll out a large-scale clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate with at least 30,000 participants each month through fall."

If the study is successful, the companies could submit the vaccine for regulatory approval as early as October, putting them on track to supply up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Patients are each given two doses of the drugmakers’ vaccine to help boost immunity, so the first 100 million doses would vaccinate around 50 million people. The study is expected to include about 120 sites globally and could include up to 30,000 participants. It will include regions heavily impacted by COVID-19. “The initiation of the Phase 2/3 trial is a major step forward in our progress toward providing a potential vaccine to help fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Kathrin Jansen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer. The trial hones in on Pfizer’s most promising vaccine candidate, which it calls BNT162b2. Earlier studies filtered out other potential vaccines. Pfizer has already has an agreement to sell 100 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. government and give it the option to buy 500 million more. It is in talks with other governments, including the European Union, about similar deals. Over 150 vaccines are being developed against COVID-19, which has claimed nearly 650,000 lives globally and crippled economies. The vaccine utilizes chemical messenger RNA to mimic the surface of the coronavirus and teach the immune system to recognize and neutralize it. Although the technology has been around for years, there has never been an approved messenger RNA (mRNA)vaccine. Moderna Inc also launched an advanced stage trial with 30,000 participants on Monday.

0.6814901866506756," Exclusive: EU talks with Pfizer, Sanofi, J&J on COVID vaccines hit snags - sources BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) - European efforts to secure potential COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer PFE.N, Sanofi SASY.PA and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N are mired in wrangles over price, payment method and potential liability costs, three EU officials told Reuters. The bloc is in talks with at least six vaccine makers to acquire up front doses of potential shots against the novel coronavirus, officials told Reuters earlier in July, in a strategy meant to increase the chances of having COVID-19 vaccines for its population. Despite the urgency to seal deals amid a global race to secure the most promising shots, the EU is struggling to reach swift agreements, said the officials, who are involved in the talks, and declined to be named because the negotiations are confidential. The United States, meanwhile, has already inked two supply agreements with AstraZeneca AZN.L and Pfizer among other major funding deals. The EU’s negotiations with Johnson & Johnson are among the most advanced but have yet to conclude amid a back-and-forth over how to share liability costs if the potential vaccine showed unexpected side-effects, two of the officials told Reuters. Johnson & Johnson had no immediate comment. France's Sanofi is negotiating to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine it is developing with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc GSK.L to the EU and wants an immediate upfront payment for the entire stock, two officials said. But the EU wants to pay in tranches and delay some payments until the vaccine has passed large clinical trials, the officials said. This has caused “some hurdles,” one of the officials said. A spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment. A spokesman for the Commission, which is leading EU talks with drugmakers, declined to comment. Aside from the Pfizer, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson discussions, the EU is also in talks with biotech companies Moderna MRNA.O and Germany's CureVac, officials told Reuters earlier in July. Moderna and CureVac were not immediately available to comment. A deal with AstraZeneca AZN.L for its vaccine under development with Oxford University was struck by four large EU countries in June and is now about to be completed for the whole 27-nation bloc, officials said. One official said the EU was seeking to seal three or four advance purchase deals. “OVER BUDGET” The most complex talks appear to be with Pfizer and BioNtech which are developing a vaccine using an experimental technology known as messenger RNA, or mRNA, which has not been approved for commercial use by medical authorities. The two firms want the EU to pay them for 500 million doses only if their COVID-19 vaccine is authorised, one official told Reuters. This might eliminate the EU’s risk of losing money should the shot prove unsuccessful. But the bloc fears that if it waits for the vaccine to be proved effective, the bill could be much higher and they risk going “over budget,” one of the officials said. In a further potential complication, some EU negotiators have raised doubts about mRNA, which is also used in the potential COVID vaccines developed by Moderna and CureVac. Pfizer and BioNtech are also discussing liability issues with EU negotiators, a fourth person familiar with the talks told Reuters. Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment. The U.S. government last week agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to inoculate 50 million people, but with payments conditional on their vaccine being successful in large clinical trials. The price agreed under that deal of nearly $40 per course of treatment is considered too high by the EU, officials told Reuters last week. The EU is relying on about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from an emergency fund to finance its possible deals with vaccine makers, which could be topped up with payments from EU governments. For instance, the agreement with AstraZeneca initially negotiated by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands cost the four countries 750 million euros for 300 million doses of the potential shot, an Italian official said, with an option to buy a further 100 million doses. That works out at 2.5 euros per dose. It is not clear whether under ongoing talks that money will now be provided by the EU emergency fund. ($1 = 0.8581 euros)"

The same day, United warned that demand for flights would languish until there was a widespread vaccine, a similar caution to Delta Air Lines’s warnings last week. United already mortgaged its airlines miles program to secure a government loan.

The pharma giant added $9 billion to its roughly $200 billion valuation on Wednesday morning after the U.S. government placed an initial order of nearly $2 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine it’s developing with German biotech BioNTech. The two partners will only be paid once the drug is approved. Even then, the bump to revenue and profit is likely to be modest. Subsequent orders might be bigger and more profitable. But 150 different vaccines are under development, so competition is likely to reduce the price and number Pfizer can sell – AstraZeneca has said it will price its vaccine at cost during the pandemic.

That was the message from the chief executives who met virtually on Wednesday, as they pressed to extend a waiver on rules governing landing slots. In normal times, carriers are required to use 80% of their slots or forfeit these highly valued assets. European regulators eased the rules during lockdown, but only until October. Executives including Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of TUI Aviation, say returning closer to normality will take longer. Airlines typically lose money in the winter anyway, but lockdown and fears of catching Covid-19 in the skies have dampened demand further. The airlines, many of which have raised capital or sought government support, have talked of an eventual recovery in passenger numbers. Smith has reassured investors he is ramping up flight frequencies. First, however, carriers need to get through a harsh winter. (By Aimee Donnellan) HOME IMPROVEMENT. The end of lockdown has done little to dampen the DIY boom.

Sales soared 25% in June from a year earlier, having increased 15% in May. Online sales, however, were the clear winner as demand for items that can be delivered, such as wallpaper, fences and plants, leapt 225%. Running a DIY retailer is also getting cheaper. Although Kingfisher had to pay for protective equipment for staff, including barriers and hand sanitiser, its advertising and marketing budget fell as customers needed little encouragement to enter their stores.

Hong Kong is shutting down once again. The financial hub has recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases since July 13, logging over 50 cases daily and a high of 108. Foreign students were blamed for a second wave in March, and now fingers are being pointed at flight crews, sailors and senior executives exempted from quarantine. The local government has defended the exceptions. Financial services, trade and logistics account for a total of two-fifths of Hong Kong’s economy, and they can’t work well, or at all, unless their staff can move across borders. So authorities are hesitant to impose stricter measures, perhaps with an eye on fellow hub Singapore, which reported a 41% fall in GDP after its own lockdown. But of course a third major outbreak will cancel the benefits of selective relaxation. It is a harrowing warning for what’s ahead of the curve for the many metropolises still trying to flatten it. (By Jamie Lo) MIND THE GAP. London’s Central Line emptied out in March, as did the coffers of the tube’s parent organisation. Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Sadiq Khan, needed a 1.6 billion pound government bailout back in May. That prompted parallel funding reviews to be launched this week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government and Khan. There’s a clear opportunity to improve. TfL is one of the few major transport networks in Europe that receives no funding for its operations from the central government. If fares dip, and it can’t borrow to cover the gap, bailouts are likely. It would be simpler for the state to formalise a financial backstop to allow investment to be maintained and ensure trains are clean post-pandemic. Fares may be lower for some time given emptier trains and buses. The state, which has the lowest cost of funding, is the best placed to pick up the bill. (By Liam Proud)"
-1.981761628390902," U.S. to pay Pfizer, BioNTech $1.95 billion for COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) - The U.S. government will pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and German biotech BioNTech SE 22UAy.F to innoculate 50 million people if it proves to be safe and effective, the companies said on Wednesday. The contract for 100 million doses of the vaccine amounts to a $39 price tag for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. The contract is the most the United States has agreed to spend on a vaccine, although previous deals with other vaccine makers were intended to also help pay for development costs. Pfizer and BioNTech will not receive any money from the government unless their vaccine succeeds in large clinical trials and can be successfully manufactured, according to a Pfizer spokeswoman. Under the agreement, the government would also have an option to procure an additional 500 million doses. Pfizer said the price for the additional doses would be negotiated separately if the U.S. orders them. The vaccine, if successful, will be made available to Americans at no cost, although their health insurance may be charged, the U.S. department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla has said the company intends to make a profit on the vaccine. He has also said that spending its own money, rather than government money to develop the vaccine should help speed the process. Pfizer hopes to start its pivotal late-stage trial of the vaccine as early as next week, pending regulatory approvals, Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview. “We’re already starting to the process of allocating vaccine vials to a variety of different clinical sites in the U.S. and elsewhere,” Dolsten said. “We’re looking at the map and getting good advice from the CDC. Where do we have the greatest incidence of COVID-19 disease?” Vaccine trials are more efficient if conducted in areas where high rates of active infection are prevelant. The vaccine has already shown promise in early-stage small studies in humans, producing the type of neutralizing antibodies needed to fight the virus. In those trials, subjects received two doses of the vaccine. The Pfizer/BioNTech candidate is one of the most advanced of over 150 vaccines being developed against COVID-19, which has claimed more than 600,000 lives globally and crippled economies. The vaccine utilizes the chemical messenger RNA to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the surface of the coronavirus, which the immune system sees as a foreign invader and mounts an attack. Although the technology has been around for years, there has never been an approved messenger RNA (mRNA)vaccine. The Trump administration has agreed to spend billions of dollars for the development and procurement of potential vaccines under its Operation Warp Speed program. The aim is to produce vaccines that can end the pandemic by protecting billions of people from infection or severe illness, and governments have signed deals with drugmakers to secure supplies of various candidates. Whether any will succeed remains far from clear. Other vaccine makers that have signed deals to receive U.S. government funding for their efforts include Moderna Inc MRNA.O, AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L and Novavax Inc NVAX.O. Pfizer said it will deliver the doses if the product receives emergency use authorization or U.S. approval as early as October after demonstrating safety and efficacy in a large Phase III clinical trial involving up to 30,000 subjects. Pfizer and BioNTech currently expect to manufacture up to 100 million doses globally by the end of 2020, and potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, subject to final dose selection from their clinical trial. On Monday, the companies agreed to supply the United Kingdom with 30 million doses of the vaccine candidate, but did not disclose a price. Pfizer shares were up nearly 5%, while BioNTech’s U.S.-listed shares were up 13%."

-1.981761628390902," UPDATE 1-U.S. has contract with Pfizer for 100 mln coronavirus vaccine doses -Azar (Adds other vaccines, comments) WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Wednesday the federal government has signed a contract with Pfizer Inc for 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccine, once it is approved. “We just signed a contract with global pharmaceutical leader Pfizer to produce 100 million doses of vaccine starting in December of this year with an option to buy another half a billion doses,” Azar said on Fox News. “Now those would of course have to be safe and effective.” According to an announcement released by Azar’s agency and the Defense Department, Pfizer will deliver the doses if the product receives Emergency Use Authorization or licensure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, after completing demonstration of safety and efficacy in a large Phase 3 clinical trial. Azar said that out of the five vaccine candidates that “prioritize” the United States, three had had good results in the first phase of testing. Those include the Pfizer drug, as well as vaccines being developed by Moderna and Astrazeneca. “It’s a very serious situation that we’re facing now but we have tools to deal with it,” Azar said, noting there are three therapeutics: Remdesivir, steroid and convalescent plasma."
2.050723125138683," Moderna, Merck say they will not limit price of coronavirus vaccines to company cost (Reuters) - Moderna Inc and Merck & Co on Tuesday told a U.S. Congressional panel that they expect to profit from their coronavirus vaccines once approved, amid concerns the vaccines may not be accessible to all. “We will not be selling our vaccine at cost, although it is premature for us as we’re a long way from understanding the cost-basis,” Julie Gerberding, chief patient officer for Merck, told the House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and investigations in a virtual, off-site hearing. Merck’s has yet to begin human studies of its experimental vaccine, lagging the leading candidates. Executives from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc testified that they will price their respective potential vaccines at no profit while the pandemic rages on. Gerberding and a representative from Moderna did not comment on the price they have in mind for their vaccines at the hearing, which focused on efforts to develop a safe, effective and widely accessible vaccine against COVID-19, which has claimed 600,000 lives globally. Pfizer Inc has said the company intends to make a profit from its potential coronavirus vaccine if approved. However, Pfizer Chief Business Officer John Young, testified: “We recognize that these are extraordinary times and our price will reflect that.” Unlike rivals Moderna and AstraZeneca, Pfizer has not received funding from the United States for its vaccine development. Lawmakers questioned whether Pfizer had declined government funding so it could price the vaccine at a profit. “We didn’t access federal funding solely for the reason that we wanted to move the vaccine faster to the clinic,” Young said. AstraZeneca said its vaccine would be provided at no profit under its agreement with the United States for allocation of some 300 million doses. More than 150 coronavirus vaccines using a variety of technologies are in development globally, with some two dozen already in human trials. The aim is to produce vaccines that can end the pandemic by protecting billions of people from infection or severe illness. Whether any will succeed or be available by the U.S. government’s stated goal of having one by late this year remains far from clear. “Speed is important,” Gerberding said of the vaccine development, “but we will not compromise scientific efficacy, quality, and above all, safety, despite the sense of urgency we all feel.”"
2.050723125138683," Pfizer-BioNTech potential coronavirus vaccine shows promise in second early trial (Reuters) - German biotech BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc on Monday said data from an early-stage trial of their experimental coronavirus vaccine showed that it prompted an immune response and was well-tolerated, similar to results seen in prior early test. In the study conducted in Germany on 60 healthy volunteers, the vaccine induced virus-neutralizing antibodies in those given two doses, in-line with previous results from an early-stage U.S. trial. BioNtech’s U.S. shares rose 5%, while Pfizer’s stock was marginally higher at $36.44. Under expedited development plans, the companies have said they expect to begin a trial later this month with up to 30,000 subjects with the aim of demonstrating the vaccine’s efficacy. A safe and effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus is seen as essential to ending a pandemic that is still raging and has claimed more than 600,000 lives worldwide. In the German study, the vaccine also generated a high level of T cell responses against the coronavirus. T cells, a type of white blood cell, are an important component of the immune system’s attack against foreign invaders, such as viruses. “Today’s data includes the first evidence of the vaccine generating a T-cell response, which could be critical in order for patients to develop durable immunity to the novel coronavirus,” said Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan. Trial subjects experienced no serious side-effects from the vaccine, though some reported flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. The results come as separate results were released for two other experimental COVID-19 vaccines on Monday. AstraZeneca’s vaccine being developed with Oxford University researchers appeared to be safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials. Another vaccine being developed by CanSino Biologics Inc and China’s military research unit also appeared to be safe and induced immune responses in most recipients. More than 150 potential coronavirus vaccines are in various stages of development around the world, with 23 candidates already being tested in people, according to the World Health Organization. Separately on Monday, Britain signed deals to secure 30 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as well for additional doses from French group Valneva."
2.050723125138683," Britain secures 90 million possible COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer/BioNTech, Valneva LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has signed deals to secure 90 million doses of two possible COVID-19 vaccines from an alliance of Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech 22UAy.F, and French group Valneva VLS.PA, the business ministry said on Monday. Britain secured 30 million doses of the experimental BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and a deal in principle for 60 million doses of the Valneva vaccine, with an option of 40 million more doses if it was proven to be safe, effective and suitable, the ministry said. With no working vaccine against COVID-19 yet developed, Britain now has three different types of vaccine under order and a total of 230 million doses potentially available. “This new partnership with some of the world’s foremost pharmaceutical and vaccine companies will ensure the UK has the best chance possible of securing a vaccine that protects those most at risk,” business minister Alok Sharma said. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deals follow a previously announced agreement with AstraZeneca AZN.L for the firm to produce 100 million doses of its potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the University of Oxford. Britain said it was the first such deal which Pfizer and BioNTech had agreed for the supply of their vaccine, which is being tested in early to mid stage trials. The firms are aiming to make up to 100 million doses by the end of this year and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by end of 2021, if the vaccine is successful. It uses the so-called messenger RNA approach, in contrast to the more traditional, inactivated whole virus vaccine being developed by Valneva. Valneva’s potential vaccine is still in pre-clinical trials, and the company is aiming to move into clinical trials by the end of 2020. Britain also said on Monday it had secured treatments containing COVID-19-neutralising antibodies from AstraZeneca AZN.L to protect people who can't be vaccinated."

5.824052578674161," Pfizer, BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine candidates get FDA's 'fast track' status (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE said on Monday two of their experimental coronavirus vaccines received ‘fast track’ designation from the U.S. health agency, speeding up the regulatory review process. The U.S.-listed shares of the German firm climbed about 10%, while Pfizer’s stock rose about 2% before the bell. The companies are in a global race with Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and others to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, which has claimed over 568,500 lives globally, according to a Reuters tally. There are no approved vaccines for COVID-19, and the United States and other countries have poured billions into their development as they seek to secure a safe and effective vaccine. The fast track status could potentially make Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidates, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, eligible for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ‘priority review’, under which the agency aims to decide on an approval within six months. Moderna Inc, which is developing a potential vaccine using similar technology as Pfizer/BioNTech, won the same status for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in May. BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 are the most advanced of the at least four vaccines being assessed by the companies in ongoing trials in the United States and Germany. Earlier this month, the companies said the testing of two dosages of BNT162b1 on 24 healthy volunteers showed that after 28 days they had developed higher levels of COVID-19 antibodies than typically seen in infected people. The companies said they expect to start a large trial with up to 30,000 participants as soon as later this month, upon regulatory approval. They also expect to make up to 100 million doses by the end of this year and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by 2021-end, if the vaccine is successful."

8.848460391757838," BioNTech and Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine shows potential in human trial FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine developed by German biotech firm BioNTech and U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has shown potential and was found to be well tolerated in early-stage human trials, the companies said on Wednesday. The drug is one of 17 being tested on humans in a frantic global race to find a vaccine the world is counting on to end a pandemic that has infected 10.5 million people and killed more than half a million so far. The potential treatment is the fourth early-stage COVID-19 drug to show promise in human testing, along with projects involving Moderna, CanSino Biologics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals. BioNTech’s shares were up about 8%, after rising as much as 19% to reach their highest in more than three months. Pfizer stock also gained, rising 4.4% to $34.13. In turn, shares in some rival vaccine developers, such as Moderna and Novavax Inc dropped. BioNTech said testing of two dosages of its BNT162b1 drug on 24 healthy volunteers showed that after 28 days they had developed higher levels of COVID-19 antibodies than typically seen in infected people. It said the higher of the two doses - both administered via two injections within three weeks of one another - was followed by a short fever in three out of four participants after the second shot. A third dosage, tested at a higher concentration in a separate group, was not repeated after the first shot because of injection pain. “These first trial results show that the vaccine yields immune activity and causes a strong immune response,” said BioNTech’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin. He said larger trials were being prepared to show whether this translates into protection against a real infection. “While more work needs to be done, we believe the benefits appear to outweigh the risks so far, especially when considering the disease the vaccine is trying to prevent,” Mizuho Securities analyst Divan Vamil said in a note. Bernstein analysts said their initial impression was that the data was “solid”, but noted they don’t expect the initial generation of vaccines to be silver bullets in terms of conferring nearly complete protection. No COVID-19 vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis last year found that about one in three vaccines in the first stage of testing later gains approval. BioNTech, which listed on the U.S. Nasdaq in October, said the data demonstrated that BNT162b1 could be administered in a dose that was well tolerated with only temporary side effects. Early-stage human trials of vaccines are designed to measure certain antibodies and other immune markers in the blood as an indicator of the body’s readiness to fight an infection that then requires further validation. The pharmaceutical industry is eager to launch larger follow-up trials to see how vaccinated participants react to real infections over longer periods. Brokerage SVB Leerink said these larger studies are required for vaccine approval and adoption, and the timing for approval will be dependent on the trials and their results, and not more abbreviated smaller interim studies. BioNTech and Pfizer will now pick the most promising of four experimental vaccines for a trial involving up to 30,000 healthy participants, which is likely to begin in the United States and Europe in late July, if it gets the regulatory green light. If it eventually gets marketing approval, the companies are gearing up to make up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and another 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021 at sites in Germany and the United States. Results from early-stage testing of BioNTech’s three other potential vaccines are yet to be published. The manuscript with the preliminary data from the clinical trials, which were launched in April and May, is under peer review for publication in a scientific journal, BioNTech said. The Mainz-based company is using the so-called messenger RNA approach, like unlisted domestic rival CureVac and Moderna. Translate Bio and its partner Sanofi are also working on a messenger RNA vaccine for COVID-19. Biotech investors Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold their generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis in 2005, are major shareholders of BioNTech."

11.275611398262045," Pfizer's hemophilia gene therapy shows sustained effect in early-stage study (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Sangamo Therapeutics Inc said on Thursday their gene therapy helped maintain levels of a vital protein for up to 14 months in patients with a rare genetic disorder in which blood does not clot easily. All five patients in an early-stage trial given the one-time treatment, giroctocogene fitelparvovec, did not have spontaneous bleeding episodes or require infusions of the blood-clotting protein they otherwise lack, the companies said. Pfizer and Sangamo’s therapy is one of several treatments being developed for hemophilia A, as an alternative to the current practice that requires regular infusions to replace the missing protein, factor VIII. On Wednesday, a rival gene therapy by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc was found to reduce bleeding episodes by over 90% in patients treated four years ago. The therapy is currently under review by the U.S. drugs regulator, which is expected to announce its decision by Aug. 21. The therapies are designed to help patients produce the protein on their own, to avoid the painful bleeding in muscles and joints that is typical of the condition and which could result in chronic joint damage over time. Pfizer and Sangamo expect to begin dosing patients in a late-stage trial in the second half of this year."

Companies developing coronavirus vaccines, such as AstraZeneca AZN.L and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up the production of a vaccine. Billions of vials will be needed for vaccines of the new coronavirus, with world leaders looking towards treatments as a way to re-open stalled economies. Corning's funding comes a day after the U.S. government awarded $143 million to privately-held SiO2 Materials Science to boost the production of its vials and syringes. (bwnews.pr/37eauUA) Corning said it will provide priority access of its vials to companies that have tied up with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for developing treatments and vaccines. The funding from BARDA will go towards scaling up production of the company’s ‘Valor Glass’, which is designed to minimize contamination and could potentially speed up manufacturing processes. The company signed a long-term agreement in May with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, for the glass vials.

The treatment, Ibrance, was being tested along with the standard of care for early breast cancer in men and women, against standard of care alone, the company said on Friday. The study was broadly seen to have a high probability of success readout, but the early failure represents a meaningful setback for Pfizer, JP Morgan analysts said in a note, cutting its price target on the stock by $1 to $37. At least three other brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. Ibrance, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for metastatic breast cancer, brought in sales of $4.96 billion in 2019. Shares of Pfizer fell 7.7% to $35.25 in early trade."

Pfizer said the glass vials will be used for some of its existing sterile injectable medicines and that they were also being assessed for storing a range of new products. The company did not provide details of these new products. Pfizer, like rivals Merck & Co and AstraZeneca, is racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, which does not yet have an approved vaccine or treatment. With vaccines being seen by world leaders as a way to restart stalled economies, drugmakers are looking to scale up their production to meet surging global demand. Some companies such as AstraZeneca have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines that are expected to need billions of vials. It would be essential to fill a vial with five to 10 doses of the vaccines to cope with the requirement of huge volumes of vaccines and the relative shortage of vials, Johnson & Johnson’s Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said on Thursday. Johnson & Johnson also has a potential COVID-19 vaccine under development which it plans to test in humans by September."

1.7796243330536685," Pfizer to launch late stage DMD gene therapy trial despite hospitalizations The drugmaker also said the gene therapy provided statistically significant improvements in the nine boys treated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in its phase 1b clinical trial and called the treatment a potential breakthrough for the disease. The company said, overall, the boys showed an improvement in their ambulatory abilities as well as potential improvements in muscle fiber health. DMD is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder, which affects about one in 3,500-5,000 male births worldwide, causes severe progressive muscle loss and premature death. Pfizer’s treatment is one of a number of gene therapies being developed for the disease, including a treatment developed by biotechnology company Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. Some analysts have suggested that the Sarepta gene therapy looks to have better safety profile in early trials than Pfizer’s. Pfizer said it hopes to launch its phase 3 trial within a few months, around the same time Sarepta hopes to launch its own phase 3 trial, which has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pfizer says all three patients who had serious adverse events in the trial had recovered within two weeks. The company disclosed the first two hospitalizations in the trial last year. All three were among six patients given a higher dose of the treatment, a dosage level that Pfizer plans to continue in the next phase of the trial. Michael Binks, vice president of rare disease clinical research at Pfizer, said three more patients that were not included in the phase 1b trial have since been dosed and none of them have required hospitalization. He said the company is learning how to better mange the response to the treatment. “We have ability to monitor very closely through this period of five to 10 days after the administration to make sure that any changes are picked up very early,” Binks said. “And we think that’s a manageable program to take forward into pivotal trials and even for commercialization,” he said, noting that the gene therapy is a once-in-a-lifetime treatment for a life threatening disease."

3.5991019329912133, MEDIA-Pfizer wants to expand human trials of coronavirus vaccine to thousands of people by September - CNBC -- Source link: cnb.cx/2zvpr83 -- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy
3.5991019329912133," Pfizer to outsource some drug production, focus on coronavirus vaccine (This May 8 story corrects to delete word “intravenously” in para 8 in reference to Pfizer’s 1.5 billion doses of injected vaccines) (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Friday it is in talks to shift more of its medicine production to outside contractors as it prepares for large-scale production of an experimental vaccine to prevent COVID-19, should it prove safe and effective. The U.S. drugmaker is tapping its network of around 200 outside contractors, which includes Catalent Inc CTLT.N, Lonza Group AG LONN.S, and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N, to play a bigger role in producing some of its existing medicines, Mike McDermott, president of global supply at Pfizer, told Reuters in an interview. Pfizer did not specify which companies within its network it is in active discussions with about shifting production. That will help Pfizer shift a portion of production at four of its vaccine manufacturing facilities, including one of its largest U.S. factories, toward the coronavirus vaccine while preventing disruptions in supply of its other products, he said. “They have been hugely helpful in the past and will help us through this,” McDermott said. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.F) said on Tuesday they have begun delivering doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidates for initial human testing in the United States. Trials in Germany had already begun. If successful, Pfizer said it hopes to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as October. It could distribute up to 20 million doses by the end of 2020, and potentially hundreds of millions next year, it said. The shift to outside production of other medicines will primarily effect vaccines and intravenous drugs. Pfizer currently produces around 1.5 billion doses of injected vaccines and drugs each year. McDermott said Pfizer will also add additional shifts to its own factories, hire more workers to take advantage of its unused production capacity, and stockpile current products in preparation for the shift to COVID-19 vaccine production. Pfizer said earlier this week it was preparing four of its manufacturing sites - three in the United States and one in Belgium - to produce the vaccine, even before clinical trials shows which, if any, of the four potential candidates being tested demonstrates efficacy in preventing infection with the novel coronavirus. It will cost Pfizer at least $150 million to gear up its facilities for the new vaccine, McDermott said. Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidates use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has long been talked about but has yet to produce an approved product. The mRNA technology instructs cells in the body to make specific coronavirus proteins that then produce an immune response. It has the potential to be among the first vaccines against the virus that has infected more than 1 million people in the United States and killed over 77,000. Producing vast quantities of vaccines requires that Pfizer and BioNTech work to rapidly scale up their suppliers’ ability to make raw materials for mRNA vaccines, McDermott said, adding that many are small biotechs. It could also face potential shortages of more basic materials, he added, such as the vials and syringes used to contain and administer vaccines. Those materials “could become stressed in this environment, where you are trying to produce your ... existing products and add in vaccines needed for hundreds of millions or billions of people,” McDermott said. Contract manufacturers Lonza and Catalent are also working with other drugmakers to help produce potential treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. Last week, Lonza said it was working with Moderna Inc MRNA.O to help it produce its experimental mRNA vaccine being developed with U.S. government backing. Catalent agreed last month to help Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N manufacture its coronavirus vaccine candidate. Lonza, Catalent and Thermo Fisher did not immediately respond to requests for comment about their work with Pfizer. Pfizer also operates its own contract manufacturer, CenterOne, which provides raw materials to other drugmakers."

The U.S. drugmaker and German partner said if the vaccine proves to be safe and effective in trials, it could potentially be ready for wide U.S. distribution by the end of the year, shaving several years off the typical vaccine development timeline. The vaccine, which uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, has the potential to be among the first vaccines against the virus that has infected more than 1 million people in the United States and killed some 68,000. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the new coronavirus, though some drugs are being used on patients under an emergency use authorization. The U.S. study is part of a broader, global program already underway in Germany, where BioNTech is based. Dosing there began last month. Moderna Inc MRNA.O is using similar technology for its vaccine being developed along with the U.S. government. Phase I testing of that vaccine candidate has also begun, with mid-stage trials planned in the current quarter. Pfizer said last week it hopes to receive emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as October, and could distribute up to 20 million doses by the end of 2020, with an eye toward producing hundreds of millions of doses next year. “Even going from a few million to 20 million will allow you to protect the epicenters of the virus, and then drive out the virus from our society as we ramp up to hundreds of millions,” Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in an interview. Using synthetic mRNA technology can enable the vaccine to be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines, the companies said. Pfizer said last week it expects to make safety data on the vaccine available by late May. The trial will initially aim to test different dosing regimens of four potential vaccine candidates on around 360 healthy volunteers divided into a younger cohort and a group of seniors. The trial will expand to more subjects after researchers determine which compounds and dosing regimens are most effective, said Kirsten Lyke, a director at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, which is participating in the trial. Doses have already been administered to some volunteers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Pfizer plans to expand the trial to sites across the United States in early July, and may ultimately enroll more than 8,000 participants, a company spokeswoman said. If successful, the U.S. clinical trial would be one of the fastest ever progressions of a vaccine from early stage studies to regulatory approval, compressing a development process that often takes as much as a decade to just over 9 months. “This is the equivalent of doing phases one, two and three of a typical clinical trial but all compressed into the May through October time frame,” Lyke said. BioNTech is producing the vaccine for the trials in its European manufacturing facilities. Pfizer is investing in developing its own manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, and is preparing sites in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Belgium to begin producing it. Both companies will jointly commercialize the vaccine, if approved."

2.9939771233222574," Pfizer aims for 10-20 million doses of coronavirus vaccine by end-2020 ZURICH/GENEVA (Reuters) - Pfizer aims to make 10-20 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine it is developing with Germany’s BioNtech by the end of 2020 for emergency use should it pass tests, the U.S. drugmaker’s head of vaccines said on Thursday. The companies, whose project relies on messenger RNA technology never before used in an approved vaccine, have dosed the first humans in Germany and hope to begin a U.S. trial soon, pending regulators’ blessing. Pfizer, BioNtech and other companies are racing to develop a vaccine, since there are currently no approved treatments and only mixed results of medicines under study against the virus. Britain’s AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had joined with the University of Oxford on a vaccine project also being tested in volunteers. Making millions of doses within just months, as Pfizer hopes, would mark almost unprecedented speed and require swift regulatory action. “Of course we need to see and wait to see how the vaccine’s efficacy and safety is demonstrated, hopefully in the coming months,” Nanette Cocero, global head of Pfizer Vaccines, said on a call organised by Geneva-based industry group International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA). “Assuming that is demonstrated, we are looking to ramp up manufacturing rather quickly to have around 10 to 20 million doses by the end of this year, which are expected to then of course be used in an emergency type of setting.” Other drugmakers testing more than 70 COVID-19 vaccine candidates include Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax, and smaller projects like at Bern’s Inselspital hospital in Switzerland. Countries are risking billions on projects that may prove unsuccessful, out of desperation for a preventative treatment for a virus that has killed more than 200,000 people and lamed the global economy. Merck Chief Patient Officer Julie Gerberding, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said many perils remain. The novel coronavirus, still a mystery to scientists, may evolve, rendering an initially successful vaccine ineffective, she said. “We have multiple shots on goal,” said Gerberding. “Most of them will not cross the finish line, but I’m really very optimistic that a few will.” Questions also linger over who will get a vaccine first, with potentially painful allocation decisions inevitable. “We do not want to run lotteries on who gets medicines,” IPFMA director Thomas Cueni said. “It will be challenging to ramp up production at such a speed that we will be able to service the world, from day one.”"

3.9537477690327782," Pfizer plans expanded coronavirus vaccine trials, sees 'negligible' hit from outbreak (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N on Tuesday said it expects its experimental coronavirus vaccine to move into expanded clinical trials by October that could allow for emergency use or accelerated approval, as it ramps up efforts to combat the pandemic. The company left its full-year adjusted profit forecast of $2.82 to $2.92 per share unchanged, saying it expects the pandemic to have little impact on its overall results. Pfizer said most of its drugs are not administered at the physician’s office, which would help it emerge from the pandemic with a “negligible” impact on its results. Millions of Americans have been avoiding visiting doctors or hospitals out of fear of becoming infected with the virus. However, Chief Executive Albert Bourla on a conference call cautioned, “We are likely to see more negative impact during the second quarter, driven primarily by reductions in new patient starts.” Pfizer, in partnership with Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.F, is among many drugmakers racing to develop a vaccine for the highly contagious virus that has infected more than 3 million people worldwide. The company said it expects to make safety data available by late May and move into expanded trials that could allow emergency use or accelerated approval starting in the fall, although experts have cautioned that a safe, effective vaccine may still be more than a year away. (reut.rs/2VHJicW) The company’s unchanged forecast “makes clear management confidence that they have enough gears to make its earnings guidance despite COVID-19,” Citi analyst Andrew Baum said. In contrast, Merck & Co MRK.N on Tuesday estimated a $2.1 billion hit to 2020 revenue due to the pandemic, as two-thirds of its products must be administered by doctors. Pfizer reported a nearly $150 million boost to first-quarter revenue, helped by increased demand for some of its medicines, including pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, which some physicians are prescribing to help combat the effects of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. There are currently no treatments of vaccines approved for COVID-19, but doctors have been trying many approaches to try to alter the course of the sometimes deadly disease. Pfizer also said its commitment to spin off its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O was unchanged. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 80 cents per share in the quarter, beating analysts by 7 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue fell 8.3% to $12.03 billion, but topped Wall Street estimates of about $11.87 billion. Pfizer shares were down 0.4% at $38.16."

Drugmaker Pfizer Inc reiterated its full-year forecast and reported higher sales of its pneumonia vaccine as physicians prescribed it to prevent infections caused by the virus. Its shares gained 2.3%. Investors are now gearing up for one of the busiest weeks for high profile tech-related earnings reports from the likes of Microsoft Corp, Google-parent Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc. “This is going to be an important test for the market as lots of businesses moved online following the lockdown,” said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard in London. “If these big heavyweights in the tech space don’t deliver on the expectations, then of course the rally we’ve seen over the past few weeks (will) have to be questioned.” Wall Street has recovered more than 30% from its March lows, rescued by aggressive stimulus efforts and, more recently, signs that states were moving to let businesses reopen after a near total halt in activity. Still, the benchmark S&P 500 index remains 17% away from reclaiming a record high hit in February and analysts have warned of further losses if a deep global recession, as many now expect, sets in. “It’s a catch-22 sort of situation,” said Adam Vettese, analyst at investment platform eToro in London. “The longer the lockdown, we could be in for worse economic data because we are stifling the economy for longer. That said, if we lift it too early and see a resurgence in cases, then also we are in a bad situation, which could then lead to more bad economic data.” Consumer confidence figures for April due later in the day are expected to slide further from near three-year lows hit in March, as widespread production halts put millions of Americans out of work. Investors are also watching a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting that kicks off on Tuesday, although expectations are low for more central bank easing at this time. At 8:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 399 points, or 1.66%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 41.25 points, or 1.44% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 93.25 points, or 1.06%. Harley-Davidson Inc jumped 8.2% as it took more steps to boost its cash reserves to deal with the drop in motorcycle sales due to lockdowns. Elsewhere, the damage from the lockdowns continued to mount, with Southwest Airlines down 1.4% after reporting its first quarterly loss in nine years due to the virtual halt in global travel. Ford Motor Co and Starbucks Corp are among other big names reporting after markets close. The CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, fell on Tuesday and hovered near two month lows, indicating a risk-on sentiment.

The Commission, which oversees competition policy in the European Union, said its investigation had focused on genericised medicines, which are sold to pharmacies and hospitals, with overlaps in a number of fields. Mylan and Upjohn have offered to divest Mylan’s certain generic medicines across 20 countries in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, the Commission said.

Coury had previously served as executive chairman between 2012 and 2016. He was also the company’s chief executive officer for a decade, during which he substantially increased the company’s generic drug footprint. Mylan is now banking on that experience to help it through a critical time for drugmakers and corporate America in general, as the global economy heads for what is likely to be a deep recession. “Given the unprecedented current operating environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic ... the Mylan Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the company for Mr. Coury to assume this position effective immediately,” Mylan said in a statement. Coury will also partner with Mylan CEO Heather Bresch to work on the merger, which aims to bring the company’s emergency allergy shot EpiPen and Pfizer’s blockbuster treatments, Viagra and Lipitor, under one umbrella. The deal, previously expected to close in mid-2020, was delayed to the second half of this year due to the pandemic.

-4.511285755894331," Pfizer clinches coronavirus vaccine deal, sees potential in antiviral treatment NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Thursday that early data has helped it identify a drug candidate with the potential to help treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus. It also finalized a plan to develop a coronavirus vaccine in partnership with German drugmaker BioNTech SE 22UAy.F and said the companies hope to produce millions of vaccines by the end of 2020. The companies said they plan to start trials of the vaccine as early as this month. Data from preclinical studies of a compound that was originally developed to treat SARS - a different coronavirus that caused a major epidemic in 2003 - shows its potential to treat patients with the new coronavirus, Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in an interview. Pfizer said it will conduct additional preclinical studies of the drug and aims to begin trials in humans in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, Pfizer said it plans to support studies to determine whether existing Pfizer medicines, including its rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz, may provide benefits for those struggling with the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. “Pfizer has mobilized resources and capabilities to address every single frontier of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Dolsten said. More than a dozen large drugmakers, including Pfizer, have announced plans in recent months to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus, although few if any are likely to reach patients in time to stem the current outbreak. Reuters last month was first to report Pfizer’s planned collaboration with BioNTech on a vaccine based on messenger RNA technology. Pfizer will pay BioNTech $185 million upfront to develop the vaccine, with additional payments if certain milestones are achieved that could boost its total investment to nearly $750 million, the companies said. Pfizer will help manufacture any eventual product and said it aims produce hundreds of millions of vaccines next year. The largest U.S. drugmaker also announced a five-point plan for confronting the virus that includes collaborating with outside companies and institutions on the research, development and manufacture of treatments. Meanwhile, Pfizer will help fund a study into whether Xeljanz, which belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors and also treats the autoimmune disease ulcerative colitis, can help patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Rheumatoid arthritis treatments from other drugmakers that work differently than Xeljanz are also being studied as possible COVID-19 treatments. Pfizer is also looking into the potential of other drugs that work on the immune system to help coronavirus patients, the company said. The company is also working with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine on two studies to better understand the relationship between coronavirus and pneumonia, which plays a role in many deaths caused by the virus that attacks the lungs. Pfizer will also publish a review of research into whether its antibiotic azithromycin, sold under the brand name Zithromax, can play a role in treating COVID-19. Azithromycin has been used with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine by some doctors after a French study suggested the combination might benefit some COVID-19 patients."

Wall Street analysts have said the pandemic is likely to hit clinical trials that are not dealing with life-threatening conditions or cancer patients.

5.393210616588576," Pfizer, BioNTech to co-develop potential coronavirus vaccine (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N has signed a deal with Germany's BioNTech SE 22UAy.F to co-develop a potential vaccine for the coronavirus using BioNTech's mRNA-based drug development platform, the companies said on Tuesday. The drugmakers will start the collaboration immediately and have signed a letter of intent for the vaccine’s distribution outside China, they said in a joint statement. The companies said they will finalize financial terms, and details regarding development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of the vaccine over the next few weeks. Reuters reported on Sunday that the German government was trying to stop the U.S. administration from persuading CureVac, another German drugmaker working on an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus, to move its research to the United States. Pfizer and BioNTech will use research and development sites from both companies, including in the United States and Germany, the companies said. BioNTech on Monday struck a collaboration deal with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical 600196.SS over its rights in China to its experimental coronavirus vaccine, aiming to start testing on humans from late April. The race is on to develop an immunization, which is seen as by far the most effective tool to halt the global spread of the pathogen. Rival Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is working with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, on Monday announced that it dosed the first patient with its experimental coronavirus vaccine in an early-stage trial. Pfizer already collaborates with BioNTech to develop mRNA-based vaccines for influenza. The coronavirus outbreak has so far infected nearly 179,000 people globally and killed more than 7,000. Several countries have imposed bans on mass gatherings such as sporting, cultural and religious events to combat the disease."

3.7940489041686094," Pfizer weighs working with BioNTech on potential coronavirus vaccine: R&D head (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is considering a collaboration with German drugmaker BioNTech SE to develop vaccines for the coronavirus using BioNTech’s mRNA-based drug development platform, Pfizer’s R&D head told Reuters on Thursday. Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten was one of the pharmaceutical executives who attended a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss possible vaccines and treatments for the fast-spreading virus on Monday. He had said then that the company was working on developing an anti-viral therapy to help patients who already have contracted the virus. But he said on Thursday that Pfizer was considering joining companies like Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi SA and Moderna in the race to develop a vaccine to inoculate healthy patients. Dolsten said that Pfizer, which already collaborates with BioNTech on the development of mRNA-based vaccines for influenza, is also interested in the company’s efforts in coronavirus. “We will share some of our thoughts with BioNTech also on what they do on COVID-19 and evaluate whether there are things that could merit to do together,” he said. BioNTech has been considering using its mRNA platform to develop a vaccine for coronavirus since earlier this year, BioNTech chief executive officer Ugur Sahin told Reuters in an interview last month. An mRNA-based vaccine, which uses synthetic messenger RNA to help the body immunize itself against a virus, can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines. Moderna, which also focuses on mRNA-based therapies, has already developed an experimental coronavirus vaccine using a similar method to BioNTech. Moderna plans to begin clinical trials of its vaccine later this month. Dolsten also gave more details about the company’s efforts to develop potential anti-viral treatments for the virus, which are currently being screened by a third-party company to see how it performs against the virus in a laboratory setting. Pfizer said these compounds could potentially be used in conjunction with another antiviral treatment being developed by Gilead Sciences called remdesivir, which is further along in the development process. Pfizer’s compounds use a different mechanism of action than Gilead’s to attack the virus, Dolsten said, with Pfizer’s looking to attack the protease segment of the virus. The protease “is one of the best drug targets in the viral sector,” Dolsten said. “It has been one of the most effective for HIV and HCV and our analysis confirmed that the COVID-19 protease target was very similar to one we had been working on for another virus.” He declined to say what virus the compounds had been originally developed to fight. Gilead’s drug is focused on a target called the polymerase, Dolsten said. He said there were opportunities for Pfizer’s compounds - if they are successful - to work in combination or sequentially with Gilead’s. “In other viral studies when you hit the two different mechanisms, you see a far better outcome, a much bigger cure rate than if you just work on a similar target,” he said. Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day said on Wednesday that remdesivir is in late stage clinical trials in both China and the United States. He said the company should know “in the next couple of months” whether the drug helps treat patients with the coronavirus."

0.4123170752046842," Pfizer profit misses estimates as revenue falls; plans no 2020 share repurchases (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N on Tuesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street expectations for the first time in at least two years, and the drugmaker said it will no longer rely on share repurchases to help drive growth. Shares of the largest U.S. drugmaker, which also reported higher operating costs and sharply lower sales of its off-patent pain treatment Lyrica, were down 4% at $38.51. The company, which is spinning off its Upjohn unit that sells branded drugs that have lost patent protection such as Lyrica and Viagra into a combination with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O, said it expects that deal to be completed by the middle of this year as it focuses on more profitable newer growth medicines. On a conference call with analysts, company executives said it does not plan any share repurchases this year. It bought back nearly $9 billion of its own shares in 2019. “We will focus instead on increasing the dividend and investing in the business during this period of growth,” said Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said Pfizer would not need such “financial engineering” to produce growth and that share buybacks could dilute it deal making firepower. Pfizer forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, excluding the Upjohn unit. Analysts on average are estimating 2020 earnings of $2.11 per share. However, UBS analyst Navin Jacob raised concerns over higher-than-expected fourth-quarter operating costs and sales of some drugs that fell short of Wall Street estimates, which contributed to the earnings miss. “It’s very surprising,” he said, noting that Pfizer tends to be “very good at cost control.” Excluding special items, Pfizer said it had adjusted earnings of 55 cents per share, three cents shy of Wall Street expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv Sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance, an important growth driver, rose 13% to $1.28 billion in the quarter, but fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.35 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Total revenue fell 9% to $12.69 billion in the fourth quarter, with Lyrica sales plunging 67% to $433 million in the face of generic competition. Lower revenue also reflected the absence of the consumer health business it sold last year."

-9.92400245910169," Biogen to buy early-stage potential Alzheimer's, Parkinson's treatment from Pfizer (Reuters) - Biogen Inc said on Monday it has agreed to buy an early-stage experimental treatment from Pfizer Inc that it aims to test in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Under the deal, Pfizer will get $75 million upfront and will be eligible for $635 million in potential milestone payments. Biogen said it plans to develop the early-stage candidate for treating Sundowning associated with Alzheimer’s and Irregular Sleep Wake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD) for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease. The company aims to start a study in the fourth quarter. Sundowning is a symptom that impacts 20% or more of Alzheimer’s patients who become confused and anxious later in the day, while ISWRD is a circadian rhythm disorder where patients experience fragmented sleep at night. “This asset is highly complementary to our existing pipeline of potential disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases,” Biogen’s Chief Medical Officer Alfred Sandrock Jr. said. Biogen scrapped development of its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, in March last year, and then reversed course in October, saying it planned to file for U.S. approval of the drug in early 2020, citing new analysis of data. Companies have tried and failed for years to successfully develop an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.

-18.052302163547253," Exclusive: Drugmakers from Pfizer to GSK to hike U.S. prices on over 200 drugs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Pfizer Inc PFE.N, GlaxoSmithKline PLC GSK.L and Sanofi SA SASY.PA are planning to hike U.S. list prices on more than 200 drugs in the United States on Wednesday, according to drugmakers and data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors. Nearly all of the price increases will be below 10%, and around half of them are in the range of 4 to 6%, said 3 Axis co-founder Eric Pachman. The median price increase is around 5%, he said. More price increases are expected to be announced later this week, which could affect the median and range. Soaring U.S. prescription drug prices are expected to again be a central issue in the presidential election. President Donald Trump, who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020. Many branded drugmakers have pledged to keep their U.S. list price increases below 10% a year, under pressure from politicians and patients. Drugmakers often negotiate rebates on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from healthcare payers. As a result, health insurers and patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug. Pfizer will hike prices on more than 50 drugs, including its cancer treatment Ibrance, which is on track to bring in nearly $5 billion in revenue this year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz. Pfizer spokeswoman Amy Rose confirmed the company’s planned price increases. She said the company plans to increase the list prices on around 27% of its portfolio in the United States by an average of 5.6%. Of the medicines with increases, she said 43% of them are sterile injectibles, and many of those increases are less than $1 per product. GlaxoSmithKline said it will raise prices on more than 30 drugs. The company will raise prices on the blockbuster respiratory treatments it delivers through its Ellipta inhaler, its recently acquired cancer drug Zejula and on several products in its HIV-focused ViiV joint venture, according to 3 Axis Advisors. Price increases ranged between 1% and 5%. Sanofi said it will raise prices on around 10 of its drugs, with hikes ranging between 1% and 5%. The drugmaker noted the increases are in line with its commitment to not raise prices above medical inflation. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA raised prices on more than 15 drugs, in some cases by more than 6%, according to 3 Axis Advisors. A Teva spokesperson said the company regularly reviews prices in the context of market conditions, availability and cost of production. 3 Axis advises pharmacy industry groups on identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. drug supply chain and has provided consulting work to hedge fund billionaire John Arnold, a prominent critic of high drug prices. Ian Spatz, a senior adviser at consulting firm Manatt Health, said that drugmakers could be holding to relatively low price hikes in an attempt to stay out of politicians’ crosshairs. Trump, for instance, targeted Pfizer after a proposed round of price increases in 2018, saying in a tweet that the drugmaker “should be ashamed.” “I’m sure many manufacturers are interested in making sure they are not called out on a large list price increase,” Spatz said. The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world’s most lucrative market for manufacturers. Trump, a Republican, has struggled to deliver on a pledge to lower drug prices before the November 2020 election. His administration recently proposed a rule to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada. The administration had previously scrapped an ambitious policy that would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed a bill earlier in December that would cap prices for the country’s most expensive drugs based on international prices and penalize drugmakers that do not negotiate with the Medicare insurance program for seniors. Trump has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would undermine access to lifesaving medicines."

Pfizer said Xtandi, in combination with an anti-hormone therapy, reduced the risk of cancer spreading or deaths by 61% in men with the disease, compared to placebo plus anti-hormone therapy. The drug is the first and only oral treatment approved by the FDA in three distinct types of advanced prostate cancer, the companies said. The FDA has earlier approved the drug for non-metastatic prostate cancer, a form of cancer which does not spread to other parts of the body, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which spreads and continues to grow despite hormone therapy. Xtandi has been prescribed to more than 420,000 patients worldwide since it was first approved in 2012, according to the companies.

The drug, Vyndaqel, is used to treat patients who suffer from a form of amyloidosis, which is a rare, progressive disease characterized by the abnormal buildup of a protein called amyloid in the body’s organs and tissues. There are no approved treatments for the condition in the European Union, the company said, adding that the particular form of the disease is life-threatening, with patients living only two to three and a half years following diagnosis. Vyndaqel was first approved in 2011 in the European Union for the treatment of a form of nervous system disorder and is currently approved in 45 countries, including Japan, and countries in Europe. The EMA’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission and a final decision is expected in the coming months, Pfizer said."

-10.824917304231741," Pfizer, Novartis lead $2 billion spending spree on gene therapy production (Reuters) - Eleven drugmakers led by Pfizer and Novartis have set aside a combined $2 billion to invest in gene therapy manufacturing since 2018, according to a Reuters analysis, in a drive to better control production of the world’s priciest medicines. The full scope of Novartis' NOVN.S $500 million plan, revealed to Reuters in an interview with the company's gene therapy chief, has not been previously disclosed. It is second only to Pfizer PFE.N, which has allocated $600 million to build its own gene therapy manufacturing plants, according to filings and interviews with industry executives. Gene therapies aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient’s cells with healthy copies. With the potential to cure devastating illnesses in a single dose, drugmakers say they justify prices well above $1 million per patient. But the treatments are also extremely complex to make, involving the cultivation of living material, and still pose a risk of serious side effects. Drugmakers say building their own manufacturing plants is a response to rising costs and delays associated with relying on third-party contract manufacturers, which are also expanding to capitalize on demand. They say owning their own facilities helps safeguard proprietary production methods and more effectively address any concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is keeping a close eye on manufacturing standards. “There’s so little capacity and capability at contract manufacturers for the novel gene therapy processes being developed by companies,” said David Lennon, president of AveXis, Novartis’s gene therapy division. “We need internal manufacturing capabilities in the long term.” The approach is not without risks. Bob Smith, senior vice president of Pfizer’s global gene therapy business, acknowledged drugmakers take a “leap of faith” when they make big capital investment outlays for treatments before they have been approved or, in some cases, even produced data demonstrating a benefit. The rewards are potentially great, however. Gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of drug research and, given the life-changing possibilities, the FDA is helping to speed treatments to market. It has approved two so far, including Novartis’s Zolgensma treatment for a rare muscular disorder priced at $2 million, and expects 40 new gene therapies to reach the U.S. market by 2022. There are currently several hundred under development by around 30 drugmakers for conditions from hemophilia to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. The proliferation of these treatments is pushing the limits of the industry’s existing manufacturing capacity. Developers of gene therapies that need to outsource manufacturing face wait times of about 18 months to get a production slot, company executives told Reuters. They are also charged fees to reserve space that run into millions of dollars, more than double the cost of a few years ago, according to gene therapy developer RegenxBio. As a result, companies including bluebird bio BLUE.O, PTC Therapeutics PTCT.O and Krystal Biotech KRYS.O are also investing in gene therapy manufacturing, according to a Reuters analysis of public filings and executive interviews. They follow Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc BMRN.O, developer of a gene therapy for hemophilia, which constructed one of the industry's largest manufacturing facilities in 2017. The FDA is keeping a close eye on standards. This comes amid the agency’s disclosure in August that it is investigating alleged data manipulation by former executives at Novartis’ AveXis unit. AveXis had switched its method for measuring Zolgensma’s potency in animal studies. When results using the new method didn’t meet expectations, the executives allegedly altered the data to cover it up, the FDA and Novartis have said. One of the former executives, Brian Kaspar, denied wrongdoing in a statement to Reuters. Another, his brother Allan Kaspar, could not be reached for comment. Novartis and the FDA say human clinical trials, which found Zolgensma effective in treating the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy in infants, were not affected. Novartis also says its investments in gene therapy production started long before it became aware of the data manipulation allegations. But the scandal has highlighted the importance of having a consistent manufacturing process for gene therapies, industry executives say. According to four of them, the FDA has stressed in recent meetings the need for continuity in production processes all the way from the development of a drug to its commercialization. By bringing production in-house, drugmakers may avoid pitfalls such as the need to switch to a larger facility if contract manufacturers’ capacity proves limited, executives say. The FDA is finalizing new guidelines for gene therapy manufacturing, expected at the end of the year. “Manufacturing consistency is always a major concern for the agency,” FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo told Reuters. Highlighting the pressures on the industry, Sarepta Therapeutics SRPT.O, which largely outsources manufacturing, delayed a clinical trial of its Duchenne treatment in August, telling investors it wanted to avoid any questions from regulators about consistency in producing its therapy at commercial scale. “Between the trade secrets, the cost schedules and the time lag, it makes a whole lot of sense, if you can do it, to build out your own facilities and more and more gene therapy companies have started to do that,” said Krish Krishnan, chief executive of Krystal Biotech Inc. Krystal, which is developing therapies for rare skin diseases, has built one manufacturing facility and plans to invest more than $50 million in a new one it will start constructing in December. MeiraGTx MGTX.O, which focuses on gene therapies for eye conditions, estimates it is currently spending roughly $25 million a year on manufacturing, including process development. Despite such moves, however, contract manufacturers like Lonza LONN.S and Thermo Fisher TMO.N are confident their businesses will continue to grow due to the strength of demand. Thermo Fisher has told investors its Brammer gene therapy manufacturing division, acquired in May, could soon earn $500 million in revenue a year, double its projected 2019 earnings. Lonza CEO Marc Funk is also optimistic. “Demand in gene therapy has increased,” he said in an interview. “We believe this is going to continue in the coming years.”"

-0.6982777815196257," Pfizer raises 2019 forecast as sales of cancer drug, heart medicine surge (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit on Tuesday on increased sales of cancer drug Ibrance and a strong launch of new heart medicine Vyndaqel, prompting the largest U.S. drugmaker to lift its earnings forecast for the year. Pfizer raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $2.94 to $3.00 per share from its prior estimate of $2.76 to $2.86, and its shares rose 3.6%. Analysts on average were expecting $2.82, according to Refinitiv IBES. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, on a conference call, also raised the 2019 revenue growth forecast for the company’s Upjohn unit in China to “mid-to-high single digits” from an earlier view of low-to-mid single digits, even as it prepares to spin off that business. The New York-based drugmaker announced in July it would separate the Upjohn unit, which sells off-patent branded drugs, and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O, allowing Pfizer to focus on its more profitable newer medicines. Mylan will be able to leverage a strong base in Asia through Upjohn, whose headquarters Pfizer had shifted to China, a prime market for the older branded drugs with high name recognition such as Lipitor. Mylan shares rose 2.8% to $19.51. Bourla said he envisions Pfizer as a “smaller, science-based company” following close of the Mylan deal, expected next year. While sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance rose 25% to $1.28 billion rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz had a sales jump of nearly 39% to $599 million, the performance of Vyndaqel out of the gate was an eye opener. The drug, chemically known as tafamidis which was approved in May, brought in sales of $156 million, nearly double the Wall Street estimate of $82 million. “Ibrance is back to strong growth after a period of slowing,” said UBS analyst Navin Jacob, adding that “the Vyndaqel number in particular is impressive.” Priced at $225,000 per year, Vyndaqel’s high cost has faced criticism. Experts affiliated with Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said it could become among the most costly cardiovascular treatments ever. Investor sentiment on Pfizer has been poor since it announced the deal with Mylan, making the third-quarter beat a relief, Jacob said. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 75 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by 13 cents. Total revenue fell about 5% to $12.68 billion as sales of pain treatment Lyrica, which now faces generic competition in the United States, fell by more than half to $527 million."

9.340507555195309," Novartis says Kisqali boosts survival in breast cancer patients ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis said on Sunday that Kisqali helped women with advanced breast cancer after menopause live longer, adding to data the Swiss company hopes will help convince doctors to choose its drug over Pfizer’s blockbuster Ibrance. Kisqali plus the hormone therapy fulvestrant, when compared to fulvestrant alone, demonstrated a significant improvement in survival with a 28% reduction in risk of death, Novartis said at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Barcelona. Novartis said Kisqali is now the only drug of its kind to show positive overall survival in two pivotal studies. The Basel-based firm said this year that Kisqali also boosted survival for women before menopause with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. “These results arm oncologists with more evidence to make a confident treatment choice for their hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer patients,” Dennis Slamon, a doctor at the University of California, Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center involved with the study, said in a statement. Kisqali had $235 million in sales in 2018, well behind $4.1 billion for Ibrance, as Pfizer’s first-to-market drug captured the lion’s share of women with metastatic HR+/HER2- cancer. However, a Refinitiv poll found analysts expect Kisqali, priced at about $130,000 per year, to have sales of about $1.2 billion annually by 2024."

Osborne, a retail industry veteran with more than two decades of experience, will join Ted Baker “at a date to be agreed within the next few months”, the company said in a statement and published after Debenhams announced her departure. Debenhams said its current Group Finance Director Mike Hazell, who has been with the company for nearly a decade, would replace Osborne. She is leaving at a time the group is going through a restructuring under company voluntary arrangement. Osbourne is set to join Ted Baker’s C-suite after its founder Ray Kelvin infamously stepped down in March as chief executive officer following claims that he presided over a culture of “forced hugging”. UK retailers are battling severe challenges on Britain’s high streets with shoppers tightening their purse strings amid Brexit uncertainties, while competition from online rivals and higher costs also take their toll. On the back of those struggles, Ted Baker posted its first drop in annual profit since the 2008 financial crisis in March this year.

Novartis aims to file for U.S. approval for oral capmatinib later this year as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic MET exon14 skipping-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the Basel-based company said on Friday. Pfizer drug Xalkori in 2018 also won the FDA’s fast-track development and review designation for this form of lung cancer for which there is not yet an approved targeted therapy. Drugmakers like Novartis and Pfizer are increasing using biomarker-driven drugs to treat patients with rare tumours -- only about 3%-4% of lung cancer patients have the MET exon14 skipping mutation -- that have proven very difficult for oncologists to fight with their existing arsenal of medicines. “We look forward to working with the FDA and global health authorities to bring capmatinib to patients who currently have no available targeted therapy options,” said John Tsai, Novartis’s chief drug developer.

9.276568549876538," Pfizer invests $500 million in expanding gene therapy facility (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is investing $500 million to expand a manufacturing facility in Sanford, North Carolina, that plays a central role in its efforts to become a major player in gene therapy, the company said on Wednesday. The investment will add additional capacity and capabilities to a facility that makes some of Pfizer’s most closely watched experimental treatments. The Sanford plant manufactures therapies used for the company’s late-stage experimental treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and hemophilia B therapies, among other gene therapies. It is also responsible for making components for some of Pfizer’s vaccines, such as Prevenar 13, which had nearly $6 billion in sales in 2018. “The expansion of the Sanford site is expected to create hundreds of highly skilled jobs, which would increase Sanford’s high-tech manufacturing environment and is part of our overall plan to invest approximately $5 billion in U.S.-based capital projects over the next several years,” Mike McDermott, president of Pfizer Global Supply, said in a statement announcing the investment. Pfizer has been looking to move into innovative and fast- growing therapeutic areas such as oncology and gene therapy in recent years as it prepares for a looming patent cliff on some of its biggest drugs in the mid-2020’s. In March, Pfizer agreed to buy gene therapies under development at French biotech Vivet Therapeutics for as much as $636 million. It has gene therapies under development for diseases including DMD, hemophilia, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Pfizer is in a race with rivals such as Sarepta Therapeutics Inc to be the first to bring a curative, late-stage treatment to DMD market. Sarepta recently faced a setback when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, citing safety risks, rejected its application to market a DMD treatment called Vyondys 53, which is not a gene therapy. Pfizer has been making big moves toward becoming a more streamlined business focused exclusively on innovative drugs.

0.1288964602874664," J&J says FTC probing efforts to protect arthritis drug Remicade WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission issued civil subpoenas to Johnson and Johnson in June as part of an investigation into whether contracting practices for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, violated antitrust laws, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. Shares of the company traded marginally down at $132.47, after having closed up 1.7% on Monday. (bit.ly/2ZkZGze) J&J said that the FTC had issued a “civil investigative demand,” or CID, the equivalent of a subpoena to determine if the contracting practices were legal. Pfizer Inc filed a lawsuit against J&J in 2017, saying its rival’s contracts with health insurers for blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, were anticompetitive and aimed at blocking sales of Pfizer’s biosimilar called Inflectra. Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J had contracted with many insurers to give discounts in exchange for giving preference to Remicade, and to only pay for Inflectra in cases where Remicade proved to be ineffective. Inflectra was approved in 2016 while Remicade went on the market in 1998. Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the lawsuit. J&J has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting the Pfizer lawsuit. Pfizer said in a statement that it had received a CID in June. “As Pfizer’s complaint alleges, J&J’s unlawful conduct is designed to prevent Inflectra from being able to compete on its primary point of differentiation – price. Today, Inflectra has an average selling price (ASP) that is more than 22% lower than Remicade,” the company said in a statement. “Despite these facts, J&J has not lost substantial volume or share of sales – counter to what should occur in a competitive market.” Biosimilars are intended to be lower-cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But since they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be. The drugs treat ailments like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis."
-6.954235532252021," Mylan deal puts future of its beleaguered EpiPen in spotlight (Reuters) - Mylan NV's MYL.O planned merger with Pfizer Inc's PFE.N off-patent branded drugs business may have boosted its share price on Monday, but one of its most pressing problems remains: shortages of its flagship EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. For the past year, Mylan has been struggling to address an ongoing EpiPen shortage that could potentially worsen as thousands of school children with allergies need to restock EpiPen supplies ahead of the school year. Now, the planned tie-up will bring together two businesses that have long collaborated on making EpiPens. For years, Pfizer has manufactured EpiPen on Mylan’s behalf through its Meridian Medical Technologies unit. It was not yet clear if the combination will help ease the shortages by simplifying the company’s complex manufacturing processes. Although Meridian will not be merged with Mylan as part of the transaction announced on Monday, the companies were in talks to transfer Meridian to the newly created generics business, a Pfizer spokeswoman said. The discussions are still ongoing and there is no guarantee that a deal will be reached, but the parties are aiming to reach a final decision before the close of the larger Pfizer-Mylan deal in 2020, Pfizer said. “We’ve had some conversations with Mylan about that potentially transferring to Mylan as a supplement to the existing transaction, but nothing has been finalized to date yet,” Frank D’Amelio, Pfizer’s chief financial officer told Reuters. If the company is transferred to the new Mylan-Pfizer spinoff, it could potentially help streamline a fix to the manufacturing issues that have led to shortages. “Over the long term, having all EpiPen operations under one unified company would reduce complexity,” said Ashtyn Evans, an Edward Jones analyst. Meridian, which produces all EpiPens sold globally at a single plant near St. Louis, has been hit by a series of manufacturing problems since at least 2018 that resulted in shortages in the United States and elsewhere. The company said in early July it anticipates further supply shortages over the coming months. Canada’s national health agency said earlier this month it continued to experience EpiPen shortages as well. Mylan, a generic drugmaker that came under fire from mothers and politicians over steep EpiPen price hikes, has been facing new competition for its emergency allergy treatment. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries TEVA.TA has launched its own EpiPen generic, and other companies including Novartis AG NOVN.S, Kaleo Inc and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc AMRX.N also are in the market with rival products."

-6.954235532252021," Pfizer to spinoff, merge off-patent drugs unit with Mylan (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N has agreed to spin off its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O, a move that leaves Pfizer with its more profitable innovative drugs, including cancer treatment Ibrance and pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. The move, which brings blockbuster treatments Viagra and Lipitor under one umbrella with Mylan's EpiPen, is part of a years-long effort by Pfizer to split into three parts - innovative medicines, lower margin off-patent drugs facing generic competition and consumer healthcare. Pfizer agreed in December to combine its consumer health business with GlaxoSmithKline Plc's. GSK.L The combined company, which will get a new name, is expected to have 2020 revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion, with free cash flow expected to be more than $4 billion. The pharmaceutical industry has been under intensifying pressure from lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, to keep prices down for U.S. consumers, which has limited profits and led to recent deals, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's BMY.N plan to buy Celgene Corp CELG.O and AbbVie Inc's ABBV.N acquisition of Allergan Plc AGN.N. The new company, to be based in the United States and incorporated in Delaware, will be led by Michael Goettler, president of Pfizer’s Upjohn unit, which sells Pfizer’s older drugs that have lost patent protection. Upjohn will issue $12 billion of debt at or before the separation, with proceeds going to Pfizer. Pfizer said it plans to use that cash to pay down its own debt. Mylan said Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who took the helm in 2012 and faced intense political pressure over the high price of EpiPen, will retire after the deal closes. Mylan Chairman Robert Coury will become executive chairman of the new company. “We think it is clear Mylan needed to do something to change direction,” Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said, adding that the deal is also recognition that Pfizer wanted out of generics. Pfizer’s older drugs business has a much higher operating margin than Mylan’s, Maris added. Mylan, which had a market value of $9.5 billion prior to Monday’s announcement, last year said it would review its business as it grapples with lower prices of generic drugs and declining sales of its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. In 2015, Mylan fended off a takeover attempt from rival Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.TA that would have valued the company at around $40 billion. Based on Monday's share price, the company is worth around $11 billion. EpiPen sales fell sharply after Mylan was heavily criticized for steep price hikes on its device that delivers a life-saving shot epinephrine to treat severe allergic reactions. Bresch was called to testify before Congress in 2016, as the controversy put Mylan at the center of the ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of prescription medicines. Mylan’s shares have lost about a third of their value in 2019 through Friday’s close. The stock was up more than 12.9% at $20.84 on Monday, while Pfizer slipped 2% to $42.23. Graphic: Mylan shares - tmsnrt.rs/2ykeLFF Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and his predecessor Ian Read have been saying for more than a year that the company would eschew large, transformative deals because of confidence in the strength of its pipeline. But if the Mylan and GSK deals both close, the company will have shed two large businesses to tighten its focus on newer, patent-protected innovative medicines. Pfizer CFO Frank D’Amelio said on a conference call that the streamlined company will grow sooner and faster beginning in 2020 than it would have otherwise. Under terms of the agreement, Pfizer shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Mylan shareholders the rest. Each Mylan share will be converted into one share of the new company under the all-stock deal. Revenue from the Upjohn unit in the second quarter was $2.81 billion, accounting for a fifth of Pfizer’s total sales. Mylan brought in revenue of $2.85 billion in the same quarter. Pfizer, which acquired Upjohn as part of its 2002 purchase of Pharmacia for $60 billion, will separate Upjohn in a tax-free spinoff and combine with Mylan. Once the deal closes, the new company will have about $24.5 billion of total debt outstanding. Separately, Pfizer reported its quarterly results on Monday, a day earlier than planned. The company cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, largely due to the joint venture with GSK last year."

-20.794576443999947," Pfizer, Sanofi, to boost South African Biovac's vaccine output CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa’s Biovac Institute will start local production of Sanofi’s Hexaxim vaccine next year and Pfizer’s anti-pneumonia Prevnar 13 vaccine in 2021, boosting supply of life-saving drugs in its main market, its CEO said. Local output of the two human vaccines is a step change for Biovac, a public-private partnership 47.5%-owned by the South African government with long-term ambitions of expanding sales into the continent. The new production lines follow years of technology transfers and skills upgrades with partners Sanofi and Pfizer in Africa’s largest pharmaceutical market. The companies were tight-lipped about commercial details of the partnership. “We start production of (the) hexavalent in Q3 2020,” Morena Makhoana, Biovac’s chief executive said at its state-of-the art facility in Cape Town, referring to the Sanofi vaccine. The plant, modernized at a cost of around 1 billion rand ($70 million), will produce four million doses of Hexaxim vaccine a year and has capacity to ramp up significantly as it explores new markets in neighboring Namibia, Mozambique and Angola, he said. South Africa’s government buys about 95% of the total 25 million doses of vaccine supplied annually by Biovac, covering diseases such as tuberculosis, cervical cancer and influenza. Biovac’s dose of Hexaxim, a six-in-one vaccine for several diseases including diphtheria, tetanus and polio, is the only one in the world that is fully liquid and unlike other versions on the market, Makhoana said, does not have to be mixed before injecting. This makes it easier to administer in remote and resource-poor clinics across Africa, he added. “On this particular six-in-one vaccine we are the only tech transfer partner with Sanofi in the world, so we are very proud,” Makhoana told Reuters. Sanofi said it will continue to invest in South Africa’s vaccine program as it looks to bolster its position. “South Africa, and Africa for that matter, is an emerging market and showing strong growth year-on-year and hence will remain a priority for Sanofi,” Merilynn Matthew, who heads Sanofi’s South African vaccines unit, said. Around one-in-five African children do not get immunized, with measles alone accounting for 61,000 preventable deaths a year on the continent, according to the World Health Organisation. Biovac, the rest of which is owned by a consortium led by local investment holding firm Immunotek, has also made progress preparing Pfizer’s pneumonia vaccine for infants, Prevnar 13, Makhoana said. It expects full output of 3 million doses to start in the first half of 2021. Under a five-year agreement signed with Pfizer in 2015, Biovac only packaged labeled syringes but it is now acquiring the formulation and filling processes ahead of the new product line launch. “Security of supply is one big issue and the second is the economic benefits local production brings, while making sure that prices are equally benchmarked and South Africa pays a fair price in line with other middle income countries such as Brazil or Turkey,” Makhoana said. At the partnership launch four years ago, a cabinet minister said the pneumonia vaccine alone used up 40% of South Africa’s total budget for vaccines, with the government then paying around 185 rand ($13.11) per single dose of imported Prevenar 13. Each infant will eventually need three doses. Pfizer did not provide the current cost of the vaccine. “The technology transfer process has enabled significant knowledge transfer, job creation and direct investment,” said Rhulani Nhlaniki, Pfizer’s country manager.

-15.607459488289383," Sarepta surges after Pfizer gene therapy data raises safety concerns (Reuters) - Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics Inc SRPT.O surged 15% on Friday after some safety concerns were raised in a small, early-stage study of a competing gene therapy for a rare muscle-wasting disorder from Pfizer Inc PFE.N. Sarepta reported promising data from its study last year and is in a race with Pfizer and Solid Biosciences Inc SLDB.O to first market a gene therapy for the genetic degenerative disorder that affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 males. Shares of Pfizer were marginally up in midday trading, while Sarepta shares were up 15% and Solid Biosciences was up about 10%. Baird analyst Brian Skorney said Pfizer fell way short on both safety and efficacy, making Sarepta’ position in the space even stronger. Sarepta already has a treatment, Exondys 51, in the market for some form of the disease. People with the condition lack the protein dystrophin needed to keep muscle cells intact. That can lead to life-threatening damage to the heart, and over time, death, often at a young age. Pfizer’s six-patient study tested two different dosages of the gene therapy in boys in the age group of 6 to 12. Two months after receiving the one-time therapy, mini-dystrophin expression levels ranged from 10% to 60% of normal. Skorney said all measures of expression looked worse. “More importantly, it just did not look safe.” Two Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients in the trial experienced side effects that landed them in the hospital, the company said. The higher tested dose appeared to be more effective, according to data presented by Pfizer at the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy conference in Orlando, Florida. Pfizer said it had paused enrollment in the study and then modified the study protocol in order to mitigate future risks of similar safety events. The company said future trials will use the higher dose, which had triple the concentration of virus with genetic material. The U.S. drugmaker said it also may test an intermediate dose. Both of the boys who required hospital treatment had received the higher dose. One had developed a kidney injury. He was hospitalized for 11 days and received two doses of Alexion's ALXN.O Soliris, but left the hospital with normal kidney function. The other suffered nausea and vomiting after the treatment and spent two days in a hospital."
-15.607459488289383," Pfizer gene therapy for rare muscle disease shows promise in small, early study June 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Friday presented promising results from a tiny early study of its experimental gene therapy for a rare muscle disease, but two of the six patients in the trial experienced side effects that landed them in the hospital. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic degenerative disease that affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 males. People with the condition lack the protein dystrophin needed to keep muscle cells intact. That can lead to life-threatening damage to the heart, and over time, death, often at a young age. The study tested two different dosages of the gene therapy in boys ranging in age from 6 to 12-years old. Two months after receiving the one-time therapy, mini-dystrophin expression levels ranged from 10% to 60% of normal, Pfizer said. Gene therapies use engineered viruses to carry healthy genetic material into a person’s cells to replace faulty or mutated genes that cause a disease or condition. The higher tested dose appeared to be more effective, according to data presented at the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy conference in Orlando, Florida. Pfizer said future trials will use the higher dose, which had triple the concentration of virus with genetic material. The U.S. drugmaker said it also may test an intermediate dose.

He was hospitalized for 11 days and received two doses of Alexion’s Soliris, but left the hospital with normal kidney function. The other suffered nausea and vomiting after the treatment and spent two days in a hospital. Pfizer is racing Sarepta Therapeutics Inc to be first to market with a gene therapy for DMD. So far, there are just two approved gene therapies in the United States, even though pharmaceutical companies have been pouring money into potentially lucrative treatments that could offer patients with deadly or debilitating conditions a possible one-time cure. In October, Sarepta said a study of its gene therapy in four patients showed mean micro-dystrophin levels of 74% of normal. But Sarepta and Pfizer used different techniques to measure dystrophin, so the data are not immediately comparable. Evercore ISI analysts said an investor survey the brokerage conducted indicated dystrophin levels of greater than 40% would likely mean Pfizer’s drug could be competitive. Sarepta’s older drug, Exondys 51, won U.S. approval to treat some forms of DMD in 2016. (Reporting by Michael Erman in New York and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot)"

-14.082395033917669," Pfizer makes $10.6 billion cancer bet in cash deal for Array Biopharma (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday it would buy Array Biopharma Inc for $10.64 billion in cash, a deal it hopes will help make it a leader in colon cancer and build up its pipeline of oncology drugs. The largest U.S. drugmaker agreed to pay a hefty premium of 62% for Array, which sells the combination treatment Braftovi and Mektovi for melanoma. But those drugs appear poised to become part of a promising triple combination for advanced colorectal cancer. Pfizer executives said the company began actively pursuing Array last month after it released positive clinical data showing that Braftovi and Mektovi in combination with Eli Lilly and Co’s Erbitux helped reduce the risk of death from colorectal cancer by 48% compared to the standard of care in patients with a gene mutation known as BRAF V600E. The data “is really a landmark publication in one of the most dismal tumors,” Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten said in a phone interview. “There will be ample opportunities to do combinations and build a whole science platform around colorectal cancer,” said Dolsten, adding that he believes the Array drugs could eventually tackle colon cancer earlier in the disease process. That is a type of cancer where the class of immunotherapies that include Merck and Co’s blockbuster Keytruda have not been as compelling as Array’s results, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. Braftovi and Mektovi, launched last July for the deadliest form of skin cancer at a price of $22,000 per month, had sales of around $72 million over their first nine months. The company also has revenue from royalty and licensing deals. Pfizer is paying $48 per share for Array, which closed 57% higher. Pfizer’s shares rose almost 0.3%. (For a graphic on 'Array biopharma shares' click tmsnrt.rs/2XT8Cv9) Oncology has become one of the most profitable areas for drug companies as breakthroughs in treatments have improved survival rates and costs for the drugs have surged. Array is Pfizer’s first major purchase under new Chief Executive Albert Bourla, who took on the role in January. It is also its biggest acquisition since a $14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016 gave it the prostate cancer drug Xtandi, forecast by analysts to top $1 billion in sales next year. Bourla and his predecessor Ian Read have been saying for more than a year that the company would eschew transformative deals because of the strength of its pipeline. But in April, Pfizer said it would consider bolt-on deals worth a few billion dollars to complement its pipeline. Read had previously failed to close megadeals to acquire rivals AstraZeneca and later Allergan. Pfizer’s growth has slowed in recent years and Bourla has been touting the company’s “15 in 5” plan to launch 15 experimental treatments, each with at least $1 billion annual sales potential, over a five-year period. The company been investing in cancer drugs and gene therapies. Pfizer said it expects to complete the deal in the second half of 2019. The transaction is expected to add to earnings beginning 2022, and will reduce adjusted earnings per share by between 4 and 5 cents this year and in 2020, Pfizer said. Pfizer said it expects to finance the majority of the deal, which has an enterprise value of about $11.4 billion, with debt and the remaining with existing cash. Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley on the deal. Array’s advisor was Centerview Partners."

-12.191885891760496," Novartis hopes Kisqali data will help narrow gap to blockbuster rival ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis has released data showing sharply improved overall survival rates for its breast cancer drug Kisqali, which the Swiss drugmaker hopes will help it chip away at the dominance of Pfizer’s blockbuster Ibrance. Novartis’s Kisqali had $235 million in sales in 2018, well behind the $4.1 billion for Ibrance, as Pfizer’s first-to-market drug captured the lion’s share of women with metastatic HR+/HER2- cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ibrance in February 2015, two years before Kisqali. The data released on Saturday showed about 70 percent of pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer were alive 42 months after getting a cocktail of Kisqali and endocrine therapy. That compares with 46 percent who received only endocrine therapy, which at the time of the study was the standard of care. Doctors helping lead Novartis’s Kisqali study, called Monaleesa-7, said the statistically significant benefit it showed was good news for patients facing a challenging disease. “To achieve overall survival improvement in an incurable disease, like metastatic breast cancer, is truly an outstanding advancement,” said Dr. Sara Hurvitz, head of breast cancer clinical trials at the University of California Los Angeles. According to a Refinitiv poll, analysts expect Kisqali - priced at about $130,000 per year - to reap about $1.2 billion annually by 2024. The Swiss company is hoping its new survival analysis, released at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago, will convince more doctors to consider Kisqali. “Most physicians would practice evidence-based medicine, and in that case, having statistical significance certainly would have some persuasion in how they would actually move forward,” John Tsai, Novartis’ head global drug developer, said on a call. Analysis of separate clinical trials is ongoing to determine potential overall survival benefit of taking Ibrance together with endocrine therapy, as well as of endocrine therapy with a similar drug, Eli Lilly’s Verzenio, that had $255 million in sales last year. Kisqali, Ibrance and Verzenio have not been compared with each other in trials. In addition to losing the race to market for Ibrance, Novartis’s Kisqali has faced some safety-linked hurdles. Its label includes warnings for a possible heart condition, called QT prolongation, and liver toxicity that require monitoring that Pfizer’s medicine has avoided. Kisqali, a CDK4/6 inhibitor that aims to halt hyperactive cellular machinery that drives tumor growth, is approved as an initial treatment for women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of whether they have gone through menopause. Ibrance and Lilly’s Verzenio have somewhat narrower first-line FDA labels, covering initial therapy for HR+/HER2- breast cancer in women after menopause."

-9.660335844076636," Pfizer gets U.S. approval for $225,000 a year heart drug NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Pfizer Inc’s oral drug, tafamidis, to treat a rare and fatal heart disease called transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, the U.S drugmaker said. Pfizer, which has touted tafamidis as a potential blockbuster product, set a list price of $225,000 a year for the medicine, which would be sold under the brand name Vyndaqel. It is the first approved medicine for the disease in the United States. Analysts are forecasting annual sales to exceed $1 billion in 2024, according to Refinitiv data. The FDA also approved another oral formulation of tafamidis under the brand name Vyndamax, with a recommended dose of either Vyndaqel 80 mg once-daily, taken as four 20 mg capsules or Vyndamax 61 mg once-daily, taken as a single capsule. “There were three factors we took into consideration on this price: the transformative nature of this compound, the population ... and the third would be our capacity to ramp up diagnosis over time,” Paul Levesque, head of rare disease at Pfizer, said in a phone interview. Quickly reaching more than 30 percent of a rare disease population with a new drug is very rare, Levesque said. Pfizer believes there are about 100,000 people in the United States with the condition, the vast majority undiagnosed. Only about 2,000 to 5,000 patients are currently diagnosed with the progressive heart disease globally. The company has been in talks with insurers and is confident the drug will be reimbursed at the $225,000 price, he said. The drug, which received FDA breakthrough status in May, reduced the risk of death for patients with the disease by 30 percent when compared with placebo in clinical trials. In 2012, tafamidis was rejected by the FDA as treatment for a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease called familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). But it is approved in 40 other countries for that disease. Vyndaqel currently sells for about $100,000 a year outside the United States as a treatment for FAP. It was approved in Japan for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in May at a price of around $750,000 a year that was set by a government body, Pfizer said. As the disease primarily affects an older population, a significant percentage of U.S. patients will likely be on the government’s Medicare program. For those Medicare patients unable to afford potentially high copays on the medicine, Pfizer said it will have a program to make Vyndaqel available through patient assistance programs. Pfizer believes there could be 400,000 to 500,000 patients in developed markets around the world and said the current rate of those diagnosed may be as low as 0.5 percent to 1 percent. Pfizer said that the frequency of adverse of effects in patients treated with the drug was similar to those on placebo. Both Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc have approved medicines that treat a similar disease called hereditary TTR amyloidosis, also caused by a buildup of transthyretin protein in the body. Those drugs cost around $450,000 a year. Pfizer has touted tafamidis as one of its “15 in 5” - 15 experimental treatments in development, each with at least $1 billion annual sales potential that the drugmaker hopes to launch over a five-year period. Shares of Pfizer were flat at $41.39 on Monday morning."

-3.6344698174190837," Vaccine and blood thinner help drive Pfizer to quarterly earnings beat (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Tuesday reported first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates and slightly raised its 2019 earnings forecast, as the company reined in costs and recorded higher sales of blood thinner Eliquis and Prevnar pneumonia vaccine. Shares of the largest U.S. drugmaker rose more than 3 percent to $40.84. As blockbuster pain medicine Lyrica faces competition from generics, growth at Pfizer has slowed, driving the company to invest in cancer drugs and gene therapies as it works to launch new medicines. Pfizer has pointed to experimental drugs like heart medicine tafamidis, a potential blockbuster it expects to be approved within the next few months, as part of its plan to grow sales, and said it will continue to consider bolt-on acquisitions worth “a few billion dollars.” But it has also suffered setbacks among other candidates in its plan to launch up to 15 new drugs with at least $1 billion annual sales potential each over a five-year period. That included disappointing clinical results for non-opioid pain drug tanezumab, as well as two other discontinued trials. “We are not overly reliant on a single pipeline opportunity,” Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla, who succeeded CEO Ian Read at the start of the year, said on a conference call with analysts. In a phone interview with Reuters, Bourla said he expects a high rate of approvals. “If you use the average industry success rate, we should do more,” he said. “So far I have been very pleased,” he said, citing recent positive results in five late-stage and three midstage clinical trials. Pfizer said its business development priorities are now focused on enhancing its pipeline of drugs in development. Meanwhile Eliquis, which it shares with Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Prevnar keep putting up big sales. The blood clot preventer had sales of $1.01 billion in the quarter, above consensus estimates of $935 million. Prevnar sales of $1.49 billion topped Wall Street estimates of $1.39 billion. The company expects mid-single-digit operational revenue growth post-2020 through 2025, Bourla said. Two of Pfizer’s U.S. rivals also reported first-quarter results on Tuesday. Strong vaccine and cancer drug sales helped Merck & Co top Wall Street earnings expectations and sent its shares higher. But Eli Lilly and Co shares fell after it reported sales of closely-watched diabetes and psoriasis treatments that fell short of analyst estimates. Pfizer pushed its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast marginally higher and now expects $2.83 to $2.93 per share, up from a prior projection of $2.82 to $2.92. It maintained its full-year revenue forecast of $52 billion to $54 billion. Excluding special items, the company earned 85 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 75 cents. Net income rose 9 percent to $3.88 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarter. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $13.12 billion, ahead of estimates of $12.99 billion."

The drug, tanezumab, belongs to a new category of pain medications that target nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells, and has been touted as a potential blockbuster. The study tested the treatment in two doses, 2.5 mg and 5 mg, comparing the long-term joint safety and effectiveness at the end of 16 weeks with painkillers that are normally prescribed to patients. The higher dose of the treatment met two of the three main goals, in which it reduced pain and improved physical function.

3.6722711787256155," U.S., China key to GSK's consumer venture with Pfizer LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and China will be key focuses for the consumer healthcare venture being formed by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, as the companies look to build on strong existing positions in those markets. GSK and Pfizer are on track to create the world’s biggest consumer health business - with brands from Advil painkillers to Chapstick lip balm - by the second half of 2019, Brian McNamara, CEO of GSK Consumer Healthcare, told Reuters on Thursday. The venture, to be 68 percent owned by GSK, will become a stand-alone company within three years of closing the deal, and McNamara will lead it. “The U.S. and China are really two of the key value drivers of the deal because it’s where Pfizer has critical mass and a significant amount of their key brands,” he said in an interview, noting the new entity will be the No.1 player in the United States and No.2 in China. “U.S. and China are must-win markets.” The consumer health sector, which spans vitamins, non-prescription medicines and other drug store purchases, is buoyed by ageing populations, a growing interest in health, wellness and self-care, and growing middle classes. It has slowed at times in recent years, due to emerging market fluctuations or weak flu seasons. The new, yet-to-be-named company will have annual sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.9 billion) and more than 7 percent of the global consumer health market, with brands also including Centrum vitamins and Sensodyne toothpaste. That puts it ahead of rivals Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and Sanofi. Pfizer’s Centrum is already the leading multivitamin in China, while Caltrate is the No.2 calcium supplement in what is one of the world’s most calcium-deficient populations, McNamara said. He said vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) would be a major focus, alongside oral care and over-the-counter pain medicine, and respiratory treatments like cold and flu tablets. “It gives us the presence globally but it really strengthens our China position,” he said about VMS. GSK has said it is aiming to make divestments worth about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in 2019/2020, but McNamara declined to comment on them. GSK in December announced plans to separate into two companies - one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products - after agreeing the deal with the consumer health business that Pfizer tried, and failed, to sell previously."

Pfizer has paid Vivet about $51 million upfront and may pay up to $635.8 million in clinical, regulatory milestone payments and to exercise the option to buy the whole company. Pfizer already has collaboration agreements with gene therapy companies including Spark Therapeutics and Sangamo Therapeutics to target conditions like hemophilia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Pfizer is one of several large pharmaceutical companies that has done deals to try to tap the potential for gene therapies to dramatically improve or even cure disease. Analysts expect the companies to charge more than $1 million for these therapies. Last month, Swiss drugmaker Roche AG agreed to buy Spark Therapeutics, which developed the only approved gene therapy on the U.S. market, for $4.3 billion. The FDA is also expected to decide on whether to approve a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy from Novartis AG later this year. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Vivet and Pfizer said Pfizer can exercise its option to acquire all of Vivet following its delivery of certain data from an early-stage clinical trial for its VTX-801, an experimental treatment for Wilson disease.

Nearly 90 percent of patients who received the combination therapy were still alive after 12 months compared with about 78 percent of patients who were alive after a year when treated with the older drug Sutent, data showed. Merck on Monday released interim data from the trial, saying the combination reduced the risk of death by 47 percent compared with Sutent. The findings add to an arsenal of positive clinical data for Keytruda, which is approved to treat several types of cancer, making it by far Merck’s most important growth driver. Patients who received the Keytruda/Inlyta combination also went longer before their disease started to worsen, a measure known as progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 15.1 months for the combination versus 11.1 months for those treated with Sutent. Results from the trial of 861 previously untreated patients were presented at a cancer meeting in San Francisco and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Keytruda/Inlyta combination, if approved, could provide serious competition for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s immunotherapy combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. That therapy, currently considered a gold standard for previously untreated advanced kidney cancer patients, has shown a 67 percent survival rate after two years. A similar kidney cancer trial pitting Sutent against a combination of Inlyta and the immunotherapy Bavencio, sold by Pfizer and Germany’s Merck KGaA, was also presented at the meeting on Saturday. The Bavencio combination led to a median PFS of 13.8 months compared with 8.4 months for Sutent. While full overall survival data was not yet available, at the end of 11.6 months, 37 of 442 patients in the Bavencio arm of the study had died, while 44 of 444 patients in the Sutent group had died after 10.7 months, researchers said. “Both combinations are expected to become new standards of care and to be incorporated into future (treatment) guidelines,” Bernard Escudier from France’s Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus said in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine. Immunotherapies help the immune system to recognize and attack cancer. Inlyta is a newer chemotherapy than Sutent that is also approved to treat advanced kidney cancer. In the Keytruda trial, four patients died from what were deemed to be treatment-related side effects versus seven in the Sutent group."
-2.2454666733877726," Merck, Pfizer combo treatment boosts kidney cancer survival NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said on Monday that the combination of its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda with Pfizer Inc’s Inlyta cut the risk of death nearly in half for patients with the most common form of kidney cancer when compared with treatment with chemotherapy drug Sutent. Merck said the treatments when used as the initial treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) reduced the risk of death by about 47 percent in its late-stage trial. The drugs also improved progression-free survival and had a higher response rate in patients than treatment with chemotherapy. The drugmaker said it will present full results from the trial at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco later this week. Keytruda has been Merck’s most important growth driver with its domination of the lucrative lung cancer space, and shows no sign of slowing as it produces positive clinical data and adds approvals for different types of cancer. Approval of the combination to treat patients with RCC would put Merck again in competition with rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Opdivo, which is already being used in combination with another Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat kidney cancer. Bristol-Myers was a pioneer in pushing treatments that help the immune system attack tumors and Opdivo looked poised to be a top immuno-oncology treatment. But Keytruda’s sales have surged past Opdivo’s, with Merck expected to sell nearly $10 billion of the drug this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

-2.046206164324167," Pfizer quarterly profit in line, touts pipeline of future products (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter profit and sales that edged past Wall Street estimates, helped by higher sales of breast cancer medicine Ibrance and pain drug Lyrica. The largest U.S. drugmaker also touted its pipeline of drugs in development and its shares rose more than 2 percent after initially falling on a 2019 earnings forecast below Wall Street estimates. That continued a trend among major drugmakers as Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co have also issued initial 2019 earnings forecasts below analysts’ estimates. On a call with analysts, new Chief Executive Albert Bourla said Pfizer had “the best pipeline in our history,” and predicted that the company would return to sustained growth beginning in the middle of 2020. “Our job now is to stay the course,” said Bourla, who took over as CEO to start the year. Pfizer forecast 2019 adjusted earnings of $2.82 to $2.92 per share, while analysts were estimating $3.04 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its revenue forecast of $52 billion to $54 billion, which takes into account the impact of a stronger dollar and the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity on Lyrica around mid-year, also fell short of analysts’ estimates of $54.25 billion. “The confidence in the pipeline and potential for accelerated growth beginning in 2020 is contributing to the positive share price reaction,” Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said. Pfizer and partner Eli Lilly & Co also reported positive results from a late-stage trial of their experimental non-opioid arthritis treatment tanezumab, one of 15 potential billion-dollar drugs Pfizer says could win approval within five years. However, some analysts suggested that the new data may not alleviate safety concerns around the pain drug. Pfizer executives said they expected flat pricing for its drugs in the United States this year, but that it was not counting on price increases to drive growth. Bourla also said Lyrica would be its last top-selling product to go off patent until the second half of the decade. Pfizer’s promising pipeline also includes potential blockbuster heart medicine tafamidis, as well as potentially lucrative vaccines and cancer drugs. In the fourth quarter, Ibrance sales rose 58 percent to $1.13 billion, helped by growing demand in Europe. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 64 cents per share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by a penny. Revenue of $13.98 billion also edged past forecasts of $13.90 billion.

1.4023733336508077," Novartis oncology boss Barrett makes quick exit ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis is getting its third oncology chief in less than a year after Liz Barrett said on Thursday she was leaving the Swiss drugmaker to become chief executive of a U.S. biotech firm only 11 months after taking up the role. Barrett, a U.S. citizen who previously worked at Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson J&J.N before joining Novartis in February, will be replaced from January by Susanne Schaffert, a longtime Novartis executive. Barrett, who could not be reached for comment, cited challenges in moving her family to Basel, Novartis’s headquarters, as the reason for her departure. She did not name the biotechnology firm she was joining. Novartis is trying to build up its oncology portfolio with new therapies including its costly Kymriah cell therapy, nuclear-based medicines and immuno-oncology. “After much personal reflection, it became clear that my family would be unable to relocate,” said Barrett, who had replaced Bruno Strigini as oncology chief less than a year ago. A Novartis spokesman said he did not know where Barrett had taken a job. Schaffert, a 20-year Novartis veteran, had for five years been Region Head, Novartis Oncology Europe, before this year taking over at its Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) unit, purchased late last year for $3.9 billion. AAA makes therapies that deploy trace amounts of radioactive compounds to treat cancer. Schaffert will replace Barrett on the Novartis executive committee, where she will report to Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan. “She has our full support and confidence as we continue to invest in both our internal pipeline as well as external assets to strengthen our presence,” Narasimhan said in a statement."
1.6664916716097926," Drugmaker GSK to split after striking Pfizer consumer health deal LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline plans to split into two businesses -- one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products -- after forming a new joint venture with Pfizer’s consumer health division. The revamp is the boldest move yet by GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year. It will lead to the creation of a consumer health giant with a market share of 7.3 percent, well ahead of its nearest rivals Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and Sanofi, all on around 4 percent. Walmsley has previously played down the idea of breaking up the group, something that a number of investors have called for over the years. On Wednesday, however, she announced that GSK and Pfizer would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 percent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction. GSK said the deal laid the foundation for the creation of two new UK-based global companies focused on pharma/vaccines and consumer healthcare within three years of the transaction closing. For Pfizer, the deal resolves the issue of what to do with its consumer health division, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, after an abortive attempt to sell it outright earlier this year. GSK, whose consumer products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, had withdrawn from that earlier Pfizer auction process but Walmsley said the opportunity to strike an all-equity deal cleared the way for the new agreement. “It’s something we’ve been able to do quickly and quietly,” she told reporters in a conference call. “What this deal is all about is the opportunity to strengthen two businesses -- a world-leading consumer healthcare business and a new GSK that is focused on pharma and vaccines.” Shareholders welcomed the news and the shares jumped 7 percent, with Jefferies analysts saying the future separation could crystallize value. The new joint venture with Pfizer is expected to generate total annual cost savings of 500 million pounds by 2022 for expected total cash costs of 900 million and non-cash charges of 300 million. GSK plans divestments of some 1 billion pounds. Walmsley said there would be an inevitable impact on jobs but there was also an opportunity for cost savings in procurement and across the supply chain. The Pfizer deal is expected to boost adjusted earnings and free cashflow in the first full year after closing, which GSK anticipates will occur in the second half of 2019. Pfizer, which already has a long-standing HIV medicines joint venture with GSK, said the transaction would be slightly accretive in each of the first three years after it closed. The consumer tie-up follows a deal by GSK earlier this year to buy Novartis’s stake in their consumer joint venture for $13 billion and comes as Walmsley tries to reshape Britain’s biggest drugmaker, which has seen its shares move sideways for years. Earlier this month, she agreed to buy cancer drug specialist Tesaro for $5.1 billion to try to revitalize its pharmaceuticals business, a high-priced acquisition that was poorly received by the market. GSK has lagged rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and it largely sat out a spate of dealmaking by rivals under previous CEO Andrew Witty. Seeking to reassure investors of its financial strength, GSK extended its guarantee on the dividend by stating it expected to pay unchanged dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019. GSK was advised by Citi, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Greenhill, while Centerview, Guggenheim and Morgan Stanley acted for Pfizer."

-1.3734654574468308," FDA approves new blood cancer treatment from Pfizer (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Pfizer Inc’s drug to treat a form of blood cancer in newly diagnosed patients as a combination therapy. Pfizer plans to launch the drug, Daurismo, in the United States by early December with a monthly list price of $16,925, a Pfizer spokeswoman told Reuters. Daurismo was approved for use in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) aged 75 or older or those who have certain health conditions prior to receiving their diagnosis, for whom intensive chemotherapy is not an option, Pfizer said. The treatment comes with a boxed warning - the agency’s harshest - that flags risks of severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death. “Intensive chemotherapy is usually used to control AML, but many adults with AML are unable to have intensive chemotherapy because of its toxicities,” said Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. Daurismo along with low-dose chemotherapy improved overall survival in clinical trials, when compared to treatment with only low-dose chemotherapy. Almost half of the adults diagnosed with AML are not treated with intensive chemotherapy because of serious side effects and chemotherapy related toxicities, the FDA said here. The American Cancer Society has estimated that there would be about 19,520 new cases of AML, a rapidly progressing cancer that forms in the bone marrow, in the United States this year. The FDA earlier in the day also approved Roche-AbbVie’s Venclexta combination therapy for AML."

-1.7000462116917179," Pfizer to raise U.S. drug prices in January after previously backing down NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday that it plans to hike U.S. prices on 41 of its medicines in January, after walking back its previous planned price increases this summer under pressure from President Donald Trump. The largest U.S. drugmaker said in a statement that the increases would be on around 10 percent of its medicines. Pfizer said it would raise the list price of most of the drugs by 5 percent, while prices for three will rise by 3 percent, and the price of one by 9 percent, all effective Jan. 15. The company did name the drugs in line for price hikes. Pfizer said it does not expect the price increases to boost its revenue in the United States next year as it believes that rebates to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will offset them. Chief Executive Ian Read said in the statement that the company believes the best way to make drugs more affordable is by focusing on reducing out-of-pocket costs and returning rebates to consumers. This would effectively place responsibility for lowering costs with PBMs and insurers, rather than drugmakers. The company rolled back a set of price increases in July after Trump said in a tweet that the drugmaker “should be ashamed” and that his administration would respond. Pfizer said then that it would defer price increases until the end of the year or until the president’s drug pricing plan went into effect, whichever was sooner. It was not immediately clear whether other drugmakers plan to follow suit. Several, including Roche, Merck & Co and Novartis, made similar pledges not to raise U.S. prices before the end of the year. Merck and Novartis could not immediately be reached for comment, while a spokeswoman for Roche’s Genentech unit declined to comment. Pfizer did not tip off the administration that the latest round of price increases was coming, according to a source familiar with the matter. The hikes “illustrate the perverse incentives of America’s drug pricing system,” said Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley. “Drug companies raising their prices and offsetting them with higher rebates benefits everyone but the consumer,” she said, noting that HHS and the Trump administration was committed to lowering drug prices.

-1.3363732788142548," Pfizer loses drug patent fight in UK top court, may face claims LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer lost the final round in a lengthy patent battle in Britain on Wednesday after the country’s highest court ruled against it in a case involving its $5 billion-a-year pain drug Lyrica, exposing the company to possible financial claims. The Supreme Court decision is a blow for the U.S. drugmaker -- which had sought to affirm a secondary medical use patent for the product -- and a win for generic drug companies Actavis, now renamed Allergan, and Mylan. Lyrica, known generically as pregabalin, was originally developed for epilepsy but further research showed it could also help patients suffering from neuropathic pain, which soon became its main market. In a bid to protect this lucrative section of the market, Pfizer secured a secondary patent, valid beyond the life of the original one. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the secondary patent claims relevant to neuropathic pain were invalid. For Pfizer, the legal fight had become a point of principle, following years of battles in lower courts, since its key secondary pain patent has now expired in Europe. But the decision could leave it open to financial claims if Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) tries to recover over-payments from using Pfizer’s more expensive branded Lyrica, rather cheap generics. “This is an enormous blow to Pfizer. They face claims running potentially into hundreds of millions of pounds if the NHS seeks to recover the excess costs,” said Darren Smyth, partner at law firm EIP. An NHS England spokesperson said: “Clinical commissioning groups and the NHS nationally have been tracking this legal case and will be deciding on the right next steps on behalf of patients and taxpayers.” Pfizer had no specific comment on the possibility of NHS claims but said it was disappointed by the ruling and the decision would have a significant impact on incentives for innovation in public health. “The period that a medicine is under patent is a critical phase in its lifecycle that fuels innovation -- as science evolves and knowledge grows, patients increasingly benefit from ongoing research into new uses for existing medicines,” the company said. “As situations such as these are expected to become more common, it’s important for patients that pharmaceutical companies are able to protect patents, including second medical use patents.” The expiry of the basic patent on Lyrica five years ago had allowed generic drugmakers to launch cut-price versions of Pfizer’s medicine, which carried a “skinny label” limiting their use to epilepsy and general anxiety disorder. Pfizer sued, arguing it was inevitable that the copycat versions would be dispensed for pain as well as other conditions. The U.S. group took the case to the Supreme Court after a appeal in the case was rejected in 2016. Since then Pfizer’s secondary neuropathic pain patent in Britain has also expired, in July 2017. In the United States, by contrast, Pfizer is only expecting generic competition to Lyrica in 2019."

The treatment, Lorbrena, is designed to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer in patients with a mutation of the ALK gene, who have relapsed after being treated with ALK inhibitors, such as Pfizer’s Xalkori. While many patients respond to initial ALK inhibitor therapy, they typically eventually experience disease progression and are faced with limited options due to resistance to existing treatments. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat. About 3 to 5 percent of NSCLC tumors are ALK-positive, and is often found in non-smokers. Lorbrena, known chemically as lorlatinib, received an accelerated approval, Pfizer said. Its continued approval may depend on verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial."

A sale of the division, which has annual sales of about $1.2 billion, could fetch about $2 billion and draw bids from both private equity firms and rival pharmaceutical companies, Bloomberg reported here. Pfizer did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

-2.3062349249181313," Pfizer revenue worse than expected as generic competition weighs (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N on Tuesday reported worse-than-expected third quarter revenue and lowered the top end of its full-year sales forecast as generic competition and drug pricing pressure in the United States hurt its older drugs business. Investor attention has been increasingly focused on the company post-2020, with a view toward drugs they hope will be on the market by then. The company has touted its pipeline, which it believes contains 15 drugs with annual sales potential that could exceed $1 billion launching within the next five years. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said shareholders are keen to know how Pfizer plans to bridge the gap until 2020 with products such as breast cancer medicine Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz underperforming this quarter. Both drugs slightly missed analysts estimates in the quarter, with Ibrance sales coming in at $1.03 billion and Xeljanz bringing in $432 million. Pfizer retreated from some planned price hikes earlier this year under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. Last week, Trump announced a plan to try to reduce what the government pays for some physician-administered prescription drugs by basing Medicare spending for the medications on lower prices paid in other countries. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, who will be succeeded in that role by Chief Operating Officer Albert Bourla in January, said in a phone interview that the plan is “flawed in its conception.” “It is effectively importing into an innovative-based society the prices of free riders,” Read said. The largest U.S. drugmaker said it now expects 2018 revenue of between $53 billion and $53.7 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of $53 billion to $55 billion. Revenue rose 1 percent in the quarter to $13.30 billion. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion. Pfizer shares were down 1.2 percent at $42.73 in afternoon trading. Excluding one-time items, Pfizer earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 3 cents, according to Refinitiv estimates. Net income rose 45 percent to $4.11 billion. Supply problems at facilities making Pfizer’s sterile injectables, as well as competition from cheaper generic medicines in the United States, hit sales at the company’s Essential Health business. Sales from the unit, which Pfizer plans to reorganize into a new division that sells off-patent medicines and generic drugs, fell 4.4 percent. The company benefited from a 13.3 percent tax rate on adjusted income, well below the 23.7 percent it paid last year before the U.S. Congress passed a bill that significantly lowered corporate taxes."

Bourla’s remarks came during a conference call with analysts after Pfizer cut its yearly revenue forecast, blaming supply snags and a strengthening dollar. “We continue not to see the need for any large-scale M&A activity at this time,” Bourla, currently Pfizer’s chief operating officer, said.

-4.962732725355753," Novartis, Pfizer join forces on potentially lucrative fatty liver disease ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG and Pfizer Inc are teaming up to develop treatments for a liver disease many drug companies believe will become a hugely lucrative market, as it is tied to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. The Swiss and U.S. drugmakers announced on Monday that they will collaborate to develop combination therapies involving medicines they have been working on separately to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Though hardly a household name, the progressive fatty liver disease with no approved treatments is poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. [reut.rs/2HojtnT] NASH, which is closely associated with obesity and diabetes, is emerging as a major global health concern, especially among populations with increasingly fatty diets. Unchecked, it can lead to advanced cirrhosis and liver failure. Drugmakers like Pfizer, Novartis, Gilead Sciences Inc and Allergan PLC see the potential $20 billion to $35 billion market, according to some estimates, as a source of future growth. Several small companies that have been focused on NASH treatments are well ahead of Pfizer and Novartis in their efforts, including Intercept Pharmaceuticals and France’s Genfit. While studies have shown increased exercise and altering dietary patterns can be a first-line of defense against the disease, Eric Hughes, who heads Novartis’s hepatology development program, has seen first hand the need for pharmaceutical options. “As a physician, I told everyone about exercise, lifestyle changes and diet,” Hughes said. “And I was lucky if I got 5 percent that even listened to me. “This is an epidemic of 38 million people in the U.S., and to treat all those people who are advanced in their disease requires therapy,” Hughes added. The companies will test Novartis’s tropifexor in various combinations with three experimental Pfizer medicines, with the idea of attacking different aspects of NASH, said Morris Birnbaum, Pfizer Internal Medicine’s chief scientific officer. “The way this disease develops is, first you get fat in the liver, and then for reasons which nobody understands, the fat provokes an inflammatory response ... and then lastly, you get scarring and fibrosis,” Birnbaum said. The combination therapy would target all three stages of the disease, he said. Pfizer’s drugs are aimed at steatosis, or fat accumulation in the liver. Novartis’s molecule fights inflammation and fibrotic scarring. The collaboration is not exclusive. Novartis’s 2017 partnership with Allergan testing tropifexor with an Allergan drug will continue, Hughes said. It is too early to predict when NASH patients might receive combination Pfizer-Novartis treatments, Hughes said. But the deal shows there is still an appetite for tackling chronic conditions that affect millions of people at a time when many drugmakers, including Pfizer and Novartis, have increasingly directed resources to treatments for rare diseases that can command extremely high prices."
-3.689450179735555," Australian watchdog's appeal against Pfizer ruling dismissed by court (Reuters) - Australia’s competition watchdog said on Friday the High Court dismissed its special leave application to appeal a court’s decision on whether Pfizer Inc’s local unit used its market power to limit competition for its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sought leave to appeal against a judgment by a Federal Court in May, when Pfizer was alleged to have abused its market power by offering big discounts and rebates on Lipitor to pharmacies. The drug stores were said to have bought large quantities of the drug and agreed to limit re-supply of competing generic atorvastatin products. The court had found that Pfizer took advantage of its substantial market power, but did not accept the ACCC’s argument that Pfizer had acted to lessen or deter competition. Pfizer Australia said, in an emailed statement to Reuters, it welcomed the High Court’s decision to dismiss ACCC’s case. Prior to the loss of its patent protection in May 2012, the drug Lipitor generated annual sales of more than A$700 million ($497.49 million) for Pfizer in Australia, the commission said when it launched the case in 2014.

-2.595004049132463," Merck, Pfizer combo treatment meets main goals of kidney cancer trial (Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Thursday a combination treatment of its cancer drug Keytruda and Pfizer Inc’s Inlyta met the main goals of a late-stage study in patients with the most common form of kidney cancer. The combination resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival of the patients and helped patients survive without the cancer worsening, when compared to Pfizer’s kidney cancer drug, Sutent. Keytruda is a blockbuster medicine that targets a blockade of proteins known as PD-1 and is approved for a range of other cancers, including lung cancer. Pfizer’s Inlyta is already approved to treat advanced renal cell cancer in patients who have faced failure of one prior systemic therapy. “This marks the first time that combination treatment with an anti-PD-1 therapy has achieved the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival as first-line therapy (in renal cell cancer patients),” Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories said."
-3.976403690789622," Pfizer to cut around 2 percent of jobs through early next year NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N plans to reduce its global headcount by around 2 percent through voluntary retirements and layoffs this year and early next year, as it looks to streamline its corporate structure and eliminate some managerial roles and responsibilities. Pfizer has around 90,000 employees worldwide. Pfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty said the job cuts were “about creating a simpler, more efficient structure and not achieving cost savings.” The job cuts were originally reported by CNBC. The move follows the announcement earlier this month that Chief Operating Officer Albert Bourla would succeed Ian Read as chief executive in January. The company also added new responsibilities for many of its top managers and hired a new chief digital officer. Shares of Pfizer were up 1.8 percent at $44.70 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares are up around 20 percent this year, outperforming the Standard & Poors 500 index, which is up about 4 percent over the same period."

The PARP market is currently dominated by AstraZeneca’s cancer drug Lynparza. Talazoparib, a once-daily pill that Pfizer acquired with its $14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016, is indicated for breast cancer triggered by mutation of BRCA genes, which accounts for 25-30 percent of hereditary breast cancers and 5-10 percent of all breast cancers. The FDA also approved Myriad Genetics’ diagnostic test to identify breast cancer patients who are eligible for Pfizer’s talazoparib."

-1.5501464266748854," Pfizer to replace longtime CEO Read with veteran Bourla (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N Chief Executive Officer Ian Read will hand over the reins of the largest U.S. drugmaker to veteran insider Albert Bourla in January, after eight years at the helm, in the backdrop of increased scrutiny over drug pricing. Under Read, a Scot who joined the company in 1978, Pfizer has weathered patent expirations of several blockbusters, including cholesterol drug Lipitor, through dealmaking, expansion in emerging markets and cost cuts. Pfizer won 30 approvals from the U.S. health regulator during his tenure. Read, however, failed to pull off two mega deals - acquisition of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L in 2014 and Botox maker Allergan Plc AGN.N in 2016 - that would have helped lower its corporate taxes. Bourla, 56, was promoted to the newly created post of chief operating officer at the start of this year and was widely seen as the leading candidate for the top job. Before becoming COO, he led the drugmaker’s Innovative Health business, which holds its newer, patent-protected medicines, since the start of 2016. The unit recorded an 8 percent rise in revenue in 2017 to $31.4 billion. “Now is the right time for a leadership change and Albert is the right person to guide Pfizer through the coming era,” Read, who will become executive chairman, said. Shares of the drugmaker, which have risen about 160 percent since Read took over as CEO in December 2010, were trading up nearly a percent at $44.42. The stock had earlier touched 17-year high of $44.51. “This looks like a well-considered transition, thus I’m not convinced it will herald a major change in strategic thinking, particularly as Ian will still stay on as chairman,” Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said. The leadership change comes at a time when the Trump administration has been pressuring drugmakers to lower prescription costs. Read, after a conversation with President Trump in July, had decided to defer price increases for no more than six months. Pfizer, which has been trying to sell its consumer healthcare business for the past one year, is bracing for patent expiration of its neurological disease treatment Lyrica, which raked in $1.2 billion in second-quarter sales. The company’s drug pipeline has the potential for about 25-30 approvals through 2022, Pfizer said, adding that it expects up to 15 of them to fetch multi-billions in sales. “The timing of this transition makes sense given Reed’s age and the company’s current strong portfolio of new products,” Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said. Last week, rival Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said it would amend a policy to allow its head, Kenneth Frazier, to remain CEO beyond 2019 when he was expected to retire."

6.8063526397104805," Pfizer rare heart disease drug reduces risk of death by 30 percent in study NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday that its drug tafamidis reduced the risk of death for patients with a rare and fatal heart disease by around 30 percent, boosting the prospects of what could be a billion-dollar-a-year drug. The study showed that tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality over a 30-month period in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy to 29.5 percent, versus 42.9 percent in patients who received a placebo. It also reduced the rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalization by around 32 percent, Pfizer said. The data was presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Munich. “The result is really, phenomenally encouraging and gives fantastic hope for patients with this devastating illness,” said Dr. Brenda Cooperstone, chief development officer of rare disease at Pfizer. “It’s a uniformly fatal disease.” Tafamidis is one of 15 potential blockbuster treatments Pfizer is trying to develop. The company’s chief executive officer, Ian Read, has touted Pfizer’s pipeline, arguing that the growth potential from these drugs makes undertaking a large transaction unnecessary. There are currently no approved medications in the United States for transthyretin cardiomyopathy. The number of patients currently diagnosed with the progressive disease is exceedingly small -- somewhere in the range of 2,000 to 5,000 patients globally. But Pfizer believes the disease is underdiagnosed and that there could be 400,000 to 500,000 patients in developed markets around the world. Cooperstone said the current diagnosis rate is only around 0.5 percent to 1 percent. “Part of that is driven by the fact that today there is no therapy - there’s no reason to actually make the diagnosis,” she said, noting that a real treatment should significantly help improve the diagnosis rate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the drug breakthrough status in May after Pfizer released topline results from the study, which could accelerate the drug’s approval. Cooperstone said Pfizer expects to complete the submission of its application for tafamidis to the FDA in the fourth quarter. The agency has committed to reviewing it as fast as possible, she said, but declined to lay out a timeline for approval. Until then, Pfizer has established an expanded access program to make the drug available to patients prior to regulatory approval. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said in a research note last week that a second-half submission to regulators suggests approval and launch of the drug in 2019. He said that at an annual price of $150,000 to $300,000, the drug could bring in $600 million to $1.2 billion globally. The study had around 440 patients enrolled. Tafamidis was previously rejected by the FDA as treatment for a rare neurodegenerative disease. But it is currently approved, under the brand name Vyndaqel, in 40 other countries as a treatment for familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. While the drug would not currently have any competition, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc are developing drugs for a similar disease - hereditary TTR amyloidosis - also caused by a buildup of transthyretin protein in the body."

The companies will invest a combined $48 million, shared equally, next year to market the non-invasive DNA screening test Cologuard, Exact Sciences Chief Executive Officer Kevin Conroy told Reuters in an interview. “The marketing effort will begin in the fourth quarter (and) we expect the impact (of it) to occur next year,” Conroy said, adding that the company is currently investing about $80 million in advertising and promoting Cologuard. Approved in the United States in 2014 to screen adults aged 50 or older at average risk for colorectal cancer, sales of the diagnostic test jumped 78 percent to nearly $103 million in the latest reported quarter. The company reiterated its revenue forecast for 2018 and said it expects about $700 million in 2019. Analysts on average have forecast 2019 revenue of $611 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The diagnostics firm will continue to manufacture the test, with Pfizer chipping in with its sales force to boost marketing to primary care clinics and large hospitals. “This story has always been about driving uptake more so than profitability over the next few years, and this should accomplish this nicely,” William Blair analyst Brian Weinstein said. Pfizer will receive 50 percent of gross profit above an agreed-upon baseline, Conroy said. Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the United States and is expected to cause about 50,630 deaths in 2018. Earlier this year, the American Cancer Society recommended people at risk of the disease start regular screening at 45 rather than 50, as studies increasingly show a rise in cases among younger individuals.

5.85644417717057," Pfizer bets on biotech flu vaccine in $425 million BioNTech alliance FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pfizer has agreed to pay German biotech firm BioNTech up to $425 million in an alliance to develop more effective influenza jabs, the latest among several major pharma companies to bank on a promising new genetic approach. Privately-held BioNTech will receive $120 million upfront plus up to $305 million depending on certain development achievements as well as tiered royalties on futures sales in the double-digit percentage range, the two companies said in a statement on Thursday. Mainz-based BioNTech, valued at $2.3 billion in a January financing round, is specializing in so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that instruct human cells to produce therapeutic proteins or to launch an immune response. The emergent field has seen drugmakers such as AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Sanofi partner up with biotech firms. “mRNA vaccines offer a novel approach to code for any protein or multiple proteins, and the potential to manufacture higher potency flu vaccines more rapidly and at a lower cost than contemporary flu vaccines,” said Kathrin Jansen, the head of Pfizer’s vaccine research and development unit. Flu jabs are currently produced from chicken eggs based on the previous flu season’s viral strains. The alliance partners hope to offer a vaccine that can be quickly adjusted to the latest viral mutations, which can also be a major advantage in case of a pandemic threat from avian flu. Pfizer will take over testing on humans and commercialization of BioNTech’s flu vaccines once the German firm, which is Europe’s largest unlisted biotech firm by staff numbers, has completed the first clinical study. Having raised $270 million from investors early this year, BioNTech is also developing personalized immunotherapies for cancer and is eyeing a future public listing. The company competes in the race for mRNA therapies with groups such as Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, Belgium’s eTheRNA and domestic rival CureVac. CureVac’s work on jabs to prevent malaria and influenza won more financial backing from its investor the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in a February agreement. BioNTech, for its part, has previously attracted alliance partners including Roche’s Genentech, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Genmab and Bayer Animal Health. As part of the upfront payment, Pfizer will acquire a “smaller” stake in the Germany company. Precise terms were not disclosed. Biotech investors Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold their generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis in 2005, will remain majority shareholders in BioNTech."

8.272377078871951," Allergan sues Pfizer over costs of opioid litigation (Reuters) - Allergan Plc on Thursday sued Pfizer Inc to require its rival to cover any damages it is forced to pay as a result of hundreds of lawsuits claiming Allergan deceptively marketed an opioid it acquired from a company Pfizer bought. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, Allergan said the “primary basis” for the claims against it was the alleged improper marketing and sale of Kadian, a form of morphine, in the years before it gained rights to the painkiller in late 2008. “But now that more than a thousand lawsuits seek to impose liability for that very marketing and sale, Pfizer has rejected any responsibility to indemnify Allergan,” alleged Allergan Finance LLC, the subsidiary that filed the lawsuit. Pfizer in a statement said Allergan’s claims related to a drug it never sold and arise from a contract with King Pharmaceuticals Inc, which Pfizer acquired in 2010. “We will review Allergan’s suit and respond accordingly,” Pfizer said. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drugmakers including Allergan, Purdue Pharma LP and Endo International Plc are facing a wave of lawsuits by state and local governments accusing them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing. At least 1,021 lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland. The first trial is set for March. Plaintiffs’ lawyers pursuing the cases have compared them to the litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998. In its complaint, Allergan said most of the lawsuits it faces seeking to hold it responsible for playing a role in the opioid crisis primarily relate to improper marketing of Kadian and involve allegations dating back to the mid-1990s. The drug at that time was owned by Alpharma Inc, which King Pharmaceuticals acquired in 2008, the same year King sold the rights to Kadian to Actavis. In 2016, Actavis acquired Allergan and took on the company’s name. Sale of rights to Kadian was a condition of winning U.S. antitrust approval for King’s acquisition of Alpharma. Allergan argued that Pfizer under the terms of an agreement Actavis signed with King in 2008 was required to indemnify it for any damages arising out of the pre-2009 marketing of Kadian. But Allergan said Pfizer has rejected its claim for indemnification. The case is In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, No. 17-md-2804."
8.272377078871951," CORRECTED-Allergan sues Pfizer over costs of opioid litigation (Corrects first paragraph to make clear the opioid was acquired from a company Pfizer later acquired) Aug 2 (Reuters) - Allergan Plc on Thursday sued Pfizer Inc to force its rival to cover any damages Allergan is forced to pay as a result of hundreds of lawsuits claiming it deceptively marketed an opioid it acquired from a company Pfizer bought. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, Allergan said the “primary basis” for the claims against it was the alleged improper marketing and sale of Kadian, form of morphine, in the years before it gained rights to the painkiller in late 2008. “But now that more than a thousand lawsuits seek to impose liability for that very marketing and sale, Pfizer has rejected any responsibility to indemnify Allergan,” alleged Allergan Finance LLC, the subsidiary that filed the lawsuit. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drugmakers including Allergan, Purdue Pharma LP and Endo International Plc are facing a wave of lawsuits by state and local governments accusing them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing. At least 1,021 lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has scheduled the first trial for March.

8.756948724017347," Pfizer CEO believes U.S. will eliminate rebates on prescription drugs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N Chief Executive Ian Read said on Tuesday that he believes the Trump administration intends to eliminate rebates on prescription drug purchases, but he does not know how quickly such a policy could be implemented. Earlier this month, the administration proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers. Read said on a conference call with analysts and investors that he believes the administration wants to get rid of them entirely. President Trump had criticized the largest U.S. drugmaker for raising prices. After Read spoke with the president, Pfizer on July 10 retreated from announced price hikes on about 40 of its drugs, saying it would not raise prices again this year."
8.756948724017347," Pfizer CEO expects Trump to eliminate drug rebates (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N Chief Executive Ian Read said on Tuesday he believes the Trump administration intends to stop the practice of allowing rebates on prescription drug purchases, suggesting that U.S. drug pricing reforms may focus on middlemen rather than drugmakers. “I believe the administration does want to remove rebates, and they consider it a priority,” he said in an interview, following similar comments made on Pfizer’s conference call to discuss second quarter earnings. The administration has already proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). Read said he believes the administration wants to get rid of them entirely. These rebates are rarely passed along to U.S. patients. Read said Pfizer had discussed the administration’s plan for rebates “in broad terms” with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. The CEO said he does not know how quickly changes to rebate policy could be implemented. U.S. President Donald Trump has made lowering prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers a top priority. His administration has placed blame on “middlemen” such as PBMs - which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans - and health insurers for driving up drug prices by demanding hefty rebates in exchange for broad access to patients. Read said Pfizer currently receives around 58 percent of its list prices on drugs, suggesting that about 40 percent goes to middlemen. He said ending the rebate system would allow drugmakers to keep price hikes in line with health care inflation. The largest U.S. drugmaker retreated from planned price hikes on about 40 of its drugs earlier this month, following criticism from President Trump. Read has spoken with Trump and visited the White House since deferring those price increases. Bowing to intensifying political pressure, several major drugmakers have also announced drug price freezes until the end of the year. Pfizer shares rose $1.09, or 2.8 percent, to $39.68 in afternoon trading, closing in on near 16-year highs. Pfizer on Tuesday also reported better-than-expected second quarter profit, but trimmed its full-year revenue forecast due to the strengthening dollar. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said investors were encouraged by management optimism about new drugs and long-term growth prospects after prior disappointment that Pfizer had not done a big acquisition. “There’s more optimism around the internal pipeline and their ability to expand margins long term,” she said. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 81 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 7 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Pfizer said it now expects 2018 revenue of between $53 billion and $55 billion, versus its a prior forecast of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. It raised both ends of its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast range by 5 cents and now expects $2.95 to $3.05 per share. Second quarter results were helped by higher-than-expected sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz at $463 million, and by the staying power of its former top-seller Lipitor. The off-patent cholesterol drug still generated worldwide sales of $521 million. Total revenue in the quarter rose 4.4 percent to $13.47 billion, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $13.31 billion."

17.82969516834659," Pfizer-Lilly pain drug meets late-stage trial goals (Reuters) - An experimental osteoarthritis drug developed by Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co achieved its main goal of lowering pain in a late stage trial, the companies said on Wednesday, potentially offering a safer alternative to opioids. Opioid abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and drugmakers have been looking for less addictive and safer options for people wanting to reduce pain. The treatment, tanezumab, belongs to an investigational category of pain medications that target nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells, and is also being evaluated to treat chronic lower back and cancer pain. U.S. regulators in 2015 lifted a hold on trials of medicines targeting the protein due to concerns they could worsen osteoarthritis in a small percentage of patients. Pfizer’s shares were marginally up at $37.79 in premarket trade. Eli Lilly shares rose 1 percent to $90.50. The study showed that patients who received two doses of the drug, tanezumab, showed a statistically significant improvement in physical function and an assessment of osteoarthritis by the patients, when compared to placebo, meeting all three goals of the study. Preliminary safety data showed that the drug was generally well-tolerated in these patients, with only about 1 percent of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects. “Safety concerns have been an overhang on the tanezumab opportunity. The data today should alleviate some of those concerns, in our opinion,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louis Chen said. Pfizer and Lilly, in a $1.8 billion deal, agreed in 2013 to jointly develop and sell tanezumab for several pain-related conditions, with the companies equally sharing development expenses and future sales. The drug’s sales are expected to reach $283 million for Pfizer by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters’ data. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting about 20 million people in the United States alone. Due to the lack of effective alternatives, patients with painful conditions like osteoarthritis and cancer turn to opioids for managing their symptoms. On average, 115 Americans die every day from opioid overdose."

16.02936610632234," Pfizer separates consumer health unit in business rejig (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc announced plans on Wednesday to reorganize into three units, separating its consumer healthcare business that the U.S. drugmaker has been trying to sell since last year. The company said it is still looking for options for the lower-margin, non-core consumer healthcare business that makes products ranging from painkiller Advil to lip balms and is worth about $15 billion. “Given the lack of urgency, management is being rational about its divestiture,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said, adding the new structure will help Pfizer maintain its options for the business. The news comes a day after Pfizer deferred drug price increases for no more than six months, following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Starting 2019, Pfizer’s new units would be Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. The company is currently split into two units - Innovative Medicines, which includes the consumer business, and Essential Health which houses legacy drugs such as Viagra. “This design gives us a sharper focus on diverse patients in diverse markets,” Albert Bourla, chief operating officer, said. The innovative medicines business will include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit, and together with the consumer healthcare business, will account for about three-quarters of the company’s revenue. Pfizer’s 2017 annual revenue was $52.55 billion. The established medicines unit would now include a majority of the company’s brands such as soon-to-be off-patent neurological disease treatment Lyrica as well as some generic drugs. The restructuring will allow the company to evaluate its businesses better and could result in selling or spinning off its off-patent drugs, Wall Street analysts said. While the company expects the business to generate sustainable moderate revenue growth after Lyrica goes generic, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the reorganization would allow the established medicines unit to have more autonomy. “We believe the potential for Pfizer to ultimately sell or spin the business likely remains on the table over time,” Divan said. Pfizer shares were trading marginally down at $37.27 in early trading."

16.02936610632234," Trump told Pfizer CEO price hikes hurt his drug plan: source NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read on Tuesday to say the company’s July 1 price hikes had complicated the administration’s drug pricing plans, prompting the company to defer its planned increases, according to a source familiar with the matter. Pfizer said on Tuesday it was deferring its drug price increases on around 40 drugs for no more than six months after Read’s conversation with Trump. U.S. Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar called Read previously, and the Pfizer CEO asked to speak directly with the president, the source said. The conversation took place around 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday and lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. Trump, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, had arrived at the U.S. ambassador’s residence at about 3:30 p.m. ET. Trump tweeted about the call at 6:37 p.m. and Pfizer confirmed it soon after. The call and subsequent price rollback came a day after Trump took aim at Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers for raising prices on some of their medicines, saying in a tweet that they “should be ashamed” and that his administration would respond. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said he was concerned that Trump had struck a “secret, sweetheart” deal with Pfizer and asked for Azar and Pfizer to release details about what was agreed on the calls. “Instead of proposing meaningful changes that result in lower costs for families and taxpayers, Trump and his Administration are busy scoring cheap PR points that don’t address the fundamental challenges that lead to higher prices every year,” Wyden said in a press release. Trump rolled out a blueprint in May on how his administration planned to lower drug prices. Later that month, Trump said that some drug companies would announce “voluntary, massive” price decreases in two weeks, though none have materialized yet. Pfizer on Tuesday said it would defer price increases that went into effect on July 1 until the end of the year or until the president’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect - whichever is sooner. The company said it would return drug prices to their pre-July 1 levels as soon as technically possible. Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies, now likely will not raise drug prices until after the 2018 midterm elections in November. That gives Trump, who made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue, a short-term victory he can point to in the run-up to the elections, which are being closely watched to see if Trump’s fellow Republicans will be able to maintain control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives."

16.6328648240732," Pfizer wins appeal against UK fine for epilepsy drug price hike LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Flynn Pharma won an appeal on Thursday against fines totalling nearly 90 million pounds ($120 million) imposed in 2016 for ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had fined the companies for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The Competition Appeal Tribunal said on Thursday there was much in the CMA’s decision with which it agreed, but it found that conclusions on abuse of market dominance were in error. The CMA said it might appeal the tribunal’s ruling. It had taken action against the drugmakers after the UK price charged for 100 mg packs of the epilepsy drug jumped 2,600 percent from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 in 2012, before being reduced to 54 pounds from May 2014. As a result, annual spending on the capsules by Britain’s National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said at the time that UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. Pfizer, which was fined 84.2 million pounds, used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012. The Competition Appeal Tribunal said the CMA misapplied the test for unfair pricing, and would send the case back to the CMA for further consideration. The CMA said it continued to have serious concerns about the very big increases that have occurred for this and several other generic drugs, which have cost the NHS tens of millions of pounds, and the ruling could severely delay other active investigations. “The CMA is disappointed with today’s judgment which it is carefully reviewing,” it said. “In light of its importance to the NHS and the potential implications for similar cases, the CMA is actively considering whether to appeal.” Pfizer said it was pleased that the tribunal had overturned the finding that it abused its dominant position – along with the associated fine. “Our priority has always been to ensure a sustainable supply of our medicines to UK patients and this was at the heart of our decision to divest this medicine,” it said."

The new funding will bring total assets managed by Pfizer Ventures to over $1 billion, the company said in a statement. The announcement comes six months after the U.S. drugmaker said it was abandoning research to find new drugs aimed at treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Several drugmakers, including Pfizer, have cut back on neuroscience research after a string of costly trials yielded disappointing results, with some of them betting on startups that are focusing on such areas. Pfizer has already invested in six neuroscience companies and, alongside drugmakers such as GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L and Eli Lilly LLY.N, is part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, which has raised more than $190 million since its 2015 launch. Pfizer Ventures will seek to invest $150 million in early-stage neuroscience companies, particularly those focusing on neuro-degeneration, neuro-inflammation and neuro-metabolic disorders."
16.09810104697559," FDA clears Pfizer's Xeljanz for inflammatory bowel disease (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday that it had approved Pfizer Inc’s drug, Xeljanz, to treat adults with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. The effectiveness of Xeljanz in treating ulcerative colitis was shown in three controlled clinical trials, including two trials that showed the drug caused disease remission in about 17-18 percent of the patients. The drug is already approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Xeljanz is expected to bring in sales of $2.16 billion in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It had generated sales of $1.35 billion in 2017. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and causes recurrent flares of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. More than 900,000 people suffer from the disease in the United States, according to the FDA. Pfizer’s shares were up 1.1 percent at $36.11 in afternoon trading."

19.845944207171478," Australian anti-trust watchdog loses appeal against Pfizer over Lipitor sales MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian court dismissed an appeal by the nation’s anti-trust watchdog in a case against Pfizer Inc in which the regulator alleged the company had used its market power to limit competition for its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Friday it was considering the judgment and remained committed to pursuing cases involving “misuse of market power”. “The ACCC brought this appeal because it was concerned that Pfizer’s use of its market position as supplier of the top selling branded atorvastatin immediately before generic products were able to enter the market harmed the competitive process and therefore consumers,” Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The drug Lipitor generated annual sales of more than A$700 million ($530 million) for Pfizer in Australia before the company’s patent expired there in May 2012, the Commission said when it launched the case against Pfizer in 2014. The Commission had alleged that Pfizer had offered big discounts and rebates on Lipitor to pharmacies that bought up large quantities of the drug and agreed to limit re-supply of competing generic atorvastatin products. The full Federal Court upheld a 2015 decision which found the regulator had failed to show that the sales strategy was specifically designed to deter other generic manufacturers from supplying their own atorvastatin to pharmacies. Pfizer welcomed the decision on Friday. “We have always maintained that our behavior was appropriate and reflected the high ethical standards, integrity and compliance that are central to our culture,” Pfizer said in an emailed statement."
19.144698447163126," Pfizer to pay $23.85 million to settle U.S. co-payment kickback probe (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N agreed to pay $23.85 million to resolve U.S. charges that it used a purportedly independent charity to pay illegal kickbacks to Medicare patients, covering their out-of-pocket costs for its prescription drugs. The U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday that the civil settlement resolves allegations that Pfizer improperly used the Patient Access Network Foundation as a conduit to cover co-payment obligations of patients taking three Pfizer drugs. Pfizer’s actions enabled the New York-based drugmaker to boost prices and revenue, violating the federal False Claims Act in a scheme that ran from 2012 to 2016, the department said. The False Claims Act bans drugmakers from offering anything of value to induce Medicare patients to buy their drugs. The accord resulted from an industrywide probe led by the office of U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston of drugmakers’ support of patient assistance charities. “Kickbacks undermine the independence of physician and patient decision-making, and raise healthcare costs,” Chad Readler, the acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s civil division, said in a statement. Pfizer said the settlement was not an admission of liability, but reflected its “desire to put this legal matter behind it and focus on the needs of patients. The company believes all individuals deserve access to medicines prescribed by their physicians.” The largest U.S. drugmaker also entered a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Drugmakers are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in Medicare, the government health plan for older Americans, but may donate to independent non-profits that provide such assistance. Pfizer was accused of working with a third party specialty pharmacy, Advanced Care Scripts, to move patients taking its kidney cancer drugs Sutent and Inlyta to the foundation, rather than provide the drugs for free to qualified patients. The government also said Pfizer worked with the foundation to create a fund for patients taking its heart drug Tikosyn, and coordinated the fund’s opening with a price hike. Advanced Care Scripts became part of CVS Health Corp CVS.N in 2015. ""We are not aware of any allegation of wrongdoing by ACS,"" a CVS spokesman said. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In December, United Therapeutics Corp UTHR.O reached a $210 million settlement to resolve similar allegations it improperly used a charity to cover co-payments. On May 8, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc JAZZ.O said it would pay $57 million in another accord."

16.308417676841223," Pfizer's biosimilar of Amgen, J&J's anemia treatments gets FDA nod (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s Retacrit was approved by U.S. health regulators as a biosimilar to current anemia treatments from Amgen Inc and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday, setting it up to compete against more established brands. A year ago the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected Retacrit as a copy of Amgen's Epogen and Johnson & Johnson's Procrit, citing here issues with a potential manufacturing facility in Kansas. Shares of the rival companies dipped in afternoon trade. “People were surprised last time when Pfizer didn’t get a first round approval for a biosimilar, so I think people certainly expected it this time. Its not a surprise,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney said. Epogen’s $1.10 billion in sales accounted for about 5 percent of Amgen’s 2017 revenue, but analysts believe a competing product is unlikely to hurt the company. “Its nice to see that the FDA is moving along and approving biosimilars but the commercial impact to Amgen is quite minimal,” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, who has a “buy” rating on Amgen’s stock, told Reuters. Johnson & Johnson’s Procrit brought in sales of $972 million in 2017, accounting for 2.7 percent of its total sales. The FDA has been pushing to approve copies of expensive branded drugs to increase competition in the market as the Trump administration rallies against exorbitantly priced medicines. Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, but they can never be exact duplicates. Tuesday’s approval allows Retacrit’s use as a treatment for a drop in red blood cells caused by chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy, or the use of zidovudine in HIV patients. The biosimilar was also approved for use before and after surgery to safeguard against the need for red blood cell transfusions due to blood loss from surgery. Shares of Johnson & Johnson dipped 1.2 percent and Amgen’s shares fell 2.5 percent in afternoon trading. Pfizer’s shares were down about 1 pct."

Data showed U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April, weighed down by shortages of skilled workers and rising capacity constraints, but strengthening global demand continued to support manufacturing. The Institute for Supply Management survey also showed a jump in raw material costs, with steel and other prices increasing due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Trump administration was prepared to levy tariffs on China if an American delegation heading to Beijing did not reach a settlement on trade imbalances. The news came after Trump on Monday extended a temporary reprieve from metal tariffs for the EU, Canada and Mexico until June 1, just hours before they were due to come into force. While first-quarter corporate profits are expected to have notched their best growth in seven years, largely due to lower taxes, investors have focused on cost warnings from companies. “I think a lot of data is pointing to 2018 being a peak from many points of view,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “What’s concerning is beyond this year, the momentum will slow.

The energy sector fell 1.2 percent on the back of a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as the dollar remained near a four-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve meet. Pfizer fell 4.3 percent, the most on the Dow, after posting its biggest miss on quarterly revenue in a year, on disappointing sales of some blockbuster drugs.

14.867539383629957," Pfizer first-quarter results miss estimates as key drug sales fall short NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue as demand for some key drugs and international sales fell short of estimates, sparking a 5.1 percent drop in shares of the largest U.S. drugmaker. The company, which is exploring a sale of its consumer healthcare business but has seen potential suitors drop out, said it has not received an acceptable offer at this time. “If we can’t get value, we’ll retain it and invest in it,” Chief Executive Officer Ian Read told analysts. A final decision is still expected this year. Read, whose previous attempts at huge acquisitions of AstraZeneca AZN.L and Allergan AGN.N were thwarted, said the company does not need a megamerger to drive future growth. “I don’t see that we need a transformative deal or see one at an appropriate value,” Read said, adding that drugs in development and newer medicines will be able to drive future growth. He said the company has 15 potential blockbuster medicines in the pipeline that could be launched by 2022. Pfizer also sees opportunities to significantly expand sales of prostate cancer drug Xtandi for treating less advanced patients, and arthritis drug Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis. U.S. regulatory decisions on the expanded uses are expected later this year. Pfizer posted adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share that topped analysts’ average expectations by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on lower taxes and cost of goods sold. It did not raise its full-year earnings or revenue forecasts. Despite strong growth, sales of oral rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz and blockbuster breast cancer treatment Ibrance missed expectations largely due to inventory stocking issues but are likely to rebound, analysts said. Injected arthritis drug Enbrel was hit by competition from cheaper biosimilars outside the United States. Vaccines and other older drugs, such as Lyrica, Premarin and Celebrex all fell short of analysts’ estimates. Ibrance sales rose 37.4 percent to $933 million, while analysts looked for $956.6 million. Xeljanz sales totaled $326 million, missing the Wall Street outlook by about $72 million. Total revenue rose 1 percent to $12.91 billion, while analysts expected $13.13 billion. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said he expected stronger international sales, given favorable foreign exchange rates. ""If you remove the FX tailwind it would have been a much more substantial miss,"" he said, adding that it was disappointing Pfizer did not raise its 2018 forecasts after rivals, such as Merck & Co MRK.N and AbbVie ABBV.N, raised their outlooks after reporting first-quarter results. Pfizer still expects adjusted full-year earnings of $2.90 to $3.00 per share on revenue of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. Net profit rose to $3.56 billion, or 59 cents per share, for the quarter, from $3.12 billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier. Pfizer shares fell $1.87 to $34.74."
