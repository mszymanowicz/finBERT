Its customers include big financial institutions, large merchants, small businesses and independent ATM distributors.

10.310122976611687," NCR throws hat in the ring for Cardtronics with $1.73 billion offer (Reuters) - NCR Corporation on Monday offered to buy Cardtronics Plc for about $1.73 billion in cash, threatening to derail the ATM operator’s acquisition by private equity firm Apollo Global and investment firm Hudson Executive Capital. Atlanta-based NCR, which makes ATMs and self-service kiosks for the retail and hospitality industries, proposed to buy all outstanding shares of Cardtronics for $39 apiece, representing a discount of about 5% to Cardtronics’ Friday close. The bid trumps a $35 per share cash offer from funds managed by affiliates of private equity firm Apollo and Hudson Executive that Cardtronics accepted weeks ago. bit.ly/35LyGyr Apollo and Hudson Executive’s offer indicated a value of $2.3 billion, including net debt. Apollo, Hudson Executive and Cardtronics did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on NCR’s offer for the company. Hudson Executive is Cardtronics’ largest investor with a 19.44% stake, according to Refinitiv data. Other investors include Blackrock Institutional Trust and Vanguard Group. Cardtronics, which claims to be the world’s largest ATM operator, runs 285,000 ATMs in 10 countries and has processed 2.6 billion transactions since 2019. Its customers include large financial institutions, large merchants, small business and independent ATM distributors. Houston-based Cardtronics’ debit network combined with NCR’s payments platform will enable the merged company to connect their retail and bank customers, NCR Chief Executive Officer Michael Hayford said. “We believe a transaction of this nature could add sizable incremental recurring revenue, afford it (NCR) with notable synergy/accretion opportunities and represent a springboard for NCR’s ATMaaS (ATM as a Service) strategy,” D.A. Davidson analysts said in a note. Shares in NCR were marginally higher in premarket trade, while Cardtronics was 2.4% lower; the shares have soared almost 60% since it first revealed a proposal by Apollo and Hudson Executive in December."

-14.894736842105255," Wynn, NCR deals a sign of yet more risk returning to bond market NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. casino operator Wynn Resorts Ltd WYNN.O and automated teller machines maker NCR Corp NCR.N jointly raised $1 billion on Tuesday, in the first unsecured junk-rated bond offerings since the market was roiled by the coronavirus outbreak at the start of March. The offerings indicate investor appetite for risk is gradually returning in the market for new corporate debt rated below investment grade. The so-called high-yield market has been supported by the Federal Reserve’s pledge to backstop the investment-grade market, according to Bill Zox, chief investment officer of fixed income at Diamond Hill Capital Management. “It opens up the new issue market on the investment-grade side, which then gives high-yield investors some confidence that the market can absorb new issuance,” said Zox. Wynn, which issued a warning on Feb. 28 about the potential impact of the coronavirus on earnings, sold $600 million in new debt maturing in 2025, upsized from the $350 million the company originally planned to raise. The company is paying interest of 7.75%, compared with 5.125% in a $750 million deal for bonds maturing in 2029, which was done in September. NCR sold $400 million in new debt maturing in 2025 at a yield of 8.125%, a higher borrowing cost than the 6.125% yield on the $500 million in 2029 bonds it agreed to in August. Yum Brands Inc YUM.N and Carnival Corp CCL.N last week reopened the market for riskier debt after its longest lull since the 2008 financial crisis, but those deals were both secured against the companies' assets. In an unsecured deal, the borrowing is done against a company's perceived creditworthiness. Nevertheless, the high-yield market is still seen as off limits for smaller companies or borrowers with lower credit ratings. “You’re going to see larger well-known issuers accessing the market. I still don’t expect very low-quality or much smaller issuers to access the new issue market,” Zox said. Shares in Wynn and NCR closed up 7.3% and down 4.3% respectively."
