15.909658387732753," Morgan Stanley has a chance to raise stakes in China ventures SHANGHAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Shanghai Chinafortune Co said on Friday its brokerage subsidiary plans to sell stakes in Morgan Stanley’s Chinese securities and mutual fund ventures, potentially enabling the U.S. bank to move toward full control. China Fortune Securities Co plans to auction a 39% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, and its entire 36% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Fund Management Co through the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, Chinafortune said in an exchange filing. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Global banks and asset managers, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been increasing stakes in joint ventures in China, as Beijing fully opened the country’s financial industry last year. Majority, or full ownership could make is easier for foreign banks to expand their operations in the multi-trillion-dollar Chinese financial sector. Chinese state-controlled companies often transfer stakes through auctions. In 2019, Morgan Stanley bought a 2% stake in its Chinese securities JV from China Fortune Securities also through an auction. Following the stake sale, China Fortune Securities will still own 10% of Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, which is currently 51% owned by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley currently owns a 49% stake in its Chinese fund venture, which means the U.S. bank will gain majority control if it succeeds in buying the stake to be auctioned from China Fortune Securities. Shanghai Chinafortune said the auction deals will need to go through certain procedures. (Reporting by Samuel Shen and Alun John. Editing by Jane Merriman)"
22.507352778259644," Italy's Treasury officials to face new trial over Morgan Stanley derivatives case ROME, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Italy’s Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for two ex-economy ministers and two former Treasury officials in a case over disputed derivatives transactions between the Treasury and U.S. bank Morgan Stanley. The court also confirmed a previous ruling that the country’s audit court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case against the U.S. investment bank. The ruling by the Supreme Court was made on Nov. 17 but only published on Monday. It concerns Morgan Stanley derivative transactions made by the Italian state between 1995 and 2005 and terminated in December 2011 and January 2012. The Audit Court ordered a new trial for a group of once senior Treasury officials - former public debt chief Maria Cannata and Treasury boss Vincenzo La Via, and former finance ministers Domenico Siniscalco and Vittorio Grilli. They have denied any wrongdoing. Cannata’s lawyers, Giuseppe Iannaccone and Riccardo Lugaro, said in a statement they were confident the new trial would prove her innocence. “She has always carried out her work with dedication in extremely difficult years,” they said. Prosecutors have argued that the termination clauses of some of the derivative contracts were overly advantageous to Morgan Stanley and resulted in Italy paying around 3 billion euros ($3.63 billion) to the bank. Their original trial opened in 2018, but swiftly came to a halt when the Italian Audit Court ruled that it was not authorised to hear the case. The Supreme Court confirmed that the audit court did not have jurisdiction over Morgan Stanley, which has denied any wrongdoing. The original case included a demand for 2.7 billion euros in damages from the investment bank.

3.804655863879007," Polynt-Reichhold owner picks Morgan Stanley for $1.8 billion sale - sources MILAN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Italian buyout fund Investindustrial has picked Morgan Stanley to work on the sale of Polynt-Reichhold in a deal that could value the specialty chemicals firm at up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion), two sources familiar with the matter said. “The sales process is slated to kick off in the coming weeks. It could be a deal for the first-quarter,” one of the sources said. Investindustrial, headed by Italian businessman and founder Andrea Bonomi, took indirect control of Polynt back in 2008 and then more than tripled its revenues with the Reichhold tie-up. The company, based close to the northern Italian town of Bergamo, provides specialty, intermediate and composite chemicals to a range of industries including the transportation, construction, medical and food additive markets. It operates globally with a strong presence in Europe and North America and has over 2 billion euros in annual revenue. “It’s going to draw interest not just from industry names but private equity with the know-how and skills like Cinven or Apollo,” the first source said.

3.804655863879007," Breakingviews - Morgan Stanley serves up best of two weird worlds NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Morgan Stanley has a foot in two worlds, both of them distorted in ways that help the Wall Street firm. On Wednesday the company run by James Gorman reported a 57% increase in earnings over 2020, driven by a surge in its stock and bond trading business. Banks can’t rely on a repeat of that, but a stock-fueled M&A spree leaves Morgan Stanley well placed for what comes after. The $5 billion increase in trading revenue Morgan Stanley reaped last year reflects a street-wide windfall. The biggest five investment banks collectively made $28 billion more than a year earlier, thanks to volatile markets that were kept in working order by supportive central banks. Morgan Stanley isn’t the most sensitive to that kind of move – trading provides just under 40% of total revenue, versus nearly half at Goldman Sachs – but its 30% annual increase in the fourth quarter comfortably beat peers. Gorman put the odds of that continuing at “less than 50%” on Wednesday; Goldman warned something similar the day before. So the question becomes which of the Wall Street firms is best positioned to live without profitable market swings. Big lenders like JPMorgan and Bank of America suffer when interest rates and loan demand fall. Goldman too has been pushing into retail banking. Conversely Gorman’s focus is on the stable business of wealth management. Last year he bought online brokerage E*Trade Financial and is in the process of acquiring asset manager Eaton Vance for a combined $20 billion, most of it in shares. E*Trade attracted almost 1 million new accounts just in the second half of last year. On Wednesday Morgan Stanley raised its estimate of how much money it will save from bringing E*Trade’s low-cost deposits onto its own balance sheet. That hasn’t gone unnoticed – at $136 billion Morgan Stanley trades at almost 1.5 times its estimated book value a year from now, according to Refinitiv, its highest since at least the financial crisis. The post-Covid-19 world may be different, but still weird in its way. Retail investors have piled frantically into online stock trading, and rising markets together with rock-bottom savings rates may continue that trend. The rich will keep getting richer, to the benefit of wealth managers. It’s fair to say Gorman has read the room."
3.804655863879007," Morgan Stanley boosts targets after blowout trading quarter (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley boosted both its short and long-term operating targets on Wednesday after coronavirus-induced volatility in financial markets helped the Wall Street bank post a quarterly profit that sailed past estimates. The company also confirmed plans to buy back $10 billion of shares this year, more than three times the figures announced by its retail banking peers, as it wrapped up results for U.S. lenders, which pointed to a modest rebound in the economy. “We are in the growth phase of this company for the next decade,” Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told analysts on a conference call. Morgan Stanley increased its two-year target for return on tangible equity to 14%-16%, from an earlier forecast of 13%-15%. The metric measures how well a bank is using its capital to produce profit. The company also raised its longer term target for the same metric to more than 17%, from its previous outlook of 15%-17%. “If we’d said to you 3 years ago, our aspiration was to have a 17-plus ROTCE, you would have thought we’re off the planet,” Gorman said, responding to one analyst, who commented that the target looked conservative. Gorman’s comments came after high trading volumes during the final quarter of 2020, stemming from the U.S. elections and the release of coronavirus vaccines, benefited Morgan Stanley’s trading unit, which is housed within the institutional securities business. The bank’s revenue from sales and trading rose to $4.22 billion from $3.19 billion a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $13.64 billion from $10.86 billion last year, while revenue from the company’s investment banking division rose to $2.30 billion from $1.58 billion. Gorman has, however, been taking steps to insulate the bank from its reliance on trading, and engineered two large back-to-back acquisitions, those of Eaton Vance and E*Trade, to bolster its investment management and broking arms. Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting revenue soared 81% from a year earlier, driven by high profile IPOs and follow-on offerings as clients continued to access capital markets. Morgan Stanley was among underwriters for IPOs of companies including Airbnb Inc, gaming firm Playtika Holding Corp, fintech startup Affirm Holdings Inc and cloud-based data warehouse firm Snowflake Inc. “The environment is clearly exceptional, and we are not counting on it to persist in our forward estimates. Nevertheless, there is nothing not to like in these results,” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said in a note. The bank’s shares, which rose about 34% in 2020, hit their highest level in over 20 years in early trading. Morgan Stanley’s most comparable rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, on Tuesday posted a blockbuster fourth-quarter profit that dwarfed Wall Street estimates, but executives warned that capital markets activity fueling results lately will probably slow down. Morgan Stanley reported a net income applicable to common shareholders of $3.27 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $2.09 billion, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.27 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Fourth-quarter return on tangible equity came in at 17.7%, compared with 13.0% last year and 15.0% in the third quarter."

21.393496263441254," Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley lead U.S. bank rally after stress test (Reuters) - U.S. bank shares outperformed the broader market on Monday, led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, after the Federal Reserve said stress test results meant the sector could resume stock buybacks for the first time since the coronavirus-led downturn. The Fed said the biggest U.S. banks had enough capital to withstand over $600 billion in losses from a short, sharp economic slump, as well as a moderate longer-lasting downturn, and would now be permitted to pay out dividends and buy back stock on a limited basis. Earlier this year, the Fed barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was its second bank “stress test” for 2020, the first time the Fed has done two in a year since annual health checks began after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Goldman shares were last up 7.2% after surpassing their January high for the first time since the COVID-crisis. Morgan Stanley was up 5.9% and trading at its highest since September 2007. In comparison, the S&P 500 bank subsector, which does not include Goldman or Morgan Stanley, was up 3.1%. The regulator’s decision came quicker than many investors had expected and suggested Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs investors were in line for bigger buybacks than the majority of the sector, according to Piper Sander analyst Jeffery Harte. “Overall, the amount of share buybacks the Fed’s math suggests the big banks will be able to make in the first quarter of 2021 is good news for the group,” said Harte. As for Goldman Sachs, Harte noted that investors had worried more about the bank’s dividend prospects during the pandemic. “It’s quite a positive change from people being concerned Goldman wouldn’t be able to maintain their dividend to being able to buyback more stocks than most of the sector,” he said. The Fed’s decision came earlier than expected and the results were a little better than expected across the board, said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “Generally people thought the Fed was going to keep restrictions in place another quarter or two,” said Grant, who also suggested investors were favoring Morgan Stanley and Goldman due to relatively cheap valuations. Goldman’s 9.9 forward price to earnings multiple, which compares its trading price to analyst expectations for earnings per share for the next 12 months, is well below the industry median of 12.9, according to Refinitiv Morgan Stanley’s 12.3 multiple also lags the median. In the sector index JPMorgan Chase led gainers, up 4.8% while Citigroup climbed 3.7% and Bank of America was up 4.0%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was down 0.6% as investors fled risk after a new strain of the coronavirus emerged in the United Kingdom, leading several countries to close their borders to Britain just days before the UK is set to leave the European Union."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that there was “a strong possibility” Britain and the EU would fail to secure an agreement. Morgan Stanley sees shares of UK banks falling 10% to 20% in a “no deal” scenario, given there is a higher chance the Bank of England would cut interest rates into negative territory. The U.S. investment bank said insurance, real estate and housebuilding stocks were also at risk. “A no-deal Brexit outcome would represent an unexpected surprise to markets, however the negative impact would be cushioned by an otherwise positive global outlook,” the bank’s equity strategists, led by Graham Secker, said in a note.

The company has seen air freight demand surge as the cargo capacity usually available in passenger planes has evaporated during the COVID-19 pandemic as air travel all but shut down.

49.37213554491169," Morgan Stanley unveils scholarship fund for Black colleges (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N said on Wednesday it will cover college expenses for 60 students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the banking industry's latest attempt to address racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. The Morgan Stanley HBCU Scholars program will fund the entire cost of attending Howard University, Morehouse College or Spelman College for students in any field of study. The bank has committed to spending $12 million on the program over four years. “This is about something much bigger than banking and Morgan Stanley,” Chief Diversity Officer Susan Reid said in an interview. “This was about helping young adults of color who might not otherwise be able to afford college, regardless of whether they want to be a banker, or a doctor or a lawyer.” The bank has also tapped its internal network of HBCU alumni to provide career readiness support to the selected students. The banking industry has been criticized for its lack of racial diversity since the May 25 death in police custody of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked demonstrations and prompted introspection at companies across the country. In June, a former diversity officer sued Morgan Stanley alleging racial discrimination, retaliation and violation of equal pay laws, according to a court filing. The bank has rejected the allegations and said the firm will defend itself. Last month, Morgan Stanley started recruiting for a new program that aims to add more black employees to its trading division. “In this moment, we are focused on black talent,” Reid said."
47.66741973223015," Morgan Stanley profit crushes estimates on trading strength (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N eased past Wall Street estimates for profit on Thursday, wrapping up mixed third-quarter earnings for big U.S. banks that saw those focused on trading clocking big gains while retail banks took a hit from the pandemic. Like fellow Wall Street trading powerhouse Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley capitalized on a flurry of activity in financial markets. Clients bought and sold securities in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and many companies went public or raised fresh capital. While Morgan Stanley’s trading unit did not hit the record highs of the previous quarter, the latest performance was still good enough to help the bank comfortably beat expectations. Striking an upbeat tone about future growth, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said the bank was encouraged by client engagement across all its businesses in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter. Even as trading returns to the spotlight amid the pandemic, Chief Executive James Gorman has been taking steps to shore up Morgan Stanley’s asset and wealth management businesses to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking. Gorman engineered two large back-to-back acquisitions recently - a $7 billion deal to buy Eaton Vance Corp to expand its investment-management business immediately after closing its $13 billion acquisition of discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp. Executives said they are done with deals for awhile as they integrate those companies. “We clearly have our plate full,” Pruzan said in an interview. Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.5% to $51.40 in afternoon trading. The bank’s wealth management arm also turned in a solid quarter with a 7% jump in revenue to $4.7 billion. Its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profits, came in at 15%, in line with the target Gorman had set out earlier this year. In contrast to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, other big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup C.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N are more exposed to weak activity in the real economy, plus historically low interest rates. They have collectively set aside tens of billions of dollars' worth of provisions this year to cover bad loans. Even so, most large banks beat profit estimates this quarter, partly due to muted expectations. Revenue from Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities division, which is houses its investment banking and trading businesses, rose 21% to $6.1 billion. Equities underwriting revenue more than doubled to $874 million due to handsome fees from a number of high-profile initial public offerings such as Snowflake Inc SNOW.N, Royalty Pharma RPRX.O, KE Holdings Inc BEKE.N and Warner Music WMG.O. But revenue from underwriting bonds dropped from last year due to declines in loan issuances and muted dealmaking activity. Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 26% to $2.60 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share rose to $1.66, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.28 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue also comfortably beat estimates, rising 16% to $11.7 billion, as all three of its main businesses posted gains. (mgstn.ly/3dvUT5T)"
47.66741973223015," Breakingviews - Morgan Stanley dares to share with bankers’ pay NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Morgan Stanley is making more, and paying more. Logical as that sounds, it’s also rather daring. Handing over big sums to traders and dealmakers is a potentially touchy subject in a pandemic that has cost millions of Americans their livelihood, and brought Wall Street firms’ market makers huge profits. Fortunately, Morgan Stanley is better placed than some peers to share the wealth. The three months ending in September were kind to the $92 billion firm. Morgan Stanley’s earnings increased by 26% year-on-year, and its $2.3 billion in equities revenue put it back at the top of Wall Street’s slippery pole for stock trading, after sliding behind Goldman Sachs the previous quarter. CEO James Gorman was able to buy brokerage E*Trade Financial, and intends to buy asset manager Eaton Vance, while still having more capital than regulators say he needs. As a result, this year is shaping up to be a good one for Gorman’s underlings. Trading and investment-banking revenue rose 24% over the year to date, compared with the same nine months in 2019, and pay earmarked for that division rose 26%. That made Morgan Stanley an outlier, at least for now. Goldman paid more in dollars, but less as a share of revenue. JPMorgan’s comparable revenue rose by nearly 30%, but its bankers’ pay increased just 10%. Gorman has more freedom over pay than some of his rivals. His firm isn’t a giant lender to American consumers and businesses, for one, which puts him less in the crosshairs of progressive politicians. It also means that Morgan Stanley overall isn’t facing a huge slump in earnings this year, unlike all of the big main-street banks against which its traders and rainmakers compete. Gorman’s own relatively low profile doesn’t hurt either. There’s another difference: Morgan Stanley won props last year for being restrained in Gorman’s pay. Make no mistake, a $27 million award for 2019 is still astronomical by real-world standards. But the Australian-born bank chief took a pay cut in 2019 of $2 million, even though his full-year profit fell less than at his four biggest rivals’ banks. Goldman, in an exceptionally tin-eared moment, awarded David Solomon a 20% raise, after a year when earnings fell by one-fifth. Those are the kind of gestures that endure."

54.709734831363654," Morgan Stanley to pay $60 million penalty for insufficient oversight of data centers WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N will pay a $60 million penalty after a U.S. banking regulator found the firm lacked proper oversight as it decommissioned two business data centers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Thursday the bank failed to properly monitor an outside vendor as it wound down the centers in 2016, and failed to maintain inventory of customer data. The regulator said the bank had similar vendor management issues in 2019 when decommissioning other network devices. In July, the bank began notifying some wealth management customers that their personal data might have been compromised, after computer hardware the bank had disposed of was found to still contain some of that information. The bank offered two years of free credit monitoring services to affected customers. “We have continuously monitored the situation and we do not believe that any of our clients’ information has been accessed or misused,” said a bank spokesperson in a statement. “Moreover, we have instituted enhanced security procedures, including continuous fraud monitoring, and will continue to strengthen the controls that we have in place to protect our clients’ information.”"
54.709734831363654," Morgan Stanley to buy Eaton Vance for $7 billion in investment-management push (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has agreed to buy Eaton Vance Corp for about $7 billion in a cash-and-stock deal that can quickly expand its investment-management business and add more offerings for retail investors, the bank said on Thursday. The transaction is the latest move by Chief Executive James Gorman to reshape Morgan Stanley into one of the biggest global money managers through a series of acquisitions that began just before he took over more than a decade ago. Morgan Stanley’s wealth and investment management businesses already account for 40-50% of the bank’s revenue. Adding Eaton Vance would nearly double assets under management within the investment management division compared with June 30 and boost the business’s annual revenue by about one-third. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit,” Gorman said. Eaton Vance shareholders will receive $28.25 per share in cash and 0.5833 Morgan Stanley shares for each share they hold, representing a 38% premium to Eaton’s closing price on Wednesday. They will also get a one-time $4.25 dividend paid by Eaton Vance before the deal closes. Subject to regulatory approvals, the two companies expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021. The deal is good for Morgan Stanley because it will help the bank distribute funds to retail investors since Eaton Vance is the top U.S. distributor of individual separate accounts, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said. It may also help grow revenue in an inexpensive way while growing assets, he said. However, the deal still dilutes shareholders and involves “execution risks” for a bank that has bought a couple of other companies lately, including online retail brokerage E*Trade Financial. “Morgan Stanley is undertaking another acquisition so soon after E*Trade,” Goldberg wrote in a note to clients. The Eaton Vance deal bolsters Gorman’s reputation as a CEO who acquires his way to growth, then finds efficiencies to bolster profits. The most emblematic deal of his tenure was Morgan Stanley’s decision to buy Smith Barney, which was announced in 2009 when he ran the bank’s wealth management business. Gorman was crucial in forging the massive deal, and combining the two companies became his chief task when he was elevated to CEO the next year. During that time, Gorman boosted the wealth management’s profit margins from single digits to 25-30% in more recent periods. After a long pause in acquisitions, Morgan Stanley announced last year that it would purchase an employee stock-plan manager for $850 million, and in February said it would buy online stock brokerage E*Trade for $13 billion. Although Gorman has turned around wealth management through deals, investment management has long been a sore point for the bank. After the financial crisis, executives tried without much success in turning around performance. The crisis crushed values in some funds, especially real estate, while FrontPoint, a prominent hedge fund it owned, got entangled in insider trading charges. By 2010, Morgan Stanley also had to comply with the Volcker rule, which limited its own financial commitment to private equity and hedge funds it managed. Nonetheless, management set growth targets Morgan Stanley struggled to meet. For instance, in 2014, Morgan Stanley set a goal for its investment management unit of $500 billion in assets under management and a 20% return-on-equity (ROE) by 2016, neither of which it reached in time. It is now surpassing both targets, partly due to soaring market values. The Eaton Vance deal will certainly help with assets, boosting AUM to $1.2 trillion from $665 billion at June 30. The bank expects combined annual revenue of about $5 billion, compared with $3.8 billion last year. Morgan Stanley has been looking at Eaton Vance for several years, Gorman said on a conference call with analysts to discuss the deal. He dismissed the idea that Morgan Stanley had overpaid, saying “you pay quality for quality.” After Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley is done with deals for awhile, Gorman said. The bank will then focus on incorporating all the companies it has bought and finding ways to make them gel with one another. Morgan Stanley expects to realize $150 million in annual savings through the transaction. It will have a break-even effect on earnings per share immediately and then become marginally beneficial to EPS, the bank said. The deal also helps the bank use extra capital in a way that still leaves it about 300 basis points above what the Federal Reserve requires, Morgan Stanley said. Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.2% to $49.29 in morning trading, while Eaton Vance shares jumped 47.7% to $60.45."

55.479933201946544," Negative BoE interest rate unlikely even in hard Brexit, says Morgan Stanley (Reuters) - Investment bank Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday it saw a “high barrier” to the Bank of England cutting interest rates below zero, even if Britain ends its Brexit transition period in December with no EU trade deal. Noting recent comments by BoE chief economist Andy Haldane and Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden, the U.S. bank told clients, “With two heavyweight insider Monetary Policy Committee members coming out publicly in opposition, at least at the moment, we see a high barrier to negative policy rates.” It said a bad Brexit outcome, such as World Trade Organisation terms instead of a free trade deal, could force the BoE to cut bank funding rates (TFS) to sub-zero, rather than the main policy rate. “We now think that outright cuts in Bank Rate to below zero in a WTO-style Brexit outcome look less plausible. Instead, adjusting TFS and providing term funding at negative rates, while leaving Bank Rate at 0%, looks like the more plausible option,” Morgan Stanley added."

26.502609610645074," Morgan Stanley doesn't expect trading boom to continue NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said on Wednesday the bank doesn't expect its sales and trading and investment banking business to perform as well in the third quarter as it had in the second. Pruzan, at a virtual conference hosted by Barclays, said that August activity levels had still been good and the bank had seen “no real slowdown”. “From an Institutional Securities Group (ISG) perspective, we’re not going to have as good a quarter as we did in the second quarter, but I would say it’s sort of better than a typical summer quarter,” Pruzan said. During the second quarter, Wall Street’s big investment banks gained from huge swings in financial markets due to the coronavirus crisis. Pruzan said the bank was still seeing “very constructive markets” across all parts of its sales and trading and investment banking business. JP Morgan said on Tuesday that its third-quarter trading revenue would be up about 20% from a year earlier. Pruzan said he expected net interest income at the bank’s wealth management business would “drift down a little bit” in the third quarter, in line with previous guidance. Pruzan also confirmed the bank is on track to complete its $13 billion acquisition of discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp in the fourth quarter, in line with previous guidance.

21.874218691352148," Morgan Stanley lowers 10-year Treasury yield forecast to 0.95% (Reuters) - Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR should end 2020 just under the 1% level, Morgan Stanley said in a recent research report that pointed to dovish moves by the Federal Reserve and other factors that led it to lower its yield forecast. The investment bank said it expects a 0.95% 10-year yield at year-end, down from a previously forecast 1.15%, citing the Fed’s recent shift toward average inflation targeting and its signaling of “an implicit cap on yields.” Other factors that have changed since June include “higher probability of disappointment on fiscal stimulus” to bolster the coronavirus-hit economy as Republicans and Democrats in Washington remain far apart, and an uncertain election period, which could “drive a flight-to-quality premium in Treasuries,” according to the report. Morgan Stanley also said with its expectations diminished for a near-term rise in 30-year yields, it recommended taking off yield curve steepeners such as long five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) versus short 30-year nominals and continued to suggest holding long five-year TIPS trade outright."
26.69183313031805," Morgan Stanley hikes chance of WTO-style Brexit to 40% LONDON (Reuters) - Investment bank Morgan Stanley has ramped up the risk of Britain and the European Union flopping onto World Trade Organization terms to 40% from 25%, after the UK signalled a willingness this week to walk away from Brexit talks. Negotiations have been thrust into chaos by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s threat to tear up part of the divorce treaty he signed only last year. “Although we still expect a deal in the end, the probabilities have shifted,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts said in a note on Friday. “The risks are skewed to a harder outcome... bumping up the probability of our bear case of a WTO-style outcome to 40%,” they said, adding a delay in implementing any deal was also likely. The chance of WTO crash out could be even higher if the UK government saw a significant chance of a close trade deal with the United States -- something seen as more likely if Donald Trump wins a second term as U.S. President in November. Morgan Stanley has previously modelled that in a WTO outcome, the share of UK exports to the EU facing tariffs – at an average 4% – would rise from zero to around 60%, with other non-tariff related frictions such as quotas or embargoes also having a damaging impact. In the context of a near 20% slump in the British economy due to the pandemic, the hit from a WTO Brexit would look modest at between 1.1% and 2% of GDP over the four-quarter period following the UK’s exit. Nevertheless Morgan Stanley thinks a 'hard Brexit' would send the pound down to $1.15, roughly 10% from its current $1.28 GBP= level and cause a 20% plunge in British bank shares. A reasonable trade deal, meanwhile, could lift the pound to $1.40 and boost bank shares by 20-40%, the bank said. Other institutions have also been rapidly revising their Brexit assumptions this week following the political drama. Japanese bank Nomura has warned that the chance of a no-deal could be as high at 50-60% if relations continue to fracture, while ratings agency Fitch has made WTO terms its base case outcome and knocked 2% off its 2021 British economic forecasts."

Morgan Stanley also raised its price forecast for West Texas Intermediate to $47.5 per barrel for the third quarter of 2021. The bank also sees a steady undersupply throughout 2021 and expects inventories to largely normalise by the end of next year as the global economy recovers. “We have delayed our assumption for when demand crosses over to its pre-COVID19 level from end-2021 to mid-2022, but this implies recovery nonetheless,” Morgan Stanley added. However, in the short-term oil market fundamentals look soft with fragile demand recovery, high inventories and spare capacity and low refining margins, the bank said. Both major oil benchmarks are trading close to three-month lows as the global health crisis continues to flare, threatening to slow a global economic recovery and reduce demand for fuels from aviation gas to diesel.

The Fed said Friday that it miscalculated hypothetical trading losses for Goldman and four other banks and issued corrected stress test results. In response, Goldman issued a statement saying it revised its stress capital buffer downward to 6.6% from 6.7%, and lowered the corresponding standard common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio requirement to 13.6% from 13.7%. Morgan Stanley meanwhile lowered its stress capital buffer to 5.7% from 5.9% and its CET1 ratio to 13.2% from 13.4%. In June, the Fed examined big banks’ balance sheets to see if they had enough funds on hand to handle losses during two years of severe economic and market stress. Goldman’s loan portfolio suffered significantly higher hypothetical loss rates than those of peers. The Fed ordered Goldman to hold the most capital of the 34 banks it tested, requiring it to have a CET1 ratio of 13.7% by Oct. 1. Goldman said in June that it had already boosted capital measures and was on track to meet the Federal Reserve’s benchmark for October. Now that will be slightly easier to achieve."

The AFT said the suspension arose after the execution on June 16, 2015, of transactions that seriously affected the liquidity of the French sovereign bond market and a failure by Morgan Stanley to disclose an investigation by the French AMF watchdog into those transactions. Morgan Stanley said it had taken note of the AFT’s decision, adding that it was working on remedial measures and hoped to regain its primary dealership status with the French state treasury as soon as possible. Last December Morgan Stanley was fined 20 million euros ($23.53 million) by the AMF for manipulation of sovereign bonds, which the bank is appealing against.

-0.8145588245506652," Morgan Stanley posts record profit on trading boom (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley posted a record quarterly profit on Thursday that blew past analysts’ expectations as another of Wall Street’s big investment banks gained from huge swings in financial markets due to the coronavirus crisis. The bank wrapped up second-quarter results for the big U.S. lenders that shook out along expected lines. Trading powerhouses Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs performed better than Main Street rivals JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, which had to build massive reserves for loans that may go bust. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, like other Wall Street executives this week, cautioned that the bank’s record-setting trading numbers would be hard to repeat in the coming quarters. “Clearly, it will be challenging for the back half of 2020 to meet the record first half results .... That said, many parts of our business should continue to perform well,” said Gorman. A hallmark of Gorman’s tenure as CEO has been the bank’s decade-long expansion into wealth and asset management, businesses that diversified the bank’s revenue streams and provide balance against the unpredictability of its trading business. Gorman said the decision to keep the bank’s consumer loan business small also helped this quarter. Credit cards and small business loans are expected to be badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and rival bank Goldman Sachs had to set aside $1.6 billion for loans that could go bad. In contrast, Morgan Stanley set aside just $239 million. The bank’s stock was up over 3% at $52.98 by mid-morning. “Morgan Stanley’s impressive second-quarter results strongly reflected its favorable business mix,” said Donald Robertson, a senior vice president at Moody’s Financial Institutions Group. “Its lack of traditional retail and commercial banking activities left it ... unscathed from the large loan-loss provisions.” For a graphic of banks' trading revenue, see tmsnrt.rs/3gYfW1I The bank’s trading unit recorded a 68% jump in revenue, led by a nearly 168% surge in bond trading. Equities trading revenue rose 23%. Investment banking was another bright spot, with revenue jumping 39% as companies looked to shore up their financial position to ride out the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.

5.946535339590429," Ex-Morgan Stanley diversity officer says bank slashed her budget by 71% NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer representing a former Morgan Stanley MS.N diversity officer who is suing the bank over racial discrimination said on Wednesday the bank cut her client's budget for promoting diversity and financial education by 71% from the time she started in wealth management to 2019. Marilyn Booker, who filed a lawsuit against the bank on Tuesday after she was let go in December, said on CNBC that she believes the bank did improve diversity during the 17 years she worked in diversity, human resources policy and recruiting. In 2011, the firm asked Booker to lead the urban markets group, a job she held until the bank eliminated her position on Dec. 9. Booker said she filed the lawsuit because she believes she was terminated for repeatedly pushing senior management to hear a proposal on increasing diversity and addressing bias against black financial advisers at the firm. reut.rs/2CeQHZZ “It’s not that I wanted to sue. I was fired,” Booker said, adding that she thinks her experience is common across Wall Street. “I think it’s important that I talk ... because my story is not unique to me.” Morgan Stanley did not provide a comment on the 71 percent figure, but it has refuted Booker’s allegations and said that she was let go along with 1,500 other employees last December. “We strongly reject the allegations made in this claim and intend to vigorously defend ourselves,” Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the diversity of our employees and have made steady progress – while recognizing that we have further progress to make. We will continue to advance our high priority efforts to achieve a more diverse and inclusive firm.” Booker and her lawyer Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP said the bank’s extremely low numbers of black employees at the firm show the bank has not made diversity a priority. Just 2.2% of Morgan Stanley’s senior executives were black last year, up from 1.9% in 2016 “This is not rocket science. It’s pretty simple. You hire black people ... and then you pay them,” Booker said. “It’s just not that difficult.”"
6.06742171995551," Ex-Morgan Stanley diversity officer sues bank, cites racial bias: court filing NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley diversity officer sued the bank on Tuesday, alleging racial discrimination, retaliation and violation of equal pay laws, according to a court filing. The plaintiff, Marilyn Booker, was a managing director for 26 years until she was fired in December, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Booker said the bank eliminated her position after senior executives ignored her proposal to address systemic racial bias against black financial advisers and trainees. Morgan Stanley rejected the allegations and said the firm will defend itself. “We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the diversity of our employees and have made steady progress – while recognizing that we have further progress to make,” spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney said in a statement. The lawsuit claims the bank violated the Civil Rights Act and New York state human rights laws, as well as federal and state equal pay laws. According to an article mgstn.ly/30NyU6h about Booker published on Morgan Stanley's website in February 2018, the bank recruited her in 1994 to run one of its first formal diversity programs. Booker worked in human resources, leading diversity, policy and recruiting until 2011, when she was asked to lead the bank’s urban markets group, which promotes prosperity in inner-city communities through financial literacy programs. According to the lawsuit, Booker pushed human resources colleagues and senior bank leaders in the fall of 2019 to consider her plan to increase diversity and “remedy rampant bias” against black financial advisers and trainees. Booker claims the bank retaliated by eliminating her job on Dec. 9, according to the court filing. Booker also alleged that the bank’s discriminatory employment practices extend to other black female employees, and is filing a collective action claim under the Equal Pay Act."

7.048613024619582," Recovery rally has further to run, so buy stocks: Morgan Stanley SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Stock market gains have further to run and investors are still under-pricing the scale of the world's coronavirus recovery, investment bank Morgan Stanley MS.N said in an outlook note. “While the last four months have been exceptional, we think that this cycle has been, and will be, more ‘normal’ than appreciated,” said Andrew Sheets, the bank’s chief cross-asset strategist. “We think that stocks and credit will be modestly higher and tighter over the next 12 months,” he said. The bank forecasts the S&P 500 index at 3,350 points and benchmark U.S. 10-year yields at 1.3% by mid-2021. The call, made in a note dated Sunday and distributed on Monday, comes as global markets pull back from a sharp rally that has lifted world stocks about 36% from March lows. The S&P 500 .SPX closed at 3,041.31 points on Friday and U.S. 10-year yields US10YT=RR last sat at 0.6625%. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest clients take long positions in U.S. small caps and financials, the euro and emerging market currencies, such as the Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee, and add a little bit more risk to their credit portfolios. “We recommend a broad rotation into cyclicals and value across global equities.”"

0.7368049675790925," Morgan Stanley flags risk oil price rally will lead to a fall (Reuters) - Oil prices have quickly climbed to levels that raise the risk of price falls as demand is fragile, Morgan Stanley said on Monday, as benchmark crude hit its highest in three months. Oil climbed on Monday after major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July and as China’s crude imports hit an all-time high in May. [O/R] The bank said its base case expectation remained that oil markets will be progressively under-supplied in the second half of this year and inventories will shrink in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year. But it said in a note the rally “appears mostly supply- rather than demand-driven, and it is questionable how strong refinery runs can increase against this backdrop”. Refining margins are historically low and inventories of oil products remain elevated relative to crude oil inventories, suggesting the demand recovery is relatively fragile. Consumption is unlikely to return fully to pre-coronavirus levels until the end of 2021, Morgan Stanley said, adding that inventories are unusually high after the increases in April. Growth from U.S. shale could return to levels that are too high, if the U.S. benchmark WTI trades too far above the low-$40s, it added. The bank also sees a risk to OPEC’s compliance with supply cuts that have led to unusually high levels of spare capacity. “When the cuts are eventually unwound, production could rise sharply,” it said."

20.494244199545292," Morgan Stanley not given advisory role on Aramco pipeline sale: sources LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N has not been given an advisory role on the potential sale of a stake in Saudi Aramco's pipeline business, a deal worth over $10 billion, two sources told Reuters. The U.S. investment bank, which has previously advised the world’s largest oil company, was originally looking to be part of the advisory group on any deal, the sources added. However, Aramco has mandated JP Morgan JPM.N and Japan's MUFG 8306.T to advise it on the deal, which is still in its early stages but would provide the company with cash at a time of low oil prices caused by the coronavirus crisis, the sources said. Morgan Stanley, Aramco, JP Morgan and MUFG all declined to comment. Although Morgan Stanley was one of Aramco’s top advisers on its initial public offering last year, three local banks - NCB, Samba and HSBC Saudi Arabia - ended up controlling most of the process when the listing was scaled down. U.S. investment banks have recently been shrinking lending outside their home market during the coronavirus crisis, sources told Reuters last month. Aramco’s pipeline sale would be similar to the path taken by Abu Dhabi’s national oil company ADNOC last year, when it raised $4 billion by selling a 40% stake in its pipelines division to U.S. investment firms KKR and BlackRock, the sources said. While ADNOC is in the process of replicating its deal by selling its natural gas pipeline assets, sources have told Reuters, in Aramco’s case the process is proving more difficult and moving more slowly, the sources added. Saudi Arabia is seen by international investors as riskier, one of the sources said, citing an attack on Saudi oil plants last year, the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the war in Yemen."
13.052744021744884," Morgan Stanley sees tighter oil market, raises Brent forecast (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley on Tuesday raised its year-end Brent price forecast to $40 per barrel, citing a faster-than-expected balance in global oil demand and supply as countries ease coronavirus restrictions and major producers cut supply. “We expect demand to rebound to about 97 million barrels per day (bpd) by Q4 as economies come out of lockdown - a significant improvement although still down about 4 million bpd year-on-year,” the bank said. The bank further expects supply to decline towards year-end across both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC, and said that will lead to an oil market that is 4 million-6 million bpd undersupplied during Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. The OPEC and producers including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, agreed last month to cut their combined output by almost 10 million bpd in May-June to support prices at a time when pandemic quarantines have slashed fuel demand. “Now that the rebalancing has been set in motion, we expect it to continue. Our base case forecasts call for a further tightening of the oil market over the next few quarters,” it said. The bank, however, said the recent rebalancing was mostly supply rather than demand-driven with the rise in crude prices compressing refining margins even further and inventories of oil products rising fast relative to crude oil stocks. The bank also raised its Q3 Brent price forecast to $35 per barrel from $30, and Q4 to $40 per barrel from $35, but maintained its long-term forecast for the global benchmark at $45 per barrel. Oil prices rose on Tuesday, supported by signs that producers are following through on commitments to cut supplies and as fuel demand picks up with the easing of lockdown curbs."
27.682380789025974," Morgan Stanley CEO: too early to consider restarting share buybacks NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's MS.N Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told shareholders on Thursday that it is too early for him or anyone on the board of directors to consider reinstating the bank's share buyback program. Morgan Stanley, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America BAC.N and five others, voluntarily suspended their share repurchases in mid-March to preserve liquidity during the novel coronavirus pandemic to lend to individuals and businesses in need. Gorman, speaking at the bank’s annual meeting, said he does not anticipate resuming share buybacks until the bank is certain the economy is on more steady footing. The current suspension is in place through at least June 30. Gorman, who has led the U.S.-based bank since the middle of the financial crisis more than a decade ago, has worked to build out the bank’s wealth management business to create a stable revenue and funding source for the bank. In February, the bank announced plans to buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O for $13 billion. reut.rs/2Pa8y7L Earlier this week, the bank said it will expand its full-service wealth management business to Canada. reut.rs/2zYD4wA Despite the costs of these expansions, Gorman has said that the bank’s operating committee unanimously ruled out staff cuts in 2020.

37.28504348350323," Morgan Stanley pays $5 million fine to settle SEC charges it misled investing clients (Reuters) - A unit of Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $5 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it misled retail investing clients about the costs of a “wrap fee” program, the regulator said on Tuesday. Wrap fee programs offer accounts in which clients pay asset-based fees meant to cover investment advice and brokerage services, including the execution of trades. The SEC said that while Morgan Stanley Smith Barney promised wrap fee clients a “transparent” fee structure, some managers sent most or all of their client trades to third party brokers, causing clients to pay extra fees they could not see. “Investment advisers are obligated to fully inform their clients about the fees that clients will pay in exchange for services,” Melissa Hodgman, associate director in the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement. Morgan Stanley oversaw $2.4 trillion of client assets, including $1.13 trillion from fee-based clients, as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing. The alleged wrongdoing occurred from Oct. 2012 to June 2017, and the $5 million will be distributed to harmed investors. Morgan Stanley did not admit or deny wrongdoing. The SEC said the New York-based company now requires wrap managers to disclose more about trades they conduct through third parties, and upgraded client account statements to reflect such trades.

35.25487210057183," Morgan Stanley CEO: coronavirus will continue to pose challenges (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told shareholders on Thursday he ""can promise"" the bank will miss its medium-term financial targets again in the current quarter, as the economic shutdown caused by the novel coronavirus will continue to upend the global and U.S. economy. “We’re in a wild period,” Gorman said on a call with analysts, noting economists predict gross domestic product will fall 30 percent this quarter. “A CEO who stands by their short-term targets that were set right before this virus hit, I don’t know what planet they’re on.” The last of the big U.S. banks to report first-quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley said its profit slumped by 30% and it missed new return targets and cost-cutting goals. The nation’s largest lenders reported sharp declines in profit and higher reserves this week, as they anticipated that the millions people unemployed as a result of the coronavirus will likely struggle to pay loans and credit card bills. Morgan Stanley, which does not have a significant consumer loan business, faired well by comparison. After years of steady growth targets, the bank boosted goals in January, saying it could reach a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of between 13% and 15% in two years. It also set its efficiency ratio at 70% to 72% and pre-tax profit margin for the wealth management business between 28% and 30%. It was far from all three in the first quarter, reporting a 9.7% ROTCE, a 77% efficiency ratio and a 26.1% pre-tax margin in wealth. Gorman said that the bank can “definitely” beat some of those targets by the end of 2021 but said they were set before the downturn. “It would be irresponsible of me to recommit to those targets on this call,” said Gorman, who recently recovered from the illness caused by the coronavirus. “Those targets are not achievable in the second quarter. They weren’t achievable in the first quarter.” Targets aside, the bank’s trading revenue surged 30% in the quarter ended March 31, boosted by high market volatility last month. The returns were led by a 29% jump in bond trading and a 20% rise in equities trading. The robust trading mirrored a similar showings by rivals Goldman Sachs GS.N and JPMorgan JPM.N, both of which clocked double-digit growth in equities and bond trading. However, revenue at Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit, which contributes roughly half of its total revenue, fell 8% to $4.04 billion this quarter, in part because investments associated with employee compensation lost value during the market downturn. These contributed to a roughly $500 million decline in wealth revenue. Advisory revenue fell 11% as dealmaking took a beating in the quarter, with businesses bracing for a massive slowdown in the coming months. Morgan Stanley’s $13 billion deal to buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp also coincided with the spread of the coronavirus, forcing management to justify the buyout to investors. The company said it was on track to close the deal in the fourth quarter. Investment management revenue at Morgan Stanley fell 14% to $692 million, hurt by valuation mark downs on its investment portfolio and lower interest on loans. The bank said earnings attributable to common shareholders fell to $1.59 billion, or $1.01 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
38.4336454324144," UPDATE 3-Morgan Stanley profit plunges, warns of more pain ahead (Recasts, adds comments and outlook from analyst call, background, Breakingviews link) April 16 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman warned that the bank would take “longer to achieve” its medium-term financial targets due to the coronavirus crisis, after its first-quarter profit slumped by 30%. In January, just before the virus started spreading around the world, Gorman boosted the bank’s performance targets and set new goals for cost-cutting, returns on equity and wealth management profits over the next two years and beyond. In the weeks that followed, the pandemic forced sweeping lockdowns, shuttered businesses, left millions jobless and raised fears of a severe recession, prompting Wall Street banks to set aside billions to cover for potential losses. Morgan Stanley said the current economic crisis will push its targets out of its reach and a long-drawn-out crisis could adversely affect its business in the coming quarters. “As long as the duration and scale of the pandemic and economic slowdown remain uncertain, I expect markets will continue to be fragile. The resulting stress on the global economy is real and will take time to recover,” Gorman said on a call. The bank’s results capped a tumultuous quarter of earnings reports from big U.S. lenders, which reported sharp declines in profit and boosted their reserves in anticipation of a wave of loan defaults and non-payment of credit card bills. Morgan Stanley reported a below-target return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) in the first quarter, and Gorman cautioned that the bank probably will not meet them in the next quarter. “It would be irresponsible of me to recommit to those targets on this call. Those targets are not achievable in the second quarter, they weren’t achievable in the first quarter,” said Gorman, who recently recovered from the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Morgan Stanley differs from most of the other big six U.S. banks because it does not have large book of consumer loans and credit card business like JPMorgan Chase, or significant balance sheet investments like those of rival Goldman Sachs . That business mix appeared to work in its favor, as it did not have to set aside massive loan loss provisions. Its robust performance in trading mirrored a similar showing from bigger rivals Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, both of which clocked double-digit growth in equities and bond trading. Trading revenue at Morgan Stanley surged 30%, boosted by wild swings in markets. This was led by a 29% jump in bond trading and a 20% rise in equities trading. However, revenue at Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit, which contributes roughly half to its total revenue, fell 8% to $4.04 billion, as it bore the brunt of the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.

Gorman, 61, started to feel sick in mid-March, he said. After getting tested and confirmed as having COVID-19, he self-isolated at home but did not stop leading regular calls with Morgan Stanley’s operating committee and board of directors, nor did he experience severe symptoms, he said. His disclosure in a 10-minute video emailed to staff is one example of how and when financial firms are choosing to disclose sensitive health information during a global pandemic that has sickened half a million people, upended the global economy, and put banks at the center of relief efforts for any potential recovery. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to disclose material facts to the public, but there is widespread debate about when corporations must disclose information about the health of an executive, corporate governance lawyers said. Last month, Jefferies Financial Group Inc CFO.N disclosed its chief financial officer, Peg Broadbent, died of complications related to the coronavirus. Perella Weinberg Partners LP founding partner Joseph Perella also tested positive for the coronavirus and recovered after treatment, said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the information publicly. A spokeswoman said it is the firm’s policy not comment on the health of its employees. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N disclosed that Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had emergency heart surgery within hours of the event happening last month. Other CEOs – including Juan Domingo Beckmann Legorreta of Jose Cuervo tequila-owner Becle CUERVO.MX, Jeff Shell of Comcast-owned NBC Universal CMCSA.O and Glenn Fogel of online travel agency Booking Holdings – each received diagnoses of coronavirus infections and disclosed them shortly after. Gorman’s staff-wide video was the first time Morgan Stanley shared with anyone beyond the board room and executive suite that its CEO had tested positive for the respiratory disease. It became public knowledge once news outlets including Reuters learned of the message. A CEO of a major global financial firm developing an infection would naturally shake investors, employees and customers, but disclosure for SEC purposes is not always necessary, lawyers said. “There is no specific requirement to disclose when an executive becomes sick, unless the information is material ... such as if the executive is unable to continue to perform even if only temporarily,” said Michael Hermsen, a Chicago-based partner at Mayer Brown, who previously worked in the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance."

The U.S. bank said it had cut its first-quarter forecast to an annualised 3.4% contraction from a previous 2.4%, while in the second quarter the economy is predicted to shrink 38%, up from an earlier forecast of a 30% contraction. U.S. unemployment will also peak at a record 15.7% in the second quarter - that is up from a previous 12.8% forecast by the bank’s economists - with cumulative job losses of 21 million in the second quarter, Morgan Stanley said.

21.947779567972418," Morgan Stanley sees 9% U.S. car sales dip from coronavirus (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N expects the coronavirus outbreak will send U.S. auto sales down 9% this year, it said in an investor note on Wednesday. Before the outbreak, analysts had expected a modest decline of 1-2%. Separately, researcher LMC Automotive said it expects concerns over coronavirus in the United States and other countries could drive global vehicle sales this year down 4% to 86.4 million, from 90.3 million in 2019. LMC previously had expected relatively flat global sales of 90.1 million. In the United States, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas wrote that “demand shock” triggered by the spread of the virus could cause consumers to delay large purchases such as new cars. He predicted U.S. sales could drop to 15.5 million vehicles, from 17.1 million in 2019. LMC dropped its U.S. sales forecast to 16.5 million. Automakers are due to report first-quarter sales in early April. In midday trade, General Motors Co GM.N shares were down 3.5% and Ford Motor Co F.N shares fell 4.2%. The National Automobile Dealers Association in early January had predicted a slight dip in 2020 sales to 16.8 million. In his note, Jonas said coronavirus fears could have a ripple effect on used car sales and on consumer credit. As the virus spreads, it will continue to have a negative impact on the auto industry, said Jeff Schuster, LMC president of global vehicle forecasts, adding, “volatility will remain with us until there is evidence of containment globally, and the lasting effect could spill into 2021.”"
24.350351443324346," UPDATE 1-Morgan Stanley confirms New York employee tests positive for coronavirus (Updates with additional details from memo, context on proximity to New Rochelle) NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley confirmed on Tuesday that an employee at the bank’s campus in Purchase, New York, has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a bank memo obtained by Reuters that was verified by the bank. “Fortunately, the employee was already self-quarantined for some time and is doing well and recovering at home,” the memo stated. The bank is the fourth financial firm to confirm this week that one of its employees has tested positive for the flu-like virus, following similar announcements by Wells Fargo & Co , Barclays Plc and BlackRock Inc. The bank deep-cleaned its office in Purchase, and said that “anyone directly impacted has been notified.” No one else at the bank is being asked to self-quarantine at this time. Last week, Morgan Stanley announced that select groups of sales and trading staff at its New York City office would be asked to work from its Purchase office, which is about 45-minutes north of the city.

The Wall Street bank tested the site, located in Hounslow, earlier this week and is pressing ahead with plans to move part of its trading workforce out of its Canary Wharf base, the sources said. The move comes as global banks take more sweeping steps to contain the spread of the virus in Europe’s biggest financial hub, sending staff home, splitting up trading teams and activating back-up offices. Despite efforts to lobby regulators, banks have yet to receive exemptions to connect trading desks remotely. Trading room compliance - along with complex technology and the need for high-speed connections - means trading desks cannot just be operated remotely. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N was the first bank to activate contingency plans and split its sales and trading staff between central locations in London and New York, and secondary sites in Basingstoke - about 50 miles (80 km) from its London base - and New Jersey. Other banks including Goldman Sachs GS.N and Citi C.N are still testing secondary sites located in the London suburbs of Croydon and Lewisham respectively, and may shift staff in the coming weeks.

On Thursday, Morgan Stanley entered into a deal to buy E*Trade, the biggest acquisition by a major Wall Street bank since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. E*Trade has been the subject of M&A speculation for some time, especially after Charles Schwab Corp said it would buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp last year.

The bank expects to complete the deal by the fourth quarter, and executives expressed confidence that it would meet regulatory approvals."
-22.444542729136167," Morgan Stanley's Gorman charts ambitious course with $13 billion E*Trade deal (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Thursday it would buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp in a stock deal worth about $13 billion, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Part of a broader consolidation in the discount brokerage sector, the move will add breadth to Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit, a business that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has been trying to build out to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking. Morgan Stanley’s main rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, has also been forging ahead with an upstart retail bank, while others including Bank of America Corp and UBS are trying to focus on basic lending and wealth management services. “The addition of E*Trade’s products and iconic brand will serve as a leap forward” for the bank, Gorman said on a call with analysts. The deal reflects a more relaxed regulatory mood under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has helped unleash other big-ticket takeovers in the financial sector. Big banks have been emboldened to do deals that would have been tricky for the Wall Street titans under President Barack Obama’s administration. In March last year, U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp’s purchase of smaller rival MB Financial Inc for $4.7 billion got a nod from regulators. It was followed by approval for a $28 billion marriage of BB&T Corp and SunTrust. “We believe federal regulators are likely to approve Morgan Stanley’s acquisition of E*Trade though the review could take longer than realized as we expect the Federal Reserve to conduct a systemic risk review,” said Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group. Gorman sounded confident that the deal would go through without any regulatory hurdles. “We wouldn’t be entering into this (the deal) if we didn’t think from a regulatory perspective this would be viewed favorably,” said Gorman. The U.S. Federal Reserve did not immediately comment on the deal. Banking deals in particular had languished after the financial crisis as strict capital and liquidity rules were imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets, making it unattractive for mid-size firms to acquire more assets. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Gorman said he had attempted to buy E*Trade twice - in 2002 when he was at Merrill Lynch and then again in 2007 at Morgan Stanley - before re-initiating talks late last year and finally sealing the deal. Since taking over a decade ago, Gorman has pulled off multiple big acquisitions. He orchestrated the bank’s takeover of Smith Barney, making wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue. E*Trade, which became popular nearly two decades ago with commercials that blasted financial advisers for high fees, had been under the gun as the online trading space became more competitive with increased cut-throat pricing. Revenue growth at the brokerage, like at rivals, has taken a hit in recent years from the emergence of digital upstarts called roboadvisers, falling commissions and lower interest rates, prompting consolidation in the sector. Late last year, E*Trade’s biggest rival Charles Schwab Corp agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp for $26 billion. Morgan Stanley will get E*Trade’s more than 5.2 million client accounts and $360 billion of retail client assets, and the brokerage’s CEO, Mike Pizzi, will continue to run the business following the merger. E*Trade shareholders will get 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each share as part of the deal. That translates to $58.74 per share - a premium of 30.7% to the last closing price of E*Trade shares. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020."
-22.444542729136167," Breakingviews - Morgan Stanley beats Goldman to E*Trade punch NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman has stolen a march on David Solomon at Goldman Sachs. His $13 billion all-share deal to buy online brokerage E*Trade Financial gives Morgan Stanley more stable revenue, higher returns and cheaper funding – in short, just what Solomon’s strategy is designed to achieve. Gorman’s dive into retail brokerage comes just weeks after Solomon laid out his own grand plan. Part of that entails cutting the cost of funding by $1 billion, which in turn involves replacing expensive debt with customer deposits. Yet building a retail bank takes time. Goldman’s consumer deposits totaled $60 billion at the end of 2019. Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade deal would add almost that much in one go. Then there’s diversification. Gorman already had a head start after branching into wealth management over a decade ago. Last year, volatile trading income made up around one-third of Morgan Stanley’s total revenue, compared with more than 40% at Goldman. Taking E*Trade’s revenue into account, Morgan Stanley’s reliance on trading would have been around 30%. Buying a giant online broker isn’t without risk. For Morgan Stanley’s 15,000-plus financial advisers, it might feel like inviting cannibals in for dinner – after all, E*Trade and its rivals recently cut trading commissions to zero. But at least the price is reasonable. The $400 million of expected cost savings alone are worth just over $3 billion today, taxed and capitalized. That neatly covers the $3 billion premium in the announced deal – and the cost reductions will boost Morgan Stanley’s return on equity, too. So why didn’t Goldman pounce on E*Trade? At $84 billion as of Wednesday, it’s in the same market-value ballpark as Morgan Stanley. One answer is the bank prefers to build its own businesses, and is focusing on other areas like credit cards and transaction banking. But Solomon also has yet to resolve issues surrounding the bank’s role in Malaysia’s 1MDB corruption scandal, potentially making approval from regulators for a big acquisition more of a hurdle. The window for doing deals may not be open for long. Morgan Stanley expects to own E*Trade by the end of 2020. Soon after, the United States could have a new, less Wall Street-friendly president. There’s probably no better time for Gorman’s move – especially if it puts Solomon on the back foot."

Instead, Goldman's top rival beat it to the punch. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley MS.N said it plans to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O for $13 billion, cementing its position as a hub where individuals manage their finances. If successful, it will be the biggest acquisition by a big Wall Street bank since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. It also underlines Goldman's position as an outlier as the only big U.S. bank to not do any transformative deals during or since that time. Unlike Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N or Bank of America Corp BAC.N, which all executed major transactions during or after the crisis, Goldman looks much the same, analysts say. Instead of opening its own wallet to expand, Goldman is trying to grow a fledgling retail bank, create a treasury-services business, and expand in asset management, corporate lending and trading — largely all from the ground up. Asked about the matter in January, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon dismissed the idea. “We’re not out there looking to buy a big bank,” Solomon told Bloomberg TV. A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on whether Morgan Stanley’s deal affects its own strategy. Goldman was among a litany of financial firms that were rumored as suitors of E*Trade over the past year or so, as the retail trading firm looked for an acquirer.

Morgan Stanley’s stock fell 4.5% on Thursday after announcing the deal. Goldman was down 2%. With Goldman’s stock value weak and with it doing less business with average investors, the E*Trade deal would have been too expensive, said David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors. “Morgan Stanley is better positioned to acquire E*Trade because of its higher stock valuation and more significant cross-over into its network of brokers and workplace assets than Goldman Sachs,” said Hendler. Goldman’s share price as of Thursday’s close was 1.1 times its stated tangible book value as of the fourth quarter compared with 1.3 times tangible book value for Morgan Stanley. Goldman entered the retail space a long time after Morgan Stanley or other U.S. rivals. It purchased $16 billion worth of deposits from a General Electric Co GE.N subsidiary in 2015, and has since bought a few relatively small companies to expand its presence in retail and wealth management: a personal-finance startup called Clarity Money, a retirement platform called Honest Dollar and an investment-advisory firm called United Capital. But none of those deals gave Goldman a big pool of retail deposits or other kinds of businesses that could offset a sharp decline in trading revenue. Michael McTamney, an analyst of big banks and brokers for credit rating service DBRS Morningstar, said Morgan Stanley’s move deal puts more pressure on Goldman. “Goldman Sachs has, historically, been a build-up-themselves organization as opposed to making acquisitions,” McTamney said. Now there will be more questions from investors about whether acquisitions are needed, he said. Associates say that Solomon is staking his legacy on turning Goldman into a global, full-service financial services firm that can compete with rivals. His predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein, has expressed regret about not acquiring during the crisis for the same kind of growth A longtime dealmaker, Solomon became CEO in 2018 and was instrumental in a turnaround plan that preceded his elevation. At Goldman’s first-ever investor day in late January, his management team set ambitious targets to grow the bank’s consumer division over the next five years. Goldman may be able to do that without an acquisition, but a deal would help, said Dick Bove, a senior research analyst at Odeon Capital. “If they acquire a bank, which will bring in low-cost deposits, I think that would be a big plus,” he said. “Goldman, clearly under Blankfein, missed the boat.”"

-22.937184644479764," Morgan Stanley's E*Trade deal to test Washington's regulatory mood in election year WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley’s takeover of brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp reflects a more relaxed regulatory mood in Washington, but it is still a gamble in an election year that will see Democrats continue to shine a spotlight on Wall Street excesses, said analysts. The bank’s CEO James Gorman said on Thursday he expected the $13 billion all stock deal, the largest by a Wall Street giant since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, to be completed by the fourth quarter with little regulatory pushback. His confidence underscores a seismic shift in Washington, where a more industry-friendly tone from President Donald Trump’s regulators has helped unleash other bumper deals in the financial sector. In November, Charles Schwab Corp said it was buying rival TD Ameritrade, in a $26 billion blockbuster deal. That announcement came just days after federal bank regulators approved the $28 billion merger of BB&T Corp and SunTrust into a new firm called Truist Financial Corp in just nine months. But such a bold move by Morgan Stanley, one of the riskiest banks in the United States with roughly $900 billion in assets, will test regulators’ limits during an election year in which Democratic primary candidates are burnishing their bank-bashing credentials. The deal would have to get the green light from the Federal Reserve, and potentially other financial watchdogs. Progressive Democrats say mega-banks put the financial system and consumers at risk, and have called for big lenders to be broken up. “This is not going to be an easy deal to move through the Federal Reserve. Morgan Stanley is a globally significant financial institution, which means any sizable deal is subject to strict review,” said Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group in a note on Thursday. Casting doubt on Gorman’s timeline, Seiberg said the approval process could spill beyond the November election during which time the CEOs of both companies would likely have to justify the deal before Congress. The election also poses a risk to the deal, he added, although terms for some key Fed officials do not expire until 2021. The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the deal. Banking deals languished after the financial crisis due to strict capital and liquidity rules imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets, making it unattractive for mid-size lenders to acquire more assets. Regulators also aggressively enforced rules that allow them to bar firms with compliance issues from expanding. That freeze has thawed in recent years partly because Congress eased some post-crisis constraints in 2018, and partly because Trump-appointed Fed officials have sped up approvals and been more flexible on compliance hurdles. The central bank’s approval period fell from an average of 297 days in 2015 to 135 during the first half of 2019, its data shows. The value of M&A among commercial, savings and investment banks reached $54.66 billion by November, the highest since 2009, according to data from Dealogic. While that bodes well for Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street giant’s size, complexity and push into retail banking poses heightened regulatory and political risk for the deal. Morgan Stanley is among the top five riskiest banks in the United States by some key measures, including short-term wholesale funding needs and leverage, according to U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Research. E*Trade also ranks in the top 20 financial firms in the United States measured by leverage, according to the Treasury’s research. That will likely spark calls from Democrats such as progressive firebrand and presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren for the Fed to block the deal, said analysts. “Any giant Wall Street bank buying a household name company is a tempting talking point for progressive Dem(ocrats),” said Capital Alpha Partners in a note on Thursday, adding though that the Fed is unlikely to bow to that pressure. “They will listen to but probably won’t be swayed by arguments against the deal.”"

-26.94841609011486," Morgan Stanley donates $20 million to children's mental health programs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N said on Monday it will give $20 million to seven nonprofit groups working to prevent youth suicide and fight depression and other children's mental health problems. Calling the initiative the Morgan Stanley Alliance for Children’s Mental Health, the bank aims to recruit other donors to help fund the rapid expansion of the groups in the United States, Britain and Hong Kong. Roughly 17 million people in the United States under age 18 have a mental health disorder, but the vast majority will never receive treatment, said Joan Steinberg, president of Morgan Stanley’s foundation. “We are not going to make a dent in this problem by ourselves,” said Steinberg. “The problem is way bigger than any one us. But we are all hiring these kids when they grow up.” The bank’s grants will substantially increase funding for the Jed Foundation, a U.S. group that works to combat teen suicide, and the Steve Foundation, which promotes mental health and emotional well-being for students of color. Non-profits like these run lean operations, Steinberg said, and the Morgan Stanley grants are among the largest either group has ever received. The Jed Foundation reported total revenues of $8.9 million in 2018, and the Steve Foundation reported $1.15 million, according to tax filings. “Our hope is to bring capital to the table, ours and other groups — private philanthropy, our clients, employees and our (Wall Street) peers,” said Steinberg. Some of the groups will use the money to make their resources available to more communities, she said. For example, Child Mind Institute offers an online symptom checker parents can use to analyze symptoms they recognize in their child for possible psychiatric or learning disorders. The group currently offers the symptom checker in English and Spanish, and they will use the grant money to upgrade all of its online services, which includes health guides and more than 1,000 articles, to also offer them in Spanish. Access to mental health resources is limited for people in Spanish-speaking communities, and poorer and geographically isolated communities, the Child Health Institute said, and they will use the money to make their online tools more useful and applicable to these groups. Other groups that also received grants from the bank include the New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, Mind HK in Hong Kong, Place2Be in London and Scottish Association for Mental health in Glasgow, Scotland."

-22.841014512867268," Morgan Stanley warns coronavirus could drag on global, Chinese GDP growth LONDON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday the coronavirus outbreak in China was likely to hurt global growth in the near-term and could shave up to 1 percentage point off Chinese growth in the first quarter. Assuming the coronavirus peaks in February or March, global economic growth could be reduced by 0.15 to 0.3 percentage point during the first quarter, the bank said. The United States and Japan flew their nationals out of China’s virus epicentre on Wednesday, and some big-name airlines suspended flights, as deaths leapt to 133. “There should be some adverse impact to 1Q20 global growth,” Morgan Stanley said, referring to the first quarter of this year. “But as the underlying drivers of the global recovery remain intact, growth should get back onto the recovery path once the effects of disruption fade.” If the outbreak continues for three to four months, global growth could be further hit by about 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point in the second quarter, it said. Most major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will stay in a dovish holding pattern as they assess the impact of the outbreak, it said. In China, it said travel, entertainment and retail could be most affected and extended factory suspension could weigh on industrial output and trade. If the virus peaks in February or March, first-quarter growth in the world’s second-largest economy could suffer by 0.5 to 1 percentage point, although recovery beyond the period could be intact amid restocking demand and counter-cyclical policy. But if the virus instead peaks in three to four months, first-half Chinese growth could be dragged down by 0.6 to 1.1 percentage points, although that could be partly offset by stronger policy support. China’s A-share market will likely open lower on Feb. 3 after the Lunar New Year holiday and Chinese and Hong Kong equities, as well as other equity markets in North Asia, will likely underperform global and regional benchmarks during the escalation phase of the outbreak, Morgan Stanley said. Still, it said there was no change to its 2020 target levels for the key MSCI China .MICN00000PUS and CS1300 .CSI300 indexes, implying an upside of 1% and 4% respectively from where the markets were trading before the holidays."

Portogallo spent more than three decades at the Wall Street investment bank, and was well liked by colleagues for what one executive described as his tireless work ethic and calm, wise approach to stressful situations. “There is no name more synonymous with the prime brokerage business at Morgan Stanley than Rich Portogallo,” Ted Pick, the bank’s chief of trading and investment banking, said in the memo. Pick wrote that Portogallo’s “humility and calm in the storm” will live on through the “enduring ... personal client relationships” he forged and that the bank now benefits from. Portogallo started at Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage business in 1986, and over two decades made it the industry’s go-to firm for hedge funds and big trading customers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley is usually at or near the top of prime brokerage and equities trading rankings. Prime brokers provide services to hedge funds and other large investors, including help with trading and raising money. Portogallo most recently served as the bank’s global head of institutional equities, clients and services. He is expected to be out of the office by mid-March, according to the memo.

-31.583137781136433," Morgan Stanley CEO Gorman's total 2019 pay falls 7% to $27 million NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N Chief Executive James Gorman is receiving $27 million in total compensation in 2019, nearly 7% less than what he got the year before, the company said in a filing on Friday, following a reduction of bonuses staff-wide. The board, which decides the top executives’ pay, called the 61-year-old’s performance in the year “outstanding” and acknowledged “the firm’s strong financial performance.” The bank’s reported profit jumped 46% to $2.09 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. That kind of out-performance would typically result in the board giving the CEO a big raise. However, a source familiar with the board’s thinking said members also considered the bank’s recent disclosure that it would cut staff and discretionary compensation as it aimed to further reduce expenses. In the bank’s fourth quarter earnings on Thursday it said it was lowering 2019 bonuses staff-wide in an effort to offset a 7% increase in other compensation expenses. Morgan Stanley also disclosed it paid $172 million in severance packages to terminated employees, many of whom worked at the investment bank and trading business. The bank said in December that it would cut about 1,500 employees, or roughly 2% of its global workforce.(reut.rs/2qAtgES) Gorman’s compensation is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a cash bonus of $6.375 million; a deferred equity award of $6.375 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $12.75 million. The board again required that 75% of Gorman’s incentive compensation be deferred over three years subject to a claw-back, and for all of that compensation to be paid in the form of equity in the company."

-31.587964028995795," Morgan Stanley shares soar after Gorman boosts performance targets (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N lifted its performance goals on Thursday after beating Wall Street estimates by a wide margin, the latest sign that Chief Executive James Gorman's strategic vision for the bank is bearing fruit. In a presentation, Morgan Stanley set the bar higher for expense controls, returns on equity and wealth management profits over the next two years and beyond. Analysts cheered the new targets, after repeatedly asking management when Morgan Stanley might upgrade them, since the bank was routinely meeting previous goals. Investors cheered the news, with Morgan Stanley shares up 7%. The bank posted its presentation after reporting a fourth-quarter profit beat that showed most of its businesses flourishing. Bond trading, underwriting and investment management each produced much higher revenue, with M&A advisory being the only area to report a meaningful decline. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit jumped 46%, to $2.09 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.36 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. (reut.rs/37b9508) Analysts had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The bank’s net revenue rose 27% to $10.9 billion. It set new records for annual profit and revenue, and met or exceeded full-year performance targets Gorman laid out last January. Since taking over a decade ago, the 61-year-old CEO has transformed Morgan Stanley from a Wall Street firm heavily weighted in money-losing trading businesses into a more balanced bank. He was the driving force behind Morgan Stanley’s decision to acquire Smith Barney, and made wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue. Morgan Stanley's stock has risen about 79% during Gorman's tenure, while the S&P 500 Banks index .SPXBK and S&P 500 .SPX have nearly tripled. During an analyst call on Thursday, Gorman described the first five years of his tenure as a clean-up period after the financial crisis, and the second five as a time when he focused on growing businesses without sacrificing profitability. Gorman noted that Morgan Stanley’s wealth business now generates about three times as much daily revenue as it did five years ago, and its securities business has snatched market share from rivals at a time when industry revenue has shrunk. (For a graphic on Morgan Stanley's institutional securites revenue, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2TrH94a) ‘TRANSFORMED’ BUSINESS “We have meaningfully and with intent transformed this business into what it is today,” he said. “As we execute on the next phase of the firm’s journey, the objectives listed here, assuming a normal market environment, should result as a natural consequence.” Over the next two years, Gorman wants Morgan Stanley to hit an efficiency ratio of 70-72%. Over the long-term, he is hoping the bank can get to 70% or less. That metric, which measures costs relative to revenue, is watched closely by investors as a symbol of whether a company spends wisely. Morgan Stanley met its prior goal of 73% or less in 2019. Keeping costs under control will help the bank reach another metric Gorman set for returns on equity (ROE), which shows how profitably a bank uses shareholder funds. Morgan Stanley now aims to produce ROE of 13-15% through 2022, and 15-17% after that. Its 11.7% ROE last year was within Gorman’s prior targeted range of 10-13%. Finally, he now wants the wealth unit to generate a pre-tax profit margin of 28-30% over the next two years, and 30% or more after that. The business’s 27.2% margin last year was comfortably within the prior goal of 26-28%. On the call, some analysts probed the assumptions behind those figures, asking what might happen if markets collapse. On the other hand, Wells Fargo’s Mike Mayo - who has repeatedly pressed management to raise targets - asked why they should not be higher. Gorman recalled a time when analysts were skeptical that Morgan Stanley could achieve much lower goals he had set, when its ROE was just 2-4% and its wealth margins were only 10%. He compared them to children in the back of a car asking, “When are we going to get there?” “What I’ve always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances,” he said. “The top of the range is obviously a little more sporty.” Morgan Stanley is the last of the major U.S. banks to report results this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N posting similar trends in their Wall Street businesses. However, its performance came in a stark contrast to its closest rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, which reported a profit decline on Thursday. Goldman is now in the middle of its own strategic turnaround, expanding into areas like consumer banking and corporate cash management to make profits less volatile."

-33.179257836769," Morgan Stanley restarts its base metals business: sources LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley is building up its base metals trading business after abandoning it four years ago, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The move comes as rising volumes and volatility in industrial metals have boosted revenues for investment banks after years of lackluster market conditions. Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest investment banks, has hired around four people in London including Daniel Levene from rival JPMorgan and Ryan McCartney from trading house Trafigura and plans to add more staff, the sources said. It will focus on market making and services for clients such as hedging, the sources said. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The bank closed its base metals trading desks around the end of 2015 as part of a plan to cut up to 25 percent of jobs in its fixed income and commodities division, Reuters reported at the time. It remains a Category 2 or Associate Broker Clearing member of the London Metal Exchange, the world’s largest and oldest platform for the trade of metals. According to consultancy Coalition, higher income from base metals helped drive a 45 percent increase in commodities-related revenue last year at the 12 biggest investment banks, of which Morgan Stanley is one."

After Kelleher’s departure was announced, Gorman had said co-presidents could be named, but no appointments have been made yet. Internally, potential successors include Ted Pick, who has Colm’s old job of running institutional securities, and Andy Saperstein, who runs wealth management. Gorman also said the U.S. Federal Reserve should hold rates steady and sounded confident about the health of the consumer, which had helped buoy reut.rs/2tbw785 big banks' third-quarter earnings.

AMF said the fine related to manipulating the price of 14 French government bonds (OAT) and 8 Belgian bonds (OLO) on June 16 2015, and also of an OAT futures contract. AMF had noted a large sale of government bonds on June 16, 2015 disrupted the French MTS Global Market bond trading system, causing transactions to be suspended for four minutes and liquidity levels to drop for about an hour. Morgan Stanley said it intended to lodge an appeal. “The activities in question were undertaken in accordance with market practice and as part of the firm’s role and obligations as a market maker,” the bank said in a statement. AMF said on June 16 at 0920 local time Morgan Stanley International, located in London, had ""aggressively purchased"" futures in French, German and Belgian debt on Eurex, the derivatives exchange of Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE. At 0944 local time on the same day the U.S. bank’s European Governments Bonds and Agencies Desk instantaneously sold 815 million euros ($898.29 million) worth of 17 different government bonds on MTS France and Broker Tec platforms, as well as via MTS Belgium. The watchdog said that Morgan Stanley fixed prices on some of the bonds at abnormal and artificial levels, citing high volumes negotiated by traders and the fact that the bank’s large trade had the biggest positive impact on the futures prices that day. AMF also said Morgan Stanley had said that price variations were “normal” given the volumes traded and that they were mainly due to the exceptional circumstances of June 16, 2015. The watchdog also said Morgan Stanley had said the acquisition of futures on French government debt was part of a move to “unwind a deficit position” and that there was no motivation to impact the pricing. Morgan Stanley is one of 15 primary dealers for French government bonds which are expected ensure the liquidity of the secondary market in French treasury securities, according to the French treasury."

-23.898983701128202," Brent to revert to $60 per barrel by mid-2020 despite OPEC cuts: Morgan Stanley (Reuters) - OPEC and allied oil producers’ plan to deepen cuts through the first quarter of next year will support the market only in the short-term, while Brent crude prices are likely to revert to $60 per barrel by mid-2020, Morgan Stanley said. The bank cut its 2020 OPEC production forecast by 0.4 million barrels per day (bpd) to 29.2 million bpd after oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut output in the first quarter of 2020 but stopped short of pledging action beyond March. “The recent additional cuts are clearly positive in the short-term, but the fact they are needed also emphasizes the softness in underlying fundamentals,” the bank said in a note dated Dec. 6. Despite the cuts, the bank expects non-OPEC supply to grow by about 1.8 million bpd next year, with the U.S. monthly production growth rate of 50,000 bpd, slower than what was reported in 2018 and 2019. The bank expects a modest oversupply into next year, even as the demand is expected to re-accelerate with some support from the upcoming IMO 2020 rules. New regulations from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) require shippers to reduce the sulphur content in fuels used in their vessels starting January. Brent futures were down 0.3% at $64.18 per barrel, as of 0558 GMT on Monday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures were down 0.5% at $58.91 per barrel. Morgan Stanley sees Brent oil prices at $62.50 per barrel in the first quarter, but lowered its forecasts to $60 for the rest of 2020. WTI prices are expected to hold at $57.5 per barrel in the first quarter, and at $55 for the rest of the year."
-6.7630868284094925," Ex-Morgan Stanley developers launch high-speed cryptocurrency derivatives exchange NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of former software developers from Morgan Stanley announced on Wednesday the launch of a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange called Phemex that aims to execute trades in less than a millisecond for both retail and institutional investors. Jack Tao, an 11-year executive with Morgan Stanley where he was the global development leader of the investment bank’s Electronic Trading (MSET) Benchmark Execution Strategies (BXS), co-founded the company. He resigned from Morgan Staley in July. Tao has assembled a team of more than 30 senior developers, including eight former executives from Morgan Stanley’s BES and enterprise application infrastructure teams. “The internet has made it possible to communicate and transfer information,” Tao told Reuters in a phone interview. So a public blockchain enables instant transfer of value.” The platform has been in the beta testing phase for several weeks and commenced trading on Nov. 25, Tao said. The exchange can manage 300,000 transactions per second, and can deliver an order entry and response time of less than 1 millisecond, Tao said. Phemex offers up to 100 times leverage to both retail and institutional investors in bitcoin, ethereum and XRP contracts, Tao said. Contracts will soon be able to be backed by not only crypto assets, but also by traditional financial products, such as stock indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, metals and energy, for users to trade easily and with trust, he added. The Phemex top official also noted that existing crypto derivative trading platforms have been hampered by performance and reliability issues, especially during high-volume trading periods such as bitcoin’s mid-June $10,000 price surge. The former Morgan Stanley developers have also built their own cold wallet system, which assigns an independent deposit address to each user, so that all assets are kept in cold wallets, or offline, Phemex said in a statement.

10.18891254658966," Morgan Stanley pushes advisers to boost revenue in 2020 pay plan: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N told financial advisers on Tuesday that they could be paid less if they do not generate more revenue or get customers to sign up for comprehensive financial plans next year, people familiar with the bank's 2020 compensation plan said. Morgan Stanley made several changes to the incentive structure, including its 16-tier “pay-out grid” that determines what percentage of fees and commissions brokers get to take home. Some brokers who generate less than $5 million in annual revenue will have to deliver another 10% to reach the payout they received in 2019, according to material reviewed by Reuters. For instance, someone who was generating toward the low end of $300,000-$360,000 revenue tier this year will need to generate a figure in the range of $330,000-$400,000 next year to get the same payout. The rates range from 28% of commissions and fees at the lowest tier to 55.5% at the highest. Advisers generating above $5 million will not see any change. Other features of the plan incentivize advisers to target wealthier customers, grow their asset books and lend more. It will also pay them less for households that do not enroll in a comprehensive financial plan or have less than $100,000 in assets and liabilities with the bank. The changes underline themes Morgan Stanley and other big wealth managers have been pushing for years in terms of the types of clients and advisers they want associated with their firms. The 2020 compensation plan could affect as much as half of Morgan Stanley’s advisers, said compensation consultant Andy Tasnady of Tasnady & Associates. As of Sept. 30, that headcount stood at 15,553, down from more than 18,000 a decade ago. The pay-out grid is closely watched by advisers, especially those in lower tiers. Tasnady compared the grid to a flight of stairs. “They basically raised the heights of all the stairs,” he said. “If you do the same thing you did last year, there will be many people who get a payout that is one step lower.” (In third paragraph, corrects that pay changes will only affect some brokers, not all)"

AOC “does not intend to accept the offer”, PNE said in its reasoned opinion on the offer, in which it comes out in favour of the bid, which runs until Nov. 28, and recommends shareholders accept it. PNE said its management and supervisory board saw the bid as an appropriate reflection of “the value of the company at the present time – i.e. also taking into account the current overall regulatory, geopolitical and macro-economic situation”. AOC, which holds a 5.07% stake in PNE, was not immediately available for comment. The investor had brought about a strategic overhaul at German generic drugmaker Stada STAGn.DE that culminated in the group's later takeover. The decision not to tender comes as resistance against the bid from Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners is gathering momentum, with top 10 shareholder ENKRAFT having long opposed the 306 million euro bid. “The reasoned opinion by the management and supervisory board of PNE lacks any substantive detail and level of necessary professional duty of care,” ENKRAFT said in a preliminary assessment of the reasoned opinion seen by Reuters.

21.864840354110058," Morgan Stanley elbows out rivals for plum role in $1.5 billion IPO relaunch: sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N has usurped rivals including Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs to lead the relaunch of a $1.45 billion IPO - Hong Kong's second-largest this year - in an unusually brutal shuffling of banks' roles on a big deal. The Wall Street bank was approached by ESR Cayman 1821.HK and its main backer, Warburg Pincus, in August to develop a rescue plan for ESR's initial public offering (IPO), according to two sources involved in the transaction, after the industrial property investor was forced to pull its original planned float in June. The sources declined to be identified because the discussions were not public. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, CLSA, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the shuffling of banks working on the deal. Warburg Pincus and ESR also declined to comment. Banks worldwide jostle fiercely for top billing on IPOs, decided by which ones are listed at the top and which are listed first, or to the left, of each category. Position matters for publicity as well as league-table credit - and is usually reflected in the fees each bank will take. Although Morgan Stanley had no role in the first IPO attempt, it has usurped its rivals and is now leading the relaunched offering as the so-called ‘lead left’ JGC. “It’s very rare to see a bank not working on a deal at first get a senior role as JGC (joint global coordinator) - not to mention in ESR’s case, the new bank is actually leading the relaunched deal,” said one senior equity capital banker not involved in this transaction. The top-ranked banks in a Hong Kong IPO are known as sponsors, who carry legal liability for the accuracy of the prospectus. Under them are joint global coordinators. The bottom rung are joint bookrunners (JBRs), who collect orders from would-be investors but do not usually play a bigger role. “It’s certainly not common in the Hong Kong IPO market,” said one source involved in the transaction. “Several existing banks couldn’t sell the deal as well as the issuer and its main backer expected, due to the high target valuation last time.” The June deal was led by Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and CLSA as the lead sponsors with Citigroup C.N, Credit Suisse CSGN.S, DBS DBSM.SI and Goldman Sachs GS.N listed as joint global coordinators. This time however Morgan Stanley is leading investor meetings for the deal in London on Wednesday, continuing a roadshow which has already taken in Singapore and Hong Kong and will head to New York on Thursday. Only Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts are producing research on the deal - typically also a sign of which banks are leading the transaction. Both Deutsche Bank and CLSA retain their official roles as sponsors because changing sponsors would have involved restarting the entire IPO application process, said two sources. While Deutsche Bank is also still listed as a JGC, CLSA has been dropped to a bookrunner role. ESR Cayman made the decision to pull its deal in June on the day it was due to price, citing “market conditions”. Sources at the time told Reuters that the company had targeted a relatively aggressive valuation that had made the deal a hard sell in volatile markets. [nL4N23K1LK] “ESR and Warburg Pincus were not happy with some of the banks and wanted to kick some of them out last time. But to have a smooth relaunch of the deal as soon as possible, they have brought in Morgan Stanley and kept these banks,” said the same source involved in the deal. In its second attempt, ESR is seeking to sell shares worth up to $1.45 billion, giving it a market capitalisation of as much as $6.74 billion - the same as it sought in June."
33.38641172191143," Morgan Stanley executives offer cautious outlook after profit beat (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N reported a higher-than-expected profit on Thursday, bolstered by strength in bond trading and M&A advisory, but executives were careful not to sound too optimistic about the rest of the year. Like other big banks, Morgan Stanley had to navigate falling interest rates, volatile markets and recession signals during the third quarter, and fared relatively well. Its overall profit rose 3%, topping Wall Street expectations by a healthy margin. However, the factors that created such a difficult operating environment during the quarter have not gone away, Chief Executive James Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said on a call to discuss earnings. They suggested the trade dispute between the United States and China, further central bank easing, an unknown Brexit outcome and other geopolitical tensions could pressure results further. Although Gorman said the fourth quarter was “off to a good start,” that could change. “We remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rates continue to be debated,” Gorman said. Although Pruzan said CEO confidence has remained high, it is unclear whether companies that are planning initial public offerings will proceed. Morgan Stanley led some of this year’s biggest IPOs, but signs of a possible downturn have slowed activity. “Conversion from pipeline to realized remains highly dependent on market conditions,” he said. During the quarter, Morgan Stanley swallowed heavy losses from stakes in companies that went public. Investment revenue plummeted to $33 million from $340 million. Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley shares were up 2.7% in afternoon trading, with analysts celebrating the results. The bank beat KBW’s revenue forecasts in each business line, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note to clients. Overall, Morgan Stanley’s profit rose to $2.2 billion, or $1.27 per share, from $2.1 billion, or $1.17 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue inched up to $10 billion from $9.9 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.11 per share on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The sixth-largest U.S. bank capped three days of results from Wall Street heavyweights. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Citigroup Inc C.N also topped expectations, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N disappointed. Sales and trading revenue rose 10% to $3.5 billion. Gains came from a 21% jump in bond trading as equities trading fell slightly compared to a year ago. Morgan Stanley typically ranks No. 1 in equities trading, but after years of market-share gains it has been facing tougher competition lately. Its investment banking business, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, posted a 5% rise in revenue to $1.5 billion. Wealth management’s $4.4 billion in revenue was down 1% from a year ago. That business has been a stabilizing force for Morgan Stanley during volatile times. The business is trying to add new clients in Asia and lend to them more, Gorman said. Morgan Stanley’s loan book grew 8% rise in the third quarter, but net interest income stayed flat due to declining rates. In investment management, its smallest business, Morgan Stanley reported a 17% rise in revenue, to $764 million. Gorman complimented Morgan Stanley’s trading and investment banking businesses for being resilient in a shaky quarter, and said management is focused on keeping the bank stable and prosperous over the long term. “There remains tremendous upside here,” he said."

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “we have a great new Brexit deal,” lifting the mood across global equities, while he is yet to receive approval for the agreement in a vote at a session of the British parliament on Saturday. “Although, the agreement reached between the U.K. and EU needs to be approved by the British parliament, the headline news coupled with U.S. earnings should boost market sentiment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in a client note. Netflix Inc shares jumped 8% in premarket trading, after the video streaming service provider added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley gained 3.6% after the big lender beat analysts’ expectations for quarterly profit, buoyed by higher revenue from bond trading and M&A advisory fees. This followed upbeat results earlier in the week from major U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America and healthcare giants Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group Inc. “So far so good. Definitely the bank earnings have been terrific, relative to expectations,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. Also supporting sentiment was the Chinese Commerce Ministry saying it hoped to reach a phased agreement in a protracted trade dispute with the United States and cancel tariffs as soon as possible. Rising uncertainties around the U.S.-China trade war, increasing geopolitical risks and weak domestic economic indicators have recently hit sentiment, with investors now focusing on third-quarter earnings for clarity on these factors impacting Corporate America. Analysts are expecting S&P 500 third-quarter earnings to fall by 3%, which would mark the first year-on-year contraction since the earnings recession that ended in 2016. However, of the 43 S&P 500 companies to have posted quarterly results so far, 86% have beaten expectations. At 8:34 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 64 points, or 0.24%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 8.25 points, or 0.28% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 30.5 points, or 0.38%. Among other stocks, International Business Machines Corp slipped 6% after it missed quarterly revenue estimates due to weakness in its global technology services unit.

33.38641172191143," US STOCKS-Futures rise on Brexit deal; Netflix, Morgan Stanley earnings adds to cheer (For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Futures up: Dow 0.27%, S&P 500 0.28%, Nasdaq 0.33% Oct 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a higher open on Thursday, after Britain struck a preliminary last-minute deal with the European Union helping to ease some geopolitical jitters, while upbeat earnings from Netflix and Morgan Stanley affirmed a strong start to the reporting season. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “we have a great new Brexit deal,” lifting the mood across global equities, while he is yet to receive approval for the agreement in a vote at a session of the British parliament on Saturday. “Although, the agreement reached between the U.K. and EU needs to be approved by the British parliament, the headline news coupled with U.S. earnings should boost market sentiment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in a client note. Netflix Inc shares jumped 8.7% in premarket trading, after the video streaming service provider added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley gained 4% after the big lender beat analysts’ expectations for quarterly profit, buoyed mainly by a strong performance in its trading business. This followed upbeat results earlier in the week from major U.S. lenders JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America and healthcare giants Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group Inc. The mood was also lifted after the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it hoped to reach a phased agreement in a protracted trade dispute with the United States and cancel tariffs as soon as possible. Rising uncertainties around the U.S.-China trade war, increasing geopolitical risks and weak domestic economic indicators have recently hit sentiment, with investors now focusing on third-quarter earnings for clarity on these factors impacting Corporate America. Analysts are expecting S&P 500 third-quarter earnings to fall by 3%, which would mark the first year-on-year contraction since the earnings recession that ended in 2016. However, of the 43 S&P 500 companies to have posted quarterly results so far, 86% have beaten expectations. At 7:12 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 73 points, or 0.27%. S&P 500 e-minis rose 8.25 points, or 0.28% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 26.5 points, or 0.33%. Among other stocks, International Business Machines Corp slipped 5% after it missed quarterly revenue estimates due to weakness in its global technology services unit.

28.144075493922678," PNE AG agrees to takeover by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's PNE AG PNEGn.DE has agreed to a takeover offer from Morgan Stanley Infrastructure (MSIP) which values the wind energy project developer at 300 million euros ($330 million), it said on Thursday, drawing criticism from a top shareholder. The fund said it intends make an offer worth 4 euros a share, a 31% premium to when their talks were announced on Aug. 26, subject to receiving over 50% acceptance. It plans to delist the company after completion. MSIP had said it could offer 3.50-3.80 euros per share, but increased its bid after other suitors began conducting due diligence on PNE. PNE had caught the eye of Australia's Macquarie MQG.AX, Swedish private equity firm EQT EQTAB.ST and Canadian energy group Oryx OXC.TO, people familiar with the matter said. PNE shares were up 4.0% at 4.02 euros at 0920 GMT. They have risen about 65% this year. But PNE shareholder ENKRAFT Capital, which holds a 2.7% stake, said the offer significantly undervalued PNE given its development pipeline and prospects in the global renewables market. “PNE’s management and supervisory board seem to primarily want to help Morgan Stanley to secure an attractive transaction,” said Benedikt Kormaier, managing director of ENKRAFT. “In particular, the threat of a delisting of the shares post the offer is an attempt by the management board to get rid of existing shareholders cheaply.” PNE has a pipeline of onshore wind projects of nearly 5 gigawatts (GW). It trades at just 3.3 times core earnings while larger peer Encavis HWAG.DE trades at 11.2 times. ENKRAFT, which is being advised by Frankfurt-based 7Square, previously said it would back a special audit should the company not run a fair and transparent M&A process."

26.70823635532564," WeWork IPO failure a critical signal for markets: Morgan Stanley (Reuters) - WeWork’s failure to go public is a critical turning point for markets that signals the end of “the days of endless capital for unprofitable businesses,” Morgan Stanley Equity Strategist Michael Wilson says. He said in a note to clients dated Sept. 29 that it is reminiscent of other corporate events that marked the top of secular trends in the past 20 years. Morgan cited three: United Airlines’ failed leveraged buyout in October 1989, which effectively ended the LBO craze of the 1980s; the AOL-Time Warner merger in 2000, which indicated the dot com bubble was coming to a close; and JPMorgan Chase’s takeunder of the failed Bear Stearns investment bank in 2008, which signaled the end of the financial excesses of the previous few years. “It was one heck of a run, but paying extraordinary valuations for anything is a bad idea, particularly for businesses that may never generate a positive stream of cash flows,” he wrote. Getting back to a more disciplined mindset was a good thing, Wilson said, adding that some publicly traded stocks “still need to fall back to earth.” This downward adjustment was already happening and may not have much further to go, he said, but noted that these stocks also will come roaring back. WeWork’s parent, The We Company, on Monday filed to withdraw its IPO a week after the SoftBank-backed office-sharing startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its CEO. The scrapping of the IPO marks the conclusion of a tumultuous few weeks for the firm, which failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out short-term space."
20.327488961997243," Bank of America, Morgan Stanley eye growth in employee-benefits management NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N are expanding the employee-benefits services they offer, hoping to gain market share in the dull-but-reliable business of managing wealth for companies and employees. The banks, which operate the two biggest U.S. wealth management firms, are focused on different parts of the benefits business, executives told Reuters. But both strategies create opportunities for the firms to market to younger and middle-class clients. Morgan Stanley is building on its $850 million purchase of Solium Capital, which manages employee stock plans for some 3,400 companies and 2.7 million employees. Morgan Stanley has renamed it Shareworks and is looking to roll out deferred compensation management, health savings accounts and student loan refinancing. The firm is also considering partnering with a payroll company. Meanwhile, Bank of America has focused on retirement services, with significant growth in its 401(k)s and health service accounts businesses. The bank now manages plans for about 30,000 companies covering 5 million people. It ranked No. 7 on PlanSponsor.com’s annual list of 401(k) record-keepers by assets last year, three notches higher than in 2017. The two banks typically cater to older, wealthy families. By providing wealth services to companies, they hope to start relationships with young workers that could develop into one-on-one wealth management relationships later. The investments Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are making in workplace benefits services reflect the global banking industry’s shift toward steadier, fee-driven businesses to offset a secular decline in trading revenue since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. However, the business has become more competitive in recent years. Fidelity, Vanguard and TIAA are consistently ranked as the top three employee-benefits providers, and Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N and E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O have substantial stock plan businesses. Companies only consider changing financial institutions about once a decade, and retirement products are fairly standardized, leaving little incentive to switch. Combined with a push to reduce investor fees and the hefty expense of operating an employee-benefits operation at scale, it could be hard for Morgan Stanley and Bank of America to succeed, analysts said. “This is a very fee-sensitive industry,” said Anastasia Krymkowski, an associate director at research firm Cerulli Associates specializing in retirement. “It’s an even bigger deal in 401(k) plan management because you have this idea of being a good fiduciary.” Nonetheless, executives at the two banks told Reuters in separate interviews that they see opportunity to grow revenues and gain clients through these businesses. Bank of America believes it can pick up clients left behind by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, which both quit the 401(k) business in recent years. And Morgan Stanley bought the most popular software platform for employee stock plans, making it difficult for rivals to compete. Morgan Stanley has added 200 new corporate clients since the acquisition and estimates that, overall, employees on Shareworks’ platform have $1.5 trillion in other accounts. Executives predict that, over the next decade, they can turn hundreds of thousands of employees into customers of the firm’s robo-adviser or its full-service brokerage. “It creates value for the employer, the employee and creates a new source of potential clients for us,” said Jed Finn, chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley’s wealth unit. Analysts said revenues earned from Shareworks will be minimal in the near-term but later could create substantial business. Bank of America’s strategy to market a full suite of employee benefit products, including 401(k)s, equity compensation plans and health savings accounts, to existing clients in other parts of the bank also makes it money now. Bank of America added nearly 3,000 corporate clients to its institutional retirement business in 2018, up about 50% from the prior year. So far this year, it has added another 2,190 of them. That includes 401(k)s, HSAs, employee stock and defined benefit plans. “The vast amount of wins come from existing clients,” said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America’s global head of commercial banking. Still, only about 10% of Bank of America’s corporate clients use its retirement services, presenting the bank with an opportunity, Borthwick said. The institutional retirement business is hiring more retirement specialists to help pitch these products. “Getting a company to turn on a 401(k) or a stock plan administration takes time,” said Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI. “The good news is that they already have relationships with their target market customer and now it is up to them to convince them.”"

16.408410634432993," Turkish banks tap Morgan Stanley for Turk Telekom stake sale ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Three Turkish banks said on Thursday they had mandated Morgan Stanley MSMSI.UL as financial adviser for the sale of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that holds a 55% stake in Turk Telekom TTKOM.IS, sending the company's shares up. The three banks, Garanti BBVA GARAN.IS, Is Bank ISCTR.IS and Akbank AKBNK.IS, said in December that Turk Telekom shares previously held by Ojer Telekom (OTAS) had been moved to a special purpose vehicle, called Levent Yapilandirma Yonetimi. They said the main goal in the process is to transfer the shares to a “competent” investor. “Morgan Stanley...has been mandated as financial adviser for (the) sale of Levent Yapilandirma Yonetimi or its 55% stake in Turk Telekom,” the banks said in separate identical statements. They said the required steps for the process and sale negotiations with potential buyers would begin. Turk Telekom shares were up 4.24% at 1509 GMT. OTAS, a unit of the Dubai-based Oger Telecom, had taken out a $4.75 billion loan in 2013 to acquire a 55% stake in Turk Telekom. But it failed to keep up payments on what at the time was Turkey’s largest corporate loan. Many Turkish companies are currently facing the formidable task of repaying foreign currency loans while raising revenues in lira TRYTOM=D3, which lost some 30% of its value against the dollar last year. The currency was hit by a sharp sell-off last year sparked by worries about President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and deteriorating ties between Ankara and Washington."

Holding onto the No. 1 spot, Morgan Stanley advised 19 companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N and United Technologies Corp UTX.N, in the first half of 2019. A year ago, when activists launched more campaigns overall, Morgan Stanley counseled 23 companies in the first six months of 2018.

23.458601104319232," Morgan Stanley cuts 2019 oil prices outlook on demand, growth concerns (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has lowered its oil price forecasts for the rest of the year citing a weaker economic outlook, faltering demand and higher shale growth that could offset OPEC’s efforts to support the market. “The slowdown in oil demand growth that started in early 2019 has not come to an end yet,” the bank said in a note published on Tuesday. “Demand growth has softened as global economic growth has slowed.” The U.S. bank cut its 2019 Brent price forecast to $60 per barrel from $65, and cut its WTI outlook for the third and fourth quarters of this year to $55 from $58 previously. It also lowered its 2019 oil demand growth outlook to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 1 million bpd, and its 2020 forecast to 1 million bpd from 1.4 million bpd. “More cuts would be required in 2020 if Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were to balance the market. Much depends on demand growth next year, but on our current estimates the ‘call on OPEC’ is about 1 million bpd below current production in 2020,” analysts said. Crude oil prices have fallen about 20% from 2019 highs hit in April, in part due to an escalating trade war between the United States and China, which is seen hurting the global economy and in turn, demand for oil. Other banks have also flagged risks to oil demand growth due to economic uncertainties. Last month, Barclays cut its oil price forecasts for the second half of this year and 2020, saying it expected slower demand growth due to a weaker-than-expected global macroeconomic backdrop."

Huaxin Securities signed an equity transfer contract on Aug. 1 to move the 2% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities to the U.S. bank, according to a statement dated Aug. 2 filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange by Huaxin's parent, Shanghai China Fortune Co 600621.SS. Morgan Stanley, which currently owns 49% of the JV, was the only bidder, the filing said. An unnamed buyer will pay 376.2 million yuan ($54.24 million) for the 2% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, according to a separate notice on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange website dated Aug. 1. The transfer still has to be approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the JV’s business registration license must be changed by the Ministry of Commerce to reflect its foreign ownership, the filing added. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, whose offerings include underwriting and sponsoring of stock and bond sales, told the CSRC earlier this year about plans to change its equity holdings, Reuters reported in June, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. The outcome of Sino-U.S. trade talks could, however, impact the approval timeline, the people said at that time, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss regulatory matters with media. U.S. President Donald Trump vowed, on Thursday, to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, escalating the bruising trade war between the world’s largest economies and jolting financial markets. If the transfer is approved, Morgan Stanley will join rivals HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T and UBS Group AG UBSG.S in owning controlling stakes in onshore securities JVs in China under liberalized rules announced in 2017. Lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for Wall Street banks, and became a key issue in Washington’s push to persuade Beijing to open up its market for wider foreign participation. Management control would allow foreign banks, including Morgan Stanley, to offer more services through their JVs and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share, bankers have previously said."

-0.9667188617132946," Morgan Stanley reports drop in profit, but wealth management gains (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N reported a drop in quarterly profit Thursday, hit by lower market activity amid global trade tensions and expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts. It was the last big U.S. bank to report earnings in a quarter that exposed weaknesses in Wall Street’s investment bank and trading businesses. But Morgan Stanley executives downplayed the toll rate cuts could have on profitability and highlighted growth in the bank’s wealth management unit. The wealth business, which contributes 44% of Morgan Stanley’s revenue, rose 1.9% to $4.40 billion from a year earlier. The unit benefited both from higher stock prices and more lending to customers. That more than offset the effects of lower interest rates. The bank reported pre-tax profit margin of 28.2% for the business, just above the high end of its 26% to 28% target. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman placed a huge bet on wealth manager nearly a decade ago as a source of stable revenue. Lower interest rates can squeeze a bank’s net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for deposits and earns from loans. But Morgan Stanley officials said they expected net interest income for the third quarter to remain in line with 2018 at roughly $1.1 billion. “What drives the numbers is not just net interest income,” said Gorman on a call with analysts. “We have some other businesses over here and some of these businesses are chugging along quite nicely.” Still, Morgan Stanley's sales and trading revenue fell 12% in the second quarter, with both bond and equity trading seeing a dip. By comparison, main rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N on Tuesday reported a drop in revenue from bond trading but higher equities trading. Concerns about up to three rate cuts this year weighed on bank earnings throughout the week and caused rival JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N to lower its projected net interest margin for the year. Morgan Stanley does not report this metric, but Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said interest rate cuts would crimp margins in the wealth business. What it would do to the rest of the bank’s business, he said, is less clear. “What it does to our fixed income business and our equity business is really a function of how people interpret the cut,” Pruzan said. “If it improves people’s view of the world that we’re going to extend the economic expansion and people want to press that view in the equity markets, it could ... help.” Equity sales and trading net revenues fell 14% in the second quarter from a year earlier. Revenue from investment banking, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, fell 13%, helping push the bank’s total revenue down to $10.2 billion. The bank said earnings attributable to Morgan Stanley fell to $2.20 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $2.44 billion, or $1.30 per share, a year ago. Non-interest expenses fell 2% to $7.34 billion, helped by lower compensation costs. The bank beat analysts profit expectations of $1.14 per share. Its stock was up 0.4 percent at $43.95."

On Friday AB InBev called off the Hong Kong listing of its Asia Pacific brewing business, that was being managed by Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, citing several factors, including prevailing market conditions. A further 11 banks were listed as global coordinators and bookrunners but Goldman had no role on the deal. In the internal email sent as the deal was faltering on Friday, the Goldman banker told colleagues they needed to call clients “as soon as possible” to reassure them that a collapsed deal did not mean markets were closed. “MS is the only bank to have played a lead role on the two largest postponed HK IPOs in past decade,” said the email, sent to investment bankers in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. “GS has successfully led 26 jumbo Hong Kong IPOs above US$1bn as Sponsor since 2010, more than any other bank on the Street (MS 19, JPM 15),” the email said. Aside from the AB InBev deal, the Goldman banker’s email was referring to the collapse of the $4.5 billion sought by Chinese-U.S. pork producer WH Group in April 2014. That IPO was pulled as investors balked at the valuation the company sought, although Goldman itself was a sponsor on that deal along with Morgan Stanley and five other banks. Three months later WH Group successfully raised $2.1 billion in an IPO led solely by Morgan Stanley and Bank of China International. Goldman did not get a role in the relaunched deal even though the bank was an investor in the pork producer, holding 5.2% of the shares through its private equity unit. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Banks fight fiercely for deals and league table credit in equity capital raising, with fees from the business making up about a quarter of the global investment banking fee pool, on average. Worldwide, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan typically take the top 3 spots, according to Refinitiv data.

Aside from the AB InBev deal, the Goldman banker's email was referring to the collapse of the $4.5 billion sought by Chinese-U.S. pork producer WH Group 0288.HK in April 2014. That IPO was pulled as investors balked at the valuation the company sought, although Goldman itself was a sponsor on that deal along with Morgan Stanley and five other banks. Three months later WH Group successfully raised $2.1 billion in an IPO led solely by Morgan Stanley and Bank of China International. Goldman did not get a role in the relaunched deal even though the bank was an investor in the pork producer, holding 5.2% of the shares through its private equity unit. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Banks fight fiercely for deals and league table credit in equity capital raising, with fees from the business making up about a quarter of the global investment banking fee pool, on average. Worldwide, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan typically take the top 3 spots, according to Refinitiv data. In Asia, their fortunes fluctuate more, but Goldman and Morgan Stanley ranked first and second in the table for the past two years."
-1.4515114474633477," Exclusive: Morgan Stanley likely to gain majority control of China securities JV in H2 - sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N is likely to get regulatory approval for owning a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture in the second half of this year, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The U.S. investment bank’s joint venture informed the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) a couple of months ago about plans to changes in equity holding, subject to regulatory approval, the people said. Morgan Stanley is seeking to raise its holding in the venture with Chinese partner Huaxin Securities to 51% from 49%. The venture’s offerings includes underwriting and sponsoring of stock and bond sales. The approval is likely to come in the second half of the year, the people said, with one saying it is likely to be as soon as the fourth quarter. The timeline for possible approval to ownership changes in the joint venture has not been reported before. When approved, Morgan Stanley will join rivals HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T and UBS Group AG UBSG.S in owning controlling stakes in onshore securities joint ventures in China under liberalized rules announced in November 2017. The move by Morgan Stanley comes even as the United States and China have waged a year-long trade war marked by tit-for-tat import tariffs on each other’s goods. The likely approval, however, will be another indication that China is nevertheless pushing ahead with its agenda to open up its financial sector, after JPMorgan’s approval in March. China has in recent months allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in domestic joint ventures across mutual funds, insurance and brokerage businesses. Earlier in June, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said he wanted majority ownership of a joint venture in China, but that regulators has not signed off on the idea. Morgan Stanley also has a fund management joint venture in the country. Gorman did not identify which venture he was referring to. Morgan Stanley’s senior Hong Kong bankers in recent months have been working on integrating its operations with the joint venture’s, another person said. Those efforts are progressing “at full speed”, the person said. The outcome of Sino-U.S. talks to reach a trade deal could, however, impact the approval timeline, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss regulatory matters with media. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong declined to comment. The CSRC has not responded to a Reuters request for comment. Shanghai Fortune, the parent of Huaxin, said in a June 13 regulatory filing that it planned to divest of a 2% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities through a bidding process for no less than 376.2 million yuan ($54.72 million). The firm did not disclose possible bidders, but such a process is usually a means of transferring additional shares to an existing joint venture partner. After winning the auction, the bidder would still need regulatory approval. Morgan Stanley raised its stake in the venture to 49% from 33.3% in 2017, betting on strong deals momentum. Before easing ownership rules in late 2017, China allowed foreigners to own a maximum 49% in such ventures. That lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for Wall Street banks, and became a key issue in Washington’s push to persuade Beijing to open up its market for wider foreign participation. The lifting of the cap on foreign stakes to 51% has allowed Western banks to buy more shares from their partners in existing joint ventures or enter into new partnerships. JPMorgan and Nomura became the latest to win regulatory approval to set up majority-owned brokerage joint ventures in March this year. UBS received approval in November to hold a majority stake in its existing joint venture. Management control would allow foreign banks including Morgan Stanley to offer more services through their joint ventures and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share, bankers have previously said.

4.799699411262843," Morgan Stanley wants majority stake in Chinese joint venture: CEO MONTREAL (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley wants to obtain majority ownership of a joint venture in China, but regulators there have not signed off on the idea, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has a mutual funds joint venture in China called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Fund Management Co, as well as a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities. In April, the bank became the largest shareholder in the funds venture, but remains a minority owner. Gorman did not identify which venture he was referring to. “China is, I think, the only country in the world where we do business (and) don’t have 50% or more ownership of our business,” Gorman said at the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal. “That is unacceptable.” China has historically prevented foreign investors from becoming too powerful in its markets. That stance softened recently, with Beijing allowing foreign financial institutions to expand their presence onshore, but some Western companies have complained that progress is too slow. Gorman said he recently spent time with regulators in China, seeking authority for Morgan Stanley to acquire a majority stake in one of its joint ventures. Although they were open to the discussion, the broader trade war between the United States and China is hurting business ties and threatening to destabilize both countries’ economies, Gorman said. “There’s a hardening of attitudes on both sides,” he said."

Following a recent visit to Asia, Gorman is concerned that the United States and China have moved from a “tit-for-tat” dispute to something worse, he said at a financial conference hosted by his bank. “If we have a full-blown trade war, I think that’s a disaster,” Gorman said. “Both countries have enormous self interest in putting this back on the tracks.” He also said the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policies regarding capital requirements and stress tests remain too stringent, more than a decade after the financial crisis. Gorman has been a frequent critic of certain capital constraints. “Regulators in my view were excessively cautious,” he said. Gorman also suggested that Morgan Stanley’s second-quarter results will not be as strong as in the previous quarter, citing a trading slowdown and issues like higher tax expenses. The last two weeks have been “quite hard” in trading, he said, but the bank is trying to control expenses to make up for the revenue shortfall."

-4.519248355431251," Morgan Stanley to pay $150 million to settle California crisis-era mortgage charges (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley will pay $150 million to settle charges it misled two large California public pension funds about the risks of mortgage-backed securities they bought in the years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The settlement announced on Thursday by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra resolves an April 2016 lawsuit filed by his predecessor Kamala Harris, who is now a U.S. senator. Becerra said the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) will receive $122 million from the settlement, while the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) will receive $8 million. The other $20 million will cover costs and help fund other investigations. Morgan Stanley denied wrongdoing. A spokesman said the accord is the New York-based bank’s last regulatory settlement related to the financial crisis. California said Morgan Stanley overstated the quality of subprime loans from lenders such as New Century Financial, which went bankrupt in 2007, that it bundled into seemingly safe securities that CalPERS and CalSTRS bought from 2003 to 2007. The bank was also accused of failing to remove poor-quality loans from those securities, and hiding the risks because disclosure could become a “relationship killer” prompting lenders to send future business elsewhere. “Morgan Stanley lied about the risks of its products and put profits over teachers and public employees who relied on its advice,” Becerra said. The lawsuit was one of hundreds accusing banks of misleading investors in the marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities. Morgan Stanley agreed in February 2016 to pay $3.2 billion to resolve federal and state claims over those securities."

-8.732026419476218," Morgan Stanley leans on wealth management to beat estimates (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley reported a 9 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but managed to beat analyst estimates through slight growth in its wealth management business, as well as cost cuts. Shares of the sixth-largest U.S. bank were up 1.4 percent to $47.69 in morning trading. Morgan Stanley gets about half its annual revenue from wealth management, which helps it ride out weak periods for trading and investment banking. Both of those businesses suffered during the first quarter at Morgan Stanley and its Wall Street rivals because of subdued volatility. “This quarter ... shows the resiliency of wealth management, which is an important indicator of the health of our business,” Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. The bank also cut non-interest expenses by 4 percent, which helped boost its bottom line. Overall, Morgan Stanley reported a quarterly profit of $2.34 billion, or $1.39 per share, down from $2.58 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share. mgstn.ly/2vaVd4I Its revenue fell 7 percent to $10.29 billion. Both metrics still beat Wall Street expectations. Analysts had estimated earnings of $1.17 per share and revenue of $9.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Wealth management revenue rose slightly from a year ago, with profit margins holding steady at 27 percent. But the business looks robust compared with institutional securities, analysts said. That unit reported steep declines across trading, underwriting and investment banking. “Wealth management was able to protect the margin in a tougher backdrop” than the year-ago period, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients. The performance “should make people more optimistic considering the lift in markets and better underwriting environment lately.” Concerns about a slowing global economy, U.S. trade tensions with China and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy spurred worries of recession risk early in 2019. But those concerns seem to have subsided, Pruzan said. Morgan Stanley’s wealth management profit margin and its return on equity of 13.1 percent were comfortably within the targeted range Chief Executive James Gorman has set. Investors watch that return figure closely, because it measures how much profit a bank produces from shareholder capital. Gorman, who took the helm in 2010, has defined his tenure by building out the wealth management business, dialing back bond trading and generally reducing risk across the franchise. Like in previous quarters, an analyst asked Gorman on a conference call why he has not lifted performance targets for wealth management, given how easily the business has been meeting the 26 percent to 28 percent range he set. Gorman again reminded analysts that the margins were far lower when he first set about growing the wealth unit. But now, the business produces returns of nearly 25 percent in difficult times, and might do better, he said, without raising the target. “There’s no magic to this,” said Gorman. “It’s pretty consistent.” By contrast, top rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc remains more weighted toward capital markets businesses and is struggling to produce more stable results. On Monday, Goldman reported a 20 percent profit decline and lower revenue across nearly all its major businesses, sending its shares down more than 3 percent. Analysts also asked about Morgan Stanley’s recently announced plan to acquire Solium Capital Inc, a software provider that helps businesses manage employee stock plans. Gorman explained that the business will help Morgan Stanley interface with roughly 3,000 small companies and 2.5 million individuals. That benefits Morgan Stanley’s wealth business, which will oversee the accounts, but also allows the bank to offer cash management services and potentially handle stock offerings for companies that go public. The transaction is expected to close in May, he said."

The Wall Street bank, which currently owns 37.4 percent in Shenzhen-based Morgan Stanley Huaxin, won the bid on March 30 to buy the additional stake for 25.04 million yuan ($3.73 million), according to the auction notice on Taobao.com. Morgan Stanley is buying the stake from a private shareholder in a court-appointed auction, which will see its stake surpass that of Huaxin Securities, which owns 39.56 percent of the joint venture. The purchase needs to be approved by China’s securities regulators. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Moves by Morgan Stanley to boost ownership in the fund venture comes as China is opening up its financial sector worth trillions of dollars – from insurance to asset management and brokerage - for bigger foreign participation. China has in recent months allowed many foreign financial institutions to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in domestic joint ventures. Under new rules announced in late 2017, Beijing has also paved the way for foreigners to own up to 51 percent in their local mutual fund ventures. Besides the fund management business, Morgan Stanley also has a securities joint venture with Huaxin, in which the Wall Street bank raised its stake to 49 percent in 2017.

-0.9160441679718606," Big banks to report first quarter results with lowered expectations NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will focus on falling profits, a more dovish Federal Reserve and lower interest rates as major U.S. banks kick off what analysts expect to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016. On Friday, April 12, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co will post results to begin the earnings season in earnest. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc will report the following Monday, followed by Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. In the wake of the Federal Reserve’s cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data. (For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs/2HOVt1D) “The Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they’re saying about the economy,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “Flat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It’s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.” The central bank’s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth. Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond’s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits. “That’s why the estimates are going down,” Carlson added. “(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there’s an underlying concern about loan growth.” In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks. Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings “recession” that ended in 2016. The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates. In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter. “Within financials, the industry that’s been hit hardest is capital markets,” said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. “Those downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines” in first-quarter earnings estimates. But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated. Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note “to be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.” But he called the impact from the Fed’s decision “a minor one,” and wrote that aside from these impacts, “bank fundamentals are remarkably stable.” Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500’s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data. (For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs/2Vmv2DP) In today’s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period. “Psychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,” Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. “Banks are up there.”"

Kelleher, 61, will stay on as senior adviser, according to a memo Chief Executive James Gorman sent to employees that was seen by Reuters. Kelleher’s replacement was not immediately named. Kelleher was president of the firm since January 2016, and widely known to be Gorman’s second-in-command. KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said Kelleher was thought of as a possible successor to the CEO if Gorman ever needed to step down suddenly. Kelleher is older than Gorman, 60, and so was not thought of as a permanent successor, but his departure “raises some succession concerns near term” for the bank, Kleinhanzl said. Kelleher served as chief financial officer and co-head of corporate strategy from October 2007 to December 2009. Gorman credited Kelleher’s leadership during that “critical period” with “helping the firm navigate the depths of the financial crisis,” according to the memo. While Kelleher was CFO, the bank drastically shrank its balance sheet, became a bank holding company, which meant it could access funding from the Federal Reserve, and secured a $9 billion investment from Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Kelleher went on to become co-president and then president of institutional securities, as well as the head of international for the bank. “Every time I have faced an issue of real significance Colm has been the most important person I have sought advice from,” Gorman wrote in the memo. Kelleher joined the bank in 1989, initially working in the fixed income division. Reuters previously reported that Kelleher, a wine and classical music aficionado, was known by colleagues to care so deeply about the bank’s traditions that he chastised employees if they rolled up their shirt-sleeves because it lowered the standards of the business dress code."

The bank beat rival JPMorgan into second place and Citibank and Goldman Sachs into joint third in Coalition’s ranking of the twelve largest global investment banks’ commodities businesses. The score caps a rapid rise for Morgan Stanley, which in the 2017 rankings tied for first place with JPMorgan and before that had not been inside the top three since 2014, when it placed third. For Goldman, traditionally a major force in commodities, it is a partial return to form after it fell from the top three in 2017, after its commodities business suffered one its worst years on record. Citi’s ranking was unchanged from 2017. Coalition did not give figures for each bank, but said in February overall revenues at the top twelve investment banks from commodity trading, selling derivatives and other activities in the sector were $3.6 billion (2.7 billion pounds) last year, up 45 percent from 2017. That increase however follows a long period of declining revenues as banks exited or shrank their commodity businesses due to more stringent regulation and poor performance from the sector. The twelve banks in Coalition’s ranking also include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Societe Generale and UBS."
4.3701122500124985," Italian appeals court rules it cannot hear $3 billion case against Morgan Stanley ROME (Reuters) - An Italian appeals court has ruled it cannot hear a case against Morgan Stanley in a derivatives case which included a request for 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion) in damages from the U.S. bank. The ruling, seen by Reuters in a document filed on Thursday, confirms a decision taken in June by Italy’s Court of Accounts saying it did not have jurisdiction in the matter. The case revolves around Morgan Stanley derivative transactions made by the Italian state between 1995 and 2005 and terminated in December 2011 and January 2012. The Italian state incurred large losses on its derivative positions. State prosecutors had argued some contracts negotiated with the U.S. bank were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank. Morgan Stanley said it welcomed the judgment and did not comment further. In the past the bank has repeatedly said the claim was groundless. The case also includes claims against former senior officials at Italy’s Treasury for a total of 1.18 billion euros. All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing. “It’s the right ruling, which fully reflects the defence’s reasons,” said Mario D’Urso, the lawyer representing former Treasury Director General Vittorio Grilli. Prosecutors in the case can appeal the decision to Italy’s Supreme Court."

McCord will join the bank as a managing director in its Data Center of Excellence, a group that works with the bank’s businesses to boost data innovation, security and efficiency, according to the memo which was sent out on Monday. Based in London, McCord will help define principles and procedures for Morgan Stanley to manage its data and work on the creation and implementation a new firm-wide data policy, the memo said. The hire comes as financial institutions of all sizes ramp up initiatives to make better use of the vast amount of data they produce and store. Banks hope to gain greater insights from their data to make their various businesses more efficient and offer better services to clients. Data efforts have been complex because banks’ information is often stored in various formats and on numerous systems, some of which may be very old. For the past two years McCord has been an external adviser to Morgan Stanley, leading the technology side of the bank’s program to prepare for Britain’s planned exit from the European Union, according to the memo. She will transition to the Data CoE at the end of the month and report to its head, Gerard Hester, according to the memo.

Safra Saran (not Morgan Stanley)) ZURICH, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse is hiring senior wealth managers from rivals JPMorgan and J. Safra Sarasin as part of a push to grow its business in Latin America as quickly as it grows its Swiss client base. Switzerland’s second-biggest bank has made five senior appointments in its Geneva and Zurich-based offices to boost business managing money for Latin America’s wealthy, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. It plans further hires in coming months, including at local South and Central American offices, a source familiar with the plans said. “To grow our regional capabilities further we need to not only develop our internal talent... but also attract external talent,” LatAm Head Jorge Fernández Amann told employees in an internal memo. He added that the bank would have a stronger local presence in Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Ricardo Castillo will join Credit Suisse as Latin American head of advisory and sales, and also lead the bank’s investment consulting team for Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay (ConoSur), according to the memo. Castillo previously held the role of global investment specialist covering ultra-high net worth individuals at JPMorgan.

13.476582428866157," U.S. shutdown 'extremely negative' for IPO market: Morgan Stanley CEO (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on Thursday it would be extremely negative for the initial public offering market if the United States government shutdown goes on much longer. “This is not the way the U.S. should be working,” Gorman said, speaking in a CNBC interview at Davos, adding, “I truly hope the leadership of both sides come to some way resolving what seems to be a relatively straightforward problem.” Gorman became the latest Wall Street executive to call on Washington to end the shutdown by finding a middle ground on President Donald Trump’s demand for money to build a wall along the border shared with Mexico. The shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay, affected market sentiment and impacted companies seeking to list themselves in the U.S. Skeletal staffing at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has nearly extinguished the pipeline of IPOs expected in early January, since companies typically rely on the SEC to approve their IPO following a review of their prospectus to investors before going ahead with a public listing. Some are considering workarounds, such as going ahead with their IPO registrations without waiting for SEC approval, or seeking direct listings, both of which carry associated risks, especially of alienating investors. Gorman, whose investment bankers are expected to underwrite Uber’s IPO this year, said the shutdown not only impacts the IPO market, but also the momentum in the economy. When asked what the solution to the “straightforward problem” was, Gorman said, “I’d recognize we have a wall - it’s 500 miles long and it has been sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans for a very long time. If there were some sensible additions to be made to that wall to improve border security, let’s make them.” Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N CEO David Solomon told CNBC at Davos that a combination of things not going the right way, including the government shutdown, the 90-day trade deadline, and Brexit negotiations, will have an impact on financial markets, and slow down the U.S. economy. Solomon, however, added that the chances of a recession in 2019 are still “relatively low”. Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also urged the Republican and Democratic leaderships to end the shutdown, saying it could, along with geopolitical issues and Brexit tensions, cause a ""slowdown or recession"" in the U.S. economy."

14.27971981561384," Volatile market hits Morgan Stanley's trading, wealth management (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's MS.N quarterly profit fell short of expectations as bond trading revenue slumped more than rivals and its wealth management business faltered, sending its shares down 4.4 percent. The bank has pledged that its expansion into wealth management over the past decade would help deliver more stable results. But the unit, which accounts for roughly half of Morgan Stanley’s revenue, was not immune from year-end market volatility that drove customers to the sidelines. Morgan Stanley also noted the impact of changes to compensation that addressed what Chief Executive James Gorman called a “very aggressive” deferral program. Gorman said that Morgan Stanley had been “mortgaging (its) future” by delaying payouts. On a call with analysts, Gorman characterized the fourth quarter as a temporary, if disappointing, blip. “2018 was a great year that finished on a disappointing note,” he said. “We do not believe the fourth quarter is the new normal.” Although market volatility hurt trading, underwriting, wealth management and asset management revenue, Morgan Stanley is keeping a tight lid on costs and making purposeful decisions to position itself for growth, he said. The bank held its profit margin outlook for wealth management steady at 26 percent to 28 percent through this year. The business had a profit margin of 24 percent in the fourth quarter and 26 percent for all of 2018. Gorman, who has been pressed by analysts to increase that target, cautioned that the current goal is “not a limit” but that the bank is putting revenue growth in that business ahead of profitability for now. “The trade-off between revenue growth and margin expansion is important,” he said. “This year, we would be more interested in driving higher revenue growth within this margin range that we’ve been public on.” A pay structure for wealth management employees also weighed on the unit during the market slump. Morgan Stanley has for years paid its roughly 15,700 brokers a combination of cash up front and stock, which is deferred for several years and invested by the firm. The bank reported that net revenues for the current quarter fell to $4.1 billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier because of losses in the investments of some deferred compensation plans. Overall, Morgan Stanley reported a fourth-quarter pre-tax operating income of $1.9 billion, down 25 percent from the $2.5 billion it reported in the year-earlier period, when changes to U.S. tax law dramatically affected results across Wall Street. Its earnings per share of 80 cents missed analysts’ average estimate of 89 cents per share. Net revenue fell 10 percent to $8.6 billion, falling well short of the $9.3 billion Wall Street expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income trading revenue fell 30 percent to $564 million. That was a much sharper drop than at rivals, who have bigger bond trading businesses. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America this week reported bond trading revenue declines of 15 percent to 20 percent, blaming a sharp and unexpected widening of credit spreads and volatility in rates trading. Revenue from Morgan Stanley’s wealth business dropped 6 percent. The unit’s profit margin fell to 24 percent from 26 percent in the year-ago quarter. Investors shifted $121 billion into U.S. money market funds in December, Lipper estimates, the most since November 2008. One bright spot in the bank’s results was its M&A advisory business, which delivered a 41 percent rise in revenue. Goldman Sachs also saw similar surge in dealmaking. “After strong results from peers yesterday, Morgan Stanley’s quarter appears weak, and we expect shares to underperform,” said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. In the last 12 months, Morgan Stanley's stock has fallen nearly 22 percent, versus a 12.5 percent decline in the financial index .SPSY and a 5.6 percent drop in the S&P 500 index .SPX over the same period."

7.322639995778911," Morgan Stanley unit to pay $10 million fine for anti-money laundering violations (Reuters) - Wall Street’s industry funded watchdog fined the U.S. brokerage unit of Morgan Stanley $10 million on Wednesday for compliance failures in the firm’s anti-money laundering program, the regulator said. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said the lapses spanned more than five years, from January 2011 until April 2016. Morgan Stanley, which agreed to the fine as part of a settlement, did not admit nor deny FINRA’s charges, but consented to the entry of the regulator’s findings. “We are pleased to have resolved this matter from several years ago,” Morgan Stanley said in a statement. FINRA rules require brokerages to have policies and procedures in place to comply with a federal law aimed at detecting and curbing money laundering. A Morgan Stanley automated surveillance system did not receive important data from other Morgan Stanley systems, FINRA said. The lapse impaired the firm’s overall tracking of tens of billions of dollars of wire and foreign currency transfers, FINRA said. Those transactions included transfers to and from countries known for money laundering risk, FINRA said. In 2015, a consultant that Morgan Stanley hired to test its surveillance identified several “high risk” issues, according to the settlement agreement. Morgan Stanley did not fix one of those problems until at least February 2017. Morgan Stanley’s other violations include failing to “reasonably monitor” customers’ deposits of 2.7 billion shares of penny stock between 2011-2013, FINRA said. Low-priced securities, such as penny stocks, are often subject to efforts by fraudsters to falsely inflate trading volume and share prices, a securities law violation that is frequently a precursor to money-laundering, according to anti-money laundering compliance professionals. Morgan Stanley has taken “extraordinary steps” since 2013 to improve its anti-money laundering programs, including a new automated process for monitoring of penny stock transactions and potential insider trading, FINRA said in the settlement."
12.627261155292347," Morgan Stanley moves to speed up collaboration with tech startups NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is simplifying the way it acquires new technologies from small companies to speed up collaboration and address long running concerns by startups that working with big banks is slow and costly. The bank has been taking steps to reduce the time it takes to begin working with new vendors by streamlining documentation and broadening the opportunities for executives to evaluate new tech products, Shawn Melamed, Morgan Stanley’s head of technology business development and innovation office, said in an interview this week. Earlier this year, the bank trimmed a 20-page vendor agreement to one page, helping reduce from three months to as little as one week the time to begin working together, Melamed said. The bank also launched a portal for employees to test new technology, he added. “We have looked at how to improve over-complicated processes,” Melamed said. “The benefit for us and them is (saving) time and money.” Large banks have been increasingly working with financial technology startups to launch new digital services, as they seek to keep abreast of technological change and fend off competition from new entrants. Entrepreneurs have long said, however, one of the biggest challenges they face when selling to large institutions remains their cumbersome procurement process. As highly regulated entities banks must ensure the technology and services they acquire are reliable and sturdy, a need often resulting in months of meetings and reams of forms. This can be especially challenging for startups with limited resources and few employees. “I used to be a founder and CEO of a fintech company,” Melamed said. “I’ve experienced the pain from the other side.” Morgan Stanley’s efforts to shorten on-boarding time come as the bank’s wealth business rolls out WealthDesk, a suite of nearly a dozen new tech tools and services, to 15,000 financial advisers. WealthDesk is a key part of the growth strategy for the bank’s wealth business, which contributes half of Morgan Stanley’s revenues. In November, the bank held a fintech event at its New York headquarters where 400 Morgan Stanley executives met with 90 fintech startups, Melamed said. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has been vocal about the bank’s technology aspirations and in June pushed back against the perception that Wall Street is too bureaucratic to work with Silicon Valley. “There’s this presumption that big firms are dumb and slow,” Gorman said at Morgan Stanley’s U.S. Financials Conference. “We’ve also got very deep pockets and scale, and we are not dumb.”"

-2.695492565109951," Ex-Morgan Stanley adviser gets five years in U.S. prison for fraud BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley adviser was sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday after he admitted that he misused client funds to invest in a wind farm project and to cover his own personal expenses, including college tuition for his children. James Polese, 52, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf in Boston, who said he could not understand how the investment adviser could be “so greedy and stupid” by carrying out the fraud when he was already financially successful. “It wasn’t just wrong,” Wolf said. “It was dumb, and it inflicted harm on the people you cared about.” The proceedings came after a former employee of the New York-based financial services firm who worked under Polese, Cornelius Peterson, was sentenced in June to 20 months in prison for participating in the scheme. Polese, who pleaded guilty in April to investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, in court apologized to his victims and Morgan Stanley, which employed him as a Boston-based adviser. “I’m sorry for tarnishing their name through my actions,” he said. In addition to prison, Wolf also ordered Polese to pay a $30,000 fine and $462,000 in restitution jointly with Peterson. According to court papers, in 2014, Polese and Peterson transferred $100,000 from a Morgan Stanley client’s account without his permission to invest in a private equity fund created to support a wind farm project. Prosecutors said Peterson was on the fund’s board of directors, and Polese had himself invested money in the wind farm project, which needed additional funding. Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an elderly Morgan Stanley client, Ralph Bates, to back a letter of credit in support of the project, causing him to incur $12,000 in fees, prosecutors said. Without Bates’ approval, in 2016 they also transferred $350,000 from his account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese’s personal expenses, according to court papers. Polese also in 2017 used more than $93,000 from Bates’ account to make college tuition payments for two of his children and to pay his own credit card bills, prosecutors said. Bates, an 87-year-old philanthropist, said in court on Tuesday that Polese had “ripped me off for big bucks. “I’m at a loss for words,” he said. Morgan Stanley fired Polese and Peterson in June 2017 and has said it terminated them immediately after uncovering their misconduct. The case is U.S. v. Polese, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-cr-10028."

Tomofumi Matsuyama, who was a managing director at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co, a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group , will join Carlyle in Japan as the managing director, the sources added. He is expected to cultivate deals related to the divesture of assets by large Japanese firms, one of the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because Matsuyama has not joined Carlyle as yet. A spokeswoman for Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley confirmed his departure. A Carlyle representative declined to comment. The hiring comes as expectations grow for private equity opportunities in Japan, where many large companies are focusing on their core business and divesting non-core assets amid a government drive to streamline operations and boost shareholder returns. Among Japanese blue-chip firms, Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Panasonic Corp have sold some of their operations to global private equity firms, including KKR & Co Inc and Bain Capital. During his tenure at the Morgan Stanley venture, Matsuyama covered mainly Japanese technology firms such as Panasonic and Hitachi, one of the sources said. Carlyle had been focusing on smaller deals in Japan, taking advantage of the need for successors of small-business owners. However, it recently shifted its strategy and focus to multi-billion-dollar deals, a market dominated by KKR and Bain."

-2.4906729097097857," Equity trading strength boosts profits at Morgan Stanley, Goldman (Reuters) - Wall Street’s top investment banks reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Tuesday, helped by strength in stock trading and equity underwriting, wrapping up what has been a strong quarter for the big U.S. banks. Morgan Stanley's MS.N gains from investment banking and trading businesses outstripped those of traditional rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, which reported its last results under long-time Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein. However, Goldman’s equity trading and underwriting revenue came in much better than that of Morgan Stanley in a quarter that was marked by uncertainties in global financial markets stemming from an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington. Talking to analysts on a post-earnings call, Morgan Stanley’s Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said he expects the firm to be the leader in equities trading by market share globally this year. Strength at equity trading desks of both banks dwarfed weakness in bond trading, in line with a broader trend across the industry during the third quarter. Both banks lack big consumer lending units that have fueled profits at rivals such as Citigroup C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, and instead rely heavily on their trading desks. To offset the ups and downs of the trading business, Morgan Stanley and Goldman have been trying to diversify into lending and wealth management. Shares of Morgan Stanley were up 2.4 percent, while those of Goldman were up about 1 percent in early trading. Bank stocks have been under pressure this year as investors and analysts have questioned their future growth strategies. The S&P Financial Index .SPSY has fallen 6 percent this year, vastly underperforming the broader market. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman have lost more than 15 percent of their value this year, making them the two worst performing stocks among the big six banks. Investment bankers helped the banks bring in big gains during the quarter. Goldman’s investment banking revenue rose 10 percent to $1.98 billion as advisory revenue hit its highest in three years, and the bank earned more from helping companies go public. This compares with a 15 percent jump in Morgan Stanley’s revenue from the business to $1.46 billion. Credit Suisse analysts had expected investment banking revenue at Goldman and Morgan Stanley to be $1.73 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively. Equity trading desks at both the banks also booked gains of between 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Bond trading business, however, did not fare as well. Morgan Stanley’s bond trading revenue rose just 1 percent, but outperformed Goldman, which reported a 10 percent fall in revenue from the business. “Pretty good results considering the choppy backdrop and we like how Morgan Stanley continues to produce strong results,” Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note. Overall, Morgan Stanley reported net profit of $1.17 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.01 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Goldman’s per share profit came in at $6.28, compared with the estimate of $5.38."
-2.4906729097097857," Morgan Stanley profit beats on strength in equity trading, underwriting (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by higher revenue in its stock trading and equity underwriting businesses. Equity trading revenue rose 7 percent in a quarter marked by uncertainties in global financial markets stemming from an ongoing tariff war between the United States and China. Morgan Stanley's bond trading revenue rose 1 percent, outperforming traditional competitor Goldman Sachs Group Inc, GS.N which reported a 10 percent fall in revenue at the business. Bond trading at Wall Street's top bank - JPMorgan JPM.N - declined 10 percent in the third-quarter. Morgan Stanley’s overall revenue rose a better-than-expected 7.3 percent, also helped by a 62 percent jump in equity underwriting revenue. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has restored Morgan Stanley to health since taking over in 2010, when the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis. His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and focusing on steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue. However, some analysts now question the bank's future growth strategy. Its shares have fallen 17 percent this year, underperforming the S&P Financial index .SPSY, with lackluster trading also weighing on the stock. The shares were up 2.4 percent before the opening bell. The bank's sales and trading revenue, its biggest contributor to total revenue, rose 7.5 percent and came in better than that of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N. Net income attributable to Morgan Stanley rose to $2.11 billion, or $1.17 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.78 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year ago.

-12.029075743054102," Race bias lawsuit against Morgan Stanley sent to private arbitration NEW YORK (Reuters) - A black former Morgan Stanley broker who filed a lawsuit accusing the bank of racial bias must pursue his claims in private arbitration, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan ruled that the former broker, John Lockette, was bound by a company policy requiring employees to arbitrate all claims, including discrimination claims. “We are pleased with the court’s decision in this case,” Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Susan Siering said in an email. “The firm is strongly committed to non-discrimination and looks forward to addressing this dispute on the merits.” Linda Friedman, a lawyer for Lockette, could not immediately be reached for comment. Lockette, who was hired by Morgan Stanley as an assistant vice president in wealth management in 2013, sued the company in February. The New Jersey resident said he was given negative performance reviews, denied raises and bonuses, deemed too “verbose,” and subjected by a supervisor to the nickname “Johnny” because of his race. Lockette also said one supervisor insisted that he join a special program to prepare for the Series 7 broker examination because blacks’ “intellectual weakness” left them “inherently less capable” of passing, the complaint said. He said the discrimination culminated in his firing in August 2016. He sought compensatory and punitive damages, back pay, and an injunction against further discrimination. Morgan Stanley filed a motion seeking to send the case to private arbitration, pointing to a May 20, 2015 email in which Morgan Stanley employees were told that the company was expanding its arbitration policy. The email said that employees could opt out, but would be deemed to have agreed to the policy if they did not do so before a given deadline and continued working for the company. Lockette said he never got the email, and so never agreed to arbitration, but Koeltl ruled that his “mere denial of receipt” was not enough to escape the policy under New York law. The case is Lockette v Morgan Stanley et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-00876."

-23.26120679514848," Morgan Stanley shifts emerging-market stance to Neutral from Negative LONDON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Monday it had changed its stance on emerging-market bonds and currencies to neutral from negative following the recent selloff, although it warned the backdrop for developing markets remained difficult. “After a significant sell-off, we close our bearish view on EM and shift into neutral gear,” strategist Jaes Lord said in a note to clients. “We can see the case for some temporary stability after a six-month bear market.” Emerging markets had a rough time over the summer after crises in Turkey and Argentina sparked a wider selloff in assets of developing economies. Following a six-month bear market, Morgan Stanley predicted some temporary stability might occur, thanks to depressed valuations, investors adjusting their positioning and a weaker U.S. dollar. Some idiosyncratic issues had become less concerning, while policy response to shore up investor confidence had picked up and a further escalation of trade looked built in, Morgan Stanley added. “However, more material escalatory risks over the medium term mean that this issue should re-emerge as a strong headwind in time and so we do not see the case to move bullish.” Across high-yielding currencies, Morgan Stanley said it “liked” Argentina, Indonesia and Russia and moved to a neutral stance on Brazil. Across local debt, its analysts took a positive view on Mexico and a neutral stance on Argentina, Brazil and Russia. “Overall, we see the case for local markets as stronger than credit, considering better positioning, valuations that are more consistently cheap across countries and expected dollar weakness,” the bank added. Across emerging-market hard currency debt, Morgan Stanley expected spreads to tighten with more debt issue supply possibly coming to market after a rocky summer, which would keep a lid on a potential rally. Bond sales usually rebound in September after a quiet August, but this year’s currency crises in Turkey and Argentina and worries about rising U.S. sanctions risk for Russia have kept volumes dramatically lower so far. Morgan Stanley is not the only major bank to take a more positive view on emerging markets. Goldman Sachs said investor sentiment for emerging market assets had been firming. “Recent price action has likely helped buoy sentiment for EM assets, but we have noticed a marked change over the past two weeks in investors’ focus on EM - from downside risks to valuation and ‘opportunities’,” Goldman analysts Caesar Maasry wrote in a note to clients. Turkey’s interest rate increase in September, softer inflation data from the U.S. and valuations have rekindled “tepid optimism”, he said. “We still prefer equity as the best-positioned asset class for a ‘bounce-back’ and find Brazil, Chile, Peru, Korea, and China offer a good combination of dislocation and supportive macro growth dynamics,” Maasry added. MSCI's emerging market equity benchmark .MSCIEF has fallen nearly 10 percent since the start of the year."
-21.456648781143983," Morgan Stanley sues six Illinois brokers who left for Stifel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N has sued six brokers who left an Illinois branch of the firm last week to join competitor Stifel Nicolaus SF.N, alleging that they have been soliciting Morgan Stanley clients in violation of employment agreements. Filed on Wednesday in Chicago federal court, the lawsuit said the team managed about $660 million in assets at Morgan Stanley’s Bourbonnais office before their sudden resignations on Sept. 13. The brokers apparently took client files and contact information with them and have been asking clients to move to Stifel, the lawsuit alleged. “When departing advisors breach their agreements, remove confidential information or trade secrets, including personal client information, or engage in other misconduct, they should expect that Morgan Stanley will take appropriate legal action,” spokeswoman Christine Jockle said in a statement. The departures include the former manager of Morgan Stanley’s Bourbonnais office, Zachary Birkey, now branch manager of Stifel’s Bourbonnais office. Birkey declined to comment on the lawsuit. Neil Shapiro, a spokesman for Stifel, said the company does not comment on pending litigation. Morgan Stanley’s lawsuit said the brokers each signed an agreement not to solicit the company’s clients for one year after leaving the firm for any reason. It asked the court to order the brokers to stop soliciting clients or using any of Morgan Stanley’s information. The complaint said the brokers also may be making false statements about their former employer. Some clients have been asking Morgan Stanley if its Bourbonnais office is closing or if Morgan Stanley is going bankrupt, the complaint said. Files for one large client also appear to be missing, the complaint said. Lawsuits over broker defections had dropped after major Wall Street firms signed a pact in 2004 agreeing not to sue if brokers left for rival firms and took clients with them. Morgan Stanley left the so-called Protocol for Broker Recruiting last October, saying the move would allow it to invest more in its advisers."

-14.497710886926763," Morgan Stanley recommends buying Italian assets ahead of budget MILAN (Reuters) - Investment bank Morgan Stanley recommends tactically buying Italian bonds and stocks ahead of the country’s budget announcement, which it reckons will aim for a deficit well below the EU threshold of 3 percent of gross domestic product. “While the macro outlook remains challenging in the medium term, a middle-ground fiscal expansion is likely to come as a relief to markets,” analysts at the U.S. bank said in a note on Monday. Morgan Stanley reckons the budget, due to be announced on Sept 27, will target a deficit of around 2.2 percent. The bank acknowledged Italian debt remained vulnerable to shocks and described itself as cautious on the long-term structural demand for BTPs, as Italian government bonds are known. But “with possible near-term upside we recommend investors to position via a tactical long in 10y BTP versus Bono,” it added, referring to Spanish government bonds. Morgan Stanley also sees Italian stocks as too cheap relative to bond spreads, and said base case forecasts suggested a 12 percent re-rating potential for MSCI’s Italy equity index.

Morgan Stanley's move comes a week after Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N stopped its coverage of Tesla last week shortly before confirming it was acting as a financial adviser on a matter related to the automaker. Morgan Stanley’s website showed Tesla had been moved to “Not Rated” from “Equal-weight” on Tuesday without providing further details on the reason for dropping coverage. Shares of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla rose to a high of $324.79 on Tuesday, bouncing off a three-month low on Monday when JP Morgan slashed its price target on the company by $113 and said it believed Chief Executive Elon Musk had not secured funding for taking Tesla private. Musk had tweeted early last week that he was working with buyout firm Silver Lake and investment bank Goldman Sachs as advisers in his efforts to secure tens of billions of dollars in funding and take the car maker private. Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Norway’s wealth fund, a Tesla investor, said on Tuesday that its rules would allow it to stay on as an investor in the carmaker if it delists from the Nasdaq exchange. Musk has given no details of funding since saying in a blog on Tesla’s website a week ago that he was in discussions with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers but that financing was not yet nailed down. His tweet earlier this month that he was considering taking Tesla private and that he had secured funding prompted investor lawsuits as well as an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Separately, Musk, a prolific Twitter user with 22.4 million followers, deleted his Instagram account, which had about 8 million followers. “Instagram is so thirsty, yet gives you Death by Water,” Musk said in response to a tweet asking why he had deleted his account. Musk has been criticized for his erratic behavior on social media, with some investors urging him to refrain from making controversial comments."

-8.421467975687175," Morgan Stanley boss Gorman hits out at Fed stress tests (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley’s top executive criticized the Federal Reserve’s annual health checks of the biggest U.S. lenders and predicted changes to the tests going forward after his bank reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The Fed said last month it would not let Morgan Stanley boost overall capital returns to shareholders after its capital ratio fell below the minimum allowed in the annual stress test. A failure to meet the requirement would normally result in an outright failure. The tests, set up to prevent a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, have become “increasingly more demanding” each year, and are now more severe than what the banks experienced during the crisis itself, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. “Ten years on, it’s time to take a fresh look,” he said. “We don’t want to be chasing in the last crisis, we’re trying to figure out the next one.” Officials Gorman has spoken with at the Fed have sympathy with his argument that rules about banks’ capital ratios should be reexamined, he said. Appearing before Congress on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was questioned extensively on the central bank’s approach to this year’s stress tests, with Democrats criticizing the Fed for passing Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc even though their capital levels fell below the minimum required. Powell told lawmakers that there had been no “haggling” or negotiations with Morgan Stanley over its stress tests results and capital plan, and added that the Fed was committed to the stress testing process. “It’s a very important thing for us and we’ll make sure to keep it stringent.” The Fed purposefully increased the stringency of the stress test this year because firms are more likely to take on greater risk as the broader economic environment improves. Gorman said that he does not expect Morgan Stanley will need to cut its capital distribution program going forward as a result of the tests. The 60-year-old CEO has restored Morgan Stanley to health since taking over in 2010, when the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis. His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and focusing on steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue. The bank’s second-quarter profit jumped 39 percent, to $2.4 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.8 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for special items, its profit was $1.25 per share, topping the $1.11 per share analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morgan Stanley benefited from higher revenues in trading, investment banking and wealth management. Volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes stirred an increase in trading volumes across Wall Street. However, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan warned that a seasonal slowdown and geopolitical concerns could weigh on activity moving forward. Morgan Stanley shares were up 3.6 percent in mid-morning trading. Its chief rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, reported a 44-percent jump in quarterly profits, also driven by trading gains and officially named David Solomon as successor to CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Goldman is undergoing a strategic overhaul to generate more revenue by focusing steadier businesses, generating comparisons to the strategy Gorman laid out many years ago. Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp are also pursuing new initiatives involving digital banks or branch networks to expand their presence with U.S. consumers. Asked by Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo whether Morgan Stanley might need to do something similar to keep up with competitors, Gorman said his bank had made more changes in the past eight years than in the previous 80 and had no plans to change course. “I think it is unwise to run strategy through envy,” he said."
-8.421467975687175," Morgan Stanley CEO declares broker recruiting wars over NEW YORK (Reuters) - A subtle peace has emerged in Wall Street’s long-running broker recruiting wars, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on Wednesday. Firms like Morgan Stanley have realized they no longer need to depend on poaching employees from rivals to boost revenue, he said, and are focused instead on earning more from a stable roster of existing brokers. “The amount of recruiting they’re doing from each other is very small, and it’s small for good reason though,” Gorman said on a conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter results. “We don’t need to recruit a lot of people. We’re growing organically.” For most of their history, full-service wealth management firms have offered recruiting bonuses to lure away competitors’ best brokers, and by extension, their clients. The number of those firms has dwindled as the industry consolidated, while small independent advisory offices have proliferated. Brokerages have pulled back on costly recruiting over the past year and are instead giving brokers incentives to bring on new clients and squeeze more assets from existing ones. The number of firms recruiting from each other has shrunk from 10 to roughly four over the past 25 years, Gorman said, referring to Morgan Stanley, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS Group AG’s U.S. wealth management division. Gorman’s comments come less than a year after Morgan Stanley and UBS left a pact with Merrill, Wells Fargo and others agreeing to terms for broker departures, a step that led to a massive reduction in lawsuits firms filed after brokers decamped for rivals. “We’re, honestly, (experiencing) very little attrition, and as a result, we are doing very little recruiting,” Gorman said. “We like growing in-house and we’re doing that successfully, and clearly, it’s an economically ... better proposition.” Morgan Stanley reported 15,632 brokers as of June 30, flat from the previous quarter and down about 1 percent from the prior year. Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch Wealth Management reported earlier this week that its headcount of 14,820 was essentially flat - down by 9 net brokers from last quarter and up by 9 over last year. Wells Fargo, which reported last week, said the 14,226 advisers in its retail brokerage declined by 1 percent from the prior quarter and by 2 percent over last year.

Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Christine Jockle confirmed Perry left the firm but declined to comment further. Attempts to reach Perry at his office by phone and email were unsuccessful. Perry’s departure, reported on Tuesday by the wealth management news website AdvisorHub, comes after a sexual harassment lawsuit was filed earlier this year against one of the top brokers at Perry’s Beverly Hills branch. In March, Lorena Alcantara filed a sexual harassment lawsuit in Los Angeles County against the firm and Michael Ladge, a director in Morgan Stanley’s sports and entertainment division whose clients included Katy Perry. Ladge did not respond to a message requesting comment left at his office. In a separate lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County court in July 2017, a female broker named Ivy Xiao alleged she was sexually harassed by several managers while working at Morgan Stanley, including while working at the firm’s branch in Santa Monica, California. Perry, as the complex manager, oversaw offices in Century City, Westwood and Santa Monica, in addition to Beverly Hills, according to his LinkedIn profile. Perry had worked for Morgan Stanley’s wealth management business since 1993, when he joined Citigroup’s global markets business, a firm Morgan Stanley acquired in 2009."

The move, part of a broader executive shuffle that also moved Franck Petitgas from co-head of investment banking to head of Morgan Stanley’s international business, was disclosed in an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Pick, 49, started his career at Morgan Stanley in investment banking and later moved to trading. He ran the bank's equities trading business, which became a key money-maker as it struggled in other businesses, and then helped orchestrate a difficult overhaul of its fixed income operation, which had weighed on results for years. (reut.rs/2oKRVTo) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and President Colm Kelleher, 61, who previously led the institutional securities business, called the promotion “a natural next step” for Pick in the memo. Pick’s shift to a role that Kelleher has long overseen is important because it hints at succession planning at Morgan Stanley. While there is no indication Gorman has plans to retire soon, and though Kelleher is his deputy, the process to find a next long-term CEO can take years to cement. Petitgas has also been mentioned as a potential successor among analysts, former executives and others who closely follow Morgan Stanley. In addition to Pick’s elevation, Susie Huang will become co-head of investment banking alongside Mark Eichorn, according to the memo. Petitgas previously had that role. Pick and Petitgas will report to Kelleher, while Huang and Eichorn will report to Pick. In a separate memo, Pick appointed Gokul Laroia, David Russell and Alan Thomas as global co-heads of Institutional Equities."

The promotion gives Pick, who is head of global sales and trading, oversight of investment banking in addition to trading at the bank. The appointment also moves Pick into position to perhaps succeed Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman when he retires, according to analysts. Kelleher, who is roughly the same age as Gorman, is not expected to compete to succeed Gorman. He was named president of the bank in 2016. Pick began his Morgan Stanley career in investment banking in 1990, and worked for a decade in global capital markets. He eventually led that business and then went on to lead the bank’s institutional equities business, leading Morgan Stanley to the number one position globally. In 2015 he took over fixed income commodity and currency trading and turned that business around after years of decline. “Leading ISG is a natural next step,” said Gorman and Kelleher in an internal memo obtained by IFR. Pick’s promotion is one of several at the bank. The bank also named Franck Petitgas head of international, also reporting to Kelleher in London. Franck started at Morgan Stanley in capital markets, has been co-head of investment banking since 2013. Reporting to Petitgas will be Wei Sun Christianson and Gokul Laroia, co-heads of Asia Pacific; Jon Kindred, head of Japan; John Moore, head of Latin America; and Clare Woodman, head of EMEA.

-1.7065165124833648," Japan's MUFG calls on Morgan Stanley expertise in wealth management drive TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) is drawing on the expertise of U.S. peer Morgan Stanley to help expand in the wealth management business, the head of the pair’s Japanese joint venture told Reuters. Japan’s biggest bank is “consulting with Morgan Stanley’s wealth management people about various aspects including product lineup,” Saburo Araki, chief executive officer of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co Ltd (MUMSS), said in an interview. MUMSS is a brokerage and investment bank, a product of MUFG’s $9 billion investment into Morgan Stanley at the height of a financial crisis in 2008. The Japanese bank now owns just under a quarter of its Wall Street peer. Faced with ultra-thin profit margins in Japan’s traditional lending business, MUFG has made wealth management a key growth driver, targeting clients with at least 300 million yen ($2.74 million) in assets. It aims to increase such assets under management to 16.3 trillion yen in the year through March 2024, from 12 trillion yen in the last financial year. MUFG hopes to replicate the success of Morgan Stanley which, under CEO James Gorman has turned wealth management into a growth pillar through reducing risk, exiting problematic fields and emphasizing steadier businesses generating reliable revenue. “It helps us greatly that we can use their expertise and experience,” said Araki, CEO of the joint venture since April. Araki, previously second-in-command at MUFG’s core commercial bank, also said the venture has not yet fully taken advantage of the bank’s vast client base, which includes 1.2 million individuals classed as wealthy. As such, it will step up efforts to attract commercial bank customers to higher-return products like mutual funds, he said. MUMSS was created by combining the Japanese investment banking operations of MUFG and Morgan Stanley in 2010. Its immediate parent, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co Ltd [MTFMS.UL], is now Japan’s third-largest brokerage and investment bank in terms of net operating revenue after Nomura Holdings Inc and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. “We are really happy to have made that investment and to have teamed up with a global investment bank,” Araki said, referring to the $9 billion deal. “The reason we can keep top positions in league tables is none other than Morgan Stanley.” He said MUFG has no intention of building its own investment banking franchise that would make it unnecessary to rely on Morgan Stanley. “It’s impossible. We cannot match their global network with investors and issuers,” Araki said. Asked to describe their respective roles in the venture, he said, “To put it very simply, we provide our client base and they provide solutions.” The interview took place before the securities watchdog on Friday recommended the Financial Services Agency fine MUMSS around $2 million, citing one instance of a dealer at the brokerage manipulating the bond market."
-1.1702573290377378," Morgan Stanley pays $3.6 million fine for weak investor protection rules WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N agreed to pay a $3.6 million fine on Friday after regulators found it failed to have systems in place to help it detect and prevent the misappropriation of client funds, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said. Since 2009, Morgan Stanley has allowed brokers to initiate wire transfers of as much as $100,000 from a client’s brokerage account into a third-party account so long as the adviser reported on an internal digital form that the client had requested the transfer over the phone or in person. The brokerage required some additional information and had policies in place allowing it to review some disbursement requests, the SEC said. But the regulator said the policies were insufficient in preventing one broker from misappropriating $5 million worth of clients’ money without their permission between December 2015 and November 2016. Former Morgan Stanley broker Barry Connell was arrested in February 2017 and faces criminal charges in a federal court in New York related to the alleged misappropriations. His case is pending. As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley did not admit or deny the SEC’s findings. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Christine Jockle said the firm was happy to have reached the settlement. “Morgan Stanley has strengthened and will continue to improve its controls against fraudulent conduct to ensure the safety of our clients’ assets,” Jockle said in an emailed statement."

-2.9917304984312967," Ex-Morgan Stanley adviser sentenced to U.S. prison for fraud BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley MS.N adviser was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Thursday after he admitted that he misused client funds to invest in and support a wind farm project that a friend had decided to start. Cornelius Peterson, 29, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston, who said the former financial adviser deserved a significant prison term for misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars from two clients’ accounts. “You were someone who didn’t need the money,” Gorton said. “Well, today you find that fraud and financial crimes that hurt people don’t go unpunished.” Peterson, who pleaded guilty in February to investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, did not speak during the hearing. In a letter to Gorton, Peterson said he was “ashamed and remorseful.” His lawyer, Carol Starkey, in court argued that he played a minor role in a scheme that his supervisor orchestrated. Peterson’s boss in Morgan Stanley’s Boston office, James Polese, pleaded guilty in April to related charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August. According to his lawyers, in 2013 Peterson became friendly with an entrepreneur investing in wind farm projects and offered to help him raise money for a private equity fund called Commonwealth Bay that would invest in them. In 2014, Peterson, who had become a member of the fund’s board of directors, transferred $100,000 from the account of one of his clients without his permission to invest in a wind farm project, prosecutors said. He did so along with Polese, who had become an investor in the project, which needed financing, prosecutors said. Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an 86-year-old long-time client of Morgan Stanley to back a letter of credit in support of the wind farm project, prosecutors said. In addition, both men without approval in 2016 transferred $350,000 from that same client’s account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese’s own and family’s expenses, according to court papers. “Mr. Peterson took advantage of his clients and took their money for his own uses,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Bloom said. New York-based Morgan Stanley fired both men in June 2017. The bank has said that it immediately terminated them after uncovering their misconduct and reported the matter to authorities. In addition to the prison sentence, Peterson must pay $462,000 in restitution jointly with Polese."

The ruling by the Court of Accounts published on Friday was made on April 19. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. “This court does not have jurisdiction,” reads an excerpt from the ruling obtained by Reuters. The administrative court can appeal.

Morgan Stanley had denied any wrongdoing and its lawyers had argued that a civil court should have had jurisdiction. The case centers on Morgan Stanley derivative transactions made by the Italian state between 1995 and 2005 and terminated in December 2011 and January 2012. The interest rate derivatives were meant as a form of insurance for the Italian government, one of the most heavily indebted in Europe, in the event that market rates rose. Instead, after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, interest rates plunged, and the state incurred large losses on its derivative positions as it was able to borrow more cheaply in the bond markets. State prosecutors had argued that some contracts negotiated with Morgan Stanley were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank. “It cannot be held that the derivatives contracts being contested constitute a violation of law,” reads an excerpt from the 80-page document that explains the ruling. Morgan Stanley has repeatedly said the claim is groundless, and in August 2016 the bank rejected a settlement proposal from an Italian prosecutor for a one-off payment, a securities filing showed.

Speaking at a conference hosted by the Wall Street bank in New York, Gorman said that in 2015, he thought that the fixed income division, one of the bank’s smallest, was its “most attractive business” because it stood to see rapid growth if interest rates rose and there was more volatility in markets. “I thought actually fixed income is the most exciting business if (those) two things happen,” Gorman said. Indeed, Morgan Stanley’s fixed income group has seen positive returns in recent quarters. Last year, the bank set a target to produce $1 billion in quarterly fixed-income revenue, on average, each year.

In an opinion on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly said he could not resolve Morgan Stanley’s bid to force the dispute into arbitration because a genuine dispute exists over whether the reservist, Rajesh Gupta, received the arbitration agreement the firm is trying to enforce.

-8.42797874273311," Morgan Stanley seeks new court in Italian derivatives case ROME (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N on Thursday asked to have a lawsuit against it for 2.7 billion euros ($3.34 billion) in damages thrown out of an Italian administrative court, an Italian judge said. At the opening of the trial in Rome, the U.S. investment bank the other defendants asked a three-judge panel at the Court of Accounts, which rules on abuses of public funds, to reject the case in an acknowledgement that the judges do not have jurisdiction, Marco Fratini, one of the judges, said. The defendants, who deny any wrongdoing, maintain the issue should be reviewed by a civil court. The U.S. investment bank maintains that derivatives contracts signed with Italy’s Treasury that led to losses belong in a civil court, not the Court of Accounts, which rules on abuses of public funds, sources close to the case said before the hearing began. If the Court of Accounts accepts the claim, the state would then have three months to bring the case before a new tribunal. At the end of Thursday’s hearing, the head of the panel of magistrates, Piera Maggi, said a ruling would be made within 45 days. The Morgan Stanley derivative transactions were made between 1995 and 2005 and were terminated in December 2011 and January 2012, Morgan Stanley said in a securities filing. The interest-rate derivatives were meant as a form of insurance for the Italian government, one of the most heavily indebted in Europe, in the event that market rates rose. Instead, after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, interest rates plunged, and the state incurred large losses on its derivative positions as it was able to borrow more cheaply in the bond markets. The Court of Accounts prosecutors argue that some contracts negotiated with Morgan Stanley were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank. Morgan Stanley says the claim is groundless, and in August, 2016, the bank rejected a settlement proposal from an Italian prosecutor for a one-off payment, a securities filing showed. The case includes claims worth 1.18 billion euros against two senior officials - former public debt chief Maria Cannata and Treasury chief administrator Vincenzo La Via - and former finance ministers Domenico Siniscalco and Vittorio Grilli. These defendants also challenged the jurisdiction of the trial on Thursday, Fratini said. A Treasury spokesman said in July that it had full faith in the work undertaken by its managers and trusted that the court could clear up these matters. Siniscalco and Grilli declined to comment. Compensation orders by the Court of Accounts can be appealed. Once confirmed, they are legally enforceable through asset seizures, if necessary."

-4.612650897892634," Morgan Stanley executives tamp down enthusiasm on record profit (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley MS.N reported record first-quarter profit on Wednesday thanks to a surge in trading activity, much like other Wall Street banks, but executives warned results through the rest of the year may not be quite as strong. Capital markets flourished during the first few months of 2018 as major economies expanded around the globe and U.S. interest rates rose, with bouts of volatility proving generally positive for trading. As investors flocked to stock, bond, commodity and currency markets to adjust their portfolios, Morgan Stanley’s broader institutional securities business reported its best results since 2007. Trading revenue soared 26 percent to $4.4 billion, topping Morgan Stanley’s chief rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, in dollar terms. However, the early days of the second quarter have been defined more by geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts and debates about the direction of yields, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. That bodes less well for trading revenue, especially since the first quarter is seasonally the strongest. “If Morgan Stanley’s strategy could be defined simply, it would be that we will do fine when the markets are tough and we would do well when the markets are good,” Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on a call with analysts. “There are others who might do better when the markets are good. That’s fine. What I care about is how we do when the markets are tough.” Morgan Stanley can generate at least $7.5 billion in revenue in a worst-case scenario, Gorman said, thanks to steps he has taken to grow more consistent income streams, like wealth management. Overall, Morgan Stanley’s quarterly profit rose 40 percent year-over-year to $2.6 billion, or $1.45 per share, easily topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.25 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 14 percent to $11.1 billion. Analysts were generally positive on the results. In a report titled “Firing on All Cylinders,” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said Morgan Stanley had beat estimates in nearly all of its businesses. Morgan Stanley shares rose 0.8 percent to $53.65 in morning trading. Its report followed similarly sunny earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Goldman Sachs. Unlike Morgan Stanley’s Pruzan, Goldman’s finance chief had said he believed the market trends that led to the blockbuster quarter were sustainable. Gorman, 59, joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 as head of wealth management. He became CEO in 2010, as the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis. His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and emphasizing steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue. During the call, Gorman made frequent references to how far Morgan Stanley has come since he took the helm, calling it a “different planet now.” He noted that when he joined, the bank’s wealth business generated $1.25 million in quarterly revenue, a tiny fraction of the $4.4 billion it printed last quarter. Overall, Morgan Stanley had been generating returns-on-equity of just 2 percent or so, compared with the annualized return of 14.9 percent last quarter. That means it is well above the 10 percent minimum investors generally like to see, above the 10 percent to 13 percent target range Gorman set a few months ago, and close to Goldman Sachs, which reported a 15.4 percent return-on-equity in the first quarter. Asked by analysts whether the target should be raised, Gorman said it would be “silly” to change so quickly, but that he would re-evaluate if Morgan Stanley generates returns above that range through the rest of the year. “Philosophically, the target range is supposed to represent a normal set of outcomes under kind of tough market environment and a good market environment,” he said. “This was a very good market environment.”"

-4.612650897892634," Breakingviews - Morgan Stanley hands investors volatility challenge NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Morgan Stanley is lumping its shareholders with a volatility challenge. In the first quarter the $94 billion Wall Street firm defended key turf against a surge from rivals and more than doubled fixed-income trading revenue from the last three months of 2017. That – and tax cuts – helped generate its best results in years, handily beating Chief Executive James Gorman’s admittedly underwhelming targets. The dilemma for investors is whether that merits a higher valuation. The bank’s most recent earnings back up the notion that the overhaul Gorman instituted in 2015 is working. The fixed-income trading unit’s $1.9 billion top line, compared with $800 million in a slow fourth quarter, shows it does have “significant potential upside,” as Gorman put it in January, when volatility picks up. Retaining its four-year-long ranking as the biggest equity trader was important, too. Morgan Stanley could only manage half the 70 percent or so growth since December racked up by closest rivals Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. But with $2.6 billion in revenue, Gorman’s bank remains comfortably ahead – and just pipped Goldman to stay top of the equity underwriting heap. That, along with a wealth-management arm that cranked out a respectable 26.5 percent pre-tax margin, contributed to a 14.9 percent annualized return on equity for the first quarter. That’s only just behind Goldman and JPMorgan and handily bests Gorman’s self-imposed goal of a 10 percent to 13 percent rate of return. It presents shareholders with another quandary. They are already struggling to decide which of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to ascribe a higher multiple to: both trade just shy of 1.4 times current book value. On last quarter’s showing alone, both might warrant an upgrade to the just over 1.6 times that JPMorgan sports. Trouble is, glimmers of improvements in industry-wide trading revenue – especially in fixed income, currency and commodities – have proven illusory in the past. Tax cuts, economic growth, diverging central bank policies around the world and growing instability in international political relations could all contribute to volatility being here to stay. Shareholders who have been burned before know to tread cautiously."
