-17.901234567901238," Canadian miner Eldorado signs revised contract with Greece for Kassandra Mines ATHENS (Reuters) - Canada’s Eldorado Gold Corp on Friday signed a revised contract with Greece covering its mining operations in the north of the country, where it has faced repeated stalling over licensing delays and environmental concerns. Eldorado has been in talks with the Greek government on a revised investment plan that would secure higher royalties from mining development and new jobs. Shares in the company gained nearly 9% on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the amended agreement that includes an investment plan for the miner’s Skouries, Olympias and Stratoni/Mavres Petres mines and facilities in northern Greece, collectively the Kassandra Mines. The contract will now allow for completion of construction at Skouries and transition of the project into production, expansion of Olympias to 650,000 tonnes per annum, further investment in exploration at Mavres Petres-Stratoni, among others, Eldorado said. The investment plan has been revised to $3.1 billion from $1.4 billion, all the three mines will remain open and will be upgraded, while a total of 3,070 of workers will be employed, up from 1,650 today, Greek Energy Minister Kostas Skrekas said. Under the revised contract, Eldorado will submit a new proposal for building a gold processing plant in 12-24 months, while there will be a 10% rise in royalties for Greece, Skrekas added. Greece’s conservative government has pledged to unblock foreign investment to lift an economy that shrank by a quarter during a decade-long financial crisis, and help recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic."

-15.011820330969272," Exclusive: Greece seeks new mining jobs, higher royalties in talks with Eldorado ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece is in talks with Canada’s Eldorado Gold Corp to secure higher royalties from its mining development projects and new jobs, Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis said on Monday. Vancouver-based miner Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece and its planned investment is viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years. The projects have, however, repeatedly stalled over licensing delays and environmental concerns. They have become flagship schemes for Greece’s new conservative government, which took office in July with a pledge to unblock foreign investments and help boost economic output crimped by a quarter through years of financial turmoil. Early this month, the government issued installation permits for Eldorado’s Skouries project. “We want to move ahead with a contract which, on the one hand, will send a business-friendly message, and on the other hand, a contract that will secure more jobs, more royalties and clear environmental protection for the region in line with European standards,” Hatzidakis told Reuters. “There are negotiations right now. What we have told Eldorado Gold is that we don’t want these negotiations to slow down, but it also depends on the proposals they will present. We cannot reach an agreement at any expense.” One standoff between the previous leftist-led administration and Eldorado was over the company’s plan to build a metallurgical plant to process ores mined in Skouries. The government had said that plan was deficient. Eldorado is open to revisiting royalty rates in the country, Chief Executive George Burns said on Monday at an industry conference in Denver, Colorado. “The royalty scheme in Greece, I would say, is modestly in the middle of the range worldwide for countries, so we are open to discussions about that,” he said in an interview. He said the company is awaiting a permit for its dry-stack tailings and a separate approval for relocating antiquities at the project site. Eldorado will seek a strategic partner to help fund the remaining $680 million in development costs at Skouries while retaining the role of project operator, Burns said. New Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said that the government could revise the contract to possibly include a new investment by Eldorado in another Greek region. Mitsotakis has also been keen to speed up privatizations in the energy sector, including natural gas utility DEPA, which is 65% state-owned. The previous government passed legislation that split DEPA operations, with the aim to sell a 50.1% stake in its commercial business and a minority stake in its distribution networks across Greece. Hatzidakis said he would soon amend that law to allow for the sale of majority stakes both in DEPA’s retail operations and its distribution grid. “We have indications that there will be strong (investor) interest.” Hatzidakis, 54, a former European Union parliament member, has been tasked to work on a rescue plan for state-owned Public Power Corp (PPC) which has been struggling with 2.7 billion euros ($2.99 billion) of unpaid bills from customers unable to pay during the country’s financial crisis. Authorities increased electricity rates and reduced discounts offered to customers who paid on time in September in an attempt to plug a cash shortfall estimated at more than 900 million euros. Hatzidakis also pledged that the state would settle subsidies owed to PPC in return for providing cheap electricity to vulnerable customers and remote islands. “It’s about 200 million euros and will be paid in the coming months,” he said. Under its post-bailout commitment with its international lenders, Greece has agreed that PPC will sell power to its peers at below-cost prices to help open up the sector via the so-called NOME auctions. Hatzidakis says this has cost the utility about 600 million euros and the NOME auctions would be scrapped. The government has been discussing with its lenders alternative structural measures for PPC and the energy market, which included the gradual decommissioning of coal-fired plants and the partial privatization of the power distribution grid, Hatzidakis said. “NOME will be scrapped and the auction which is scheduled for October will not take place,” he said. “The government needs to have finalised structural measures for the energy market and PPC by the end of October, mid-November.”"

-11.771058315334772," Greece issues permits for Eldorado Gold's Skouries and Olympias mine (Reuters) - Canadian miner Eldorado Gold Corp on Tuesday said it has received installation permits for its stalled Skouries mine project, and Olympias mines from the Greece’s Ministry of Energy and Environment. The permit will allow for the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment in the Skouries mine, which has struggled with permit delays for years. Greece’s new conservative government on Monday said it will soon issue permits for Eldorado Gold’s development in northern Greece. Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece, and its planned investment in Greece has been viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years. Eldorado said it is working with the Greek government to achieve conditions required to restart full construction at Skouries, including a stable regulatory framework and protections for foreign investors as well as approval for subsequent permits and technical studies. The company said it is also seeking approval to build a dry-stack tailings facility at the project. Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing mainly environmental permit delays. Separately, the permit for its Olympias mine allows for installation of an upgraded electrical substation and construction of support facilities, it said in a statement."
162.9834254143646," Eldorado Gold shares up 14% on optimism over Greek snap election TORONTO (Reuters) - Shares of Eldorado Gold rose as much as 14.6% on Monday on optimism that a snap poll called by Greece could result in the election of a new business-friendly party and help resolve permitting problems the miner has faced for years. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he would call a snap vote following his party’s defeat in European Parliamentary elections to the opposition conservative New Democracy Party. Eldorado shares were up 13.7% at C$4.74 in afternoon trade in Toronto, compared with a 0.3% decline in the benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index. The stock earlier rose to the day’s high of C$4.78. The Vancouver-based company has two operating mines and two development projects in Greece, and has struggled with permitting delays at its Skouries location for years, mainly over environmental regulations. The country accounts for 42% of Eldorado’s operating net asset value, according to Desjardins. “A political shift to a more pro-business climate has potential positive implications for the company’s outlook in-country,” Josh Wolfson, an analyst at Desjardins, wrote in a note. Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing the delays. The company said in September it would seek 750 million euros ($839.03 million) from the government for damages it said it had suffered due to the delays. An Eldorado spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eldorado Chief Executive George Raymond Burns said on an analyst call in February that the company was “feeling fairly optimistic that the election process could bring about a significant change in sentiment.” ($1 = 0.8939 euros)"

The differences between Eldorado and the government over the miner’s plans to produce gold and other metals in the northern Greek region of Halkidiki have dragged on for years, mainly over environmental regulations. “We hope that this matter can be resolved in an amicable manner without needing to go down the route of arbitration,” said Chief Executive George Burns in a statement. Eldorado has blamed Greece for long delays in issuing necessary permits, while Athens said the company submitted a deficient plan to build a metallurgical plant that will process ores mined in Skouries and Olympias. But the company said in April that an arbitration panel in Greece has ruled it has a valid technical plan to build a metallurgy plant to process concentrate mined from Skouries and Olympias. Eldorado froze investment and suspended operations at its Skouries project last November, citing years of permit delays."
