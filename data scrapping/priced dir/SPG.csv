27.697294335175794," Simon Property forecasts higher annual profit as rent collection improves (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc forecast a rise in its 2021 profit on Monday as the U.S. mall operator benefits from improving rent collection and a recovery in the retail industry, pushing its shares up 2% in extended trading. Sales of some brick-and-mortar retailers have risen from the pandemic troughs plumbed last year thanks to the launch of online shopping options and government stimulus checks to support household income. That has helped retailers meet their rental obligations, with Simon saying it had collected 90% of combined the second, third and fourth-quarter net billed rents as of Feb. 5. It had garnered only 85% of third-quarter net billed rents as of Nov. 6. Simon forecast 2021 earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.85, compared with $3.59 per share in 2020. However, the company wrote-off, abated or deferred about $850 million, or nearly 18%, of its contractual rents due from the second through fourth quarters of 2020 as some tenants held back on payments. “We still, even to this day, have a handful of large tenants unfortunately, that have yet to resolve their receivables,” Chief Executive Officer David Simon said on a call with analysts. “Are we completely out of the woods? Not yet, but we’re well on our way.” Lease income slumped nearly 24% to $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, missing analysts’ estimates of $1.08 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Funds from operation of $2.17 per share also missed estimates of $2.22."

41.48264614683253," Simon Property cuts purchase price for Taubman stake amid COVID hit (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N, the biggest U.S. mall operator, will cut its purchase price for an 80% stake of rival Taubman Centers Inc TCO.N by 18%, both companies said on Sunday, as the coronavirus upends the retail industry sector. The agreed discount comes as the two companies settled a legal dispute over the transaction, which Simon had previously threatened to walk away from, citing the hit to the industry from COVID-19. Under the revised terms, Simon will pay $2.65 billion for the 80% stake in the Taubman Realty Group (TRG), cutting its offer price to $43 per share in cash from $52.50 originally announced in February. The Taubman family will sell about one-third of its ownership interest at the transaction price, leaving them with a 20% stake in TRG, the companies added. The companies said they also have settled their pending litigation in a Michigan court over the merger and the companies expect the deal to close later this year or early next year. Simon, which runs shopping chains such as the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, said in June it was abandoning the deal. Simon said at that time the coronavirus outbreak had “disproportionately hurt” Taubman’s malls given their location in densely populated metropolitan areas and reliance on tourism. Online shopping growth had already slashed foot traffic at brick-and-mortar retail stores and the pandemic has only accelerated that trend. Simon also said Taubman did not cut costs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Taubman had said Simon’s termination of the deal was without merit and filed a lawsuit rejecting Simon’s allegations."
31.69091068061999," Simon Property's results miss due to unpaid rents, retail bankruptcies (Reuters) - America's largest mall operator Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N on Monday missed quarterly estimates for earnings and lease income, as retailers ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic shut stores, paid lower rents or delayed payments. The company’s shares, which closed up nearly 30% following the success of drugmaker Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine raising hopes that shoppers could return to malls, were down about 5% after the closing bell. Simon’s properties, that include malls and lifestyle centers in the United States, were forced to close during pandemic-led lockdowns and the company was left behind with months of unpaid rents and bankruptcy of some of its biggest tenants. “We still have some unresolved amounts with certain larger national tenants who unfortunately are refusing to pay their contractual rent even though they are open and operating,” Chief Executive Officer David Simon told analysts. The company sued some retailers, including Gap Inc GPS.N, earlier this year for having failed to pay rents. Simon said the leasing environment was improving, with the mall operator signing long-term and pop-up lease deals with leading brands, including names like Prada, Ferrari and UGG. For the third quarter, however, mall and premium outlet occupancy was 91.4%, down from 92.9% recorded in the previous quarter, largely due to bankruptcies of some of its biggest tenants. Consumers wearing masks and following safety protocols were beginning to return to malls, Simon said, but warned that there were no guarantees the trend would continue as coronavirus cases hit new records in the U.S. Lease income fell about 24% to $993.8 million, compared with the estimate of $1.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Funds from operations was at $2.05 per share, well below the estimate of $2.28."

21.324662999081767," Mall owner Simon adds intriguing new claim in Taubman MAE case (Reuters) - Covering M&A litigation in the COVID-19 era can be a little like shopping in a luxury mall – your attention is constantly being diverted by something new. One minute it’s Victoria’s Secret. The next it’s Tiffany and Louis Vuitton. Shiny objects abound. I used the shopping mall analogy advisedly. Remember the busted $3.6 billion merger in which the mall operator Simon Property Group was to acquire the luxury mall developer Taubman Centers? Their Feb. 9 contract, signed in the early days of COVID-19, anticipated the possibility of a pandemic: The merger agreement’s material adverse effect clause shifted the risk of a viral outbreak onto Simon, the acquirer. Nevertheless, in June, Simon sued Taubman to terminate the deal, alleging that Taubman’s high-end properties were so disproportionately hurt by COVID-19 that, despite the deal agreement’s risk-shifting provision, the target company had experienced an MAE. Taubman soon thereafter filed a countersuit to force Simon to complete the merger or, alternatively, pay Taubman damages for the premium its shareholders would have received if the deal went through. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. The litigation is taking place in Oakland County Superior Court in Michigan, outside of the Delaware Chancery Court spotlight for M&A litigation. Lawyers in the case, led by Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison for Simon and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz for Taubman, have mostly engaged in the discovery disputes. But with the case headed for a Nov. 16 trial date, Simon added an interesting new twist to the case: It asserted in an amended complaint last week that after the litigation was well under way, Taubman breached the very merger agreement it is asking the court to enforce. According to Simon’s new theory, even if Taubman is right and Simon improperly attempted to terminate the deal in June, Taubman's own subsequent actions preclude enforcement of the merger agreement. The new allegation is based on Taubman’s renegotiation of credit facilities that provide $1.625 billion in liquidity to the company. As Taubman explained in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August, COVID-19 risk prompted the company to reach new agreements with its lenders that include ""a secured interest in certain unencumbered assets."" According to Simon’s new complaint, Taubman’s renegotiated deal with lenders will “substantially reduce its financial and operational flexibility,” granting the banks a mortgage on two of Taubman’s most valuable properties if the company’s finances deteriorate. Simon alleges that its merger contract with Taubman required Taubman to get Simon’s approval before making material changes in the operation of its business. The renegotiated credit facility agreements, Simon asserts, are a material change, and Taubman didn’t even notify Simon before entering the new deals with lenders. Therefore, according to Simon, Taubman violated the M&A agreement. That alleged breach, it argued in the new complaint, provides an independent reason for Oakland County Circuit Court Judge James Alexander to release Simon from the deal to buy Taubman. A Taubman spokesman declined to provide a statement on Simon’s amended complaint. We’ve seen lots of COVID-19 deal litigation contending that targets breached M&A agreements by failing to operate their businesses in the ordinary course. But I can’t remember another disillusioned acquirer asserting that a target company committed an entirely new breach of operating covenants after the onset of litigation, thus – in Simon’s view – providing the acquirer with a whole new reason to ditch the deal. Taubman, of course, can argue that its amended agreements with its lenders were the epitome of good management. The merger agreement it signed with Simon and is trying to enforce in court in Michigan required Taubman to operate the business in a way that would retain the value of the enterprise. I expect Taubman to claim that it renegotiated its credit facility to do just that. Moreover, the early record of the case shows that Simon disagreed with many of Taubman’s key operating decisions leading into Simon’s termination of the deal, which could lend weight to potential arguments by Taubman that it would have been pointless to consult Simon on renegotiations with its lenders, particularly after Simon claimed the merger deal was off. What would be really interesting would be a split decision from the Oakland County judge, finding that Simon was not entitled initially to walk away from the merger but that Taubman subsequently breached the deal agreement. The Detroit suburbs of Oakland County, Michigan may not be epicenter of big-time M&A dealmaking. But there’s going to be a lot of attention focused there in November."
39.184320735092314," J.C. Penney reaches tentative rescue deal, averting liquidation NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc reached a tentative deal with landlords and lenders valued at $1.75 billion (1.35 billion pounds) to rescue the beleaguered department store chain from bankruptcy proceedings, averting a liquidation that would have threatened roughly 70,000 jobs and represented one of the most significant business collapses following the coronavirus pandemic, a company lawyer said. Mall owners Simon Property Group Inc and Brookfield Property Partners LP have teamed up to acquire J.C. Penney’s retail operations and are putting the finishing touches on an agreement, Joshua Sussberg, a Kirkland & Ellis LLP lawyer representing the company, said during a brief court hearing Wednesday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. The deal would carve J.C. Penney into three pieces. In addition to the retail operations the landlords are purchasing, lenders would take control of two other entities housing some J.C. Penney stores and the retailer’s distribution centers. The landlords are poised to put $300 million toward the rescue and have agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with J.C. Penney, he said. The operating company they are acquiring would assume $500 million of debt. J.C. Penney plans to move at “lightning speed” to seek approval of the deal from a bankruptcy judge in early October, Sussberg said. “We are in a position to move this into the endzone,” he told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones, noting that previous talks were in the “red zone” before faltering and then gaining renewed traction. J.C. Penney expects to emerge from bankruptcy before the 2020 holiday season, the company said. The restructured retailer is expected to operate about 650 stores, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Hedge funds and private-equity firms financing J.C. Penney’s bankruptcy would take ownership of 161 of those stores and separate distribution centers after forgiving portions of the Plano, Texas-based company’s $5 billion debt load, Sussberg said. These lenders, led by H/2 Capital Partners, would own those assets in two separate property companies. J.C. Penney is also in discussions with Wells Fargo & Co for roughly $2 billion to finance its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings, Sussberg said. In the end, J.C. Penney will have about $1 billion of cash to fund its business when the deal closes, Sussberg said. The iconic 118-year-old retailer, which went public at the start of the Great Depression, filed for bankruptcy in a Texas court in May after the pandemic forced it to temporarily close its then nearly 850 stores. Should it survive, J.C. Penney will have withstood unprecedented economic turmoil stemming from the pandemic and bankruptcy proceedings that have felled other retailers during less fraught times. In recent years, Toys ‘R’ Us Inc and Barneys New York Inc failed to reorganize under bankruptcy protection and liquidated. A deal is not yet completed, Sussberg cautioned. Talks with the landlords have hit roadblocks before, and the parties engaged in screaming matches as recently as Wednesday, he said. Negotiations continued during phone calls moments before the court hearing, he added. If the discussions fall apart, J.C. Penney would likely be on course for liquidation, people familiar with the negotiations said. Sussberg expressed optimism a deal would be codified and the judge encouraged the parties to keep working to seal an agreement. Simon, Brookfield and a lawyer for the lenders did not respond to earlier requests for comment. J.C. Penney’s survival hinges on the sale negotiations, which have consumed the summer and drawn urgent directives from the company’s bankruptcy judge for parties to set aside what he labeled egos and negotiating postures to consummate a deal to save the beleaguered retailer. The talks have dragged on for weeks in part amid haggling over lease terms, the people said. In late August, the discussions with Simon and Brookfield reached an impasse, prompting J.C. Penney to ask lenders to take control of its retail operations in addition to the real estate investment trusts they envisioned owning. After further discussions, the company reached a deal with Simon and Brookfield to buy the retail operations. Any deal would require approval from the company’s bankruptcy judge and be subject to competing bids in a looming court-supervised auction. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners and Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co also vied for J.C. Penney’s retail business earlier this summer, according to people familiar with the matter. For Simon and Brookfield, the deal talks reflect a dramatic shift following the pandemic that is pushing them to rescue faltering retailers occupying malls they own across the United States. The demise of large tenants such as J.C. Penney would deprive them of rent and also potentially trigger contract clauses allowing other retailers to pay them less or break their leases altogether, further darkening malls. Simon, the largest mall operator in the United States, has already this year negotiated separate deals to rescue the two-centuries-old men’s apparel clothier Brooks Brothers and denim retailer Lucky Brand from bankruptcy. Brookfield in May said it would devote $5 billion to non-controlling investments designed to revitalize retailers struggling in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has forced Neiman Marcus Group and J. Crew Group Inc to seek bankruptcy protection, and even retailers that have avoided restructurings, such as Gap Inc, have at times stopped paying rent or tried to negotiate lower payments."

Coronavirus-related lockdowns have been good for the $130 billion video game industry. Homebound gamers helped fuel revenue surges at industry heavyweights like Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. Spending on video games in the United States reached $1.2 billion in June, the highest June total in over a decade, according to research firm NPD. However, the industry is also grappling with remote-working challenges. On Tuesday 343 Industries, part of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Studios, delayed the release of “Halo Infinite”, a science fiction shoot-’em-up, to 2021. The company blamed development challenges “including the ongoing Covid-related impacts”. This could be a significant blow: The last big-ticket instalment of “Halo” pulled in more than $400 million in its first week, according to the Verge. Gaming companies have so far adapted relatively well to lockdown; Ubisoft’s annual report noted a “manageable” effect on production schedules. More delays could be a problem going into the lucrative holiday season. (By Oliver Taslic) ZOOMED OUT. Marc Benioff’s Salesforce.com has offloaded a stake in Zoom Video Communications it bought in the video-conferencing outfit’s initial public offering, according to a company filing. Salesforce snapped up $100 million of the stock when Zoom went public in April 2019, according to news reports. The company’s ventures arm also bought shares in the Dropbox and SurveyMonkey IPOs, according to CNBC. Though the exact dates of Salesforce’s second-quarter sales aren’t available, Zoom has been a big beneficiary of remote communication during coronavirus lockdowns. It went public at $36 a share. Between April and June 2020, the stock traded between $109 and $262, by Refinitiv data. Salesforce made three to seven times its investment in around a year. Zoom’s stock is currently below where it ended the second quarter. Whether Benioff’s crew picked the top may become clearer when Salesforce reports its second-quarter numbers in a couple of weeks’ time. For now, it appears to have made the most of the pandemic. (By Richard Beales) SIMON AND BROOKS. Lockdowns caused by Covid-19 may be crushing mall shopping, but it isn’t stopping Simon Property from shifting its strategy. The $21 billion U.S. shopping-center owner, a so-called real estate investment trust, is buying Brooks Brothers out of bankruptcy with Authentic Brands for $325 million. Tenants of Simon and other landlords are trying to pull out of leases and shutter stores, and Simon’s interest in having more control over their payments predates the pandemic. A deal in February to buy Forever 21, also with Authentic Brands, suggests that it is becoming ever more eager to go further than usual to ensure its bills are paid. Meanwhile boss David Simon’s decision to walk away from one of his company’s commitments in July, ditching a deal to buy rival mall owner Taubman Centers, isn’t exactly a vote of confidence in his day job. Without shoppers trotting back into malls, there is only so much Simon can do. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin) DELIVERY BOOM. Online retailers have made the most of lockdown. Fashion group ASOS said on Wednesday that sales and pre-tax profit in the current financial year would significantly exceed market expectations. One reason is fewer returned items. The other is a surge in demand for workout gear from its main client base, shoppers in their twenties, while they were housebound. Something similar happened in America, where sweatpant sales leapt 80% in April compared with a month earlier, according to the New York Times. Sweatpants may come in handy given surging demand for food to be delivered to doorsteps. Just Eat Takeaway.com, the delivery company that in June offered to buy American Grubhub, reported adjusted EBITDA of 177 million euros in the first half of the year, two-fifths more than analysts had expected. With people yet to return to their pre-coronavirus habits, comfort eating and comfy clothes may remain in high demand. (By Aimee Donnellan and Karen Kwok) BAD RECORD. Britain’s second-quarter recession was brutal. GDP shrank by a record 20.4% compared with the first three months of the year, official data showed on Wednesday. That was worse than even the hardest-hit euro zone country, Spain. The explanation is simple. The tough UK lockdown lasted for more of the second quarter than similar measures in the four biggest euro zone countries and the United States. Still, British GDP has fallen by more than any other Group of Seven industrial nation even over the first half of 2020. A recovery started in June. How fast will it be? The Bank of England predicted last week that GDP won’t exceed its pre-Covid peak until the end of 2021. Finance minister Rishi Sunak opposes extending a furlough scheme that expires in October. Other stimulus plans may be needed to ensure the rebound is no slower. (By Swaha Pattanaik) CLIPPED WINGS. The skies remain dark for Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific. The troubled air carrier recorded a $1.3 billion net loss for the first half of 2020. Chairman Patrick Healy called the period “the most challenging the group has ever faced”, as travel restrictions slashed passenger numbers by 76% year-on-year, with recovery nowhere in sight. Its only hope now is freight. The airline had an 8.8% boost in cargo revenue, in line with regional peers. Singapore Airlines enjoyed a 35% jump in the same category in the second quarter, while Taiwan media reported that the island’s China Airlines avoided a loss entirely due to record income from hauling goods. However, the freight fairy tale might be short-lived as fees return to normal. Cathay shares are now trading at around a quarter of their 2010 peak, and its home market remains in deep recession. It may not regain altitude any time soon. (By Jamie Lo)"
22.66661558850022," Mall owner Simon Property profit disappoints as pandemic cuts shopping days (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Monday, hurt by unpaid rent from retailers across its U.S. malls who suffered a total loss of 10,500 shopping days due to coronavirus-led lockdowns. The pandemic has ravaged the business of many retailers that were forced to shut shops to curb the virus from spreading, and driven quite a few to bankruptcy, including brands such as Brooks Brothers and J.C. Penney that Simon houses. With lockdown restrictions now easing, some retailers are witnessing a recovery, Chief Executive Officer David Simon said, adding that shoppers’ response to reopened malls was encouraging. Currently, all of Simon’s U.S. malls have reopened, except for seven that were recently closed in California. “We’ve been generally encouraged ... particularly in certain locations where there’s been a steady improvement in traffic with many tenants reporting sales better than their initial expectations.” Simon also said he would not comment on market speculations following a report by the Wall Street Journal that online retail giant Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Simon were in talks to convert some stores in malls into distribution hubs. “More and more retailers are distributing their e-commerce orders from their stores... they’re fulfilling from their stores. That’s a good trend in long term for us.” For the second quarter ended June 30, Simon’s total revenue fell 24% to $1.06 billion. The company said it has collected about 51% of its contractual rent billed for April and May combined, about 69% for June and about 73% for July from its U.S. retail portfolio. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders nearly halved to $254.2 million, or 83 cents per share.

22.66661558850022," Top U.S. mall operator Simon faces pandemic pain (Reuters) - Surging COVID-19 infections in big states like California, Texas and Florida are scaring shoppers away from newly reopened malls, dealing a blow to an industry that was on the ropes even before the pandemic began. Simon Property Group SPG.N, the No. 1 U.S. mall owner, is expected to post its smallest quarterly profit in nearly six years on Monday, as the plunge in foot traffic and early government-mandated closures resulted in tenants being unable or unwilling to pay full rent. “The upcoming earnings for mall owners could be one of the worst quarters ever,” said Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Floris van Dijkum. The pain from a slew of major retail bankruptcies, including Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers, and hundreds of store closures from department stores Macy's M.N and Nordstrom JWN.N and others is far from over for shopping malls, as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers that were already losing sales to online competitors. Simon has full or partial ownership in seven of the nation’s top 10 malls, as measured by sales of mall tenants. Its indoor malls in pandemic-ravaged states have been hit particularly hard. Foot traffic was down more than 50% at Houston’s upscale Galleria and at Miami’s Aventura Mall in mid-July, according to cellphone tracking data provided by Unacast. Even Simon’s outdoor Sawgrass Mills outlet center in Florida, the No. 1 U.S. mall, was not immune, with traffic in mid-July off 37% as COVID-19 infections spiked. But at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, an outdoor mall in New York, where infections are in check, the decline was only 8%.

It had nearly $4 billion of cash or cash equivalents at the end of March. But analysts say it has a mighty battle ahead as its retail tenants fight for their lives. Simon did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters reported in June that Indianapolis-based Simon and peer Brookfield Property Partners BPY.O were in joint talks to bid on J.C. Penney, a major department store anchor for malls that filed for bankruptcy in May and whose survival hinges on urgent sale negotiations. “When you have to start buying your tenants, you’re in a big problem,” said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management. “It’s the complete antithesis of being a landlord. The only reason one would buy a retailer is because it’s the least worst option and they know they won’t be able to lease that space to anyone else,” he said. It is not, however, Simon's first stab at buying a retailer. Simon and Brookfield, along with a third company, acquired teen apparel chain Forever 21 last February, and Simon in 2016 was part of a consortium that bought another teen apparel retailer, Aeropostale here. On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, reported that Simon and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O are exploring converting mall space formerly occupied by J.C. Penney and Sears Holding Corp into Amazon distribution centers. Simon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company has a policy of not commenting on rumors or speculation. Sears and J.C. Penney both declined to comment. The challenges now are intense. Companies like Coach handbag maker Tapestry Inc TPR.N smarting from falling store traffic say mall retailers need rent reductions to survive. Mall rents, which grew 2.5% annually over the past four years, could fall as much as 4.3% in 2020, according to real estate analytics company CoStar Group CSGP.O. Still, experts are betting that malls will have a place, albeit much smaller, in the post-pandemic world as many shoppers still prefer to see, touch and try before they buy. “At some point when enough malls flush out, those who survive - the Simons and Maceriches of the world - will come out stronger,” said Michael Jerbich, president of B. Riley Real Estate."

-9.003389403253252," New COVID-19 deal litigation: Simon sues Taubman to ditch $3.6 billion mall merger Editor’s note: this story has been updated to change million to billion in the first paragraph. (Reuters) - COVID-19 continues to infect big M&A deals struck in the weeks before the pandemic wreaked havoc on U.S. businesses. On Wednesday, the mall owner Simon Property Group filed a declaratory judgment suit in Oakland County, Michigan, to terminate its $3.6 billion deal to acquire the luxury mall owner Taubman Centers, arguing that the pandemic has disproportionately damaged Taubman’s business. The Feb. 9 merger agreement between Simon and Taubman contains a provision shifting the risk of a pandemic onto Simon. The agreement’s material adverse effect clause carves out the impact of a pandemic (as well as wars, natural disasters and widespread economic declines) on Taubman’s business. But Simon’s lawyers at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison contend in the Michigan complaint that a different provision in the MAE clause overrides Taubman’s protection from the pandemic carveout. That clause says that a material adverse effect has occurred if a pandemic (or other excluded events) hits Taubman harder than its competitors. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. “The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a particularly devastating and disproportionate effect on Taubman compared with its competitors in the retail real estate industry, and has therefore caused an MAE,” the complaint said, citing reports from analysts and consultants on the virus’ outsized anticipated impact on luxury retailers. Taubman said in an email statement that Simon’s attempt to squash the deal is “invalid and without merit.” The luxury mall owner said it “intends to hold Simon to its obligations under the merger agreement ... and to vigorously contest Simon’s purported termination and legal claims.” Among other remedies, Taubman said, it may sue Simon for money damages. If Taubman takes the same litigation approach as other jilted targets, it will argue that Simon assumed the risk of a pandemic by agreeing to the MAE’s pandemic carveout and that mere buyer’s remorse is not an excuse to ditch the deal. I left messages at Kirkland & Ellis, which represented the Taubman board in the Simon deal, and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, which represented the company, but did not immediately receive a response. Simon and Taubman are not in discussions to renegotiate deal terms, according to reporting by my Reuters colleague Jessica DiNapoli. Taubman shareholders were scheduled to vote on the Simon deal on June 25. The deal’s termination date is February 9, 2021, according to the merger agreement. As you know, the short runway for M&A transactions has been a factor in some deal litigation spawned by COVID-19. It’s not clear whether Simon’s new lawsuit will extend the termination date for the Taubman deal. The Simon complaint cited four overarching reasons why the coronavirus is disproportionately devastating for Taubman’s luxury properties. Most of Taubman’s malls, it said, are indoor spaces anchored by high-end department stores, which will be slower to rebound than outdoor malls anchored by stores that have remained open during the pandemic; many of Taubman’s most successful properties are in tourist destinations and generate significant revenue from international travelers; high-end shoppers are likely to continue buying online rather than returning to malls; and some of Taubman’s key tenants, including Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney, are already in Chapter 11. The suit also alleged that Taubman violated the merger agreement’s representations and warranties by failing to operate in the normal course. Unlike other mall owners and retailers, including Simon, Taubman did not cut executives’ salary or bonuses and did not announce staff cuts or furloughs, according to the complaint. The suit also accused Taubman of drawing down $350 million from its credit line in March, at the beginning of the pandemic, allegedly leaving the company short of money to redevelop properties to accommodate new tenants and to respond to COVID-19 concerns. That alleged breach, according to Simon, constitutes an independent rationale, aside from MAE, to terminate the deal. “Taubman has repeatedly violated the ordinary course covenant in the wake of the pandemic, causing serious and irreparable damage to its business,” the complaint said. Every M&A case involved unique facts and contractual language, of course. A mere month ago, for instance, when L Brands was (successfully!) litigating to get out of its agreement to buy Victoria’s Secret, it argued that the lingerie chain failed to operate in the ordinary course by taking exactly the steps – furloughs and compensation cuts - that Simon now blames Taubman for failing to adopt. But I suspect Simon’s arguments about COVID-19’s disproportionate effect on high-end commercial real estate will resonate beyond this lawsuit. For developers who count on luxury business, litigation could make tough times even more dangerous."
-18.653257908339036," Mall operator Simon Property abandons $3.6 billion acquisition of Taubman (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N, the biggest U.S. mall operator, said on Wednesday it was ending its $3.6-billion deal to buy Taubman Centers Inc TCO.N, citing the beating the retail sector has taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simon Property said that the coronavirus outbreak “disproportionately hurt” Taubman’s malls because they are located in densely populated metropolitan areas, depend on tourism and feature high-end retailers whose sales have shrunk. Simon Property, which runs shopping destinations such as the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, in New York, also said that Taubman did not cut costs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. There are no discussions about renegotiating the transaction at a lower valuation, a person familiar with the matter said. Taubman said that it would fight against Simon’s termination of the deal and that the move was without merit. Taubman, whose properties include the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, also said it would pursue monetary damages based on the deal price against Simon. Shares of Taubman and Simon pared losses Wednesday afternoon. Taubman’s shares dropped 19% to $36.48 and Simon shares dropped roughly 3% to $85. The terminated agreement follows a string of other broken deals. Last month, private equity firm Sycamore Partners ended its $525-million deal to acquire lingerie brand Victoria's Secret from L Brands Inc LB.N, while Japanese telecommunications conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T dropped its agreement to fund a $3-billion tender offer for co-working company WeWork. The combination of the two mall owners was announced in February. The growth of online shopping had already slashed foot traffic at brick-and-mortar retail stores, and the pandemic has accelerated that trend."

24.374205247942104," Simon to reopen half of retail properties by next week amid tenant bankruptcies (Reuters) - Simon Property Group SPG.N, the biggest U.S. mall operator, said on Monday it would have about half of its over 200 retail properties in the country open within the next week, even as some of its major retail tenants struggle to say afloat The company was forced to temporarily close all its U.S. retail properties in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading it to report over a 20% decline in quarterly profit and scrap its annual forecast. Simon did not disclose the percentage of total rent it had collected in April or May, key figures investors were looking for as major retail tenants cut or pause monthly rent payments to shore up cash reserves. Gap Inc GPS.N, one of Simon's biggest tenants, said in April it would save about $115 million per month by ceasing paying rent for its stores, while several other major retailers in the company's malls are on the brink of collapsing completely. J. Crew and Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy last week, while Reuters reported that J.C. Penney was preparing to do so and close about a quarter of its roughly 850 stores. Simon’s Chief Executive Officer David Simon declined to discuss details of negotiations the company is having with tenants over reductions in rent, but hinted at some of the tension in talks. “The bottom line is we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid” Net income attributable to Simon’s shareholders fell 20.2% to $437.6 million, or $1.43 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Simon also said it suspended or eliminated more than $1 billion of capital expenditure meant for redevelopment and new construction projects. The company said it had already reopened 77 retail properties in regions where the lockdown restrictions had eased. Health experts have warned that reopening parts of the economies and public places too quickly may cause a new wave of COVID-19 infections, but Simon is confident that his malls would reopen safely. “Unless you have science, don’t blame our openings on an increase in that community’s COVID,” David Simon, who sits on President Donald Trump’s advisory council tasked to help decide how to reopen the U.S. economy, said. The company also said it will still declare a second quarter dividend and expects to pay out 100% of its taxable income in 2020 in cash."

The health crisis, which has taken the lives of over a 100 in the United States, has forced many retailers including Macy's M.N and J.C.

Taubman’s shares jumped 53.6%, trading above the offer price of $52.50. They had closed at $34.63 on Friday. Simon said it would buy an 80% stake in Taubman Realty Group (TRG) Ltd Partnership, the entity through which Taubman Centers conducts its business. Taubman family will sell about a third of its interest in TRG and remain a 20% partner in the firm, the companies said. Taubman’s stock has climbed nearly 23% since a media report on Feb. 4 said Simon was holding deal talks with the company. Simon could drive improved cash flows at Taubman due to its “long demonstrated ability to increase net operating income above the normal operations of a mall,” said Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb. The acquisition comes against the backdrop of falling U.S. mall traffic as customers switch to online shopping and could help Simon boost its ability to negotiate leases with retailers. Taubman owns or leases 26 regional shopping centers in the United States and Asia, while Simon has stakes in more than 220 malls and other retail properties in the United States and international markets. The deal is expected to close by the middle of 2020. BofA Securities is financial adviser to Simon. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, and Latham and Watkins LLP are its legal advisers.
