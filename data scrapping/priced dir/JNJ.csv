J&J said an emergency use listing is a prerequisite for supplying vaccines to the COVAX vaccine program, co-led by WHO, which aims to deliver doses to poor and middle-income countries. The J&J vaccine is administered in a single dose and can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, a big selling point in countries with relatively weaker healthcare infrastructure. The vaccine is under review by the U.S. health regulator, and a panel of the Food and Drug Administration’s experts are expected to discuss the vaccine’s emergency use authorization next week.

3.483085290232201," Pfizer study another worry for South Africa's vaccine rollout JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Scientists will meet on Thursday to advise South Africa’s government on its next steps after a study suggested the dominant local coronavirus variant may reduce protective antibodies from Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by two-thirds. The laboratory study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is another worry for the country hardest-hit by the pandemic on the African continent after it placed AstraZeneca vaccinations on hold earlier this month. Although its implications on the real-world efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine are not yet clear, the study comes after clinical trial data on the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novavax vaccines showed reduced efficacy against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, first identified late last year. South Africa has been counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering the first J&J doses on Wednesday. It is considering swapping or selling its AstraZeneca doses, after a small local trial, where participants were on average 31 years old, showed the vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the 501Y.V2 variant. Officials are more confident about the J&J shot because it was shown to be effective against severe illness in the local leg of a large global trial. The study published on Wednesday took into account all key mutations of the 501Y.V2 variant. A paper published in late January assessed the impact of only three key mutations of the variant. Scientists say that because the new study’s findings come from a laboratory, it is not easy to extrapolate what they might mean in the real world. Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, said it was “far from proven” that the Pfizer vaccine would be less effective against the 501Y.V2 variant. He said cellular immunity - as well as antibodies - was important in protecting against the virus and that scientists did not know the level of neutralising antibodies needed for immunity. “Our scientists will be meeting to discuss it (the study) and they will advise the minister,” health ministry spokesman Popo Maja said. Barry Schoub, chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, said the committee would discuss the study alongside information on other vaccines. Asked to comment on the findings, he said: “The Pfizer vaccine is enormously effective at 95%, so even if there is quite a significant reduction there still will be quite a bit of remnant efficacy left. “It is very likely that it will protect to a reasonable extent, certainly against severe illness and mild to moderate to some extent,” he said. “STRONG ENOUGH” Richard Mihigo, an immunisation official at the World Health Organization’s Africa office, told a news conference the antibody response to the variant in the Pfizer study was “strong enough”. Linda-Gail Bekker, co-lead investigator of the South African arm of J&J’s global trial, said she would recommend rolling out the Pfizer vaccine but monitoring it in the same way as the J&J shot, which is being administered in an “implementation study” targeting up to 500,000 health workers to further test it. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June. A spokesman for regulator SAHPRA said Pfizer’s registration application was under review and declined further comment. South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and about 48,500 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa. It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign. The government plans to vaccinate 40 million people - two-thirds of the population."

J&J remains committed to providing 100 million doses by June but deliveries are likely to be “back-end loaded” as J&J works with the U.S. government to boost supply, Jeffrey Zients, the White House’s COVID-19 response coordinator, said during a press call. “Across the last few weeks we’ve learned that there is not a big inventory of Johnson and Johnson. There’s a few million doses that we’ll start with,” Zients said. J&J said in a statement it intends to immediately begin distributing doses upon U.S. authorization and expects to supply 100 million doses to the United States in the first half of 2021. The United States has been struggling to hasten its vaccine rollout because of a limited supply of doses. Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc have promised to deliver 200 million doses of their two-dose vaccines by the end of March but so far fewer than 72 million doses have been shipped around the U.S. and around 55 million shots have been given. The U.S. paid J&J $1 billion in August to help fund the development of its vaccine in exchange for a guarantee of 100 million doses and an option to buy 200 million more. It also provided J&J with $456 million in March. The Biden administration has promised to explore every option available to aid drugmakers, including J&J, in boosting vaccine production. It said it is deploying wartime powers through the Defense Production Act to help them secure needed supplies. J&J’s experimental shot involves a single dose and can be stored in refrigerators as opposed to freezers, which could help speed up vaccinations. Zients said the vaccine could be authorized in a couple of weeks. It is scheduled to be reviewed on Feb. 26 by a panel of outside advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. J&J requested FDA authorization earlier this month."
3.4966217545952056," 'I feel blessed', says doctor as South Africa launches vaccination drive CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Wednesday, battling to tame a more infectious variant of the coronavirus with a roll-out of the Johnson & Johnson shot for the first time outside a major clinical trial. “I actually feel blessed, you know, after all our hard work and effort in the first and second wave that we finally have another layer of protection, another tool...in the fight against COVID-19,” said emergency physician Sa’ad Lahri, one of the first South Africans to be vaccinated. “I am still Zoliswa, no side-effects,” said nurse Zoliswa Gidi-Dyosi, who was also inoculated at Cape Town’s Khayelitsha District Hospital along with President Cyril Ramaphosa and Health Minister Zweli Mkhize. South Africa has recorded almost half of the COVID-19 deaths and over a third of confirmed infections in all of Africa, but has lagged wealthier Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign. The government plans to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population in Africa’s most industrialised economy. But it suffered a setback when a small local trial showed AstraZeneca’s vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 virus variant dominant in the country. Authorities have paused plans to use the AstraZeneca vaccine and are considering selling or swapping doses they have ordered. Instead the J&J vaccine is being deployed as part of a research study targeting up to 500,000 healthcare workers. The U.S. company has been submitting data to South African medicines regulator SAHPRA to secure registration for a larger-scale roll-out. Ramaphosa called the start of immunisations “a new era” and said he was confident the country would meet its vaccination targets. “I’d like to say to all the doomsayers: let’s all have hope and faith in our system, our healthworkers, and let’s give them an opportunity to do what they do best.” South Africa is one of the first African nations, along with Rwanda, Morocco and Egypt, to vaccinate against COVID-19. Zimbabwe will start inoculations on Thursday, while Senegal is expecting its first vaccine delivery on Wednesday. Ramaphosa’s government has been under pressure to get the first shots in arms quickly after the revelation that AstraZeneca’s vaccine had greatly reduced efficacy against the 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year. Officials already faced deep scepticism among some South Africans about COVID-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mkhize said it was an emotional moment when the plane carrying the first 80,000 J&J doses touched down late on Tuesday, praising doctors and nurses as “frontline warriors”. He said the government had a long discussion with AstraZeneca’s leadership about possibly conducting another local study to reduce the levels of uncertainty about the British firm’s vaccine. AstraZeneca declined comment when asked about that discussion. It said previously that it believes its vaccine protects against severe COVID-19 and that it has started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant. The next vaccine to arrive in South Africa will be from Pfizer, which will supply around 500,000 doses initially and about 7 million doses by June, Mkhize said."

3.7629099084483455," J&J's vaccine implementation study in S.Africa gets regulator nod CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa’s drugs regulator SAHPRA said on Monday it has approved an implementation study of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way to start the country’s first inoculations among health workers. South Africa is yet to start its COVID-19 vaccination programme and the government has decided to go with the J&J dose after trial results this month showed AstraZeneca’s two-shot vaccine was less effective against the new variant of the coronavirus dominating South African infections. “SAHPRA has approved the implementation study,” the regulator said in response to Reuters questions, but added it was still reviewing its separate full market application. The implementation study, similar to the final phase of a vaccine trial, will test the effects of the vaccine in the field after it is administered to around 350,000 to 500,000 health care workers. The first batch of J&J’s 80,000 doses are expected to arrive this week, President Cyril Ramaphosa told lawmakers on Thursday. J&J was the first pharmaceutical major to apply to the local regulator in December to register its COVID-19 vaccine, although Pfizer and AstraZeneca have also applied. South Africa is currently the hardest hit African country and accounts for over a third of the continent’s infections and almost half of the deaths, led primarily by the new, more contagious variant called 501Y.V2.

2.332345441654656," South Africa to start vaccinating millions against local COVID-19 variant: Ramaphosa CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa has secured millions of doses of Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc vaccines to fight the highly infectious COVID-19 variant that is dominant in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday. During a televised annual state of the nation address, Ramaphosa said South Africa had secured 9 million doses of the J&J vaccine, with 500,000 expected to arrive over the next four weeks so authorities can start inoculating health workers. Another 20 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech were also on their way, he said. South Africa has been hit hard by a second wave of COVID-19, after the discovery of a new variant in the Eastern Cape, called 501Y.V2, believed to be 50% more contagious than earlier versions of the coronavirus. It has already spread to two dozen other countries. “Driven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave,” Ramaphosa said. “We must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections.” In addition, the COVAX facility co-led by the World Health Organization will provide 12 million vaccine doses, he said. COVID-19 has claimed more than 47,000 lives and infected nearly 1.5 million in South Africa since the pandemic began. Ramaphosa said the economy had shrunk by 6% between the third quarter of 2019 and that of 2020, while unemployment “now stands at a staggering 30.8%,” after 1.7 million jobs were lost. South Africa had been pinning its hopes on the cheaper AstraZeneca vaccine.

The J&J vaccine requires just one shot, while the Pfizer/BioNTech option is a two-dose regimen. Ramaphosa outlined a plan to revive Africa’s most industrialised economy, with a massive programme of building or revamping ports, container terminals, energy generation and transmission, water, transport and telecoms. He also outlined plans to tackle South Africa’s dire energy shortages - which had plunged the economy into recession before the pandemic - by greatly expanding capacity, especially in renewable power. It was unclear how the government would fund the ambitious plans. South Africa is deeply in debt, and the Treasury expects a budget deficit of 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year ending March 2021. Ratings downgrades by Moody’s and Fitch late last year, putting its debt deeper into junk, will drive up borrowing costs. The government will seek bids for 2600 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind power to plug generation shortfall estimated by power utility Eskom in the coming weeks, he said. Another round of bids will be invited in August 2021, he said, adding that this will be over and above the power procurement plans already announced. Due to its reliance on coal power, South Africa is one of the world’s major CO2 emitters. Critics say it has been slow to transition to renewable energy, despite huge interest from foreign providers. “Eskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050,” Ramaphosa said."

Well it's an option ... we will consider it. First our scientists will tell us what we do with it. Can we use it within the time that's available ... before it expires?"" Mkhize said. ""If not, can we swap it with anyone else, because we've discussed it with COVAX and with AVATT (the AU's vaccine task team), so we will see what we will do."" It is not clear how a sale or swap would work given the varying prices for vaccines around the world, or whether the British drugmaker would have to agree to such a move. The Serum Institute and AstraZeneca declined to comment. Still, in a briefing to lawmakers later in the day, Mkhize said the government wanted to see whether it could swap AstraZeneca shots it had ordered from the Serum Institute for doses of a different vaccine available under the COVAX scheme run by the WHO and international vaccines alliance Gavi.

The J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease and 57% effective against moderate to severe disease in the South African leg of a large global trial. About 95% of infections in the local study were due to the 501Y.V2 variant. The variant has alarmed health experts who have raised concerns about its ability to potentially evade the immune response generated by prior exposure to the coronavirus or vaccines.

2.710728303316767," South Africa aims to immunise 500,000 health workers in J&J study, scientist says CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa aims to immunise between 350,000 and 500,000 health workers with Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine in an “implementation study” to further evaluate the shot, the president of the country’s Medical Research Council said. Glenda Gray, co-lead investigator on the local leg of a J&J global trial, told Reuters South Africa expected to get batches of around 80,000 doses every seven to 14 days for the study, once it is approved. The implementation study would be aimed at further evaluating J&J’s vaccine in the field and would be akin to a phase IIIb study, Gray said. J&J’s vaccine has already been tested in the global phase III trial involving more than 40,000 participants including over 6,000 in South Africa. Gray’s comments come days after the government paused the rollout of 1 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine and switched to the J&J shot to start protecting its health workers. That decision was based on a small clinical trial that showed the AstraZeneca jab provided minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the more contagious 501Y.V2 virus variant that is now dominant in the country. The government said on Wednesday it was considering selling or swapping AstraZeneca shots it had ordered. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said earlier on Wednesday that the J&J implementation study would “provide valuable information about the pandemic in the post-vaccination community and thus, ensure early identification of breakthrough infections should they occur amongst vaccinated health workers”. Gray said: “We will get 80,000 (doses) every 7 to 14 days and then based on our ability to roll them out we will redeploy them.” She added that a critical next step was for J&J to get emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the United States for its vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to meet on Feb. 26 to discuss J&J’s EUA request. “Once the FDA has approved it, there’s a cascading process that goes to other countries,” Gray said. “South Africa has a bilateral agreement with the U.S. FDA and they could accept the EUA from another agency. Alternatively, South Africa could wait until there is a formal process directly with J&J and (medicines regulator) SAHPRA.”"
2.710728303316767," To sell or swap? S.Africa weighs options for AstraZeneca shots ahead of J&J rollout JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s health minister said on Wednesday the government may sell or swap doses of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine it may not need, as it scrambles to start inoculating its citizens with an alternative U.S. shot next week. The unusual move comes just days after South Africa paused the rollout of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University following a small clinical trial that showed it did not protect against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 variant dominant in the country. One million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India, landed in the country last week, and another 500,000 are due to arrive in coming weeks. That’s enough to inoculate 750,000 people. South Africa was also expecting to receive AstraZeneca shots via the COVAX global vaccine distribution scheme co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and an African Union (AU) arrangement. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a news conference the country would start vaccinating health workers with Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine in the form of an “implementation study” with researchers some time next week. He said he would wait for advice from scientists before proceeding with the possible sale or switch of the British shot. “Why not sell the AstraZeneca to other countries, well it’s an option, ... we will consider it.

Serum and AstraZeneca declined to comment. Still, in a briefing to lawmakers later in the day, Mkhize said the government wanted to see whether it could swap AstraZeneca shots it had ordered privately for a different vaccine available under the COVAX scheme run by the WHO and international vaccines alliance Gavi. The WHO and Gavi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mkhize said he would discuss a proposal to swap 500,000 doses from Serum that have not yet been delivered with COVAX, which has secured big supplies of the shot for distribution to poor nations. The move is the latest twist in a saga that has engulfed the South African government this week as it scrambles to tame the fast-spreading variant. The country’s death toll is nearing 47,000 and infections have surpassed 1.47 million.

Mkhize referred to the first batch of J&J doses as “bridging stock”, with the first shots expected to land next week. “It’s possible that the first batch would actually be not paid for, because it would be covered more as the research stock. So if we are able to achieve that, it’s fine, but if we have got to pay for it, we have got no problem,” he said. Officials previously said the country had secured 9 million J&J single-dose shots, and Mkhize said a deal could be finalised soon. Eventually, most of the J&J supplies could come from local pharmaceutical company Aspen, which is due to bring production on stream around April, Mkhize said. The J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease and 57% effective against moderate to severe disease in the South African leg of a global trial. Ninety-five percent of infections observed in the local study were due to the 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year. The 501Y.V2 variant has alarmed health experts who have raised concerns about its ability to potentially evade the immune response generated by prior exposure to the coronavirus or vaccines.

The country’s inoculation drive is currently using the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine and another developed at home by Bharat Biotech with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Several other vaccines, including Russia’s Sputnik V, Cadila Healthcare’s ZyCov-D and a Novavax product are in the queue in the world’s biggest vaccine-making country. “We are targeting 600 million doses for J&J,” Biological E’s Mahima Datla said, adding it was not clear when they could start production. “This will be in addition to our own product for which we are targeting approximately 1 billion doses.” She declined to answer if the company could help J&J run a small local safety and immunogenicity study in India for the single-dose shot found to be 66% effective in preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease. India generally asks for so-called bridging studies for foreign vaccines. A senior government official said on Tuesday J&J was interested in manufacturing its vaccine in India, which has recorded the highest number of COVID-19 infections after the United States. Biological E’s own vaccine candidate developed with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and U.S.-based Dynavax Technologies Corp is undergoing clinical trials in India, with late-stage testing due to begin in April.

Addressing a webinar on vaccines, the official, Glenda Gray, said discussions were underway with regulatory authorities to roll out the single-dose vaccine to health workers, after the government on Sunday halted distribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine over efficacy concerns. In December, the U.S. pharmaceutical company was the first to apply to the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) for registration of its vaccine. South Africa had given fast-track approval to AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use last month and had said it was reviewing applications by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. “J&J also submitted a rolling submission to SAHPRA to expedite the regulatory processes in South Africa, so this AD26 vaccine as we speak is being processed for emergency use,” Gray said on Tuesday. AD26 is the clinical name of the J&J vaccine. She said there has been progress in discussions with regulatory authorities, enough to consider evaluating the vaccine in exposed health care workers, who are the first sector of the 60 million population earmarked for inoculations. “So what we are discussing is whether, under regulatory authorisation, we can use this vaccine rapidly in health care workers in South Africa as a single shot,” she said, adding that the vaccine is safe and has shown to work on the South African variant of the novel coronavirus. South Africa has pivoted to the J&J vaccine after data showed AstraZeneca’s shot offered minimal protection against mild-to-moderate illness from a dominant local virus variant. With the most coronavirus infections in Africa and more than 46,000 deaths, South Africa had planned to start offering healthcare workers the AstraZeneca vaccine soon before it was put on hold. Shabir Madhi, the principal investigator of South Africa leg of trials of the vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca, said human trials for a second generation of vaccines to tackle new variants of the coronavirus are already underway.

South Africa’s rand and Russia’s rouble led gains across currencies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). But gains were limited, as the prospect of higher U.S. fiscal spending could push up treasury yields and drive money away from emerging market debt and currencies. The dollar retreated as investors showed more doubts about the pace of an economic recovery in the United States. “The globally low interest rate environment supports EM currencies. Rising inflation expectations in the U.S. and rising U.S. yields on the other hand are negative,” You-Na Park-Heger, foreign exchange and emerging market analyst at Commerzbank wrote. “There is not just uncertainty as to whether the package entails risks of overheating but also as to how the Fed would react ... whereas high inflation puts pressure on the dollar the Fed’s proactive measures would support the dollar.” Emerging market stocks, which stand to benefit the most from increased global liquidity, rose 0.3% and were trading just below a record high. Most EMEA stocks also gained. Stocks have by far gained the most from a risk-driven rally this year, even outperforming their developed world peers on expectations that steady vaccination campaigns and stimulus will enable a strong economic recovery this year. The rouble was set to rise for a fifth consecutive day, hitting an more than two-week high on a spike in oil prices. Investors were also pricing in a possible interest rate hike by the central bank this Friday. Reuters reported that Russian authorities were considering a new social spending package worth at least $6.7 billion to address discontent over falling living standards before an autumn election. But concerns about political unrest in the country, caused by the jailing of a prominent Kremlin critic, kept gains in the rouble subdued. Russian stocks fell slightly. Turkey’s lira dropped 0.8% from a six-month high as investors paused a recent buying streak. The Turkish central bank has vowed to keep monetary policy tight until inflation is contained, but its measures to rebuild depleted foreign exchange reserves will be a point of focus. Turkish stocks rose 0.8%. South Africa’s rand rose 0.5%, as the country looked to start a vaccination campaign with Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine after data showed AstraZeneca’s shot offered minimal protection against mild-to-moderate illness from the dominant local virus variant.

3.044303378858757," South Africa to start COVID-19 vaccinations with J&J doses JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will start its immunisation campaign with Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine after data showed AstraZeneca’s shot offered minimal protection against mild-to-moderate illness from the dominant local virus variant. The country, which has recorded the most coronavirus infections in Africa and more than 46,000 deaths, had planned to start offering healthcare workers the AstraZeneca jabs soon but put that plan on hold on Sunday. A government factsheet published on Monday said the J&J vaccine would be offered from mid-February. A senior health official said J&J had agreed to speed up deliveries so the first doses would become available around the end of the week. “Our vaccine rollout plan has not changed, except that we will begin with the Johnson & Johnson instead of the AstraZeneca vaccine,” the factsheet said. J&J said it was in advanced discussions with South Africa about “potential additional collaborations” to combat COVID-19. “We hope to be able to share more details in the coming days,” it said. Preliminary trial data showing the AstraZeneca shot does not significantly reduce the risk of mild-to-moderate illness caused by the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year was a disappointment not just to South Africa, but to the continent as a whole. The 501Y.V2 variant is believed to have spread to nine other African countries, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological report last week. The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as one of the best suited to weak African health systems as it can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, rather than the ultra-cold temperatures needed for shots from Pfizer/BioNTech . Global vaccine distribution scheme COVAX plans to start sending millions of AstraZeneca doses to African countries this month. The trial by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg did not assess whether the AstraZeneca vaccine protected against severe COVID-19. Shabir Madhi, the trial’s lead investigator, told Reuters the AstraZeneca vaccine still had a major role to play in Africa and globally, and that it probably protected against severe cases. The government is holding talks with scientists on how to proceed. Malawi’s information minister said the country would move ahead with the vaccine when it becomes available, unless the 501Y.V2 variant became dominant there. A Ugandan health ministry spokesman said the government would seek guidance from the WHO, and a Nigerian health official said the country would stick to plans to use the AstraZeneca shot. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, an adviser to the South Africa government, said the AstraZeneca vaccine would in future be rolled out in a “stepped manner” to assess its ability to prevent severe illness. AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with Oxford University, says it has already started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant. South African health ministry Deputy Director-General Anban Pillay told state broadcaster SABC that the J&J vaccine was a good fit. Trials had shown it was highly effective in preventing hospitalisation and death, and it can also be stored at fridge temperatures, he said. Regulator SAHPRA has not yet authorised J&J’s vaccine but has been conducting a rolling review since late last year. A source at the Russia Direct Investment Fund said talks were being held with South Africa over vaccine supplies but declined to elaborate."

2.8078564482612967," South Africa hopes to get some J&J COVID-19 vaccines this week JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa hopes to get some doses of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine around the end of this week, a senior health official said on Monday, after halting use of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to disappointing trial data. Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) vaccine was a good fit at this stage, health ministry Deputy Director-General Anban Pillay told state broadcaster SABC, but did not say how many doses the country would soon receive. Previously, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the country had secured 9 million J&J doses that were due to start arriving in the second quarter. The J&J vaccine is not yet authorised for use in South Africa, although the U.S. company has initiated a “rolling submission” with local regulator SAHPRA. Pillay said the J&J vaccine had shown in trials to be highly effective in preventing hospitalisation and death, and said it was an advantage that it was a one-shot vaccine that could be stored at fridge temperatures. “So we think it will be a good vaccine at this point in time for South Africa,” he said. On Sunday, the government said it was temporarily halting a large-scale rollout of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to healthcare workers after preliminary data from a clinical trial found it gave “minimal protection” against mild-to-moderate infection caused by the dominant 501Y.V2 coronavirus variant in South Africa. The trial did not assess the vaccine’s efficacy against severe infection, and its findings have not yet been peer-reviewed. AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with Oxford University, says it believes its vaccine can protect against severe disease and has already started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant. Asked whether the sample size of the AstraZeneca trial was large enough to draw conclusions from, Pillay said: “I don’t think we can be confident to say the vaccine doesn’t work, but we also don’t have the data to say it certainly will work. What we have are potential indicators.” He said the government needed a “broader discussion” with local and global scientists to interpret the trial data and say what the best way forward would be. South Africa - which has reported the highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Africa and over 46,000 coronavirus-related deaths - hopes to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population, to achieve some level of herd immunity."
2.226708345775391," White House says it is working to speed early production of J&J COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters) - The Biden administration is exploring every option for increasing manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine, which is under regulatory review, and said on Friday that currently expected levels of early doses were less than hoped. The White House has invoked the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer Inc ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production and that “every option” was on the table to produce more Johnson & Johnson vaccine should it be authorized. It will also use the wartime powers to increase at-home COVID-19 tests, and make more surgical gloves in the United States, officials said at a Friday media briefing. “As is the case with other vaccines, we have not found that the level of manufacturing allows us to have as much vaccine as we think we need coming out of the gate,” said Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House’s COVID-19 response team, referring to the J&J vaccine. J&J applied on Thursday for U.S. emergency use authorization. It expects to have some vaccine ready for distribution as soon as authorized but has not said how much. Emergent Biosolutions’ Chief Executive Robert Kramer said in an interview on Friday that the company currently is making bulk drug substance for J&J “at large scale.” Emergent is only producing bulk vaccine, which is then filled into syringes or vials and packaged for shipment by another contractor. Kramer said they were on track to make enough product for hundreds of millions of doses a year. It remains unclear what other supply bottlenecks may be. Kramer said his company had already benefited from the Defense Production Act under the Trump Administration, which helped the company get to the point where it’s ready to go. Under the authority of the Defense Production Act, the government will give priority ratings to two components important to Pfizer’s vaccine production - filling pumps and tangential flow filtration units, the officials said. “We told you that when we heard of a bottleneck on needed equipment, supplies, or technology related to vaccine supply that we would step in and help, and we were doing just that,” said Tim Manning, the supply chain coordinator for the national COVID-19 response. The government will also invoke its powers under the Defense Production Act to increase at-home COVID-19 tests with six, unnamed manufacturers, aiming to produce 61 million tests by the summer, Manning said. It will also invoke its powers to increase the nation’s supply of surgical gloves, which are made almost exclusively overseas. Manning said the government will build factories that make the raw materials for surgical gloves and help build plants in the United States to make the gloves. By the end of the year, he said, the United States would be able to produce a billion gloves a month. Officials have said that once J&J’s vaccine is authorized, it would mean that millions more doses would be available to states. The vaccine is one-shot, as opposed to Pfizer’s and Moderna Inc’s two-dose vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator. Officials have hoped that the ease of giving the J&J vaccine will mean that states will be able to more quickly immunize residents."

2.226708345775391," UPDATE 1-Four EU states urge EU to safeguard Johnson & Johnson vaccine supply (Adds background, details) ATHENS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The leaders of Denmark, Austria, the Czech Republic and Greece have urged the European Commission to act quickly to secure supplies of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson. In a letter addressed to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen they said they had been informed that the new vaccine needed to be shipped to the United States for filling and finishing. “If this could risk EU access to the vaccines, we should consider addressing the issue already now with a view to finding solutions with the company in order to safeguard European supply,” they said. They said they understood capacity was available in Europe to perform filling and finishing, a late stage in the manufacturing process that covers formulating the licensed active substance and filling it into vials. The letter comes as the Commission has faced criticism for its handling of the vaccines issue and for a damaging row with Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca. European Union countries have so far lagged far behind others such as Israel, Britain and the United States in rolling out vaccines. Describing Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose shot as a “potential game changer”, they said it was important to engage with vaccine producers “to mitigate potential problems before they arise”. “In view of the importance attached to these issues, we would encourage an early dialogue at the highest levels.” They also called for speedy contract negotiations with all promising new candidates, such as those from Novavax Inc or Valneva, and said “approval of all new vaccines will need to be as swift as possible while respecting necessary health requirements”. The letter was signed by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

The ministry said in a presentation in parliament that one of the conditions for the J&J vaccine was the establishment of a no-fault compensation system for adverse events.

2.226708345775391," J&J files COVID-19 vaccine application with U.S. FDA (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Thursday it has asked U.S. health regulators to authorize its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, and it will apply to European authorities in coming weeks. The drugmaker’s application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) follows its Jan. 29 report in which it said the vaccine had a 66% rate of preventing infections in its large global trial. The FDA said on Thursday evening that it has scheduled a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on Feb. 26, to discuss the company's request for emergency use authorization. (bit.ly/3oRgha3) Vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc were authorized a day after such a meeting. J&J’s single-shot vaccine could help boost supply and simplify the U.S. immunization campaign, amid concerns of fresh surges due to the more contagious UK coronavirus variant and the potential of lower vaccine efficacy against a variant that first emerged in South Africa. Unlike the two currently authorized vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna, J&J’s does not require a second shot or need to be shipped frozen. After the company’s application, regulators will need time to analyze the data and an advisory committee must meet. The company’s chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, said last month J&J was on track to roll out the vaccine in March. “Upon authorization of our investigational COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, we are ready to begin shipping,” Stoffels said in a statement announcing the application. J&J said it had rolling submissions with several global health agencies and would submit a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application with the European Medicines Agency in the coming weeks. J&J’s application raised hopes for fighting a pandemic that has claimed more than 451,145 American lives and over 2,271,152 worldwide. Shares of Johnson & Johnson rose about 1% in extended trading on Thursday, while Moderna was down 0.7% and Pfizer stock was little changed. The United States has agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses, which J&J said it expected to supply in the first half of the year. The United States also has the option of purchasing an additional 200 million doses. The company said it has doses ready for delivery upon emergency approval. It aims to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 with production in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India. In J&J’s trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers conducted in eight countries, the level of protection against COVID-19 was 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa where variants are circulating. Those results compare with the 95% effectiveness of the two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna. However, both those trials were conducted mainly in the United States and before the spread of new variants. J&J’s main study goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization. J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) that requires it to be stored in a freezer."

3.0947069023098233," Johnson & Johnson seeks Thai approval for COVID vaccine BANGKOK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is seeking Thailand’s approval for its COVID-19 vaccine, a senior Thai health official told Reuters on Tuesday. The request makes J&J’s one-dose vaccine the third COVID-19 vaccine to seek registration with Thailand’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after requests from AztraZeneca Plc and China Sinovac Biotech. Last month, Thailand’s FDA granted a one year emergency use approval for imported AstraZeneca’s vaccine. J&J had started the request process for its vaccine late last month, but the timing of any approval will depend on when the company submitted all required documents, Surachoke Tangwiwat, Deputy Secretary-General of the FDA, said. “They have submitted some documents for us to assess,” Surachoke said. “We can proceed with the approval within 30 days after all documents are submitted,” he said. J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thai health authorities have previously said the first 50,000 doses of imported vaccine from AztraZeneca and 200,000 doses from China’s Sinovac will arrive in February, although Surachoke said Sinovac had not yet submitted all the documents required for FDA approval. Thailand’s government has received high marks internationally for managing for the most part to suppress the virus in 2020, but opposition groups have criticized its vaccine strategy as too slow and lacking transparency. The government has said it is on track for mass inoculations beginning in June, largely using 61 million locally made doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, backed up by limited supplies of imported AztraZeneca vaccine and two million doses of the Sinovac vaccine to be administered earlier. Thailand reported 836 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, including a 26-day-old baby, its youngest ever patient, the government’s COVID-19 task force said. The country also reported two new deaths, taking the total case load to 20,454 infections and 79 deaths."
0.3768316474532196," Fresh data show toll South African virus variant takes on vaccine efficacy CHICAGO (Reuters) - Clinical trial data on two COVID-19 vaccines show that a coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa is lessening their ability to protect against the illness, underscoring the need to vaccinate vast numbers of people as quickly as possible, scientists said. The vaccines from Novavax Inc and Johnson & Johnson were welcomed as important future weapons in curbing deaths and hospitalizations in a pandemic that has infected more than 101 million people and claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. But they were significantly less effective at preventing COVID-19 in trial participants in South Africa, where the potent new variant is widespread, compared with countries in which this mutation is still rare, according to preliminary data released by the companies. “Clearly, the mutants have a diminishing effect on the efficacy of the vaccines,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in a briefing. “We can see that we are going to be challenged.” Novavax reported midstage trial results on Thursday that showed its vaccine was 50% effective overall at preventing COVID-19 among people in South Africa. That compared with late-stage results from the United Kingdom, in which the vaccine was up to 89.3% effective at preventing COVID-19. On Friday, J&J said a single shot of its coronavirus vaccine was 66% effective overall in a massive trial across three continents. But there were wide differences by region. In the United States, where the South African variant was first reported this week, efficacy reached 72%, compared with just 57% in South Africa, where the new variant, known as B 1.351, made up 95% of the COVID-19 cases reported in the trial. Another highly transmissible variant first discovered in the UK and now in more than half of U.S. states has been less able to evade vaccine efficacy than its South African counterpart. The new findings, however, raise questions about how highly-effective vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech, and Moderna Inc will fare against new variants. The two vaccines showed an efficacy of around 95% in trials conducted primarily in the United States before the new virus versions were identified in other countries. “It’s a different pandemic now,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at Harvard University Medical School’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who helped develop the J&J vaccine. Barouch said there are now a wide variety of new variants circulating, including in Brazil, South Africa and even the United States, that are substantially resistant to vaccine-induced antibodies. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said there was “a high possibility” that emerging variants may eventually render the company’s vaccine ineffective. “This is not the case yet ... but I think it’s a very high likelihood that one day that will happen,” Bourla said at the World Economic Forum. The drugmaker is considering whether its vaccine needs to be altered to defend against the South African variant. ‘STOP HOSPITALS FROM GOING INTO CRISIS’ Experts said that all four vaccines still have great value in their ability to reduce severe COVID-19. “The end game is to stop death, to stop hospitals from going into crisis - and all of these vaccines, even including against the South African variant, seem to do that substantially,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security For example, J&J’s vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa. J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels said he suspects a type of immune system reaction called a T-cell response is playing a protective role and may be helping to prevent severe disease. “We knew that to a certain extent, but it’s also better and very confirming that we can see that now in the clinic,” Stoffels said in an interview. Nevertheless, Fauci said the decreased efficacy rates underscore the need to follow variants closely, and to accelerate vaccination efforts before new, and even more dangerous, mutations arise. “The best way to prevent further evolution of a virus is to prevent it from replicating,” Fauci said, “and you do that by vaccinating people as quickly as you possibly can.”"
0.3768316474532196," J&J vaccine adds to COVID-19 armoury, includes South African variant (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday that its single-dose vaccine was 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a large global trial against multiple variants, giving health officials another weapon to tackle the pandemic. In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, from where a worrying variant has spread. The data showed that the vaccine’s effect on the South Africa variant was diminished compared to the unaltered virus, but infectious disease and public health experts said it can still help contain the virus spread and prevent deaths. Midstage trial data from Novavax on Thursday also documented lower effectiveness in South Africa. Rival shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were both around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses. Those trials were conducted mainly in the United States and before the emergence of new variants. These mean that the world is racing against time and with limited supplies to vaccinate as many people as possible, and quickly, to prevent virus surges. COVID-19 is rising in 37 countries and infections have surpassed 101 million globally. Top U.S. infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the world needs to vaccinate quickly to try to get ahead of these changes in the virus. “It’s really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this virus will continue for certain to evolve,” Fauci said. J&J’s main goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization. That “will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,” Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said. J&J shares were down 4% at $162.7 at 1700 GMT, with some Wall Street analysts saying its vaccine’s effectiveness was below those of rivals. Moderna’s stock gained 8% to $172.80. J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week and will soon follow up with the European Union and the rest of the world. It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses of the vaccine, which it will make in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India, in 2021. Public health officials are counting on it to increase much-needed supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to buy 100 million doses of J&J’s vaccine and an option for an additional 200 million. J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses. “The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh. J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune response, whereas the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines employ a new technology called messenger RNA. Unlike these vaccines, J&J’s does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where transportation and cold storage present problems. “Most countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just fine for now,” Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData, said. ‘OVERWHELMED’ Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy. “What we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,” Stoffels told Reuters.

0.3768316474532196," Wall St. drops after J&J vaccine data, GameStop effect weighs NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes dropped, closing out the Friday session with the biggest weekly fall since October, as investors gauged the ramifications of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine trial results, while a standoff between Wall Street hedge funds and small, retail investors added to volatility. Johnson & Johnson fell 3.56% as one of the biggest weights on both the Dow and S&P500 after the drugmaker said its single-dose vaccine was 72% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the United States, with a lower rate of 66% observed globally. The results compare to the high bar set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in key trials when given in two doses. Moderna shares climbed 8.53% while Pfizer shares edged up 0.11%. Worries of a short squeeze that began earlier in the week resurfaced after an army of retail investors returned to trade shares in stocks such as GameStop Corp and Koss Corp, which shot higher after brokers including Robinhood eased some of the restrictions they had placed on trading. “The overall picture is that if there is any bad news that suggests or indicates there could be a longer hibernation period for us to be indoors and not consuming or spending that tends to set the market back and a lot of people sit on the sidelines, particularly with that news,” said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs in New York. “And then what is going on with (Gamestop) and all that stuff, people are a little afraid to trade.” The surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across U.S. exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data. Volume across U.S. exchanges on Friday was 17.13 billion shares, compared with the 15.26 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was closely monitoring any potential wrongdoing, to both brokerages and social media traders. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 620.74 points, or 2.03%, to 29,982.62, the S&P 500 lost 73.14 points, or 1.93%, to 3,714.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 266.46 points, or 2%, to 13,070.70. All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October, as the Dow lost 3.28%, the S&P fell 3.31% and the Nasdaq declined 3.49%. For the month, the Dow dipped 2.04%, the S&P shed 1.12% and the Nasdaq gained 1.42%. Both the S&P and Dow closed below their 50-day moving average, seen as a technical support level. Market participants have speculated that volatility caused by the short squeezes have led to investor favorites including Apple Inc coming under pressure as hedge funds sell to cover billions of dollars in losses. Apple shares declined 3.74% while Microsoft fell 2.92%. Still, while concerns about rising COVID-19 cases and bumpy vaccine rollouts kept investors leery about a pullback and an increase in volatility in the near-term, the start to quarterly earnings has eased some concern about stretched stock valuations. Of the 184 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Friday morning, 84.2% have topped analyst expectations, well above the 75.5% beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data. Honeywell International lost 3.68% after it posted a 13% fall in quarterly profit. The first known U.S. cases of the South African COVID-19 variant, found to be partly resistant to current vaccines and antibody treatments, was detected in South Carolina on Thursday. Data showed U.S. labor costs rose more than expected in the fourth quarter amid a jump in wages, supporting views that inflation could accelerate this year, while another report showed U.S. consumer spending fell for a second straight month in December. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.88-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 16 new lows."

Protection levels 28 days after vaccination varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, where a potent new variant has become prevalent. Two-dose vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were around 95% effective in pivotal trials. But those were conducted before the highly transmissible new variants emerged. ""Right now, any protection and additional vaccine is great,"" said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the trial. ""The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death."" In a news release, J&J said its vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants. The vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune response. The company plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week. (bit.ly/3cmnnk1; reut.rs/3opLsJe) High antibody levels seen in newborns of COVID-19 survivors A mother's COVID-19 antibodies can cross the placenta, potentially protecting her fetus from infection, researchers reported on Friday in JAMA Pediatrics. Several weeks after the mother's infection begins, antibody levels in umbilical cord blood ""can be as high as - or even higher - than the levels in maternal blood,"" said study leaders Dr. Karen Puopolo and Dr. Scott Hensley of the University of Pennsylvania. In their study, out of 83 women who had COVID-19 antibodies when they gave birth, 72 of their newborns also had antibodies but no evidence of direct infection. ""It is reassuring that maternal infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, results in sufficient antibody production for an efficient transplacental antibody transfer to newborns of infected mothers,"" said Dr. Flor Munoz of Baylor College of Medicine in an editorial published with the study. It is possible antibodies created via a vaccine could have the same effect, Munoz noted. Transfer of substances in the mother's blood to the fetus starts around 17 weeks of gestation, she said, which suggests that ""maternal vaccination starting in the early second trimester ... might be optimal to achieve the highest levels of antibodies in the newborn."" (bit.ly/3cn3kSM) Skin problems can persist after COVID-19 Add bothersome skin conditions to the list of symptoms that can follow infection with the new coronavirus, a new report warns. Between April and October, an international registry established by dermatologists received reports of roughly 1,000 COVID-19 patients with itchy welts, rashes, scaly plaques, or pernio, an inflammation of the fingers and toes upon exposure to cold. In half of the cases, the skin problems lasted more than two weeks. That was more often true for patients with scaly plaques and pernio. Given that some of the patients had only mild COVID-19, the data suggest that inflammation from the disease may persist even among those who were not seriously ill, researchers said in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. ""Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, appreciation for persistent morbidity beyond the acute phase of disease has increased,"" they said. ""To our knowledge, our data represent the largest dataset to date on persistent skin signs and symptoms of COVID-19.""

In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 was just 57% in South Africa, where a particularly worrying variant of the novel coronavirus is circulating. read more  Following are initial reactions to the report:  Moncef Slaoui, Ph.D. Collaborator on the trial and Former Chief Scientific Advisor to Operation Warp Speed: ""This is very important, and impactful data in terms of public health and intervention in the setting of a raging pandemic"" ""The ease of immunisation - completing immunisation with one shot vaccine - with a vaccine that can be transported and kept stable for a period of two or three months at fridge temperature, is going to be super important""  Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology, GlobalData ""The reason JNJ's vaccine may be ideal for stemming the tide of the outbreak is because it provides strong, if comparatively lower, protection against COVID-19 but with a single dose. For now, most countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective, moderately effective will do just fine for now.""  Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota: ""It is a needed weapon in fighting this pandemic, especially in a world with an insufficient supply of vaccine and especially given its one-dose format and ability to remain stable for long periods of time at refrigeration temps."" ""At lower efficacy, we don’t yet know about the durability of protection.""  Mark Siedner, infectious disease clinician at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School: ""We're preliminarily thrilled. We want these vaccines to do two things. The most important of which is stop people from getting sick and this this vaccine almost very clearly appeared to do that pretty similarly to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines."" ""It's a one dose regimen. It has a lower price point, it's stable in standard refrigerators and when we're talking about global epidemic control I think these are precisely the words that if you really want to hear. It's going to be welcome news for the global COVID-19 response."" Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center: ""We're trying to get to 80 plus percent of people vaccinated in order to generate the herd immunity, this vaccine would certainly help us get there."" ""Down the road we're, having to prepare people already. They may have to get a booster dose of a new vaccine, at some point in the future. Because it's this virus that's playing the tune we're having to dance to.""  Dr. Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh: ""Right now, any protection and additional vaccine is great. The ""South Africa"" strain is still uncommon in the U.S. and obviously we would want to see higher efficacy, but the key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. It’s unlikely we’re going to completely eliminate Covid anytime soon, but the key is to make it a minor nuisance instead of a deadly disease. This is one shot in the arm and good efficacy. Great news.""  Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the South African vaccine trial. ""I am overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease even in South Africa.” Gray, who is the chief executive of the South African Medical Research Council said this is by far the best vaccine for South Africa and can prevent a large number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country.  Linda-Gail Bekker, the other joint lead investigator on the vaccine trial in South Africa. “We are hoping the vaccine could be approved in the country by mid February as the regulator has said it will fast-track the approval process.”  "

1.2835731611603023," J&J COVID-19 vaccine is 72% effective in the U.S., and 66% overall in large trial Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Friday said its single-dose vaccine was 72% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the United States but a lower rate of 66% was observed globally in the large trial conducted across three continents and against multiple variants. In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 was 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, where a particularly worrying variant of the novel coronavirus is circulating. Those results compare to the high bar set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses. Those trials, however, were conducted mainly in the United States and before the broad spread of new variants now under the spotlight. J&J's main study goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization. That level of prevention ""will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said in a statement. The company plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week. Public health officials have been counting on the J&J vaccine to increase much-needed supply and simplify the U.S. immunization campaign. Unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, J&J's does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world with weak transportation infrastructure and insufficient cold storage facilities.  SOUTH AFRICA Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant of the coronavirus has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy. ""What we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,"" Stoffels said in a telephone interview. Importantly, though, in a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. Ninety-five percent of cases in the South Africa portion of the trial were infections with the South African variant. A mid-stage trial of a Novovax Inc (NVAX.O) coronavirus vaccine in South Africa also showed lower efficacy in the country. It proved to be 60% effective among volunteers who didn’t have HIV. In a separate, late-stage trial in the UK, the vaccine was 89.3% effective. In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% were from Central and South America and 15% were from South Africa. Slightly more than a third of the volunteers were over age 60. There were no serious adverse events among those who received the shot, the company said. Full results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) that requires it to be stored in a freezer.  VACCINE TARGETS The news of another safe and effective vaccine comes as the United States has surpassed 430,000 COVID-19 deaths and with hospitals in many states still struggling to keep up with patients despite recent declines in new infections. Concerns about fresh surges in the United States have also grown due to the presence of a more contagious coronavirus variant first discovered in the UK and news of the arrival of the South African variant on Thursday in South Carolina. The U.S. vaccination program got off to a slow start in December and has accelerated to around 1 million shots per day nationwide. U.S. President Joe Biden has promised that at least 100 million shots will be administered in his first 100 days in office, but concerns about supply disruptions have added uncertainty to that target. The United States has an agreement to buy 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine for $1 billion. The company said in a statement the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval but Stoffels declined to specify how many doses. The government also has the option of purchasing an additional 200 million doses. J&J has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 and will produce the vaccine in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India. U.S. trial results for the vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Oxford University are expected in early February, opening up the possibility of a fourth vaccine option. It has already been approved in the UK, Europe and many countries based on results of a separate trial. Novavax is also discussing with the FDA whether its data is sufficient to apply for emergency use authorization. J&J is studying the effects of its vaccine given in two doses at two months apart, but results of that trial won’t be available until this summer, Stoffels said. "

1.6264189915433596," Lithuania says expects enough COVID-19 vaccines for herd immunity by July VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania’s president said on Friday the country would receive enough COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate 70% of its population by early July, and that this would achieve herd immunity. The ambitious supply schedule hinges on vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson being approved for use in the European Union, in addition to the Pfizer shot already being administered, President Gitanas Nauseda said. “We received assurances from the European Commission president that Lithuania will be able to vaccinate 70% of population by early summer, because we will receive 4 million vaccines during the first and second quarters,” Nauseda said. “The challenge is about to change from vaccine shortages to setting up mass vaccinations, so that we use the time optimally and can fully reach collective immunity (by early July). This is the goal we can set for ourselves,” he told reporters. The World Health Organization has estimated that 60-70% of a population needs to be vaccinated to break transmission. However, the concept of herd immunity comes with caveats and big demands of what vaccines might be capable of preventing, and some experts say such expectations are misplaced. Experts point to various still unresolved factors - such as the rate of the spread of the COVID-19-causing virus, whether vaccines can stop transmission or just stop people getting ill, how many people in a population will accept a vaccine, and whether vaccines offer the same protection to everyone. Nauseda said Lithuania, a Baltic republic of 2.8 million people, will need to vaccinate 10,000 per day by February and up to 35,000 people per day by April to reach the July target. Between 1,000 and 4,000 people have received the vaccine daily this week, according to government data."
3.1642562762295676," WHO plans slew of COVID-19 vaccine approvals for global rollout BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to approve several COVID-19 vaccines from Western and Chinese manufacturers in coming weeks and months, a document published on Wednesday shows, as it aims for rapid rollouts in poorer countries. COVAX, a global scheme co-led by the WHO, wants to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 doses across the world this year, with at least 1.3 billion going to poorer countries. But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while wealthy nations have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves. In the race to deploy shots, regulatory approvals are key to confirming the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, and to boosting output. But some poorer countries rely mostly on WHO authorisations as they have limited regulatory capacity. The WHO is therefore “expediting” emergency approvals, according to a COVAX internal document seen by Reuters. The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) could be authorised by the WHO in January or February, the document says. The same vaccine produced in South Korea by SK Bioscience could be approved by the U.N. agency in the second half of February, at the earliest, a provisional calendar published by the WHO on Wednesday shows. As well as vaccines, regulators usually authorise their manufacturing processes in different plants. SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last week he expected WHO approval “in the next week or two”. AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment, while SK said it was not aware of the WHO’s approval timeline. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has already been given emergency approval in Britain, while decisions in the European Union and the United States are close. COVAX has supply contracts with AstraZeneca and SII for about 400 million doses and an option for many more hundreds of millions, although the timing of deliveries is uncertain. The WHO authorised the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech at the end of December. WHO officials have said they are seeking a supply deal with the U.S. pharmaceutical giant, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations. COVAX had not initially included the Pfizer/BioNTech shot in its shortlist for advance purchases. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment on whether a deal was close and whether it would involve only a limited number of doses this year. The provisional approval calendar also shows the WHO is expected to approve Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, which is based on the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as Pfizer’s, at the end of February. Moderna, whose vaccine is already approved in many Western countries including in the United States and the European Union, had no immediate comment. The vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which has a non-binding agreement to supply COVAX with 500 million doses over an unspecified timeframe, is expected to get WHO approval in May or June at the earliest, the WHO document says. J&J has not yet published results of its vaccine’s Phase III clinical trials, but the EU has said it expects the company to apply for approval as early as February. A J&J spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The WHO is also considering possible quick approvals for two Chinese vaccines, the provisional calendar shows. Sinopharm and Sinovac have filed their applications with the WHO, which is reviewing them and could make decisions on both in March at the earliest, it says. Neither vaccine was shortlisted by the WHO for possible advance purchase deals. WHO approval does not automatically lead to purchases by COVAX. It could also facilitate the rollout in poorer countries that acquire the vaccines directly. Sinopharm has filed applications for two COVID-19 vaccines, but the possible March approval concerns only the one developed by its Beijing-based affiliate, Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd (BIBP), which has already been widely used for inoculations in China. Sinovac has yet to release global results of its Phase III trials, but its vaccine has been approved for emergency use in countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey. Sinopharm and Sinovac did not respond to requests for comment. There is no provisional timetable yet for the possible approval of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, despite its developers having filed the relevant documentation, the timetable shows. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the main financial backer of Sputnik V, did not respond to a request for comment."

But some poorer countries rely mostly on WHO authorisations as they have limited regulatory capacity. The WHO is therefore ""expediting"" emergency approvals, according to a COVAX internal document seen by Reuters. The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) could be authorised by the WHO in January or February, the document says. The same vaccine produced in South Korea by SK Bioscience could be approved by the U.N. agency in the second half of February, at the earliest, a provisional calendar published by the WHO on Wednesday shows. As well as vaccines, regulators usually authorise their manufacturing processes in different plants. SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last week he expected WHO approval ""in the next week or two"". read more AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment, while SK said it was not aware of the WHO's approval timeline. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has already been given emergency approval in Britain, while decisions in the European Union and the United States are close. COVAX has supply contracts with AstraZeneca and SII for about 400 million doses and an option for many more hundreds of millions, although the timing of deliveries is uncertain.  OTHER WESTERN SHOTS The WHO authorised the vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE.N) and its German partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE) at the end of December. WHO officials have said they are seeking a supply deal with the U.S. pharmaceutical giant, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations. read more COVAX had not initially included the Pfizer/BioNTech shot in its shortlist for advance purchases. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment on whether a deal was close and whether it would involve only a limited number of doses this year. The provisional approval calendar also shows the WHO is expected to approve Moderna's (MRNA.O) COVID-19 vaccine, which is based on the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as Pfizer's, at the end of February. Moderna, whose vaccine is already approved in many Western countries including in the United States and the European Union, had no immediate comment. The vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which has a non-binding agreement to supply COVAX with 500 million doses over an unspecified timeframe, is expected to get WHO approval in May or June at the earliest, the WHO document says. J&J (JNJ.N) has not yet published results of its vaccine's Phase III clinical trials, but the EU has said it expects the company to apply for approval as early as February. A J&J spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  CHINA AND RUSSIA The WHO is also considering possible quick approvals for two Chinese vaccines, the provisional calendar shows. Sinopharm (1099.HK) and Sinovac (SVA.O) have filed their applications with the WHO, which is reviewing them and could make decisions on both in March at the earliest, it says. Neither vaccine was shortlisted by the WHO for possible advance purchase deals. WHO approval does not automatically lead to purchases by COVAX. It could also facilitate the rollout in poorer countries that acquire the vaccines directly. Sinopharm has filed applications for two COVID-19 vaccines, but the possible March approval concerns only the one developed by its Beijing-based affiliate, Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd (BIBP), which has already been widely used for inoculations in China. Sinovac has yet to release global results of its Phase III trials, but its vaccine has been approved for emergency use in countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey. Sinopharm and Sinovac did not respond to requests for comment. There is no provisional timetable yet for the possible approval of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, despite its developers having filed the relevant documentation, the timetable shows. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the main financial backer of Sputnik V, did not respond to a request for comment. "
0.5679390230302906," South Africa to get 9 million J&J vaccine shots - ministry JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa, which has yet to receive its first coronavirus vaccine doses, will be getting 9 million from Johnson & Johnson, the health ministry said on Monday. The government of Africa’s most advanced economy is trying to secure enough COVID-19 vaccines after health workers and scientists criticised it for not moving fast enough to inoculate its people. The country has recorded more than 1.3 million infections and more than 37,000 deaths related to the virus, the most in Africa. Health ministry spokeswoman Lwazi Manzi did not specify when the J&J doses might be available. She was confirming a report in the Business Day newspaper. The J&J doses take the total number of doses that South Africa stands to receive to more than 30 million. J&J did not respond to an email seeking comment. The U.S. healthcare company’s chief scientific officer said last week it was on track to roll out its single-shot coronavirus vaccine in March, and expects to have clear data on how effective it is by the end of this month or early February. South Africa should also receive about 12 million doses from the COVAX global vaccine distribution scheme co-led by the World Health Organization, about 12 million from an African Union (AU) arrangement, and 1.5 million from the Serum Institute of India which is making AstraZeneca shots. The calculation for the AU allocation is based on South Africa’s share of the continent’s population. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, the AU chair, said last week that the organisation had secured 270 million vaccine doses and that they would be distributed based on countries’ population size. South Africa’s health ministry said this month it was in advanced negotiations with J&J. Local pharmaceutical company Aspen will be manufacturing J&J shots but unless a firm agreement is signed with the South African government all those doses will be exported."

0.680065315557203," Progress reported on one-dose J&J vaccine; COVID-19 reinfections seen as rare (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Johnson & Johnson vaccine advancing through clinical trials An experimental COVID-19 vaccine from Johnson & Johnson produced protective antibodies against the novel coronavirus in 90% of 805 volunteers by 29 days, and that increased to 100% by day 57, according to data from an ongoing mid-stage study. Side effects such as fever, muscle aches and injection site pain resolved quickly, researchers reported on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. To be approved by regulators, the J&J vaccine must show efficacy as reflected by a lower risk of infections and severe disease in study participants who receive it compared to those who do not. Efficacy data from a large late-stage trial on the vaccine is due by February. Experts expect the vaccine to show efficacy at or above 80%, which would exceed the 50% benchmark for regulatory approval but trail the roughly 95% achieved in trials of already-authorized vaccines from Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE. The J&J vaccine requires just a single dose, and it does not have the cold storage requirements of the other vaccines. The likelihood of good results ""hopefully is very high,"" the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said this week. (bit.ly/2LpBhHm) COVID-19 gives some immunity, and reinfections seen as rare COVID-19 survivors are highly likely to have some immune protection against the virus for at least five months, and reinfections in recovered patients are rare, with only 44 cases found among 6,614 previously infected people, according to researchers leading a large ongoing study of healthcare workers in Britain. But when people do get COVID-19 a second time, they often have no symptoms, and so they may still be able to carry the coronavirus in their nose and throat and unwittingly pass it on, the researchers wrote in a report published on Wednesday by Public Health England (PHE) ahead of peer review. Experts have said people who contracted COVID-19 in the pandemic's first wave may now be vulnerable to infection again. ""We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,"" said study leader Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE in London. ""If you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others."" (bit.ly/3ihkuBZ; reut.rs/3ieWorA) Coronavirus targets cells’ energy engines Researchers have discovered an important line of attack used by the novel coronavirus: it targets an infected cell's mitochondria. These tiny organelles not only generate the energy that powers a cell's biochemical reactions, but they also play important roles in immune function. ""We knew that when the virus attacks cells, bad things happen - but we didn't know why,"" said Dr. Pinchas Cohen of the University of Southern California, whose team published its findings this month in the journal Scientific Reports. ""Now we can say, when the virus attacks cells, it damages the mitochondria."" In test tube experiments, the researchers found that the virus caused ""dramatic changes and impairment"" in the genes that regulate mitochondrial function, Cohen told Reuters. The implication, Cohen said, is that energy production in the cells and so-called innate immunity - the body's first line of defense against germs - are then impaired. Another implication is that having healthy mitochondria would help people combat the virus if they do become infected. ""We know that a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle promote mitochondrial health,"" Cohen said, whereas mitochondrial function deteriorates with age and with many chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. In the future, Cohen added, researchers may develop COVID-19 interventions to help improve mitochondrial health. (go.nature.com/3bFlCyc) ‘Nanobody’ combos block coronavirus, even when it mutates Combining small antibodies called nanobodies into single molecules to fight the novel coronavirus may be more effective than targeting it with conventional antibodies or single nanobodies, according to a new study. These ""multivalent"" nanobodies - containing multiple nanobody building blocks - ""are substantially better in neutralizing viruses"" and preventing them from breaking into cells, study leaders Florian Schmidt and Paul-Albert König of the University of Bonn told Reuters. The fused nanobodies ""help each other so that the outcome is better than just the sum of the two responses."" The nanobody constructs can target multiple sites on the coronavirus, making it harder for the pathogen to develop mutations that render treatment ineffective, according to a report published on Tuesday in the journal Science. While the researchers saw plenty of mutations that allowed the coronavirus to ""escape"" the effect of a single nanobody, ""we did not find any escape mutants that were able to replicate in the presence of those nanobodies that target two different surfaces at the same time,"" Schmidt and König said. A spin-off company of the University of Bonn, called DiosCURE, expects to start testing the combined nanobody molecules in people later this year.

1.6368782806899331," J&J vaccine on track for March rollout with target to deliver 1 billion doses this year: exec CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is on track to roll out its single-shot coronavirus vaccine in March, and expects to have clear data on how effective it is by the end of this month or early February, the U.S. healthcare company’s chief scientific officer said. Dr. Paul Stoffels in an interview on Tuesday also said J&J expects to meet its stated target of delivering 1 billion doses of its vaccine by the end of this year as the company ramps up production. Stoffels said it was premature to say how many doses would be available in March, presuming the company receives emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The New York Times reported earlier on Wednesday that J&J was experiencing manufacturing delays that would reduce the number of doses on hand initially. “We are aiming for 1 billion doses in 2021. If it is a single dose, that means 1 billion people. But it will be in a ramp-up throughout the year,” Stoffels said. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is being produced in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India with the help of contract manufacturers in order to build capacity. “It’s a few weeks too early to be giving final numbers on what we can launch in the first couple months,” he said. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser for the U.S. Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, said on Wednesday the vaccine could show efficacy at or above 80%. That would be below the efficacy of about 95% achieved in trials of already authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, but well above the 50% benchmark for approval set by regulators. It also has the advantage of being a single-shot vaccine, which means it can protect more people faster, and without the cold storage requirements of the other vaccines. Stoffels said the company set an efficacy target at 60%, but internally has been shooting for at least 70% to 80%. “We are very confident that the vaccine will be much higher than 60%,” he said, adding that the “aim is for the highest levels, hopefully closing in on what Moderna and Pfizer are doing.” Interim results from the company’s Phase I/II study, published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, have helped boost that confidence. The study showed that 90% of 805 volunteers aged 18 to 55 developed protective antibodies 29 days after a single dose, and that increased to 100% by day 57. The study is ongoing, but the protection has lasted 71 days so far. Similar data in participants over age 65 will be available in late January. The study also evaluated the effect of two doses of the vaccine given 56 days apart, and found the booster led to more than double the level in neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Side effects such as fever, muscle aches and injection site pain, were tolerable and resolved quickly. Stoffels said the interim data, combined with monkey studies published in the summer showing strong protection against disease and transmission after a single dose, increased his confidence in the vaccine. “The likelihood that we can now translate this into humans in our Phase III study hopefully is very high,” he said, adding, “We’ll see in a few weeks.” Although J&J’s clinical trial protocols allowed for an early look at the data after 20 people became infected by the novel coronavirus, the company intends to deliver data on at least 154 confirmed cases - the target needed to fully assess the vaccine’s efficacy - when it releases results. That should come in the last week of January or the first week of February, Stoffels said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires at least two months of safety data on half of the study participants to ensure no unexpected side effects crop up. The company crossed that two-month threshold earlier this month. “That point came so close to the final analysis that we decided not to do an interim analysis,” Stoffels said. J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA based on the study of the vaccine as a single shot, Stoffels said. If results of ongoing studies suggest people would fare better with a second booster shot, Stoffels said J&J would file separately for a booster dose authorization."

Clinical data on the vaccine has been assessed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) since Dec. 1 under a rolling review to speed up possible approval. A senior EU official, who is involved in negotiations with vaccine makers and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the J&J shot could be available from April 1 in Europe. Earlier on Wednesday, an EU lawmaker said J&J could seek EU approval for its one-shot vaccine in February. “EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides announced during our (EU lawmakers) group meeting this morning that the vaccine manufacturer Johnson & Johnson is likely to submit an application for approval to the EU for their vaccine in February,” said Peter Liese, who speaks on health matters for the EU’s centre-right group, the assembly’s largest. Following Liese’s comments, a spokesman for Kyriakides said: “We cannot give any precise indications regarding an application for conditional marketing authorisation, but we of course hope that an application could be submitted in the coming weeks.” EMA, in a statement, said “a date for submission of a marketing authorisation application has not yet been confirmed.” Asked about the timeline described by the EU source and the lawmaker, which appeared to be slightly behind expectations for the vaccine in the United States, a J&J spokesman said talks with regulators were underway, but it was premature to get into the specifics of supply plans at this stage. J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the drugmaker expects to have clear data on how effective its vaccine is by the end of this month or early February and was on track for a U.S. rollout in March. The EU drugs regulator had said in December it expected the J&J to apply in the first quarter of this year. It took EMA 20 days to approve the vaccine developed by BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc, and just over a month to authorise the Moderna Inc shot after their applications were submitted in early December. The two vaccines are so far the only ones approved in the EU, while AstraZeneca submitted its application on Tuesday. “If all goes well, we will already have the fourth corona vaccine available in a few weeks,” Liese added. The EU has booked 200 million doses of the J&J vaccine and has an option to order another 200 million shots. The J&J vaccine is administered as a single shot, while those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech require two doses three or four weeks apart for full protection. The EU has invested about 360 million euros ($438 million) to secure the J&J vaccine with a downpayment that would need to be complemented with payments by EU governments willing to buy the vaccine after approval.

5.079960220379305," Colombia reaches deal with J&J for 9 million vaccine doses BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia has reached an agreement with Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical division Janssen to acquire 9 million doses of coronavirus vaccines, President Ivan Duque said in a televised address on Wednesday. The Andean country, which has reported over 1.6 million cases of coronavirus and just under 43,000 deaths, had already secured deals with Pfizer and AstraZeneca Plc to provide 10 million doses each of their COVID-19 vaccines. Colombia will also receive an additional 20 million doses through the COVAX mechanism. “Today the agreement was signed for the acquisition of 9 million vaccines for 9 million citizens,” Duque said. While the earlier-secured vaccines require two doses per person, the J&J vaccines need just one, meaning the country has secured enough for around 29 million people, Duque said. More vaccine agreements will be finalized in the coming days, Duque added, allowing for the vaccination of 35 million people in the country. “According to experts, with those 35 million (vaccinated people), we will be coming closer towards herd immunity,” Duque said. Colombia will provide COVID-19 vaccines for free under its national vaccination plan, but is also preparing rules to allow people to purchase the vaccine privately, according to the health ministry. First in line for vaccination will be healthcare workers and those over 80 years old, followed by people aged between 60 and 79, and those whose chronic health conditions put them at greater risk of severe COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Fearing rising infection numbers over the holiday season, Colombian authorities have implemented measures such as banning sales of alcohol in bars and restaurants at night, as well as limiting when people can enter shops based on their national identity number."

8.391962089393946," Germany says it needs third COVID vaccine to make inoculation universal BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany could offer shots against the coronavirus to all who want them by the summer if a third vaccine from either Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca or CureVac wins EU approval, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. Spahn was grilled during an interview broadcast live on the website of mass-selling Bild newspaper about media reports that Germany had so far only received four million doses of Pfizer Inc’s and BioNTech’s vaccine compared to five million shots secured by Israel, whose population is one-tenth of Germany’s. “We have not ordered insufficiently,” Spahn said. “We expect on the whole some 130 million doses from Moderna and BioNTech which will be enough to offer the vaccine to anyone wishing to be vaccinated.” Asked when Germany would be in a position to make the vaccine available to all those wishing to have it, Spahn said: “It depends if we get more approvals, meaning Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and CureVac. If one or two additional vaccines get approval, I think we will reach that point toward summer.” Germany at the weekend rolled out the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine developed by the German biotech company with its U.S. partner, starting in elderly care homes where death rates are highest. Europe’s biggest economy has been in a strict lockdown that is expected to be extended beyond Jan. 10 as it struggles to contain a second wave of infections. BioNTech/Pfizer is the only COVID-19 vaccine approved in the EU. Moderna has said it expects the EU, which has already secured about 160 million shots from the U.S.-based company, to approve its vaccine in mid-January. German biotech firm CureVac this month started a large Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of its vaccine candidate. J&J has said it has enrolled about 45,000 participants for the first late-stage trial of its single-dose vaccine candidate and that it expects interim data by late-January. A senior EU drugs regulator has said the bloc will most likely not be able to approve the vaccine developed by drug maker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in January. Spahn said if a third vaccine is approved in the EU, Germany would in theory be able to achieve herd immunity through inoculation next year."

6.853564772697672," South Korea to import J&J, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for 16 million people SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has signed deals with Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen to import coronavirus vaccines to cover up to 16 million people, as it grapples with the third wave of the pandemic, the prime minister said on Thursday. The government has faced growing public pressure over their COVID-19 vaccine procurement plans as the country reported its second-highest daily tally of cases on Wednesday. Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, will be enough to cover 10 million people and its shipment is expected in the third quarter of 2021. “We are mobilising the entire national capabilities to bring in the shipments within the second quarter,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a televised briefing. “The negotiation is underway.” Chung said the doses from Janssen - J&J’s pharmaceuticals division - were added from the initial amount for 4 million people to 6 million and will be ready for inoculation from the second quarter. The Pfizer and Janssen deals are part of a government plan to buy enough doses from four drugmakers and the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization, that will allow immunisation of at least 85% of South Korea’s population of 52 million. The government had already signed a deal with AstraZeneca Plc, which will be shipped as early as January next year, and is in final talks with Moderna Inc to sign a deal in January to secure 20 million doses. Health authorities will start a public vaccination programme as early as February next year, which will be completed around November, before the start of the flu season, Yang Dong-gyo, a senior official at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), told a briefing. The government had allocated an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year’s budget for vaccines. The KDCA reported 985 new coronavirus cases as of Wednesday midnight, bringing the nation’s tally to 53,533, with 756 deaths. South Korea has ramped up testing to more than 55,000 people a day, compared with roughly 16,000 a day in September, to track down cases from unknown origin and asymptomatic cases. Authorities have shut down all ski resorts and winter tourist spots and banned gatherings of more than four in a bid to stop the spread during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

5.542297630962737," Inside J&J's Latam COVID vaccine trial, a rush to recruit is followed by disappointment SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson abruptly called for an end to enrollment in its coronavirus vaccine trial and told scientists from six Latin American countries to wrap up their work within 48 hours, two researchers told Reuters. The halt was due to J&J’s decision, announced later on that same day on Dec. 9, to cap the number of participants at about 40,000 people globally, down from a previous plan for 60,000. The drugmaker said that a surge in coronavirus cases in the areas it was testing would give it enough data to vet the vaccine. Wrapping up recruitment more quickly - while continuing to monitor volunteers already participating - would keep J&J on target to seek U.S. authorization for the shot early next year, the company has said, if it proves successful against a virus that has already killed nearly 1.7 million people. J&J told Reuters it would not comment on its enrollment beyond a Friday statement that said the trial had closed. But the move has raised questions, and sparked disappointment, for some in Latin America, according to interviews with a dozen researchers, government officials and disease experts. Dr Miguel O’Ryan, leader of trials in three medical centers in and around Santiago, Chile, told Reuters his trials were abruptly closed to new volunteers after his team of 50 doctors and nurses had rushed to find people willing to take part in each age group. Researchers had been left “furious” that they weren’t given any prior warning and had to let down hundreds of people already scheduled to participate, he said. “At first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you ‘that’s it,’” he said. “You understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.” Peru, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia had all offered to participate in the trial, hoping that would give them preferential access to J&J’s vaccine in the global race to stockpile doses. J&J told Reuters in September that those hosting trials would have priority for vaccine supply. Now some in government circles and the public health community fear those deals could be compromised. And local researchers have been left wondering whether they will be fully compensated for their investment in incomplete trials. J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers. The drugmaker expects an initial analysis of the data by late January. If the trial proves successful, the company plans to seek U.S. authorization in February. To date, none of the six countries in Latin America participating in the trial has finalized a vaccine supply agreement with J&J, even though they still do not have enough doses from other vaccine makers to inoculate all of their citizens. Health officials in all six countries said that negotiations were still in progress. Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who has extensive disease research experience in Latin America, said ensuring both rich and poor countries had good access to vaccines was a “key social justice issue for the world.” “Countries in Latin America, as they are establishing trial sites, need to pressure for these deals when they are negotiating with the industry. But also it’s on the companies,” he said. Ko cited the approach of AstraZeneca Plc to helping less wealthy nations produce and distribute its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with Oxford University. AstraZeneca’s vaccine is viewed as one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures. J&J turned to Latin America when infection rates there spiked, as a way to accelerate testing of the vaccine and gauge its effectiveness in diverse populations. The drugmaker shared its plans for the region with Reuters in September, saying it aimed to enroll 20,000 participants in the six countries by November. The J&J vaccine is easier to transport and store and is administered in a single shot, unlike vaccines from front-runners Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are delivered in two doses. J&J has signed an agreement in principle to provide the COVAX vaccine program with up to 500 million doses of its vaccine through 2022 for distribution to lower income countries. “This vaccine would be a game changer because of that single dose, not just for Latin America but for Asia, South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and much of the world,” said Ko. “Two doses is exponentially more difficult to administer. I would think countries would jump on this if a safe and effective one-dose vaccine comes onboard.” Brazil has signed non-binding letters of intent to purchase vaccines from four companies including J&J, with health officials indicating a preference for the J&J single-dose shot. Mexico’s Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said earlier this month at a news conference that hosting the Janssen trial would give the country priority access to the vaccine. Foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said last week Mexico could order 22 million doses under a memorandum of understanding. The Mexican government declined to comment on the halting of trial recruitment and the likelihood now of a priority vaccine supply deal. A Peruvian government source told Reuters that new deals could be announced in the coming days, but declined to comment on which companies they could involve. The source said that there were constant surprises in the fast-moving negotiations taking place between governments and pharmaceutical companies around the world in the race to lock in deals, with intense and regular back-and-forth around price, quantity, delivery times and contractual conditions. “Things change so fast that I could tell you something now and tomorrow it will be outdated,” he said. During a conference call that Janssen - J&J’s pharmaceuticals division - convened with scientists from 100 Latin American trial sites on Dec. 9, local researchers, who had been working at full speed to help the company meet its ambitious goals, voiced their anger at the sudden announcement they should now wrap up their operations when their target volunteer numbers were not yet met and they had hundreds of people scheduled to be screened and vaccinated, according to two participants. J&J in the statement issued on Friday expressed “its thanks to all participants, trial sites and health care professionals involved in the ENSEMBLE study.” It did not comment on the angry reaction over the conference call. In all, the Latin American sites appear to have enrolled about 16,000 people, according to a Reuters tally of figures reported by trial leaders and governments. Any shortfall would be meaningful for individual research sites, who are paid based on the number of people they recruit. Reuters could not determine the range of what researchers are paid, which varies depending on a number of factors, including their specific locations, third-party partners and target size of trials. The urgency to sign people up quickly was evident at a site in Colina, Chile, late November, where a Reuters journalist was among the dozens of volunteers who moved along the queue in a narrow waiting room. Most of those volunteering were medical workers, the worst-hit by the pandemic, and their families. Trial staff also signed up their own families and friends to help make their numbers, they told Reuters. The start of trials in Chile, Peru and Mexico were delayed by several weeks, held up by factors like regulatory scrutiny, technical glitches and a scramble to get supplies. In Brazil, the effort began without a hitch in October, with people from all walks of life taking part, said a researcher. “There were thousands who volunteered. People are very enthusiastic to help and put up with long waits,” said Eduardo Vasconcellos, trial leader at the L2iP clinical research institute in Brasilia. Alejandra Camino, a trial investigator at privately-run DIM health clinics in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, said that, although the abrupt end to enrollment was not ideal, it was important to remain flexible in the fight against COVID-19. “It’s a disappointment because if you set it up and found a venue, your operation is now going to be out of pocket,” she said of her colleagues’ work on their trials. “But we are talking about a pandemic.”"

7.20616356991636," Spain's Reig Jofre to manufacture J&J's COVID-19 vaccine, shares soar BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish pharmaceutical Reig Jofre said on Tuesday it had agreed with Johnson & Johnson to produce the U.S. company’s COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the third Spanish company to be chosen to take part in manufacturing coronavirus vaccines. After the announcement, Reig Jofre’s stock price surged 32% to 4.99 euros ($6.07) a share, on track for its best day ever. J&J’s Janssen subsidiary will transfer the technology required for large-scale manufacture of the vaccine candidate to Reig Jofre, allowing production at its plant in Barcelona to get underway once the shot receives regulatory approval, the Spanish company said in a statement. Under the terms of the agreement, Reig Jofre said it will be responsible for the formulation, filling and packaging of the vaccine, while Janssen will handle distribution. The company’s new plant in Barcelona is under construction and due to start operating in the first quarter of 2021. Spain’s pharmaceutical firm Rovi was selected in October for the fill and finish final stage of manufacturing for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine outside the United States, which is expected to start in early 2021. In September, Spanish biopharmaceutical group Zendal said it would handle production in the European Union of the antigen of U.S. Novavax’s coronavirus vaccine project. Reig Jofre said last month it would able to produce 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine a year at its new factory without cancelling any existing contracts. The company’s CEO Ignasi Biosca told Reuters in July the company should have the capacity to produce between one million to two million vaccine doses per day next year. Biosca said it could invest an additional 2-3 million euros to adapt its plant for the final step in the production process of putting the vaccine into vials or syringes, such as guaranteeing the low temperature needed to preserve it.

3.646876203366873," Mexico says could order 22 mln more vaccine doses from J&J MEXICO CITY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Mexico could order an additional 22 million doses of coronavirus vaccine from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit under a memorandum of understanding signed this week, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Tuesday. Janssen has begun its coronavirus clinical trials in Mexico, and Lopez-Gatell said the memorandum his government signed on Monday gave it the option of ordering additional doses. “So there we could end up getting up to 22 million more vaccines from Janssen,” Lopez-Gatell, the government’s coronavirus czar, told a regular evening news conference. “It’s not a contract yet, it’s a letter of intent.” Earlier, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would wait his turn for the COVID-19 vaccine, as officials detailed a plan that prioritizes healthcare workers and the elderly to receive the first doses.

Johnson & Johnson gained 1.9% after the company said it could obtain late-stage trial results of a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine it is developing, earlier than expected. Pfizer Inc also rose 3.2% as it cleared the next hurdle in the race to get its COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use, after the U.S. health regulator released documents raising no new safety or efficacy issues. Wall Street’s main indexes have traded in a tight range for most of the session so far, as investors awaited more stimulus in the face of surging COVID-19 cases and strict restrictions in California. “When you are in a market where there is so much near-term negative news because of the virus, but so much future positive news because of the vaccine ... you do get into this tug of war,” said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. “We are at that equilibrium point where there are as many optimists as pessimists about where the market is headed in 2021” Investors are closely watching whether policymakers will be able to clinch an agreement on a long-awaited coronavirus relief bill and a $1.4 trillion spending bill, with Friday eyed as a deadline to avoid a government shutdown. The U.S. Congress will vote this week on a one-week stopgap funding bill to provide more time for lawmakers to reach a deal on both spending and pandemic relief. Positive developments related to the COVID-19 vaccine have in the recent weeks helped investors look past the surge in infections and raise bets on a steady economic recovery next year. Analysts now expect investor attention to gradually shift from vaccine approvals to their global distribution. “I don’t know if investors are recognizing how long the process is going to take, but the market tends to look out a little more than the very near term. Right now it is predicting that there will be a good distribution system in place some time by the middle of next year,” Meckler said. At 12:21 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 88.62 points, or 0.29%, at 30,158.41, the S&P 500 was up 5.21 points, or 0.14%, at 3,697.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 5.85 points, or 0.05%, at 12,525.79. Boeing Co slipped 0.6% after company data showed the planemaker lost another 63 orders for its newly ungrounded 737 MAX jet in November. Tesla Inc fell 1.9% after the electric-car maker unveiled a $5 billion capital raise, its second such move in three months. Drug developer Moderna Inc climbed 4.2%, after Switzerland increased its confirmed orders for its COVID-19 vaccine doses to 7.5 million from 4.5 million. Energy shares recovered some of the previous session’s losses, even as crude prices remained under pressure.

4.507745923201807," South Korea to boost COVID-19 vaccine air transport by easing dry ice rules SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea more than tripled the number of coronavirus vaccine containers aircraft can carry by easing limits on dry ice needed to keep them cold, the country’s deputy minister for aviation told Reuters on Tuesday. South Korea said on Tuesday it signed deals to provide coronavirus vaccines for 44 million people next year, including from AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. Airlines and governments round the globe are working on ways to establish cold chain delivery systems for vaccines, like Pfizer’s, which requires storage at below minus 70 Celsius, and Moderna’s, which needs to be kept at -20C. A difficulty with vaccine transport is that airplanes can only carry a limited amount of dry ice - frozen carbon dioxide - as it turns into gas over time, displacing the breathable air in the cabin. The transport ministry raised the limit of dry ice a plane can carry from 3,300 to up to 11,000 kilogrammes, which will allow a Boeing 747 cargo plane to carry 52 containers of vaccines, up from 15, Kim Sang-do, deputy minister for civil aviation, said on the sidelines of a forum. To allow this, it will boost safety measures such as carbon dioxide emission inspection and installation of gas meters, the ministry said in a statement. “Vaccine transport is difficult due to the expertise and the steady temperature necessary,” Kim said, adding that the unbroken cold chain of temperature management could include a cold cargo facility the size of two soccer fields being built near the main international airport in Incheon. It is expected to be completed in February next year and operated by Korean Air, according to the ministry. United States’ Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said last week that it supported its first mass vaccine air shipment, adding it is working to provide guidance on dry ice safety rules."

The government has said it was in final talks with global drugmakers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson over their experimental vaccines, and launched a preliminary review of AstraZeneca’s product in October for potential fast-track approval. The JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said health authorities signed a contract with the Britain-based company on Nov. 27, and were nearing agreements with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, citing an unidentified government official. “The AstraZeneca deal has been done, and a memorandum of understanding was reached with both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. But further negotiations are needed to finalise the amount of supplies and the timing of shipment,” the official was quoted as saying. The Yonhap news agency also reported, citing an unnamed health official, that an agreement with AstraZeneca was inked recently and the government would make an announcement as early as next week after completing negotiations with other firms. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said that the JoongAng report was not the government’s official position but that it would finalise talks and unveil comprehensive results shortly. The KDCA has said 172 billion won ($157 million) was set aside to buy an initial 60 million doses this year, enough to vaccinate about 60% of the country’s population of 52 million, around the second quarter of 2021.

The European Medicines Agency said the review would go on until enough evidence was available for a formal marketing authorisation application for the vaccine, which is being developed by the U.S. company’s Janssen unit. “Janssen will continue to work with Health Canada to complete the rolling review process and to facilitate an approval when appropriate,” J&J said. Rivals Moderna Inc and Pfizer-BioNTech also applied for emergency authorization on Tuesday to launch their vaccine candidates in Europe.

8.013784411528723," COVID-19 vaccine sprint as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna seek emergency EU approval FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are in a tight race to launch their COVID-19 vaccines in Europe after both applied for emergency EU approval on Tuesday, though there was uncertainty over whether a rollout could begin this year. The applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came a day after Moderna sought emergency use for its shot in the United States and more than a week after Pfizer and BioNTech did the same. U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month. “We can start to deliver within a few hours (of an approval),” said Sierk Poetting, head of operations and finance at BioNTech. “We have been stocking up. And everything that is there can really be distributed within a few hours.” The EMA clouded the timeline, however, when it said it would complete its review for that vaccine by Dec. 29 at the latest, and for Moderna’s shot by Jan. 12. It added its schedule may be subject to change as its evaluation proceeds. The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would likely give its final authorization for a vaccine’s rollout days after a recommendation by the EMA. An effective immunization is seen as the main weapon against the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.4 million lives and ravaged economies across the globe. Close to 50 potential vaccines are being tested on volunteers worldwide. Both U.S. biotech firm Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have reported preliminary findings of more than 90% effectiveness - an unexpectedly high rate - in trials of their vaccines, which are both based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. Their work validates that of several biotech experts, who for years have been labouring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory. Both inoculations work by injecting people with customised genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response. Pfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on Nov. 18 that showed their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns. Moderna Inc said on Monday that full results from a late-stage study showed its candidate, mRNA-1273, was 94.1% effective, also with no serious safety concerns. Any clearance in the EU and United States for the vaccines will be “conditional” or for “emergency use”, meaning developers are obliged to continue trials and provide more trial results as they emerge. The European filings complete so-called rolling reviews, initiated by the EMA on Oct. 6 in the case of Pfizer and on Nov. 16 for Moderna, aimed at speeding up the process by doing a real-time assessment of the data as it lands. The EMA said on Tuesday it had started a rolling review of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine candidate after preliminary results showed it triggered production of antibodies and immune cells against the virus. The review will go on until enough evidence ss available for a formal marketing authorisation application, the regulator added. The British government said here last week that Pfizer and BioNTech had reported the data from their clinical trials to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)."

12.129325130176335," Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $120 million damages in New York baby powder case NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has been ordered by a New York state judge to pay $120 million in damages to a Brooklyn woman and her husband, after she blamed her cancer on asbestos exposure from using the company’s baby powder. Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state supreme court in Manhattan reduced the payout from the $325 million a jury awarded Donna Olson, 67, and Robert Olson, 65, in May 2019 following a 14-week trial. While upholding the jury’s liability finding, Lebovits wrote on Nov. 11 that the damages were too high, and the Olsons could either accept $120 million or have a new trial on damages. The judge approved the lowered payout on Wednesday, court records show. It includes $15 million of compensatory damages and $105 million of punitive damages, down from an original $25 million and $300 million, respectively. Johnson & Johnson said it will appeal the verdict, citing “significant legal and evidentiary errors” at the trial. “We deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important,” the company said. “We remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.” Jerome Block, a lawyer for the Olsons, said they were satisfied with the result and confident it would stand. He also said Donna Olson’s mesothelioma “is at an advanced stage, and we are hoping for the best.” Donna Olson had testified that she used Johnson’s Baby Powder or Shower to Shower daily for more than 50 years. Lebovits wrote that jurors could find that Johnson & Johnson was for many years “knowingly deceitful about” or “willfully blind to” potential health risks of its talc products, in part to maintain market share and profit. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court a $2.12 billion damages award in Missouri to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its baby powder and other talc products. Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder’s safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades about asbestos in its talc. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.

13.246729406076737," Spain authorises Phase III trial of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's medicines agency authorised the launch of late-stage trials of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday as the race to develop successful vaccines intensifies. The Phase III trial of the two-dose vaccination will be carried out in nine hospitals throughout Spain on volunteers both with and without previous health conditions, the AEMPS agency said in a statement. J&J started mid-stage phase II trials in Spain and other countries in September and launched a late-stage trial in Britain on Monday. The Phase III trials will be carried out on 30,000 volunteers in nine countries. The two-dose study will run in parallel with a trials of a single shot regimen involving 60,000 participants which was launched in September. The Spanish hospitals involved in the trials will enrol volunteers as soon as possible, the AEMPS said, adding that 20% will be younger than 40 and 30% older than 60. They will be given a first dose of either a placebo or the experimental shot, currently called Ad26COV2, followed by a second dose or placebo later. Conclusions will only be available after analysing the data at the end of the trials, the Spanish medicines agency said. The news comes after Pfizer PFE.N and BioNTech BNTX.O, Russia and Moderna MRNA.O all released interim data from Phase III trials of their potential vaccines showing more than 90% efficacy, boosting hopes that vaccines against the pandemic disease may be ready for use soon."
11.691413112719628," J&J expects data for U.S. authorization of COVID-19 vaccine by February, says head scientist (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N chief scientist said the drugmaker is recruiting over 1,000 people per day for the late-stage trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine and expects to have all the data needed to seek U.S. authorization by February or earlier. “By the end of the year or around the end of the year, we should have 60,000 people in the study,” Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said in an interview ahead of this week’s Reuters Total Health conference. “And efficacy endpoint should be there in the first few weeks or months, January or February, of the new year,” he added. The Phase III trial of the single-dose vaccine started in late September. The company paused the trial in October because of a serious medical event in one participant and resumed after getting the green light from an independent safety panel. J&J must provide safety data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for at least one-half of trial participants for a duration of two months after they receive the vaccine. “So that will bring us around the year end or early next year for having all the data,” he added. J&J lags some of its rivals in the global race to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the virus that has killed over 1.3 million people worldwide and roiled the global economy. Rival Moderna MRNA.O on Monday said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, following similar results from Pfizer last week. Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines use a new technology known as messenger RNA, or mRNA. By contrast, J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger the body’s immune system. J&J's candidate is a single-dose vaccine, whereas the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer and another under development by AstraZeneca AZN.L all require two shots separated by several weeks. “In a pandemic a single shot is definitely important globally,” Stoffels said. “(A two-shot vaccine) is a very significant operational challenge. More so in healthcare systems which are less well organized.” Single-shot vaccines will likely benefit in particular remote areas, Stoffels said.

17.012659875127735," Johnson & Johnson fails to overturn $2.12 billion baby powder verdict, plans Supreme Court appeal (Reuters) - Missouri's highest court on Tuesday refused to consider Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N appeal of a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its baby powder and other talc products. The Missouri Supreme Court let stand a June 23 decision by a state appeals court, which upheld a jury’s July 2018 finding of liability but reduced J&J’s payout from $4.69 billion after dismissing claims by some of the 22 plaintiffs. Johnson & Johnson said it plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It said the verdict was the product of a “fundamentally flawed trial, grounded in a faulty presentation of the facts,” and was “at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson’s Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer.” The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company also said it will set aside a $2.1 billion reserve for the verdict, to be reflected in its year-end financial results. Kevin Parker, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement: “Johnson & Johnson should accept the findings of the jury and the appellate court and move forward with proper compensation to the victims.” Johnson & Johnson said in May it would stop selling its Baby Powder talc in the United States and Canada. The company said last month it faces more than 21,800 lawsuits claiming that its talc products cause cancer because of contamination from asbestos, a known carcinogen. In its June decision, the Missouri Court of Appeals said it was reasonable to infer from the evidence that Johnson & Johnson “disregarded the safety of consumers” in its drive for profit, despite knowing its talc products caused ovarian cancer. It also found “significant reprehensibility” in the company’s conduct. Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder’s safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc.

16.6897329017329," Brazil allows Johnson & Johnson to resume trial of COVID-19 vaccine SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian health regulator Anvisa has authorized resumption of a clinical trial of Johnson & Johnson’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine, according to a statement from the government agency on Tuesday. The J&J vaccine is one of four being tested in Brazil, which has the world’s third worst outbreak behind the United States and India, and the second-highest COVID-19 death toll. J&J’s trial in Brazil had been suspended since Oct. 12, so a safety panel could evaluate an unexplained illness of a participant in its planned 60,000-person Phase III study. Testing of the vaccine in the United States resumed last month. Anvisa said when the trial was interrupted, 12 volunteers in Brazil, all from Rio de Janeiro, had either received a dose of the vaccine or a placebo. The study in the South American country is being conducted in 11 states, and is expected to involve up to 7,560 people over the age of 18, Anvisa said."

17.074403880806624," South Africa's Aspen agrees initial deal to make J&J vaccine candidate JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African pharmaceutical company Aspen Pharmacare APNJ.J said on Monday it had reached a preliminary agreement with Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to commercially manufacture its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, sending its shares higher. The country’s biggest drugmaker said it had agreed to provide capacity required for the manufacture of J&J’s vaccine candidate, which is still in clinical trials, at its Port Elizabeth facility. The agreement with J&J will see Aspen perform formulation, filling and secondary packaging of the vaccine for the U.S. firm, the company said. Aspen’s shares rose more than 4% on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on the announcement. The company said it had invested more than 3 billion rand ($184.2 million) in the Port Elizabeth facility. “The production area where it is intended that the vaccine candidate will be manufactured has capacity to produce more than 300 million doses per annum,” it added. South Africa has recorded more than 726,000 coronavirus infections, the highest number on the African continent, and more than 19,400 deaths. It is hosting at least four clinical trials of potential COVID-19 vaccines, including the J&J candidate. The agreement between Aspen and J&J is subject to the completion of technology transfer activities and finalisation of certain commercial terms. Last month South Africa’s Biovac Institute - a joint venture between the government and private sector - said it was in talks to produce some of the vaccines the country needs to protect itself against COVID-19.

19.495763106190196," J&J plans to test its COVID-19 vaccine in ages 12-18 soon NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson plans to start testing its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in youths aged 12 to 18 as soon as possible, and the company’s previous experience with the same technology in a vaccine successfully used in children could give it a leg up with regulators. “We plan to go into children as soon as we possibly can, but very carefully in terms of safety,” J&J’s Dr. Jerry Sadoff told a virtual meeting of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday. Depending on safety and other factors, the company plans to test in even younger children afterwards, said Sadoff, a vaccine research scientist at J&J’s Janssen unit, without giving a timeline. J&J said in a statement that it is currently in discussions with regulators and partners regarding the inclusion of the pediatric population in its trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is important for drugmakers to test their vaccines in children. Some doctors have raised concerns that the vaccines themselves could trigger a rare, life-threatening condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in some children. Rival drugmaker Pfizer Inc has already begun testing the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany’s BioNTech in children as young as 12. Their vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that has yet to produce an approved vaccine. J&J’s uses a cold virus to deliver coronavirus genetic material in order to spur an immune response. The platform - called AdVac - is used in a vaccine for Ebola that was approved in Europe earlier this year and used on more than 100,000 people, including infants, children, and pregnant women. The technology’s history of safety should be important to regulators, said Dr. Paul Spearman, director of the infectious diseases division of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. “Most of the toxicities are going to come from the platform and not from putting a different insert into the platform, Spearman said. So replacing the Ebola genetic material with that of the novel coronavirus “is unlikely to give you major issues,” he added. J&J started testing the vaccine in adults in a 60,000-volunteer Phase III study in late September. It had to pause the trial earlier this month because of a serious medical event in one participant. The study resumed last week."

15.073911914420728," AstraZeneca resumes U.S. COVID-19 vaccine trial and next week J&J prepares to do same (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L has resumed the U.S. trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine after approval by regulators, and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N is preparing to resume its trial on Monday or Tuesday, the companies said on Friday. The news signaled progress against the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 41 million globally, including 8 million Americans and comes 10 days before a U.S. presidential election that may hinge on plans here to fight the pandemic. AstraZeneca, one of the leading vaccine developers, paused its U.S. trial on Sept. 6 after a report of a serious neurological illness, believed to be transverse myelitis, in a participant in the company’s UK trial. J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill. Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators. Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine. “As this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,” said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts. Infections are rising in 80 countries here as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching. J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill. J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines’ effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J’s chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said. J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said. So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients’ illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient’s sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said. AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine. AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case. Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation. AstraZeneca’s vaccine is being developed along with researchers at Oxford University."

13.14792548421699," Exclusive: U.S. trial of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine may resume this week - sources CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L COVID-19 vaccine trial in the United States is expected to resume as early as this week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed its review of a serious illness in a study participant, four sources told Reuters. AstraZeneca’s large, late-stage U.S. trial has been on hold since Sept. 6, after a participant in the company’s UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis. The sources, who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous, said they have been told the trial could resume later this week. It was unclear how the FDA would characterize the illness, they said. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment. The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants, according to one of the sources. UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was “insufficient evidence to say for certain” that it was or was not related to the vaccine. It permitted the trial to resume in the UK, according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters. “In this case, after considering the information, the independent reviewers and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recommended that vaccinations should continue,” the draft consent form stated. “Close monitoring of the affected individual and other participants will be continued.” Regulators in Brazil, India and South Africa also previously allowed AstraZeneca to resume its vaccine trials there. AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness. Early data from large-scale trials in the United States of vaccines from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O are expected some time next month. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N last week paused its Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial to investigate an unexplained illness in a study participant. At the time of the announcement, the company did not know whether the volunteer had been given its vaccine or a placebo. A J&J spokesman on Tuesday said the study remains on pause as the company continues its review of medical information before deciding to restart the trial. J&J noted last week that its “study pause” was voluntary. By contrast, AstraZeneca’s trial is on “regulatory hold,” which is imposed by health authorities. Vaccines are seen as essential to helping end the pandemic that has battered economies around the world and claimed more than 1 million lives - over 220,000 of them in the United States. Responding to a request about the AstraZeneca trial, British regulators shared with Reuters a draft of a form letter to UK vaccine trial participants, dated Oct. 14 and signed by the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Team. It says the U.S. FDA had “completed their analysis” and said vaccination under the study in the United States would resume shortly. FDA “has come to the same conclusion as the other drug regulators including the MHRA,” the letter states. The Health Research Authority, which helps oversee UK medical research, said in an email to Reuters that it vetted the communication to make sure it was suitable to ensure informed consent among study volunteers. It could not confirm that the letter had been issued. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the communication is not from the company and it “cannot verify the content,” referring to the draft letter to study participants. “We also cannot comment on a pending FDA decision,” she said. The Oxford study team did not respond to requests for comment. In another of the documents directed at trial participants, the Oxford vaccine study team noted that there was not enough evidence to link the neurological problem seen in the UK trial to the vaccine. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the document, said it can be difficult to link a rare side effect specifically to a vaccine to the exclusion of other potential causes. Transverse myelitis, which the study volunteer is believed to have developed, typically occurs at a rate of 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, so it would be unusual to see it in a trial of 9,000 individuals. Other viruses including those that cause West Nile and polio can trigger the condition, as can physical trauma. The regulators have to weigh whether a rare side effect is vaccine-related and could occur again against the sickness and deaths linked with COVID-19, Offit said. “That’s always the line that you walk.”"
8.989785966761893," GSK-J&J's long-acting HIV injection gets EU panel endorsement (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc said an injection of its cabotegravir drug given every two months, in combination with Johnson & Johnson’s rilpivirine, was recommended for approval to treat HIV infections by a panel of the European health regulator. The treatment is a long-acting regimen, which can reduce the number of doses required to 12 or six per year instead of a daily intake of pills. If approved, it would be the first complete long-acting HIV regimen requiring dosing just once in two months (in the EU region), GSK said. The combination as an injection is already approved in Canada and is currently under review in the United States. Shares of GSK were trading up 2.5% at 1410.4p, while J&J shares were marginally up during premarket trading. Gilead’s Truvada daily oral pill is currently the standard of care for preventing HIV, but GSK hopes to challenge its dominance by making shorter, long-lasting regimens and less toxic alternatives through its ViiV Healthcare unit. The positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency comes months after GSK said cabotegravir was found to be 66% more effective in preventing HIV infections than Truvada. Some 75 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and about 32 million people have died since it began in the 1980s. While final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the CHMP’s recommendation and endorses them within a couple of months."
8.989785966761893," NIH tests therapies to help cut hospital stays for COVID-19 patients (Reuters) - The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has started a late-stage trial to evaluate if immune-modulating therapies from three drugmakers can help reduce the need for ventilators for COVID-19 patients and shorten their hospital stay. The NIH said on Friday it has selected three agents for the study - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N unit Janssen Research's Remicade, Bristol Myers Squibb's BMY.N Orencia and Abbvie Inc's ABBV.N experimental drug cenicriviroc. The study will enroll up to 2,100 hospitalized adults with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms in the United States and Latin America. Immune-modulating therapies are medications that alter the way the immune system works. Severe infections are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system, known as a “cytokine storm”, and drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system can play a role in arresting a rapid escalation of symptoms. This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure, among other life-threatening complications. The NIH said its clinical trial - ACTIV-1 Immune Modulators (IM) - will last six months, and the agency will study if the therapeutics can restore balance by modulating that immune response. All patients will be given Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir - the current standard of care - and also be randomly assigned to receive a placebo or one of the immune modulators as an add-on treatment, the NIH said in a statement. Remdesivir was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and has been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery, though the European Union is investigating it for possible kidney injury."

7.163078136672402," Dollar strengthens as vaccine, stimulus hopes dim NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar strengthened on Tuesday as investors turned cautious after a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 study was paused and as hopes dimmed that a fiscal stimulus package could be reached before the presidential election. Major equity averages were lower, partly due to a decline in J&J shares after the company paused its study due to an unexplained illness in a participant, dampening optimism about a vaccine. Eli Lilly also said its clinical trial for a COVID-19 antibody treatment was paused. U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% in September, matching expectations, for a fourth straight monthly climb, though the pace has slowed amid considerable slack in the economy as it slowly recovers from a nadir caused by coronavirus shutdowns. The dollar index rose 0.528% against a basket of other currencies, putting it on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in three weeks. The U.S. currency’s safe-haven appeal has been curbed by growing expectations that a win by former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Nov. 3 would bring large stimulus for the pandemic-hit economy, bolstering the stock market and investor risk appetite. “It’s becoming increasingly evident to people that there is no stimulus coming before the election,” said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. “I wouldn’t say markets were fully pricing stimulus or fully pricing a vaccine by the end of the year but they were probably tilted towards the more positive side of those expectations.” The greenback has held within a range of about 2% over the past three weeks as talks on a fiscal deal have progressed in fits and starts. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican-led U.S. Senate would vote on a scaled-down coronavirus economic relief bill of the type Democrats have rejected as they hold out for trillions in aid.

The S&P 500 fell 23.5 points, or 0.65%, to 3,511.20, but still within sight its record high of 3,580.84 struck on Sept. 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 139.8 points, or 0.48%, to 28,699.30. The Nasdaq Composite erased earlier gains to slip 36.3 points, or 0.3%, to 11,842.03 points. Shares in Johnson & Johnson sagged 2.6% as investors digested news that a participant in its COVID-19 vaccine trial had fallen ill and that it would take the company at least a few days to evaluate the situation. Investors see the quick introduction of a vaccine as key to helping economies recover. J&J’s news comes after its rival AstraZeneca, which uses a similar technology, paused the trial of its experimental vaccine in September due to a participant’s unexplained illness. “Markets have already priced in perfection,” said Ken Polcari, chief market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Florida. “It’s ‘buy the rumor, sell the news.’” European shares also struggled as investors found a reason in news of Johnson & Johnson’s delayed trial to take profits. The Euro STOXX 600 lost 0.77%, ending three straight days of gains, with markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris mirroring its moves. The sentiment in European and U.S. equities defied earlier resilience in Asia, where Chinese shares got a lift from data that showed exports rising 9.9% in September and imports swinging to a 13.2% gain, versus a 2.1% drop in August. The data suggested Chinese exporters were recovering from the pandemic’s damage to overseas orders and helped Chinese blue-chip shares rise 0.33%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, however, trimmed earlier gains and was little changed by the end of Tuesday. The overall subdued mood in stock markets contrasted with the dollar, which is on track for its best daily performance in three weeks, as the dollar index climbed 0.54% against a basket of other currencies to 93.546. The Australian dollar, on the other hand, was slugged by news that Beijing has stopped taking shipments of Australian coal. The Aussie dropped as much as 0.76% to $0.7152 . Government bond yields mostly fell as demand for safe-haven bonds firmed. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield retreated to 0.7289%, a low not seen since Aug. 4. Government bond yields in the euro zone also held near recent troughs, with hefty supply failing to dent a market bolstered by expectations for further central bank easing. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield touched -0.538%, its lowest in just over a week. Italian and Greek benchmark 10-year debt both hit record lows. A stronger dollar capped gold prices, which dropped 1.5% to $1,893.01 per ounce. Benefiting from China’s promising trade data, Brent crude futures were up 73 cents, or 1.75%, to $42.45 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 81 cents, or 2.05%, to $40.24 a barrel."
7.163078136672402," J&J to contribute up to $5 billion to potential U.S. opioid settlement (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Tuesday it will contribute up to $1 billion more to a potential settlement of lawsuits alleging it and other companies fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic, bringing its total payment to $5 billion. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based drugmaker had agreed last October to a $4 billion settlement framework negotiated with a group of state attorneys general. That proposal also called for the drug distributors McKesson Corp MCK.N, Cardinal Health CAH.N and AmerisourceBergen ABC.N to pay a combined $18 billion, but the framework met resistance from some states and local governments. Negotiations have been ongoing since then, and the dollar amounts have been shifting. J&J in a statement said the additional $1 billion reflected continued negotiations and said additional terms are being finalized. Paul Hanly, a lead attorney for local governments pursuing federal lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors, said in a statement the plaintiffs’ lawyers were “very pleased” with J&J’s agreement to resolve the cases. “We are hopeful other companies defending the numerous litigations will see the wisdom of this step forward,” he said. Representatives for the distributors and several state attorneys general did not respond to requests for comment. More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed nationally largely by states, counties and municipalities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the U.S. opioid addiction epidemic. The lawsuits generally accuse drugmakers including J&J of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. The companies including J&J deny wrongdoing. J&J is separately appealing a $465 million judgment the state of Oklahoma won against it in the first case to go to trial in the litigation."
7.163078136672402," J&J says review of illness that led to pause of coronavirus vaccine trial could take days (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday it would take a few days at least to hear from a safety monitoring panel about its review of the company’s late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial after announcing that the large study had been paused due to an unexplained illness in one participant. The pause comes around a month after AstraZeneca Plc also suspended trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine - which uses a similar technology - due to a participant falling ill. That trial remains on pause. U.S.-based J&J, whose vaccine effort is among the high profile attempts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, said on Monday the illness was being reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board as well as its own clinical and safety team. The data board is then required to submit its findings to the U.S. Food and Drug administration before the study can be restarted. Mathai Mammen, head of research & development at J&J’s drugs business, said the company informed the safety board about the ill trial participant on Sunday. The board has asked for more information, he said, adding that the company is collecting information to answer its questions. “It will be a few days at minimum for the right set of information to be gathered and evaluated,” Mammen said during a conference call to discuss the company’s quarterly results. He said because the study is blinded, the company did not yet know if the ill person had been given the vaccine or a placebo. J&J said such pauses are normal in big trials, which can include tens of thousands of people. The company said the trial is still on track to continue adding patients over the coming months. It noted that the voluntary “study pause” in giving doses of the vaccine candidate to trial participants was different from a “regulatory hold” imposed by health authorities. Former FDA chief said on Twitter the trial said that the oversight of safety boards for the COVID-19 vaccine trials is evidence of the “integrity, rigor, and careful nature” of the vaccine trial process. Experts and officials have voiced concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could put pressure on vaccine makers to rush an unsafe or ineffective vaccine to market. AstraZeneca last month paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed with the University of Oxford due to a serious unexplained illness in a British study participant. While AstraZeneca’s trials in Britain, Brazil, South Africa and India have since resumed, its U.S. trial is still on hold, pending a regulatory review. The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines both use modified, harmless versions of adenoviruses to deliver genetic instructions to human cells in order to spur an immune response to the target virus, in this case the novel coronavirus. They are both also part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program to support vaccine development. “This could be a second case of adenoviral vaccine to spur safety concerns,” said Bryan Garnier analyst Olga Smolentseva. AstraZeneca and medical experts say trial suspensions to look into the cause of a participant’s illness are not uncommon. J&J on Sept. 22 became the fourth Warp Speed participant to enter the final stage of human vaccine testing, with the aim of enrolling 60,000 volunteers in the United States and abroad.”Everybody is on the alert because of what happened with AstraZeneca,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said by email, adding it could take a week to gather information. “This is likely to be a neurological event,” he said. Last month, J&J said its vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial. This prompted the company to start the large scale trial, with results expected by the end of this year or early 2021. Stat News reported the pause earlier, citing a document sent to outside researchers, which stated that a “pausing rule” had been met, the online system used to enroll patients in the study had been closed and the data and safety monitoring board would be convened."
7.163078136672402," J&J says review of illness that led to coronavirus vaccine trial pause could take days (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Tuesday it would take at least a few days for an independent safety panel to evaluate an unexplained illness of a study participant that led to a pause in the company's COVID-19 vaccine trial. J&J shares fell more than 2% following news of the pause and safety review. Rival AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L U.S. trial for its coronavirus vaccine candidate - which uses a similar technology - has remained on hold for more than a month after a participant in the company's UK trial fell ill. J&J, whose vaccine effort is among the high profile attempts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, said on Monday the illness was being reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board as well as by its own clinical and safety team. The data board, which is also reviewing AstraZeneca’s U.S. trial, is required to submit its findings to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before the study can be restarted.

He said because the study is blinded, the company did not yet know if the ill person had been given the vaccine or a placebo. Mammen added that J&J remains on track to complete recruitment for its 60,000-person trial in the next two to three months. EVIDENCE OF ‘INTEGRITY’ The company said such pauses are not unusual in large trials. It noted that the voluntary “study pause” in giving doses of the vaccine candidate to trial participants was different from a “regulatory hold” imposed by health authorities. J&J has said it expects to have enough data to apply for U.S. regulatory clearance by the end of the year. Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O have said they expect to be able to apply for FDA clearance for their vaccine candidates even sooner. Former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter that the oversight of safety boards for COVID-19 vaccine trials is evidence of the “integrity, rigor, and careful nature” of the vaccine trial process. Health experts have voiced concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could put pressure on the FDA and drugmakers to rush an unsafe vaccine to market to bolster his re-election prospect. He has repeatedly said a vaccine could be available prior to the Nov. 3 election. AstraZeneca last month paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed with the University of Oxford due to a serious unexplained illness in a British study participant. While AstraZeneca’s trials in Britain, Brazil, South Africa and India have since resumed, its U.S. trial remains on hold.

J&J on Sept. 22 became the fourth Warp Speed participant to enter the final stage of human vaccine testing. “This could be a second case of adenoviral vaccine to spur safety concerns,” said Bryan Garnier analyst Olga Smolentseva. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines employ an entirely different technology. AstraZeneca and medical experts say trial suspensions to look into the cause of a participant’s illness are not uncommon. “Everybody is on the alert because of what happened with AstraZeneca,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said by email, adding it could take a week to gather information. “This is likely to be a neurological event,” he said.

7.163078136672402," J&J raises profit forecast as trial halt weighs (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N raised its annual profit forecast for the second time this year in quarterly results on Tuesday, a day after it was the second major drug company to call a temporary halt to trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine. With shares in the company falling on investor worries about the fate of the vaccine, finance chief Joseph Wolk said it was unclear how long the suspension in the trials, due to an unexplained illness of one participant, would last. “It could be as small as a few days but it’s hard to predict until they get the information they need,” he told CNBC. The company will let an independent data and safety board go through its protocols as it reviewed the illness, he said. Johnson & Johnson is the first major U.S. drugmaker and medical device manufacturer to report third-quarter results and its earnings could set the tone for upcoming rival’s earnings. In the third quarter, sales rose to $21.08 billion from $20.73 billion, helped by strength in the company’s largest unit, pharmaceuticals. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex rose 43.7% to $1.10 billion. Sales of Imbruvica, which J&J jointly owns with AbbVie Inc ABBV.N, as well as Crohn's disease drug Stelara, grew in the double-digits, bringing in $1.03 billion and $1.95 billion respectively. Its medical device unit’s sales fell 3.6% to $6.15 billion, as patients and hospitals continued to delay non-urgent surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company now expects full-year 2020 adjusted profit of $7.95 to $8.05 per share, from its prior range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.20 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.98 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. J&J’s shares fell 1.7% to $149.25 before the bell."

To secure the vaccines, the EU made an undisclosed downpayment to J&J, which confirmed the deal in a statement in which it reiterated plans to allocate up to 500 million additional doses to poorer countries from mid-2021. EU states would pay the full price only when they order it. The price and liability conditions are confidential. The J&J deal follows supply contracts for 400 million doses of the potential vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and for 300 million doses of the shot being trailed by a partnership between Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.

5.402633468521269," Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine produces strong immune response in early trial (Reuters) - A single dose of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response against the novel coronavirus in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial, according to interim results published on Friday. The vaccine, called Ad26.COV2.S, was equally well-tolerated at two different doses, the results showed. A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc MRNA.O and Pfizer Inc PFE.N, could simplify distribution of the vaccine. However, it is unclear whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk from the virus, will be protected to the same degree as younger people with the J&J vaccine. The trial in close to 1,000 healthy adults, which is backed by the U.S. government, began after the J&J vaccine was found in July to offer strong protection in a single dose to monkeys. Based on the current results, J&J on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial, which could pave the way for an application for regulatory approval. The company said it expects results of that so-called Phase 3 trial by the end of the year or early next year. The results, released on the medical website medRxiv, have not been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2G3Ni1X) Researchers, including those from J&J’s unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said 98% of participants with data available for the interim analysis had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination. However, immune response results were available from only a small number of people - 15 participants - over 65 years old, limiting the interpretation. In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong. The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed. For now, the results justify why more studies are needed in larger numbers to look for serious adverse effects, Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the J&J trial, told Reuters. “Overall, the vaccine is doing what you would expect it to do if you were to move it to Phase 3 trials,” Bloom said."

5.923420588562877," J&J kicks off study of single-shot COVID-19 vaccine in 60,000 volunteers CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N on Wednesday began a 60,000-person trial of an experimental single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that, if proven effective, could simplify distribution of millions of doses compared with leading rivals requiring two doses. The company expects results of the Phase III trial by year end or early next year, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said in a joint news conference with officials from the National Institutes of Health and the Trump administration. J&J plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Stoffels said. Rival vaccines from Moderna Inc MRNA.O, Pfizer Inc PFE.N and AstraZeneca AZN.L all require two shots separated by several weeks, which make them more difficult to administer and means twice as much vaccine is needed to inoculate the same number of people. “The benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,” Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, said in a telephone interview. The J&J vaccine also does not need to be stored at extremely cold temperatures, Barouch noted, another advantage over some rival vaccine candidates. J&J shares were up 1.2%. “Big news. Numerous great companies are seeing fantastic results. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) must move quickly,” U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet. J&J published a detailed study protocol for its Phase III trial on Wednesday on the company’s website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these details available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials. PROTECTION ‘FOR A LONG TIME’ Stoffels said J&J started the late-stage study after seeing positive results in its combined Phase I/II trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently. Stoffels said the safety and level of protection demonstrated in the earlier trial were on par with what was seen in the company’s animal studies. The results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection “for a long time,” he said. J&J’s late-stage trial will be conducted at as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The trial will assess whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose. It will also seek to detect if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus. Stoffels said it likely will take six weeks to two months to fully enroll the trial. J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it will be ready to start distribution soon after an FDA green light. The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness at pre-set intervals. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three vaccines being supported by the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed - J&J’s, Moderna’s and AstraZeneca’s - share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said. J&J’s trial would be considered a success if it proves to be 60% effective, with a study protocol that could have an efficacy answer after 154 people became infected with the virus. Stoffels said the company will start counting COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated. The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine’s efficacy after 20 trial participants have become infected. Collins said the DSMB does not include any government employees and is made up of “very highly experienced” scientists and statistical experts. “Until they are convinced that there’s something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,” Collins said. His comments follow concerns that government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election bid. In August, J&J signed an agreement with the British government on a global Phase III clinical trial to study a two-dose version of its vaccine, which will run in parallel with the single-dose trial. Stoffels, in the briefing, said the single-dose version would be “very important for emergency use.” The company will later test a booster dose that could produce even greater immunity to the virus, he added."

Stoffels said J&J would publish a detailed study protocol for its phase 3 trial Wednesday on the company’s website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these study plans available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials. Stoffels said J&J started the phase 3 trial after seeing positive results in its phase 1/2 trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently. Stoffels said the safety and level of protection in the study were on par with what was seen in the company’s animal studies, and said the results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection “for a long time.” J&J’s late-stage trial will use as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The company plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Stoffels said. The goal of the trial is to test whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose, but it will also look to see if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus. Stoffels predicts it will take six weeks to two months to enroll the trial, and said the company hopes to get an answer on whether the vaccine works “around the end of the year or early next year.” It is not clear how fast the company could get regulatory approval, but J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it could start distribution quickly. The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness. In the press conference, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three of the vaccines being organized and supported by the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed - J&J’s, Moderna’s and AstraZeneca’s - share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said. J&J’s trial is designed to test for a vaccine that is 60%effective. In the study protocol, that could be determined after 154 people became infected with the virus. Stoffels said the company will start counting cases of COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated. The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine’s efficacy after 20 people have become infected. Collins said the DSMB does not include any federal employees and is made up of “very highly experienced” scientists and statistical experts. “Until they are convinced that there’s something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,” Collins said. His comments follow concerns government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election bid.

5.923420588562877," Genmab shares drop on legal battle with J&J over cancer drug COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shares in Danish biotech firm Genmab GMAB.CO fell as much as 14% on Wednesday after it said it was locked in a legal battle with its partner Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N over royalty payments for its key cancer drug. Genmab, which specialises in the development of antibody therapeutics for cancer treatment, currently receives royalties from Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, for sales of its blockbuster Darzalex drug for treatment of multiple myeloma. The Danish firm said late on Tuesday that a New York arbitration court will determine whether it is entitled to part of Janssen's royalty payments to Halozyme HALO.O which supplies the enzyme technology for Darzalex injections. Janssen started reducing royalty payments to Genmab in the second quarter, the Danish firm said. The arbitration will also decide the duration of Darzalex royalty payments to Genmab, whether they should expire around 2030, when most of the Genmab patents expire, or in 2035 when Janssen’s patents for Darzalex injections expire. Most analysts assume Genmab will receive royalty payments until 2035. If the arbitration court rules against Genmab on the duration of Darzalex royalties, it would reduce the biotech firm’s market value by a quarter, according to analysts at Jefferies. “While Genmab intends to vigorously protect its rights under the agreement, the outcome of any arbitration proceeding, as well as its duration, is inherently uncertain,” Genmab said. The legal battle creates both an overhang and uncertainty for Genmab shares, which will quickly be priced in, Citi analysts said in a note. Genmab was the worst performer on the European STOXX 600 index, trading 10.8% lower at 2154 Danish crowns each by 0833 GMT."

5.108017097739806," Johnson & Johnson charged by New York with civil insurance fraud over opioid claims NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state filed civil charges on Thursday accusing Johnson & Johnson of insurance fraud for downplaying the risks of opioid painkillers, including to doctors and elderly patients. J&J and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals affiliate were accused of targeting elderly patients for opioid treatment despite the risks of side effects such as falls, fractures and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The company was also accused of employing marketing materials, “seemingly independent” advocacy groups and “key opinion leaders” to dismiss opioid addiction as a myth. “Misrepresentation of opioids to consumers for profit is inexcusable,” Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. In a statement, J&J called its marketing and promotion of opioids “appropriate and responsible. Janssen provided these medicines for doctors treating patients suffering from pain and worked with regulators to provide appropriate information about their risks and benefits.” The charges by New York’s Department of Financial Services are the fourth in its opioid industry probe, following charges against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Allergan Plc, Endo International Plc and Mallinckrodt Plc. J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has proposed paying $4 billion to settle opioid claims by U.S. states, cities and counties. It is separately appealing a $465 million judgment in Oklahoma from last November over its opioid marketing there. New York said J&J manufactured opioid products in the state including Nucynta and the fentanyl patch Duragesic, and received multiple U.S. Food and Drug Administration letters challenging its Duragesic marketing claims. The state also said J&J’s “Norman Poppy,” developed in 1994, once accounted for as much as 80% of the global supply for oxycodone raw materials. Oxycodone is the main ingredient in OxyContin, made by the now-bankrupt Purdue Pharma LP. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997. J&J was charged with violating two New York insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation."

1.8310808731083195," Some volunteers quit J&J COVID-19 trial in Spain after AstraZeneca scare: investigator MADRID (Reuters) - Some volunteers have quit Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine trial in Spain after news of side effects in a participant in AstraZeneca’s trial, the Spanish programme’s lead investigator told Reuters on Tuesday. The investigator, Alberto Borobia, said there were enough reserve volunteers for the trial to continue as normal, however. “Many have called to ask us some more detail about the risk of the vaccine, whether what happened with that vaccine had anything to do with the one we are studying, these types of questions,” Borobia said. He did not say how many people had dropped out. AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine trials were placed on hold worldwide on Sept. 6 after a serious side effect was reported in one volunteer in Britain. Trials resumed in Britain and Brazil on Monday following the green light from British regulators but remain on hold in the United States. Johnson & Johnson’s Belgian Janssen unit began Phase II trials of its COVID-19 vaccine on 190 people in Spain on Monday with those tests due to conclude on Sept. 22. Trials are also being carried out in the Netherlands and Germany, taking the total number of participants in all three countries to 550. Johnson & Johnson was one of nine companies to commit last week to uphold scientific standards in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine amid rising concerns that safety and efficacy standards might slip in the rush to halt the pandemic. Phase II trials are designed to test which dose and schedule of a vaccine generates the most antibodies while Phase III tests the vaccine’s efficacy. Borobia said Phase II was scheduled to run for 14 to 16 months. If some doses and schedules generate considerable amounts of antibodies, an intermediate Phase III analysis could be conducted before the end of Phase II, Borobia said. He said volunteers in the third phase would be far more diverse than for Phase II, which only involves people in good health, divided into those aged 18 to 55 and those 65 and above. “In the third phase, we will include all types of people. It is necessary to include a certain number of hypertense patients, white patients, Asian patients ... The population in Phase III is totally heterogeneous,” he said. The firm aims to test 60,000 people globally in Phase III with a third of the volunteers in hard-hit Latin America, according to Josue Bacaltchuk, vice-president of medical affairs for the Jannsen unit in the region.. The first vaccines are due to be available in early 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech SE proposed on Saturday to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand their Phase III vaccine trial to 44,000 participants from 33,000 to enrol a more diverse set of volunteers."

Still, the trial had sufficient reserve volunteers to carry on as normal, lead investigator Alberto Borobia said. “Many have called to ask us some more detail about the risk of the vaccine, whether what happened with that vaccine had anything to do with the one we are studying, these types of questions,” Borobia said in the interview. He did not say how many people had dropped out. This highlights the challenge for drugmakers in trialling potential vaccines to control the pandemic in enormous public scrutiny. Drugmakers often pause trials while testing drugs but they do not typically disclose that. AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine trial was placed on hold globally on Sept.6 after a serious side effect was reported in a trial participant in the UK. Trials restarted in Britain and Brazil on Monday with the go-ahead from British regulators, but remain on hold in the United States.

1.8333628355231544," Exclusive: J&J seeking one-third of COVID-19 vaccine trial volunteers in hard-hit Latin America SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N will seek 20,000 volunteers for late-stage human trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine in hard-hit Latin America, one-third of the planned global total, one of its public health chiefs in the region said. Josue Bacaltchuk, vice president of medical affairs for Latin America for Janssen, J&J’s Belgian unit developing the vaccine prototype, said countries hosting the trials would also likely get preferential access to vaccines once ready. “We expect the majority in Brazil because it’s the biggest country and also the one most affected by the pandemic so we expect a lot of people volunteering, but we expect also high numbers in Colombia and in Argentina,” Bacaltchuk said. “It’s the intention of the company to prioritize the countries that contribute to the development of the vaccine and that will have patients participating in the trials, yes,” he added in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. J&J’s vaccine is one of over a hundred worldwide being developed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected nearly 26.5 million people and led to some 869,323 deaths. Latin America has become the epicenter of the pandemic. The drugmaker is carrying out tests in the United States and Belgium, and has added Chile, Argentina and Peru to a list of Latin American countries where it plans to conduct Phase III trials along with Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Its trials globally will include 60,000 volunteers. The Latin American countries all have high infection numbers, making them attractive testing sites for vaccine developers since it is easier to obtain dependable trial results in areas with high rates of active transmission and infection. Bacaltchuk said the decision to spread trials so widely was motivated in part by the challenge of securing sufficient volunteer numbers in a region crowded with other pharmaceutical companies conducting trials of their own prototypes. “I think this is a potential risk and that’s why we are going to a number of centers that is higher than the other companies to cover geographies that are not covered by the other studies,” he said. He said the response from volunteers in the region has been “quite positive” which he hoped would continue. “This is impacting everybody and it’s going to continue to impact even after this is over, the consequences will continue so we need to try and stop it as early as possible,” he said."
0.3245445505519983," J&J's coronavirus vaccine candidate prevents severe disease in hamsters (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Thursday its experimental coronavirus vaccine prevented hamsters from getting severely ill, as the drugmaker seeks to begin large, late-stage studies in humans later this month. In the pre-clinical study, vaccinated animals lost less weight and had less virus in their lungs and other organs than unvaccinated animals. (bit.ly/3gVS8ey) The company began early-stage human trials in the United States and Belgium in July, after details of a study in monkeys showed its best-performing vaccine candidate offered strong protection in a single dose. Depending on data from the early-stage trial, J&J plans to begin phase 3 testing in the second half of September. In the pre-clinical study reported on Thursday, Syrian golden hamsters, which are more susceptible to diseases than monkeys, were first vaccinated and then exposed to the novel coronavirus after four weeks. The researchers found low levels of antibodies that can neutralize the virus were tied to high levels of weight loss and viral replication in the lungs."
-5.035301786253756," Canada wants to be at 'front of line' for coronavirus vaccines, signs deals with Novavax and Johnson & Johnson OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada reached an agreement in principle on Monday with both Novavax Inc NVAX.O and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N for millions of doses of their experimental coronavirus vaccines, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. Canada's two agreements follow separate deals with Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O announced weeks ago, and are the latest example of countries rushing to secure access to vaccines. Canada is also in ""the final stages of negotiations"" to secure AstraZeneca's AZN.L potential vaccine and is in talks to secure more doses of the Pfizer vaccine candidate, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said. “What we are trying to do is make sure that when a vaccine is developed, we are at the front of the line,” Anand told reporters. Canada has a population of about 38 million, and the four vaccine agreements signed so far “give Canada at least 88 million doses with options to obtain tens of millions more,” Trudeau said when he announced the deals in Montreal. All four agreements announced so far have options to purchase further doses if needed, officials said. Trudeau also said the government will invest C$126 million ($96.7 million) over two years to build a biomanufacturing facility at the Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre in Montreal capable of producing up to 2 million doses of a vaccine per month by next year. Last week, Canada's National Research Council said it had ended its partnership on a coronavirus vaccine with China's CanSino Biologics 6185.HK because the company lacked the authority to ship the vaccine. Separately, Canada extended to the end of October a program to provide loans of up to C$40,000, a quarter of which is forgivable, to small businesses struggling amid the pandemic. It had been due to expire on Monday. Novavax said it expects to finalize an advance purchase agreement to supply doses of the vaccine, beginning as early as the second quarter of next year. Novavax has agreed to supply up to 76 million doses of its experimental vaccine, while Johnson & Johnson will supply up to 38 million doses of its vaccine candidate. Both agreements are subject to the vaccines obtaining licenses from Health Canada. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Shares of Novavax were up 1.7% at $109.59 and Johnson & Johnson shares were little changed at $153.72 on Monday afternoon."

The Phase II trial will last two months and include 550 participants across the three countries, including 190 people in Spain, Salvador Illa told a news conference in Madrid. “It’s a vote of confidence in our health system,” Illa said, adding it was the first human trial for a coronavirus vaccine to be approved in Spain. The study will focus on healthy people between the ages of 18 and 55 as well as people over 65. Johnson & Johnson said the study will evaluate the safety and the ability to induce an immune response from single dose and two-dose regimens of the vaccine candidate, the company said in a statement. Spain, which has western Europe's highest tally of coronavirus cases, is also working with AstraZeneca AZN.L via the European Union's vaccine procurement programme to secure sufficient doses. J&J’s website says if the latest trials are successful, it will begin final Phase III studies, in which even more volunteers will receive the experimental vaccine.

The acquisition, latest in a recent spate of healthcare deals, comes just days after France’s Sanofi struck a $3.7 billion deal to buy Principia Biopharma Inc for its pipeline of autoimmune disease treatments. Treatments targeting autoimmune conditions have fetched billions of dollars in sales, including AbbVie Inc’s Humira, which is the world’s best selling drug. J&J’s Janssen unit will gain access to Momenta’s experimental therapy, nipocalimab, which is in late-stage testing for warm antibody hemolytic anemia, a condition that causes destruction of healthy red blood cells, and mid-stage testing for myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease. Nipocalimab is expected to eventually win approval to treat several conditions, “many as first-in-class indications with potential for significant peak year sales, some of which could exceed $1 billion,” J&J said in a statement. “We find the deal modestly surprising as we see every one of Momenta’s assets as somewhat tricky to develop,” said BTIG analyst Thomas Shrader. Shares of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Momenta were up 69.2% at $52.15, just a hair’s breadth away from the offer price of $52.50. With the recent flurry of activity, the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors have seen 829 deals so far this year, compared with 839 by this time in 2019, according to data from Refinitiv.

1.7928193046962555," Britain lines up more potential COVID-19 vaccine supplies with J&J, Novavax deals LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will buy potential COVID-19 vaccines from U.S. drugmakers Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Novavax Inc NVAX.O, the companies said on Friday, boosting the number of deals it has with drugmakers as the global vaccine race rages on. Britain and the United States are in the lead with six vaccine deals with drugmakers each, as companies and governments worldwide work overtime to find a vaccine against the pandemic disease. The latest agreements bring Britain’s total number of doses secured to 340 million, with options for millions more, for a population of 66 million. Britain said both vaccines could be available by the middle of next year for priority groups, such as such as frontline health and social care workers, ethnic minorities, adults with serious diseases, and the elderly. The deals cover a wide range of vaccine types currently in development for COVID-19, as Britain seeks to hedge its bets should one or more of the technologies prove ineffective. “For now that is probably the bedrock of the portfolio. We basically need to see now, what we want to add, if anything, immediately that could diversify the sorts of vaccine that we’ve got in the hopper now,” Kate Bingham, chair of UK Vaccine Taskforce, told Reuters. “I think we’re well placed... but I think we need to see the data of some of these early vaccines first before we know what is likely to be protective and what is not.” Johnson & Johnson said its Janssen Pharmaceutica unit will supply Britain with its candidate, known as Ad26.COV2.S, with an initial sale of 30 million doses on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The advance purchase agreement will also provide an option for an additional purchase of up to a 22 million doses, it said. Separately, Novavax said Britain would buy 60 million doses of its vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373. Novavax will manufacture some of the vaccine using Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies facilities in Stockton-on-Tees, northern England. Alex Harris, head of global policy at the Wellcome Trust health charity, said the deals put the Britain in a strong position, and urged the government to explain how it will now ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for poorer countries too. “Without this...the risk increases that other rich countries will seek to strike similar bilateral deals, potentially ... leaving insufficient volumes of vaccine for the rest of the world,” Harris said in a statement. The Janssen vaccine uses an adenovirus technique to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, while the Novavax shot uses a technology known as recombinant nanoparticle to produce antigens - molecules that are designed to spur the immune system into action. Recent studies show the odds of an experimental vaccine making it from early testing in people to regulatory approval are roughly one in three. J&J said it has also agreed to collaborate with the British government on a global Phase III trial to explore the two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine, which will run parallel to a Phase III single-dose trials. Britain will also work with Novavax on a late stage British-based trial. No COVID-19 vaccine candidate has yet been proven effective against the disease, but around 20 are in clinical trials."

The EU executive arm said this paved the way for contractual talks and the possible purchase of the vaccine on behalf of all 27 EU states once it has proven safe and effective. The commission also said it could purchase an additional 200 million vaccine doses. Johnson & Johnson, through its Belgian subsidiary Janssen, “will now enter into contract negotiations with the European Commission,” J&J said in a statement, confirming the volumes indicated by the Commission. “If regulatory approval for the company’s vaccine is received, the Commission would be expected to facilitate a process for allocation of the vaccine doses among the member states,” Johnson & Johnson said. J&J could produce up to 1 billion doses of its vaccine by the end of 2021, a company executive told Reuters on Tuesday. Its vaccine is likely to be administered in a single shot, the executive said. Reuters exclusively reported in June that the U.S. company was in advanced talks with the EU for the supply of its COVID-19 vaccine under development. “Our citizens’ lives and our economy need a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Today’s talks bring us closer to achieving this,” the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. The move follows similar announcements in July about the conclusion of preliminary talks between the EU and Sanofi SA for the purchase of 300 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine that it is developing together with GlaxoSmithKline Plc. The EU is using about 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) from an emergency fund to strike advance purchase deals with several vaccine makers in a bid to have enough shots for its population of 450 million. It is also in talks with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and CureVac to buy upfront their potential COVID-19 vaccines, EU officials told Reuters in July. ($1 = 0.8462 euros)"

1.2340803448824134," J&J eyes one billion doses of potential COVID-19 shot in 2021, weighs challenge trials BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N could produce 1 billion doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine next year if it proves successful and would consider injecting healthy volunteers with the novel coronavirus if there are not enough patients for final trials, a company executive said. J&J kicked off in July early-stage human safety trials for its potential COVID-19 vaccine after releasing details of a study in monkeys that showed its best-performing candidate offered strong protection in a single dose. It is developing the vaccine in collaboration with its Belgian subsidiary, Janssen. Large-scale trials are set to start by the beginning of October and J&J aims to have results on the vaccine’s efficacy between the end of this year and mid-2021, Johan Van Hoof, head of vaccines at Janssen, told Reuters on Tuesday in a telephone interview. Earlier on Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, and before large-scale trials had been conducted. Van Hoof said that production of the vaccine had already begun despite the financial risks involved, to make sure it would be available as soon as possible should it prove effective against the new coronavirus. Several million doses will be ready by the beginning of 2021, with a total capacity of 1 billion shots by the end of the year, he said. He added that the company was likely to favour a single-jab approach, although a final decision on whether a booster would be needed had not yet been made. Outcomes of large-scale, or Phase III, trials will depend on the incidence of infections, Van Hoof said, with faster results expected with higher virus transmission. That is why J&J is likely to conduct those trials in the United States and Latin America, the world’s regions currently with the highest number of cases. If infections drop significantly, J&J is also considering so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are infected with the virus so that a vaccine candidate can be tested on them. “We are looking into that possibility,” Van Hoof said, noting though that such trials posed ethical issues that needed to be resolved before they could be conducted. For instance, an effective therapy against the disease should be available to minimise risks for volunteers exposed to the virus. In May British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L, which is developing a leading coronavirus vaccine with Oxford University, said it was too early to deliberately expose trial participants to the pathogen, but that may become an option if ongoing tests hit a snag. Van Hoof said that preparations to stock the virus for possible challenge trials were already underway and J&J was part of ongoing discussions with universities and other bodies involved in these projects. “We find it a very interesting idea,” he said, adding however, that setting up facilities for such trials would perhaps take longer than testing vaccines on people who are already infected in the community - as long as transmission remained relatively high."
-3.6360949344492544," U.S. to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine candidate (Reuters) - The United States government will pay Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N over $1 billion for 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine, as it stocks up on vaccine and drugs in an attempt to tame the pandemic. The latest contract is priced at roughly $10 per vaccine dose produced by J&J, or around $14.50 per dose, including a previous $456 million the U.S. government promised to J&J for vaccine development in March. That compares with the $19.50 per dose that the U.S. is paying for the vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and German biotech BioNTech SE 22UAy.F. J&J is studying both one and two-dose regimens of its vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate would require two doses per person treated. The drugmaker said on Wednesday it would deliver the vaccine to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) on a not-for-profit basis to be used after approval or emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The U.S. government may also purchase an additional 200 million doses under a subsequent agreement. J&J did not disclose that deal’s value. As the race for vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 intensifies, the U.S. government has been signing deals to buy them through its Operation Warp Speed program. Other drugmakers who have signed deals include Sanofi SA SASY.PA and Regeneron Inc. REGN.N This is J&J’s first deal to supply its investigational vaccine to a country. Talks are underway with the European Union, but no deal has yet been reached. J&J’s investigational vaccine is currently being tested on healthy volunteers in the United States and Belgium in an early-stage study. There are currently no approved vaccines for COVID-19. More than 20 are in clinical trials. Shares of J&J were up around 1 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (This story corrects size of previous deal with BARDA in paragraph two)"
-5.308343190341031," Johnson & Johnson starts human study of COVID-19 vaccine after promising monkey data (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday kicked off U.S. human safety trials for its COVID-19 vaccine after releasing details of a study in monkeys that showed its best-performing vaccine candidate offered strong protection in a single dose. When exposed to the virus, six out of six animals who got the vaccine candidate were completely protected from lung disease and five out of six were protected from infection as measured by the presence of virus in nasal swabs, according to the study published in the journal Nature. “This gives us confidence that we can test a single-shot vaccine in this epidemic and learn whether it has a protective effect in humans,” Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, told Reuters in a telephone interview. The drugmaker said it had started early-stage human trials in the United States and Belgium and would test its vaccine candidate in more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, as well as adults aged 65 years and older. The U.S. government is backing J&J’s vaccine effort with $456 million in funding as part of a spending spree aimed at speeding production of a vaccine to end the pandemic, which has infected millions and killed more than 660,000 people. Stoffels said prior tests of this type of vaccine in other diseases found that a second shot significantly increases protection. But in a pandemic a single-shot vaccine has a significant advantage, sidestepping a lot of the logistical issues involved in getting people to come back for their second dose. The company plans to take up the question of one or two doses in its phase 1 trial. Depending on those results, J&J plans to start large-scale, phase 3 testing with a single-shot regimen in the second half of September. Around the same time, the company will start a parallel phase 3 study testing a two-shot regimen of the vaccine, Stoffels said. “The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is exciting because it’s a single dose,” White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an interview with Fox News. Having one dose “show protection in monkeys like the other vaccines have shown with two doses does shorten the time period for development because your readout becomes 30 days quicker,” she said. J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26, or Ad26, to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, causing the body to mount an immune defense against the virus. In the monkey study, scientists from J&J and Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studied seven different potential vaccines in 32 animals and compared the results to 20 control animals who got placebo shots. Six weeks later, all of the animals were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All 20 animals that received the placebo developed high levels of virus in their lungs and nasal swabs. In the best-performing candidate, which J&J selected for human testing, none of the animals had virus in their lungs and only one showed low levels of virus in nasal swabs. Lab tests showed they all had developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus after a single shot. “This study shows that even just a single immunization with the Ad26 vaccine leads to neutralizing antibody responses and robust protection of monkeys against COVID-19,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Israel Deaconness who led the research in collaboration with J&J. J&J shares were up nearly 2% at $149.93 before the market open on Thursday."

The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based healthcare conglomerate, which expects to start human trials of its vaccine this month, lags other companies that also are developing coronavirus vaccines, with Moderna Inc MRNA.O expected to begin a late-stage study on July 27. “Our initial data on the phase I will be available second half of September, which will become the basis for a phase III study. And that will start mid-to-end September,” J&J Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said during a post-earnings conference call. Phase I clinical trials test a drug’s safety in people. Phase II trials establish more about how safe a drug is and how well it works. Larger phase III trials are the last stage before seeking regulatory approval if a drug proves safe and effective. Researchers reported on Tuesday that Moderna’s experimental vaccine showed it was safe and provoked immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study. Early-stage human trial data on a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca AZN.L and Oxford University will be published on July 20. J&J on Thursday also reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast, helped by strength in its pharmaceuticals unit. Sales of J&J’s devices used in medical procedures dropped nearly 34% as hospitals delayed non-urgent surgeries such as hip and knee replacement due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the company said that some economies had started to open up earlier than expected, helping sales of $4.39 billion beat analysts’ consensus of $3.43 billion, according to Wells Fargo. Sales in J&J’s large pharmaceuticals unit rose 2.1% to $10.75 billion, helped by demand for Stelara, used to treat Crohn’s disease, and the company’s cancer treatments. J&J raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $7.75 to $7.95 per share, from its prior estimate of $7.50 to $7.90 per share.

The healthcare conglomerate, which is among the companies racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, is planning to begin human studies later this month. Meanwhile, Moderna Inc is gearing up to begin late-stage studies later this month, while AstraZeneca Plc is expected to report results from its experimental coronavirus vaccine soon. Sales of medical devices at J&J tumbled by a third in the second quarter as hospitals and patients delayed non-urgent procedures like hip and knee replacements, but J.P.

However, J&J said it would continue to sell its talc-based products in other markets around the world. “Decades of independent scientific studies by medical experts around the world support the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder,” J&J said in a statement on Wednesday. “We continue to offer this product in many other regions around the world where there is higher consumer demand.” J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters here here in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc. The U.S. drugmaker faces thousands of lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. The company said in May that its decision to discontinue talc-based Baby Powder in North America was not connected to any of those investigations."
2.9748679369338915," Johnson & Johnson cuts price of TB drug bedaquiline in poorer countries (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Monday it was slashing the price of its version of tuberculosis drug bedaquiline to $340 from $400, for a six-month treatment, in low- and middle-income countries, to scale up its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. J&J’s bedaquiline, marketed under the brand name Sirturo, will be available at the reduced price to more than 135 eligible countries, through the United Nations-hosted Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility, created in 2001 to negotiate lower prices for treatments. The move comes at a time when the virus outbreak has been feared to have derailed global efforts to curtail the spread of tuberculosis, a bacterial infection that mainly affects a patient’s lungs. Between 2020 and 2025 an additional 1.4 million TB deaths could be registered as a direct consequence of the pandemic, the World Health Organization said in May. (bit.ly/2ZWjVFh) J&J said it would offer an increasing percentage of free drugs when certain volume thresholds are reached annually, to help support the further scaling up of all-oral treatment combinations, the use of which has been recommended by the WHO in light of the pandemic. In the first year, the initiative could lead to an estimated savings of up to $16 million for national TB programs, the drugmaker and Stop TB Partnership said. (bit.ly/2ZFSCi5) New treatments against tuberculosis have been sparse, with not-for-profit TB Alliance’s pretomanid becoming only the third new medicine for drug-resistant tuberculosis to be approved in about 40 years, after J&J’s bedaquiline and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s delamanid. International aid group Médecins Sans Frontières, which has been demanding that J&J lower its price tag for bedaquiline to no more than $1 per day, said the new price of about $1.50 per day should be cut further and extended to more countries.

Under the deal, starting next year Emergent will provide large-scale manufacturing services to produce the drug substance over five years, with the first two years valued at about $480 million. The news follows a $135 million deal struck by the two companies in April, to use Emergent’s manufacturing facilities to speed up the development and production of its vaccine candidate. J&J has partnered with the U.S. government on a $1 billion investment to produce more than 1 billion doses of its vaccine, which is set to enter human testing in the second half of this month. The manufacturing activities will happen at Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility, the company said. The facility was set up by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and make medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and therapeutics used to fight health emergencies. The facility, designated by the HHS as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, has the capacity to produce tens to hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine yearly, Emergent said. Emergent has also signed similar deals to expand the manufacturing capacity of COVID-19 vaccines under development by AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L, Novavax Inc NVAX.O and Vaxart Inc VXRT.O. The company also received $628 million from the U.S. government, which is looking to secure manufacturing capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine under its “Operation Warp Speed” program."

1.7789115047158601," J&J loses bid to overturn baby powder verdict, but damages cut to $2.12 billion (Reuters) - A Missouri appeals court on Tuesday rejected Johnson & Johnson’s bid to throw out a jury verdict in favor of women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its baby powder and other talc products, but reduced damages by more than half, to $2.12 billion. The Missouri Court of Appeals lowered the original $4.69 billion verdict from July 2018 after dismissing claims by some of the 22 women and their families who had sued. But it said the plaintiffs had proven that J&J and an affiliate concealed for decades that the talc products contained asbestos, “worked tirelessly” to ensure that testing protocols would not detect asbestos in all talc samples and published articles downplaying the safety hazards of talc. “Plaintiffs proved with convincing clarity that defendants engaged in outrageous conduct because of an evil motive or reckless indifference,” the court said. “There was significant reprehensibility in defendants’ conduct.” J&J said it will appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. “We continue to believe this was a fundamentally flawed trial, grounded in a faulty presentation of the facts,” spokeswoman Kim Montagnino said. “We deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important. We remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.” Tuesday’s decision followed J&J’s May 19 announcement that it would stop selling its Baby Powder talc in the United States and Canada. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company faces more than 19,000 lawsuits claiming that its talc products cause cancer because of contamination from asbestos, a known carcinogen. J&J’s payout in Tuesday’s decision includes $500 million of compensatory damages and $1.62 billion of punitive damages, down from a respective $550 million and $4.14 billion in the original verdict from a Missouri circuit court. Mark Lanier, the lead lawyer for plaintiffs, called the decision “a clarion call for J&J to try and find a good way to resolve the cases for the people who have been hurt.” J&J has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder’s safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (here) J&J has been the target of a federal criminal probe on how forthright it has been about the safety of its talc products, as well as an investigation by 41 U.S. states of its baby powder sales. The company has also faced an investigation by a congressional subcommittee on the health risks of asbestos in consumer products containing talc. J&J on Tuesday declined further comment on these matters. Johnson & Johnson’s shares were down 39 cents at $142.83 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

1.2412511066823144," Exclusive: EU in advanced talks with Johnson & Johnson on COVID-19 vaccine deal - sources BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is in advanced talks with pharmaceuticals giant Johnson & Johnson to reserve or make an up-front purchase of its COVID-19 vaccine under development, two officials familiar with the talks told Reuters. The move would be the first arranged by the European Union executive since it was mandated by the 27 EU national governments to use an emergency fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to strike deals with up to six vaccine producers. The Commission’s deal with U.S. company Johnson & Johnson is “in the pipeline”, a top health official from an EU member state said, asking to remain anonymous because the talks were confidential discussions about vaccines between the EU executive and EU governments. A second EU source said the Commission had a call with Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday about the possible agreement. A Commission spokesman had no comment. In response to Reuters’ queries, Johnson & Johnson said it is in talks with multiple governments and global organisations as it seeks to develop a COVID-19 vaccine but declined to comment further. It was unclear whether any deal would involve an advance purchase of the vaccine in testing or an option to buy it. Johnson & Johnson plans to start human clinical trials next month for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 8.36 million people worldwide and led to 447,985 deaths. Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands last week said that they had acquired 400 million potential vaccine doses - in principle available to all member states - from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a COVID-19 shot in conjunction with Oxford University. AstraZeneca signed a similar deal in May with the United States. The health official source said the EU deal with Johnson & Johnson could be announced as early as next week, but cautioned that it might take a little longer to finalise and there is a chance it might not be struck at all. He said the EU is also seeking a deal with French vaccine-maker Sanofi. A spokesman for Sanofi had no immediate comment. EU decision-making procedures pose a potential sticking point, with member states still in talks over the establishment of a steering board for vaccine negotiations with drugmakers, officials told Reuters. But underlining the urgency of securing a vaccine for the EU’s 450 million population, the Commission had already begun talks with Johnson & Johnson even before the steering board has been agreed. The Netherlands has also been involved in these initial talks with Johnson & Johnson, as a representative of the alliance of the four EU countries that struck the AstraZeneca deal, officials told Reuters. This alliance is expected to halt negotiations with drugmakers once the EU has appointed its negotiation team, to avoid competition among EU states, officials said. “Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine is one of the promising initiatives,” a spokesman for the Dutch health ministry said, declining to comment on the ongoing talks. By buying vaccines under development, the EU risks acquiring shots that may eventually prove unsuccessful against COVID-19.

0.0594005744661973," J&J moves up start of coronavirus vaccine human trials to July (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson moved up the start of human clinical trials for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus by two months to the second half of July, as the drugmaker rushes to develop a prevention for COVID-19, the company said on Wednesday. The acceleration should allow J&J to take part in the massive clinical trials program planned by the U.S. government, which aims to have an effective vaccine by year end. J&J shares rose nearly 2% to $148.69. Last March, J&J signed deals with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity to produce more than 1 billion doses of its vaccine through 2021, even before it has evidence that it works. There are currently no U.S. approved treatments or vaccines for the virus. A vaccine is seen as essential to ending the pandemic that has infected more than 7.2 million people and killed over 412,000 globally, while battering economies worldwide. J&J initially expected safety trials to start in September. Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company has been working closely with its U.S. government partners to accelerate that timeline. “Based on the strength of the preclinical data we have seen so far and interactions with the regulatory authorities, we have been able to further accelerate the clinical development,” Stoffels said in a statement on Wednesday. J&J’s study will test the vaccine for safety and early signs of efficacy in 1,045 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, and in those aged 65 and older. The trial will take place in the United States and Belgium. The company is also in talks with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID) to start larger, late-stage trials ahead of schedule, depending on results of the early studies and regulatory approval. The United States is planning to test a handful of coronavirus vaccine candidates in trials that will enroll up to 30,000 subjects with the aim of getting an answer on efficacy as quickly as possible. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told Reuters that companies will need to complete their safety trials by the end of summer to be included in those studies. Stoffels said last week that J&J hopes to have results of its vaccine efficacy trials in the first quarter of 2021. He added that the company is “working hard to bring it back to the end of the year.” A lot will depend on how much virus is circulating at that time, he said. “If you have an incidence of 1% a year versus 4% a year, it’s totally different. And that’s where these trials are so unpredictable,” he said referring to the percentage of new cases occurring in the population at the time. The company plans to test the vaccine in high-transmission regions within the United States. If the incidence is low, “we will complement that with international sites to make sure that we reach enough endpoints quickly to prove the vaccine works,” Stoffels said. Moderna Inc, which is working in close partnership with NIAID, has started testing its vaccine candidate in a 600-subject mid-stage trial. The company expects to begin late-stage trials in July. Moderna’s vaccine uses messenger RNA technology, an approach that has yet to produce any approved vaccines. J&J is utilizing the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which won European regulatory approval late last month. There are about 10 coronavirus vaccines in human testing. Experts have said a safe and effective vaccine could take at least 12 to 18 months from the start of development, which would shave several years off the typical vaccine development timeline.

3.244957325414987," RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Chanel, Revlon, L'Oreal pivoting away from talc in some products (Repeats to fix link to Reuters story on Johnson & Johnson) LONDON/LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Reuters) - Chanel, Revlon and L’Oreal, three of the biggest brands in cosmetics, are quietly moving away from using talc in some products as U.S. cancer lawsuits and consumer concerns mount. Luxury beauty company Chanel has removed talc from a loose face powder and dropped a talc body powder because of negative perceptions around the mineral, court documents reviewed by Reuters show. Revlon Inc removed talc from its body products, and L’Oreal SA is exploring alternatives for the mineral, those companies told Reuters. The moves come amid a reappraisal of talc in body powders and cosmetics by consumers, regulators and manufacturers. Talc - which is sometimes found in the same rock as asbestos, a potent carcinogen - is used in thousands of cosmetic and personal care products to absorb moisture, prevent caking and add softness. Thousands of cancer lawsuits, some dating back to 2013, have been filed against body-powder market leader Johnson & Johnson . Allegations that asbestos contamination caused plaintiffs’ cancers began in 2017. Other makers of talc powders also face suits, including Revlon, Chanel and Avon, securities filings and court records show. Scrutiny of talc products intensified after a 2018 Reuters investigation here reported that J&J knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc and powders. The company has disputed Reuters’ report and maintains its powders are safe and asbestos free. J&J announced last month that it would stop selling talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, attributing the decision to declining sales and negative publicity. In March, a Chanel representative disclosed in a court deposition that in 2017 the company had stopped making a talc-based body powder, scented with its iconic No. 5 fragrance that it had made since 1924. The deposition was taken in a 2018 case filed in a Los Angeles court. In it, a California woman alleges she got mesothelioma, in part from asbestos-tainted Chanel and J&J powders she used for decades. Asbestos is the only well established cause of mesothelioma, an incurable rare cancer of the lining of the lungs and other organs. Chanel representative Amy Wyatt said in the deposition that Chanel was sued for the first time over its talc powder in 2016 and she denied Chanel powders contained asbestos. “We know that it was a safe product,” Wyatt said in the deposition. But “we determined from public perception to remove it from the market.” Wyatt said Chanel had also removed talc from its loose face powder, but she was not sure when the new formulation would be on the market. She did not say what the talc was replaced with. Chanel told Reuters that it routinely updates its products “to ensure we continue to meet our customers’ changing needs and expectations,” a spokeswoman said in an email. Chanel, which continues to use talc in other products including pressed powder, blush and eye shadow, said all the talc it uses is “selected according to strict purity criteria, fully complies with current global regulations, and is safe under standard conditions of cosmetic use.” The privately held company did not respond to questions about the deposition or litigation. A Revlon spokesman told Reuters the company removed talc from its body products. He declined to say when or why; he also declined to comment on litigation. L’Oreal said it is looking for a talc replacement but has not found anything that works as well. “Well known partial alternatives exist, and we continue to explore and seriously consider performant alternatives,” a spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. “But none meet the same performance for our products.” L’Oreal - like other companies - requires its suppliers to certify annually that its talc is asbestos-free, and it does in-house testing, she said. “We have not detected any trace of asbestos in any of our raw materials containing more than 20% talcum powder,” L’Oreal’s spokeswoman said. Other personal care companies have also stopped selling talc powder. Germany’s Beiersdorf said it switched to corn starch in its Nivea baby powder in 2018. Bausch Health changed the formula of its Shower to Shower powder in 2018 “to keep the product in line with market trends and customer preferences,” and not because of safety concerns, a spokeswoman said. Bausch, which last sold talc powder in February 2019, has been named in 165 lawsuits; 12 are pending, securities filings show. Avon, which declined to comment, said in a securities filing that 128 lawsuits were pending against it over talc products. Sanofi, maker of Gold Bond powder, told Reuters it stood by the safety of its talc powder and was “vigorously” contesting talc lawsuits against it. “Sanofi will continue to evaluate its product offerings in light of supply and consumer demand,” a spokesman said. Globally, consumers are expected to purchase 139,350 tonnes of talc this year, down 0.6 percent from last year, according to Euromonitor International. Last year, during an analysis of 52 talc-containing cosmetic products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found asbestos in nine products, including three sold by tween retailer Claire’s and one bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder. All products were voluntarily recalled. A spokeswoman said Claire’s had stopped using talc, and replaced it with mica in most of its products. The FDA is analyzing 50 more samples this year and is considering establishing an asbestos testing standard. Canada’s Health Ministry tentatively concluded in 2018 that talc itself may cause lung problems if inhaled, and ovarian cancer if used in the genital area. A final decision, expected next year, could lead to a ban or restriction on the use of talc in certain products in Canada."
3.9748369900335945," J&J's Ebola vaccine wins EU regulatory panel backing (Reuters) - A panel of the European health regulator on Friday recommended approving Johnson & Johnson’s two-dose experimental vaccine for Ebola in the European Union. J&J submitted its application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in November for the vaccine, which targets an Ebola strain that causes the disease in most people. The company in February said it was developing a coronavirus vaccine program with the help of the same technologies used in the experimental Ebola vaccine. The panel recommendation confirms the potential of the vaccine technology, Johan Van Hoof, managing director of J&J’s Janssen unit said. The drugmaker last month struck a manufacturing deal with Emergent BioSolutions Inc to help produce more than 1 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which J&J plans to start testing on humans by September. The recommendation by EMA’s human medicines committee for J&J’s Ebola vaccine follows the approval in November 2019 of the first Ebola vaccine, from Merck & Co Inc. The European commission (EC) has the last word on approvals, but typically follows EMA’s recommendations. European approval could help accelerate J&J’s attempts to broaden access to the vaccine to high-risk countries and to enable registration in African countries, the company said. More than 3,400 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have been infected with the Ebola virus in the ongoing outbreak, second only to the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300."

5.234120902236785," Pfizer ties up with glass maker Corning for vial supply (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc has signed a long-term agreement with glass maker Corning Inc to procure vials for storing drugs, the companies said on Thursday. Pfizer said the glass vials will be used for some of its existing sterile injectable medicines and that they were also being assessed for storing a range of new products. The company did not provide details of these new products. Pfizer, like rivals Merck & Co and AstraZeneca, is racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, which does not yet have an approved vaccine or treatment. With vaccines being seen by world leaders as a way to restart stalled economies, drugmakers are looking to scale up their production to meet surging global demand. Some companies such as AstraZeneca have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines that are expected to need billions of vials. It would be essential to fill a vial with five to 10 doses of the vaccines to cope with the requirement of huge volumes of vaccines and the relative shortage of vials, Johnson & Johnson’s Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said on Thursday. Johnson & Johnson also has a potential COVID-19 vaccine under development which it plans to test in humans by September."
3.243277169978657," Johnson & Johnson to stop selling talc baby powder in U.S. and Canada (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, it announced on Tuesday, saying demand had fallen in the wake of what it called “misinformation” about the product’s safety amid a barrage of legal challenges. J&J faces more than 19,000 lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. Many are pending before a U.S. district judge in New Jersey. “I wish my mother could be here to see this day,” said Crystal Deckard, whose mother Darlene Coker alleged Baby Powder caused her mesothelioma. She dropped the suit filed in 1999 after losing her fight to compel J&J to divulge internal records. Coker died of the cancer in 2009. In its statement, J&J said it “remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder,” citing “decades of scientific studies.” J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters here in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (here) The Reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from J&J’s market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most well-known products. J&J has also been the target of a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products’ safety, an investigation by 41 states into its baby powder sales, which it disclosed in April, and an investigation into health risks of asbestos in talc-containing consumer products by a Congressional subcommittee. U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, who led the Congressional inquiry, described J&J’s decision to stop selling talc baby powder as “a major victory for public health”. “My Subcommittee’s 14-month investigation revealed that Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that its product contains asbestos,” he said. In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in media reports, in the court room and on Capitol Hill, J&J has repeatedly said its talc products are safe, and do not cause cancer. The company said on Tuesday that its decision to discontinue talc-based Baby Powder in North America was not connected to any of those investigations. Apart from the baby powder controversy the company, one of the most trusted brands in America, more recently has faced a series of legal and reputational challenges. J&J has said it has been named as a defendant, along with other drugmakers, in more than 2,900 lawsuits alleging the companies improperly promoted addictive opioids. In August, an Oklahoma judge rendered the first verdict in that litigation, ordering J&J to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers. J&J is appealing the Oklahoma judge’s ruling and has denied it caused the opioid crisis. The company said on Tuesday said it had stopped shipping talc baby powder when the COVID-19 crisis led to limits on shopping and manufacturing, and that now it would wind down North American sales. “Demand for talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder in North America has been declining due in large part to changes in consumer habits and fueled by misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising,” it said in a statement. Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder now accounts for only about 0.5% of its U.S. consumer health business, the company said. But it remains a symbol of the company’s family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s “#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust” and a 2003 internal memo described it as a “sacred cow,” Reuters reported. Christie Nordhielm, a professor of marketing at Georgetown, said it appears J&J made its decision to withdraw from the market while consumers were preoccupied with the pandemic. “It’s a nice time to quietly do it,” she said, adding “it will minimize the reputational hit.” Shares of J&J were up 0.35% at $149.31 on Wednesday morning after the disclosure. “We will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the Company in the courtroom,” Johnson & Johnson said. “All verdicts against the company that have been through the appeals process have been overturned.” ‘STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION’ Krystal Kim, one of 22 women with ovarian cancer whose case in St. Louis resulted in a 2018 jury verdict of $4.69 billion against J&J, said the decision to discontinue the products was “a step in the right direction.” J&J has appealed that verdict. Nevertheless, J&J’s legal challenges likely will continue, some lawyers said. In April, a New Jersey judge ruled that thousands of plaintiffs who allege J&J’s talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony would be allowed in trials. “Just taking it off the shelf today doesn’t end the litigation by a long shot,” said Loyola Law Professor Adam Zimmerman. Asbestos is known to cause cancer that emerges decades after exposure. Cases involving asbestos-containing products removed from the marketplace long ago “continue to be litigated very actively to this day,” Zimmerman said. Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said J&J’s decision could help the company reduce the amount of punitive damages by jurors in future trials, however, as those awards are frequently driven by jurors’ desire to punish a company’s ongoing conduct. J&J said it will continue to sell cornstarch-based baby powder in North America, and will sell both its talc and cornstarch-based products in other markets around the world."

-3.946954759073841," U.S. judge rules talc lawsuits against J&J can proceed, testimony limited NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thousands of plaintiffs who say that Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N baby powder and talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony will be allowed in trials after a Monday ruling by a New Jersey judge. J&J faces more than 16,000-talc related lawsuits nationwide, the majority of which are pending before U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in New Jersey. The lawsuits allege that the company’s talc products have been contaminated with asbestos and can cause ovarian cancer. The company had sought to bar all of the plaintiffs’ experts from testifying, which would have effectively wiped out all the cases before Wolfson. “We’re very pleased,” said Leigh O’Dell, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “The decision states, in a nutshell, that plaintiffs’ general causation experts are going to be able to testify that talcum powder can cause ovarian cancer.” J&J said in a statement that Monday’s decision “is not a determination by the court on the validity of the plaintiffs’ allegations.” It added that all verdicts against the company in talc lawsuits that had gone through the appeals process have been overturned. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. The ruling by Wolfson will allow plaintiffs to present expert testimony that J&J’s talc products can cause cancer based on epidemiological studies. They will be allowed to testify that the link could be caused by contamination with asbestos and heavy metals. Wolfson also ruled that the plaintiffs’ experts cannot testify that inhaling talc can travel to the ovaries if inhaled, though they may say that it can reach the ovaries when used vaginally. In so-called multidistrict litigations like the one before Wolfson, in which thousands of lawsuits are consolidated, a handful of cases are designated for early “bellwether” trials, which can help determine the strength of each side’s case and aid in settlement. Testimony in such cases typically relies heavily on experts. Several lawsuits against J&J over talc in state courts around the country have already gone to trial, including one in St. Louis, Missouri, involving 22 plaintiffs that produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J in July 2018. The company is appealing the verdict. In addition to the civil litigation, J&J faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products’ safety."

1.9964396669570252," J&J sees medical devices business recovery at end of year after taking coronavirus hit (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N on Tuesday said it expects its medical device business to begin recovering in the fourth quarter as elective medical procedures delayed by the coronavirus pandemic start to resume. The U.S. healthcare conglomerate lowered its full-year 2020 forecast due to the hit to that business, with procedures like hip and knee replacements on hold. The division accounts for nearly 30% of total sales. However, investors appeared to take heart that J&J did not simply withdraw its 2020 forecasts over coronavirus uncertainty as the pandemic causes massive business disruptions around the world. It also raised the quarterly dividend to $1.01 per share, and its shares rose 4.4% to $145.87. J&J’s 2020 adjusted earnings forecast of $7.50 to $7.90 per share - down from its prior view of $8.95 to $9.10 - assumes any return of the coronavirus outbreak in the fall will look much different than the current global health crisis. “If the virus does return, the world should be much better prepared to test, identify and isolate it. There may also be therapeutic options available,” Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said on a conference call. Wolk said he expected elective procedures and doctor visits to largely resume in the second half of the year, with the business seeing a lingering impact but starting to stabilize in the third quarter. Drugmakers and medical researchers are racing to develop treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, which has infected some 2 million people globally and killed over 123,000. J&J plans to start human trials of its vaccine candidate by September. It signed a vaccine deal with the U.S. government to jointly invest $1 billion and hopes to be able to manufacture more than 1 billion doses. J&J said it is developing the vaccine on a “not-for-profit” basis. “Being part of the solution to conquer the pandemic is good for all businesses, not just the business of Johnson & Johnson,” Wolk told Reuters in a phone interview. The company was not looking to recoup research and development costs and plans to price the vaccine to offset costs related to its manufacturing and distribution, Wolk said. J&J, the first major U.S. drugmaker to report earnings since the outbreak, said medical device sales in the first quarter fell 8.2% to $5.93 billion, with products used in high-margin orthopedic procedures and vision correction hit particularly hard. Consumer health sales jumped 9.2% to $3.63 billion, driven by a surge in demand for products like Tylenol and Motrin as consumers faced with an illness that causes fever and cough stocked up on essentials. Pharmaceutical sales rose 8.7% to $11.13 billion for the quarter. Excluding items, J&J earned $2.30 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 30 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co plunged in the first quarter, as both banks set aside billions of dollars to cover potential loan-losses from the pandemic. However, their shares rose between 1.3% and 1.5% in premarket trading after plunging 29% and 41% respectively, so far this year, as the health crisis crushed business activity and halted deal-making. Coronavirus-fueled uncertainty also forced Johnson & Johnson to cut its 2020 adjusted profit forecast, but its shares rose 3.5% as it boosted its quarterly dividend, signaling financial stability at a time when a slate of blue-chip firms have suspended dividends to shore up cash reserves. Analysts expect a 10.2% slide in earnings in the first quarter and a 22.4% slump in the second, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv. “It should come as no surprise that earnings are going to be hit very hard in 2020,” said Fiona O’Neill, deputy head of equities research at Fidelity International in London. “But it would be wrong to focus too much on 2020. Instead, we must look to forecast where earnings will go in 2021 and beyond so that we can continue to identify those companies that are going to emerge from this as winners.” The benchmark S&P 500 index has recouped about 26% in the past month, powered by historic fiscal and monetary support and early signs the virus outbreak was peaking in some U.S. hot spots, but remains about 22% below its February all-time high. President Donald Trump said late on Monday his administration was close to completing a plan to re-open the economy, but some state governors said the decision to re-start businesses lies with them. “The ‘turned the corner’ narrative has a strong immediacy, but there remain creeping concerns about a slow economic re-opening and lasting changes to consumer spending,” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon. Meanwhile, data showed China’s exports and imports shrank less than expected in March as factories restarted production, but analysts warned a sure-footed recovery was months away.

The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said earlier on Friday there were potential regulatory issues about the deal because Johnson & Johnson sells Evarrest, the only other U.S.-approved fibrin sealant patch designed to stop bleeding during surgery. “Staff had significant concerns about the likely anticompetitive effects and had recommended that the Commission block the transaction. Now that the deal has been abandoned, patients and surgeons will continue to benefit from competition,” Simons said in an email statement.

6.461817914765208," J&J, Moderna sign deals with U.S. to produce huge quantity of possible coronavirus vaccines (Reuters) - The U.S. government has cut deals with Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O and said it is in talks with at least two other companies to prepare them to produce massive quantities of coronavirus vaccines even before safe and effective ones become available. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines specifically for COVID-19, the respiratory disease that has killed more than 35,000 people and infected over 745,000 globally in just a few months. No vaccine is expected to be ready for use until at least 2021, as they must still be widely tested in humans before being administered to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people to prevent infection. On Monday, J&J announced a $1 billion deal with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity to make more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine, and its shares closed up 8% at $133.01. It has chosen a candidate but will not begin testing it in people until September. Moderna, which this month began very early tests of its vaccine candidate in people, also signed a deal with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The arrangements are part of the federal government’s effort to encourage drugmakers to be able to produce massive amounts of COVID-19 vaccines even before any are proven to work. The J&J effort will be funded in part by about $420 million from BARDA. The agency told Reuters it also plans to spend an unnamed amount to ramp up manufacturing for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Moderna shares rose 1.4% to $30.48. BARDA ultimately plans to support five or six experimental vaccine candidates, with the hopes of having two or three successful ones, BARDA director Rick Bright said in a phone interview. Experts have estimated it could be 12 to 18 months before a safe and effective vaccine wins regulatory approval. “Government and industry is working in unprecedented ways,” Bright said. The hope is to work “as quickly as possible and manufacture enough of it for us and the rest of the world in a very short timeframe.” The agency plans to take over manufacturing of Moderna’s vaccine candidate to enable the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech to focus on testing it in larger trials. BARDA hopes to speed up the back end of the vaccine manufacturing process, which involves ensuring that they are made and packaged according to standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ‘A LOT OF RISK INVOLVED’ There are dozens of coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization. But it is still not clear that people develop lasting immunity to this virus, or what it will take for a vaccine to be protective. “What you need to do is take an assessment of what the most likely candidates are and invest at risk in those,” said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The earlier you make that decision, the more likely you are to have manufacturing in place, but the less confident you are about whether the vaccine will work, Berkley said. Typically, decisions on whether to move forward with a vaccine are made after safety trials and preliminary efficacy trials have been completed. J&J said it will begin human testing in September, with an eye toward having a vaccine ready under an emergency use authorization in early 2021. J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now, even before it has a signal that its experimental vaccine candidate works. “That is the only option for us to get it on time,” Stoffels said of the early 2021 target. J&J hopes to have data proving its vaccine works by the end of this year. J&J has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that can make up to 300 million doses of vaccine, Stoffels said, but that “absolutely will not be sufficient for the world.” The company is also scouting for manufacturing plants in other parts of Europe and Asia capable of making the type of vaccine the company is working on. Stoffels said J&J’s vaccine will be based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which has been widely used in people. The company believes it will prove safe. In lab studies, it has produced strong neutralizing antibodies to the virus - the type needed to make a successful vaccine. In addition to the investments in J&J and Moderna, Bright said his agency is in talks with at least two other large vaccine makers, but declined to make them public. BARDA is interested in working with a broad range of vaccine technologies and with companies that have proven track records, Bright said. “There’s a lot of risk involved in making a new vaccine, a lot of risk in going quickly,” Bright said. “Wherever possible, we need to understand and mitigate that risk.”"

Circuit Judge Eric Murphy, writing Friday for a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, rejected both sides’ argument that the jurisdictional issue was a “technicality” and that the appeals court should rule on whether the Ohio court was an inconvenient forum, the grounds on which a lower court had dismissed the lawsuits.

Johnson and Johnson said that it had selected its own lead vaccine candidate and would start human testing of its experimental coronavirus vaccine by September, with an eye on having it ready for emergency use in early 2021, the drugmaker said on Monday. J&J said that the first batches of a vaccine could be available under an emergency use authorization in early 2021, far quicker than the typical 18 month period that it takes for vaccines to be tested, approved and then manufactured. J&J also committed more than $1 billion of investment along with U.S. agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to co-fund vaccine research, expanding a previous collaboration. The new coronavirus, which began in Wuhan, China, has infected people in most countries around the world. The United States now has the most cases globally and many of them are in New York, where hospitals are reporting a scarcity of resources to treat the COVID-19 respiratory disease it causes. A patient was dosed with Moderna Inc’s vaccine in an early-stage trial earlier this month, making it the front-runner in the race to develop a viable vaccine. J&J said in January it had begun working on a possible vaccine for the coronavirus, using the same technologies used to make its experimental Ebola vaccine.

17.78743526140248," EU says Johnson & Johnson's deal for Takeda patch may harm competition BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have opened a full investigation into Johnson & Johnson’s acquisition of Takeda Pharmaceutical’s surgical patch product TachoSil, concerned that the deal could lead to reduced choice and higher prices for customers. Takeda, 4502.T Japan's biggest drugmaker, announced the sale of TachoSil, a surgical patch for bleeding control, to U.S. giant Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N subsidiary Ethicon for $400 million last May. The European Commission said a preliminary investigation found cause for concern because TachoSil is the market leader in Europe. Johnson & Johnson is also a major maker of surgical patches globally although it does not sell such dual patches in Europe. The EU competition enforcer said high development costs meant rivals would find it difficult to enter the market. “In this concentrated space, we need to carefully assess whether the proposed merger would lead to reduced choice for surgeons and patients, to higher prices for our health services, or to slower development of alternative solutions to manage problematic bleeding,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The Commission set an Aug. 10 deadline for its decision on the deal."

13.99217160309063," Israel approves generic HIV drug to treat COVID-19 despite doubts TEL AVIV/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Israel approved the licensing of a generic version of an HIV drug to treat patients infected with the coronavirus on Thursday, despite doubts about its effectiveness in trials. The anti-viral drug Kaletra, produced by AbbVie Inc, could be a possible treatment for COVID-19, Israel’s Health Ministry said after issuing a preliminary permit. While AbbVie’s patent for Kaletra in Israel ends in 2024, the patent in some other countries, such as India, has expired. It was the first time the country’s attorney general has allowed the use of a generic version of a patent-protected drug in Israel, where there are 529 confirmed coronavirus cases. “The company with the patent and the official importer in Israel are not able to supply the necessary inventory for this drug, which is very much in demand all over the world these days,” the Justice Ministry said in a statement. “Therefore ... the state will be able to import generic substitutes from countries where the patent has expired.” It said generic Kaletra will only be used to treat coronavirus and not HIV, to protect the patent holder. A study released on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the drug was not effective as a potential treatment for coronavirus. The test of Chinese patients with severe COVID-19 found the 99 who received Kaletra, a combination of HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, fared no better than the 100 who received standard care. Those on the drugs showed clinical improvement after a median of 15 days compared to 16 days with standard care, a difference researchers said was “significant, albeit modest”. Johnson & Johnson has been testing a similar HIV drug, known as a protease inhibitor, against the novel coronavirus. At a panel on Thursday organized by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said its HIV drug Prezista, does not appear to have any effect against COVID-19. “We know from our scientific work that there is no activity on COVID-19,” Stoffels told reporters. “It’s highly unlikely there is any benefit of protease inhibitors,” he added. He discouraged the use of HIV drugs to treat COVID-19 patients if they are proven to be ineffective. “People with HIV will be deprived of medicine if it used in a non-necessary way in this outbreak.”"
13.99217160309063," J&J's Tylenol production at maximum capacity as coronavirus boosts demand NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is running its Tylenol manufacturing at maximum capacity in North America to meet surging demand due to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, a top executive said on Thursday. The company said it is stepping up its manufacturing of the drug globally. Demand for the drug rose two to four times normal levels in the last three weeks, hitting its highest point over the past week, Kathleen Widmer, group chairman for North America of Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health, said in an interview. “Just when we thought we had seen the highest demand we had ever seen for Tylenol, this week the demand has grown even more,” she said. Demand for drugs containing Tylenol’s main ingredient, known as paracetamol or acetaminophen, has soared in particular after France’s health minister suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen could worsen COVID-19. However, the World Health Organization said there is not currently data to back this up, and has not recommended people stop using NSAIDs. Before this latest surge, demand was already high as consumers stocked up on the drug ahead of potential quarantines. J&J is not experiencing any shortages of its raw materials for Tylenol, and has taken steps including adding crews and increasing the use of equipment and capacity in plants in Puerto Rico and Pennsylvania where the drug is produced. The Puerto Rico plant is running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Widmer said. “We’re running it at all-out, maximum capacity,” she said. Fears around shortages of some drugs emerged after the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on supply chains and were amplified earlier this month when India, the world’s main supplier of generic drugs, restricted the export of some ingredients as well as medicines including paracetamol. Widmer said that where it can, the company is narrowing its Tylenol production down to the products it can deliver the fastest. Those products are the traditional extra strength white caplet and 4 oz bottles of children Tylenol, which will represent most of the Tylenol currently being produced. The company has also turned off systems that manage orders from customers automatically, to avoid sending too much inventory to a single retail customer. “We totally understand that people want to be reassured that they have what they need at home should they or someone they love become ill,” Widmer said."

6.5868043010805275," Johnson & Johnson ramps up Tylenol production as demand surges (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is seeing a spike in demand for its Tylenol over-the-counter pain killer and other self-care products, the company said on Friday, as the global spread of the coronavirus prompts people to stock up on essentials. The company, which also makes Band-Aid and Listerine mouth wash, said it was shipping its stock in a “controlled manner” and that its manufacturing sites had ramped up production to ensure supply. J&J said it did not anticipate a shortage of Tylenol, a commonly used drug for headache and fever, even though the drug “may have temporarily run out of stock at one location”. Fears around shortages of some drugs emerged after the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on supply chains and were amplified last week after India, the world’s main supplier of generic drugs, restricted the export of some ingredients as well as medicines including paracetamol, known as Tylenol in the United States. J&J also said it was taking all possible measures to maximize the availability of its consumer products. The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China last year, has spread to more than 100 countries and killed more than 5,000 people worldwide, sparking a rush for everyday items ranging from toilet paper to packaged foods. Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and supermarket chain Kroger Co on Thursday placed purchase limits to stabilize inventory. Kroger placed a limit on the number of cold, flu and sanitary products per order, while Walgreens said it was limiting disinfectant wipes and cleaners, face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and gloves to four each per customer. The company also said majority of its global medical device manufacturing was running at or near normal capacity, and that it does not expect the outbreak to cause any disruptions to its supply of medicines. J&J said it had business continuity plans in place across its global supply chain network, including maintaining inventory at distribution centers away from high-risk areas and said it was monitoring demand and supply levels."

2.9740305239652374," Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $1.7 million to three Australian women in pelvic mesh class action MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian court on Tuesday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay three women a total of A$2.6 million ($1.7 million) plus legal costs as compensation for misleading patients and surgeons about the risks of its pelvic mesh implants. The Federal Court of Australia awarded the three lead applicants in the class action lawsuit between A$555,555 and A$1.28 million, the company said. Issues common to the group in the class action, which numbers more than 1,350 women, will be determined in the coming days, paving the way for damages for the other applicants to be determined. “Today is a significant step forward, but there is still a way to go until all Australian women affected by these products receive compensation,” Jan Saddler, head of class actions for Shine Lawyers, which represented the women, said in a statement. In November, the court found J&J subsidiary Ethicon had sold the mesh implants, used to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, without warning women about the “gravity of the risks” and was negligent in rushing the products to market before proper testing. Patients said they have suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted. J&J has faced similar lawsuits in the United States, Canada and Europe. In October, it agreed to pay nearly $117 million to resolve claims in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. “Ethicon emphasises with those women who have experienced complications following pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence surgical procedures,” J&J said in a statement after the compensation judgment was handed down. However, it reiterated that “Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products.” A J&J spokeswoman said after the judge sets out the issues that will be used to determine who qualifies for compensation, the company has 28 days to decide whether to appeal the November verdict."

4.869461298609584," Opioid companies say lawyers' fee demand threatens settlement talks (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and other drug companies facing thousands of lawsuits over their role in the opioid epidemic have warned that settlement talks will be ""severely"" jeopardized if plaintiffs' lawyers are allowed to assess a fee payment worth billions of dollars. Major distributors such as McKesson Corp MCK.N and drugmakers including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA joined in the request that U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, reject a request by a committee of plaintiffs' lawyers for a 7% fee assessed against any settlements. They filed their brief late Wednesday. The request could amount to $3.3 billion, based on a $48 billion settlement proposal that five companies have been negotiating with various state attorneys general. The drug companies noted that the attorneys would receive more money from the settlement than even some of the states they represent. Dozens of state attorneys general also opposed the request for the fee to the plaintiffs executive committee that is litigating thousands of lawsuits by towns, counties and tribal governments. The lawsuits, consolidated before Polster, accuse the companies of fueling a nationwide opioid crisis blamed for 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths since 1999. Many local governments hired private attorneys and will have to carve out of any money received for a separate legal fee, which in some cases will be paid to the same attorneys who sit on the plaintiffs executive committee, or PEC. “The scope of that demand is staggering,” the companies said in Wednesday’s joint filing. They said the 7% assessment would “give the PEC more money than any city or county in the country, and more than many states.” The PEC said members were engaged in negotiating a full and fair settlement with distributors and working to reach a broader settlement with opioid defendants. “Common benefit fees are not a roadblock to resolution,” the PEC said in a statement. In court filings, PEC lawyers described the fee request as “modest” given the complex litigation. Such a fee, to compensate for lawyers’ time and expenses, is a feature of complex nationwide litigation. The fee request has also met opposition from state attorneys general, who brought their own opioid cases that are not before Polster. In a letter to Polster on Monday, attorneys general from 36 states said plaintiffs’ lawyers were wrongly seeking to tax any settlements the states achieve and that the fee request if approved could “irreparably” disrupt global settlement talks. “Everyone understands these attorneys have done a lot of work,” New Hampshire Associate Attorney General James Boffetti said. “But it doesn’t mean they get a disproportionate windfall.” The parties are under pressure to resolve the lawsuits before the start of a March 20 trial in New York."

0.6305513081051534," Apple, J&J to study if Apple Watch app leads to lower stroke risk (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Tuesday it would partner with Apple Inc AAPL.O on a study to use an iPhone app and the Apple Watch to study how earlier detection of atrial fibrillation impacts stroke in people aged 65 or older. Last year, Apple's Heart Study here found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association. Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes. “We want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,” Williams told Reuters in an interview. “It’s not something that we have to do, but it’s the right thing to do.” The joint effort, called “Heartline,” is significant because J&J is one of the world’s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies. “What we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years. The study could also reach a different population than Apple’s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation. J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65. “What we’re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?” Burton said. The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG. If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study. The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches. The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk. “With tens of millions of watches on people’s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,” Apple’s Williams told Reuters."

During an earlier phase of the trial, a different jury held J&J liable for the plaintiffs’ cancers and awarded them $37.2 million in compensation. Under New Jersey law, punitive damages are capped at 5 times the amount of compensatory damages, according to plaintiffs lawyer Chris Placitella. J&J said in a statement it would quickly appeal both phases of the trial, citing “numerous legal errors that subjected the jury to irrelevant information and prevented them from hearing meaningful evidence.” The verdict came after J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky testified last month for the first time in a jury trial over allegations that the company’s Baby Powder causes cancer. “We believe the jury was speaking directly to Alex Gorsky,” plaintiffs lawyer Placitella said. J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging it sold powders contaminated with asbestos and failed to warn users. It also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products’ safety. J&J denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. On Dec. 14, 2018, Reuters published a story that showed J&J had failed to disclose that small amounts of asbestos, a known carcinogen, had sometimes been found in its talc over several decades. After the report was published, a selloff wiped more than $40 billion off the company’s market value. At the time, J&J dismissed the Reuters’ report as “an absurd conspiracy theory.”"

At the time, J&J dismissed the Reuters’ report as “an absurd conspiracy theory.” “My trade took place at a time when I did not have that kind of knowledge about the article,” Gorsky said on Monday. Gorsky testified that he followed all of the appropriate approval processes with the company’s board of directors and legal team regarding the sale of company shares after exercising stock options. J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging it sold powders contaminated with asbestos and failed to warn users. It also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products’ safety. Filings made by J&J to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that Gorsky sold $38.6 million of company stock on Nov. 16, two days after Reuters made its findings known to the company. On Monday, Gorsky acknowledged that his net proceeds totaled about $22 million. In response to questions from a lawyer representing J&J, Gorsky reiterated that he had not been told about the Reuters email in advance of the stock sale. He also acknowledged that he sold less than 10% of his holdings in the company in that transaction and that the shares would be worth more now if he had held onto them. A J&J spokesman said that Gorsky had notified the company’s legal department about the planned sale on Nov. 12, 2018, two days before the Reuters inquiry. The stock sale was prompted by plans to buy a house, he said. The spokesman provided no further details, and Reuters could not independently confirm the purchase. Gorsky was subpoenaed by plaintiffs’ lawyers as a witness in a trial playing out in a courtroom near J&J headquarters. The plaintiffs, three men and one woman, all have mesothelioma, a rare and incurable cancer that they allege was caused by their exposure to asbestos in Baby Powder in infancy during their diapering. During an earlier liability phase of the trial, a jury awarded $37.2 million in compensatory damages. Now plaintiffs’ lawyers are seeking to persuade a new jury that J&J failed to do enough to ensure the purity of its product, and therefore additional punitive damages should be awarded. “I was told by the experts in their fields that we were using the most appropriate, most up-to-date technology to make sure our talc was safe,” Gorsky testified. In response to a question posed by plaintiffs’ lawyers, Gorsky also told the jury he did not read all the internal company documents related to potential asbestos contamination in Baby Powder, including those contained in links in the Reuters report. “I did not read all the documents, but I would rely on the experts in these fields,” Gorsky testified. J&J had fought against the subpoena, arguing that its CEO had no first-hand knowledge about the safety of its powders and that the case involves corporate conduct that occurred long before he joined the company. Compelling his testimony “would serve no purpose other than to harass Mr. Gorsky and divert him from his executive responsibilities,” J&J said in a motion. The New Jersey Supreme Court turned down the company’s request to suspend the subpoena last week. In October, J&J disclosed that a contract lab for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder produced in 2018. The company questioned the finding and commissioned tests on samples from the same bottle and talc from the same lot. Less than two weeks later, J&J announced those tests had found no asbestos, other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner in the lab. Gorsky’s journey to the witness stand can be traced to the lead role he played in company efforts to rebut the Reuters report, which prompted plaintiffs lawyers to subpoena his testimony. In the days following publication, the CEO personally attested to the safety and purity of Johnson’s Baby Powder in a video posted on the company’s website, as well as in an appearance on CNBC’s “Mad Money.” “We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,” Gorsky told the investment show’s host Jim Cramer."

3.8553471356359648," J&J forecasts weak annual profit, misses revenue estimates (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday forecast 2020 profit below Wall Street estimates and said increased competition for its off-patent treatments could somewhat limit growth in the top-earning pharmaceuticals unit. Shares of the healthcare conglomerate fell nearly 2% to $146.62 after it reported a rare miss on quarterly revenue, as sales of cancer drug Imbruvica and psoriasis treatment Stelara came in below lofty Wall Street estimates. J&J’s pharmaceuticals unit, which makes up half of the company’s overall sales, has powered much of its recent growth. However, generic competition for medicines such as prostate cancer drug Zytiga, coupled with pressure to hold down prescription drug price increases in the United States, has weighed on revenue. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said the company still expects sales growth to accelerate in 2020, but it will “probably not be as robust as we would have thought this time last year.” He said J&J did not take as big a hit from generic and biosimilar competition in 2019 as feared, and that the company hoped its off-patent branded products could maintain market share into 2020. J&J expects full-year 2020 adjusted earnings of $8.95 to $9.10 per share, with a midpoint below current analysts’ average estimates at the top of the range. Important newer drugs posted double-digit sales gains in the fourth quarter but missed analysts’ forecasts. Stelara rose 17.7% to $1.70 billion, short of Credit Suisse’s estimate of $1.79 billion, while Imbruvica sales jumped 24.5% to $875 million, but still came up short of the brokerage’s estimate of $907 million. Pharmaceutical sales rose 3.5% to $10.55 billion in the fourth quarter, but failed to reach Wall Street estimates of $10.63 billion, according Refinitiv data. Overall sales rose 1.7% to $20.75 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $20.80 billion, marking the company’s first revenue miss in at least eight quarters. The company said it will not actively participate in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration hearing early next month to discuss testing methods for talc. “We certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product... I can say that our current internal testing methods exceed that of current FDA standards for cosmetic talc,” Wolk said. The company faces thousands of lawsuits alleging that its talc products, including baby powder, caused cancer. J&J has maintained that the products are safe and do not contain cancer-causing contaminants. Excluding items, J&J earned $1.88 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

2.560409559544345," Judge slashes $8 billion Risperdal award against Johnson & Johnson to $6.8 million (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania judge on Friday slashed to $6.8 million from $8 billion a punitive damages award against Johnson & Johnson to a man who said it failed to warn that boys using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts. Judge Kenneth Powell of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas reduced the payout that a jury awarded Oct. 8 to the plaintiff Nicholas Murray, a Maryland resident. No reason was given for the reduction, which was disclosed in court records. Lawyers for Murray have said the punitive damages award was the first in thousands of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit over Risperdal. Murray claimed he had been prescribed the drug in 2003, when he was 9, to treat symptoms related to autism. He had previously been awarded $680,000 in compensatory damages. Both sides pledged to appeal. “The ruling is wrong (and) provides essentially no punishment for the worst of the worst of corporate misconduct,” Murray’s lawyer Thomas Kline said in an email. “We believe that when the merits are reviewed that the $8 billion will be reinstated.” Johnson & Johnson said that while Powell “appropriately reduced the excessive punitive damages award,” he wrongly excluded evidence that Risperdal’s label “clearly and appropriately” outlined the risks of use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Risperdal in 1993 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mania in adults, and in 2006 for irritability associated with autism in children. Plaintiffs suing over the drug have said Johnson & Johnson concealed the link between Risperdal and excessive growth of female breast tissue in boys, known as gynecomastia. While doctors may prescribe many drugs as they see fit, including for off-label uses, Murray said Johnson & Johnson should have warned his doctors about Risperdal’s side effects. Johnson & Johnson said in October it faced lawsuits by 13,600 people over Risperdal. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company agreed separately in 2013 to pay $2.2 billion to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes into its marketing of Risperdal and two other drugs. In late afternoon trading, Johnson & Johnson shares were up 74 cents at $148.94."

The deal gave J&J access to the privately held company’s surgical robotic scope used in respiratory procedures and the detection of lung cancer.

-9.767497752983454," Britain's GSK seeks U.S approval for rival to J&J's multiple myeloma drug (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline said on Monday it had applied for U.S. approval for its experimental multiple myeloma drug that showed meaningful response in nearly a third of patients, setting up a battle against Johnson & Johnson and Genmab’s Darzalex. New data from the treatment, belantamab mafodotin, showed 30 of 97 patients experienced a reduction in their myeloma cells at the end of a mid-stage study, DREAMM-2. The trial was testing belantamab mafodotin, also known as GSK2857916, in patients who had received four to seven prior other treatments, including J&J and Genmab’s blockbuster drug Darzalex. Data earlier this month showed Darzalex cut the risk of death or worsening cancer by 37% in patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells. [nFWN28K0JT] GSK has submitted a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 2.5 mg/kg dose. If approved, belantamab mafodotin would be the first anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) agent available in the United States, the company said. Belantamab mafodotin targets the BCMA protein in cells characteristic of multiple myeloma - an area of focus for many drugmakers. The latest results are from the first of about 10 trials planned for belantamab mafodotin as GSK aims to soon show its benefits in earlier phases of treatment. Axel Hoos, GSK’s oncology research and development head, said the rate of response - or the number of patients that experience a reduction in myeloma cells – should go up with every earlier cycle of treatment. “We are pretty confident that we can actually achieve the same (response rates) if not more and eventually even beat Darzalex in some settings,” he said. As early as next year, the British group aims to launch a trial where the drug is given to newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. J&J and Genmab are expected to generate more than $4 billion in Darzalex revenues between them in 2020, according to the Refinitiv average analyst estimate."

-9.767497752983454," BeiGene cancer drug fails in study against AbbVie: J&J's Imbruvica (Reuters) - BeiGene Ltd said on Monday a late-stage trial failed to show that its cancer treatment Brukinsa was superior to Imbruvica, a rival drug from Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie Inc. The results come merely a month after BeiGene scored a win with Brukinsa’s approval to treat patients with mantle cell lymphoma, who have received at least one prior therapy. U.S.-listed shares of BeiGene fell 5.2% to $166.9 in early trading on Monday. The latest trial compared the drugs in 229 patients with Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare, slow-growing blood cell cancer characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow. Brukinsa did not achieve the comparative study’s main goals of showing greater reduction in cancer signs compared with Imbruvica and in reducing at least 90% of production of an antibody that overproduced in patients with WM. However, it did show greater improvements in safety and tolerability, BeiGene said. There is sufficient data from the comparative study to have a discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for Brukinsa’s approval in WM, the company said and added that it was too early to talk about regulatory filing. “It is unlikely that we would do other trials, I think that there’s potential that with longer follow up this trial in and of itself could suffice,” Eric Hendrick, chief adviser at BeiGene, told Reuters. Despite Monday’s failure, the trial data suggests Brukinsa has a differentiated safety profile, with fewer patients discontinuing treatment due to side effects, SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens said. Four patients on Brukinsa discontinued the treatment due to adverse events and there was one death, while the group receiving Imbruvica witnessed nine discontinuations from side effects and four deaths, BeiGene said. Like Imbruvica, Brukinsa belongs to a class of drugs called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. It also competes against AstraZeneca Plc’s Calquence, another BTK inhibitor. BeiGene likely faces an uphill commercial battle versus Imbruvica and Calquence without positive head-to-head data, Guggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt said. Brukinsa is currently priced at $12,935 for a 30-day supply, roughly at parity with Imbruvica and slightly below Calquence. The company said it does not believe the trial results cause it to rethink its strategy around Brukinsa’s pricing. WM affects about 3 per million people each year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health."

1.8238278568758697," J&J CEO spurns U.S. congressional hearing on carcinogens in talc products (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has declined to appear at a U.S. congressional hearing set for Tuesday on the safety of the company's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. In an announcement, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy said that its efforts to persuade Gorsky to testify included “repeated attempts to accommodate the company” over nearly a month. Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the House panel investigating concerns about cancer-causing asbestos in cosmetic talc and powders, said he was disappointed Gorsky turned down the invitation. “Mr. Gorsky refuses to speak to the Subcommittee under oath, yet he has not refrained from making multiple public comments on the topic,” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company’s offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products. Gorsky “is not, as we have repeatedly told the Subcommittee, an expert in the stated subject of the hearing,” Knewitz said. “We have respectfully declined the invitation for our CEO to testify.” Knewitz said that the composition of the hearing, which includes two experts who have testified for plaintiffs against J&J, also factored into the company’s decision. Gorsky has played a lead role in J&J’s efforts to reassure consumers and investors that its talc powders are safe and asbestos free. Last year, he issued a statement vouching for the safety of the products after a jury issued a $4.69 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who sued over allegations their ovarian cancers were caused by J&J powders. Gorsky appeared on CNBC's ""Mad Money with Jim Cramer"" and in a video posted on J&J's website to rebut a December 2018 Reuters report here that the company knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its talc and powders. “Since tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J’s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,” Gorsky said in the video. In October, Gorsky testified in a deposition here in a lawsuit filed by an Indiana man, saying, ""We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos."" J&J faces more than 16,000 similar lawsuits. Concerns over asbestos in talc cosmetics have grown in recent months as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the carcinogen had been found in several products, including a bottle of Baby Powder. J&J said it recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder “out of an abundance of caution.” Later, J&J said labs it hired found no asbestos - other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner - in samples from the same Baby Powder bottle and its production lot. The FDA has said it stands by its finding. Chief executives of companies embroiled in controversies routinely comply with lawmakers’ invitations to testify. In recent months, the CEOs of Boeing BA.N and Facebook FB.O have appeared before congressional committees to answer questions about how their companies were safeguarding consumers. Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said CEOs have a responsibility to go to Washington when Congress calls, just like other citizens. But Elson said Gorsky’s pass was understandable. He said the CEO and his advisers probably figured that the downside was greater to testifying than not. “It’s being invited in for a punch in the nose,” Elson said. For Gorsky, “nothing good will come out of it.”"

J&J faces more than 16,000 similar lawsuits. Concerns over asbestos in talc cosmetics have grown in recent months as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the carcinogen had been found in several products, including a bottle of Baby Powder. J&J said it recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder “out of an abundance of caution.” Later, J&J said labs it hired found no asbestos - other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner - in samples from the same Baby Powder bottle and its production lot. The FDA has said it stands by its finding. Chief executives of companies embroiled in controversies routinely comply with lawmakers’ invitations to testify. In recent months, the chief executives of Boeing and Facebook have appeared before congressional committees to answer questions about how their companies were safeguarding consumers. Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said CEOs have a responsibility to go to Washington when Congress calls, just like other citizens. But Elson said Gorsky’s pass was understandable. He said the chief executive and his advisers probably figured that the downside was greater to testifying than not. “It’s being invited in for a punch in the nose,” Elson said. For Gorsky, “nothing good will come out of it.” (Reporting by Lisa Girion in Los Angeles and Carl O’Donnell in New York; additional reporting by Chad Terhune; editing by Grant McCool)"

1.8205354537869134," FDA approves Amgen's biosimilar to J&J's rheumatoid arthritis drug (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Amgen Inc’s biosimilar copy of Johnson & Johnson’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, according to the regulator’s website. The biosimilar, Avsola, has the same chemical components, dosage form and strength as Remicade and would treat a range of autoimmune disorders. Amgen did not give the pricing of the drug immediately, but said is confident to compete in the biosimilar market. The label for the treatment carries a boxed warning, FDA’s harshest, flagging risks of serious infections and malignancy, similar to that of Remicade’s. With the regulatory approval, Avsola joins the existing biosimilars to J&J’s drug, including Pfizer Inc’s 2017 approved Ixifi, Celltrion Inc’s Inflectra and Merck & Co and Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd’s Renflexis. Avsola will add to Amgen’s growing biosimilar unit, which could be $2 billion over the next several years, says Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. However, Yee doesn’t see the drug as a major driver of sales for Amgen right now. Avsola was approved for all eligible indications of Remicade, including the treatment of bowel disease, Crohn’s disease and skin disorder plaque psoriasis, the agency said. Biosimilars are medicines considered highly similar to an original drug and are cheaper alternatives to biologic products. The blockbuster drug Remicade, approved in the United States, European Union and other regions, has steadily lost market share among patients enrolled in the Canadian province of Quebec’s public drug program and elsewhere, where biosimilars have been slowly catching on with doctors and patients. Remicade brought in sales of $1.14 billion in the third quarter, which fell 17.6% from last year."

3.598024534183187," Johnson & Johnson says new tests show no asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that recent tests showed that Johnson’s Baby Powder was free of asbestos, after U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigations reported trace amounts of the material in the product earlier this year. A total of 155 tests were conducted by two different third-party labs using four different testing methods on samples from the same bottle tested by the FDA’s contracted lab, the company said. The tests are the latest effort by J&J to prove the safety of its widely used consumer product after the test by the FDA prompted J&J to undertake a nationwide recall of one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder in October. The FDA was not immediately available for comment. However, in response to an October announcement from J&J that a smaller number of independent tests also found no asbestos, the regulatory agency said it stood by its findings. The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials told Reuters in October. Tests conducted by the third-party labs showed asbestos was not present in the single bottle that the FDA’s contracted lab had tested, nor was it present in retained samples of the finished lot from which the bottle was produced, the company said on Tuesday. The company said its investigation concluded that the most probable root causes for the FDA’s reported results were either test sample contamination or analyst error at the lab, or both. In October, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA said it had found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online. The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time. That move marked the first time the company recalled its baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma. The recall was the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal. J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, caused their cancer."
3.598024534183187," U.S. regions hard hit by opioids to ditch class action, pursue own lawsuits WILMINGTON, Del(Reuters) - Local governments in regions hard hit by the U.S. opioid epidemic have opted out of massive litigation taking aim at the drug industry over the crisis, potentially weakening a novel legal mechanism created to help settle thousands of lawsuits. Overall, 98% of some 34,000 local governments agreed to be bound by a class action against companies such as drug distributor McKesson Corp, drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, according to a Monday court filing. However, the 541 local governments that opted out included Florida’s Palm Beach County and counties in West Virginia, according to attorneys, raising the prospect that companies could face expensive trials even if they settled with the class. The two regions are among the hardest hit by the crisis, which has contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997. Officials from Houston’s Harris County, one of the largest U.S. counties, have said it would opt out, meaning they would pursue their own lawsuit and not receive funds from a nationwide settlement. The court filing did not identify opt-outs. U.S. Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has been overseeing 2,600 consolidated opioid lawsuits, is pushing hard for a settlement to help get funds to those most in need in a timely fashion. He approved the novel “negotiation class” as a way to reassure companies that any deal to resolve the lawsuits would bind remaining governments and prevent them from filing a case. The lawsuits generally allege that drugmakers improperly marketed opioids while distributors and pharmacy chains failed to stop suspicious orders. The defendants deny the allegations. Typical class actions allow members to opt out after a settlement has been reached, but the negotiation class fixes the members first. Any settlement must be approved by 75% of the class. Lawyers said towns and counties less affected by the crisis had little reason to opt out, while areas ravaged by opioids, like West Virginia, had more incentive to pursue and control their own lawsuit. The number of opt-outs represented around 20% of those that have already sued and could be significant if it included large cities, according to Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law. “If I’m trying to negotiate with a town of 80, that’s very different from Houston,” she said. The negotiation class was opposed by some state attorneys general and drug distributors, and faces a legal challenge at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati."

10.648439958094105," Johnson & Johnson loses pelvic mesh class action in Australia MELBOURNE (Reuters) - More than 1,350 Australian women won a seven-year-old class action lawsuit on Thursday against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) for misleading patients and surgeons about the risks of the pharmaceutical giant’s pelvic mesh implants. The suit is one of many J&J has faced in the United States, Canada and Europe over the implants, used to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, in which organs shift from normal positions. J&J in October agreed to pay nearly $117 million to resolve claims in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Australia’s Federal Court found that J&J subsidiary Ethicon had sold the devices without warning women about the “gravity of the risks”, and was negligent in rushing the products to market before proper testing. The judge in the case, Anna Katzmann, has set February for the next hearing in the case, where damages will be discussed. Ethicon said it was reviewing the court’s decision and would consider its options to appeal. “Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products,” the company said in a statement. Judge Katzmann ruled that much of the information the company provided about the devices was “inaccurate” and at times made “false representations”. “The question is whether this conduct considered as a whole was misleading or likely to mislead. I believe it was,” Katzmann said in her judgment. “The post-market evaluation of all the Ethicon devices was deficient,” she said. “It fell well below the level of care required of a reasonably prudent manufacturer.” “The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon’s own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated,” the judge said in her ruling. Patients said they had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted. Dozens of women involved in the class action welcomed the court’s decision. Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, said she was “incredibly pleased” with the judgment but said it would not take away the pain and damage done to women. “They have treated women essentially like guinea pigs, lied about it and done nothing to help,” she told reporters at a televised media conference outside the court in Sydney."

12.027666081773848," Oklahoma judge reduces Johnson & Johnson opioid payout to $465 million (Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Friday said Johnson & Johnson must pay that state $465 million for fueling the opioid epidemic through the deceptive marketing of painkillers, down from his original award of $572 million. The decision by Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman in Norman, Oklahoma, came in the first case to go to trial out of 2,700 nationally by states, counties and cities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the deadly epidemic. Balkman reduced the amount he had awarded in August by $107 million after agreeing with New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J that he had made a math error. J&J said it will appeal, and that the award and finding of liability were “neither supported by the facts nor the law.” A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said that office is reviewing the decision and will formally respond within the next few days. Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following a non-jury trial, Balkman ruled in August that Oklahoma had proven that J&J engaged in misleading marketing about the benefits of painkillers, and that their addictive risks caused a public nuisance in the form of the opioid crisis. Hunter had sought to have J&J pay $17 billion to help fund addiction treatment and other services to repair damage from the opioid epidemic over the next 30 years. Balkman, however, awarded only enough money for one year of programs, saying Oklahoma failed to support its claims regarding the need to abate the epidemic in future years. Following the August ruling, Oklahoma asked Balkman for permission to return to his courtroom annually to prove those costs, but Balkman on Friday maintained his prior ruling. J&J, meanwhile, argued that it deserved a $355 million credit, reflecting pre-trial settlements by the drugmakers Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Balkman concluded on Friday that state law did not allow such credits. Last month, J&J and four other companies proposed a $48 billion settlement framework to resolve all of the opioid cases they face, with J&J paying $4 billion. Lawyers for the local governments have opposed the proposal. If approved, the settlement would let J&J resolve some of the thousands of product liability lawsuits it faces. The company also faces litigation over whether its baby powder causes cancer, a claim it denies."

16.367911601802543," Johnson & Johnson files for European approval of Ebola vaccine (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Thursday it had filed for an approval from European regulators for its two-dose experimental vaccine to protect against Ebola, less than a month after the agency recommended approval of Merck & Co Inc's MRK.N vaccine. J&J said it submitted two marketing authorization applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its vaccine regimen targeting the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, which most commonly causes outbreaks of the deadly disease. The company's vaccine requires two injections administered about eight weeks apart, the first developed using J&J's technology and the second from Denmark-based biotech Bavarian Nordic A/S BAVA.CO. Johnson & Johnson’s applications are supported by data from over 10 studies that have tested the regimen in adults and children, the company said. The drugmaker added it was discussing with the Food and Drug Administration the dataset that would be required for U.S. approval. Since it first started in August 2018, the Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people, second only to the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The EMA’s recommendation for approval in October of Merck’s Ebola vaccine, taken as a single shot, was hailed by the World Health Organization as a “triumph for public health” that could save many lives. This month, health authorities in Democratic Republic of Congo are introducing Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine to counter the current outbreak in the country’s eastern provinces, where Merck’s vaccine is already in use. J&J’s unit Janssen is also working in collaboration with the World Health Organization to enable registration of the Ebola vaccine regimen in African countries, the company said."

13.972987578838511," Exclusive: J&J's own expert, working for FDA, found asbestos in Baby Powder (Reuters) - Ever since Johnson & Johnson disclosed this month that a government test had turned up asbestos in its Baby Powder, the company has attacked the validity of the result. On Tuesday, for example, J&J announced that other labs it hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot. In challenging the FDA’s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts. The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J. Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defense against plaintiffs’ claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers. He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson’s Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company’s argument that its iconic brand is safe. Saldivar’s lab began testing cosmetic talc products for the FDA again this year, and in September it found asbestos in an unmarked sample that the FDA later identified as Johnson’s Baby Powder. “I have never heard of anything like this,” said Richard Ausness, a University of Kentucky law professor who specializes in product liability, referring to Saldivar’s dual roles. “This is bad news for J&J. The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J&J for years, and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there.” J&J’s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness, Ausness said. “J&J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent, but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for,” Ausness said. The company appeared to do just that on Tuesday, saying testing done by other laboratories J&J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA, nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar’s finding. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results. They also said they were not surprised by J&J’s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results. The company “would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,” said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Plaintiffs’ attorneys said Saldivar’s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J&J’s defense in court. The company faces lawsuits from more than 16,000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer. The impact was immediate in one courtroom. Hours after J&J disclosed the FDA’s asbestos finding on Oct. 18, a plaintiff’s lawyer, Nate Finch, asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71-year-old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer. J&J’s lawyers opposed the request, arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company, but the judge granted Finch’s request. Days later, Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J&J, a trial transcript shows. Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution. J&J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case. The company declined to comment on Saldivar’s role in the FDA testing, or on how it might affect the company’s legal strategy going forward. Saldivar declined to comment. In a June deposition, Saldivar said J&J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in “maybe 20 or 30” cases. His firm bills $200 to $350 an hour for his services, he testified. Under the FDA contract, his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept. 7, according to the lab’s report. J&J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct. 16, prompting the company to recall 33,000 bottles “out of an abundance of caution.” In response, some major U.S. retailers have said they are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson’s baby powder from their shelves. At the same time, the company has expressed suspicions about the finding, saying it had launched its own investigation “to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results.” On Friday, the FDA posted online Saldivar’s 16-page report to the agency on the analysis of J&J Baby Powder. In samples weighing less than a gram, the lab said it found six chrysotile asbestos fibers. Given that the samples were extremely small, the asbestos could amount to millions of fibers per gram, testing experts told Reuters. While most people exposed to asbestos never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn’t been established. The World Health Organization and other health authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos, a known carcinogen. “Since there are no known safe levels of asbestos, the FDA has asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall their products when fibers consistent with asbestos are found in them,” the agency said this month. Several juries over the past two years have concluded that Baby Powder exposures caused cancer and have awarded plaintiffs more than $5 billion. Other juries have sided with J&J, and some cases have settled. ‘JUST NOT CORRECT’ The FDA has never before announced that government testing found asbestos in J&J’s Baby Powder. Since the early 1970s, J&J has pushed back hard on reports of asbestos in its talc by outside scientists, plaintiffs’ experts and, on several occasions, by its own testing labs. In an Oct. 3 deposition in a New York lawsuit, J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky dismissed the findings of asbestos over the years, saying “they were later shown to be inaccurate, incomplete and just not correct.” Attacking Saldivar’s finding, some legal experts told Reuters, could hurt the company’s ability to use him as a witness in lawsuits and undercut its broader message to jurors and consumers. That message boils down to: Trust our experts. But a product liability defense lawyer who helped organize a recent talc litigation symposium said the impact on pending cases could be limited because asbestos-related cancers are known to take decades to develop. The FDA’s new finding “would be difficult to tie” to cancers allegedly caused by long-ago exposures, said Edward Ulloa, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who does not represent J&J. The FDA findings are “essentially anecdotal,” Ulloa said, “specific to that product and that particular sample.” In its Tuesday announcement, J&J said that one of the labs it hired initially found asbestos in three samples of Baby Powder, but the lab determined that a portable air conditioner running when the samples were prepared was contaminated with asbestos. Subsequent tests in a different room found no asbestos, the company said. In 2010, when the AMA lab tested 34 talc products for the FDA, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, the lab had no experience looking for asbestos fibers in talc milled for powders and cosmetics. Saldivar testified in several depositions that the lab’s work had previously focused on determining the amount of asbestos in old building products, such as vinyl flooring. AMA made fast work of the 2010 FDA job, lab records reviewed by Reuters show. His lab examined 102 samples, three from each product, in a single day, using a method called transmission electron microscopy (TEM). That works out to less than five minutes per sample, assuming an eight-hour shift with no breaks. Experts who have found asbestos in milled talc powders told Reuters they require anywhere from a half hour to a day per sample using TEM, and litigation records show they often look at more talc per sample than Saldivar has testified is the practice at AMA. In a deposition earlier this year, Saldivar acknowledged that he looked at less talc per sample than others in the field and that looking at more talc “would raise your analytical sensitivity” - the ability to find any contamination. But he said he believed that his methods were sufficient. After the AMA lab found no asbestos in 2010, the FDA cautioned against reading too much into the results - not because of the sensitivity of the test but because so few products were tested. Though the agency has described the testing as using the “most sensitive techniques available,” it said the results “do not prove that most or all talc or talc-containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination.” When J&J’s lawyers approached Saldivar a few years ago about serving as an expert and testing Baby Powder, they “wanted me to follow my protocols that I used on my FDA testing” in 2010, Saldivar testified in May 2018. In June, he testified that his lab had never found any asbestos in talc samples, including Baby Powder, that it had tested for J&J and other manufacturer defendants. The testing by Saldivar’s lab for the FDA this year was a different story. “This positive test turns up the heat on J&J,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford University law professor who studies complex litigation. “And their expert lit the match.”"
17.396988365298245," J&J says new tests find no asbestos in same baby powder bottle that sparked recall (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that 15 new tests found no asbestos in a bottle of baby powder that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says tested positive for trace amounts of asbestos, a finding the agency stands by.

FDA officials, in an interview with Reuters, said the agency continues to support the company’s voluntary recall. “They would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,” said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition. Earlier this month, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online. “Rigorous and third-party testing confirms there is no asbestos in Johnson’s Baby Powder. We stand by the safety of our product,” J&J said in a statement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on the FDA standing by its test result. The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials said. The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time. That move marked the first time the company recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma. J&J will not reverse the recall of those 22-ounce containers, but its baby powder remains available to consumers in stores, a company spokesman told Reuters. The recall had been the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal. J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, caused their cancer. (This version corrects spelling of powder in headline)"

17.396988365298245," Justice Department issues grand jury subpoenas in J&J opioid probe: filing CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N received grand jury subpoenas in August from the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York related to its opioid medication policies, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. J&J said the subpoenas were related to anti-diversion policies and procedures and the distribution of its opioid medications developed by its Janssen pharmaceuticals unit. The company said in the filing it believes the investigation relates to monitoring and reporting programs by manufacturers and distributors of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act. “Like other companies that have manufactured opioid medications, Janssen has received subpoenas and investigative demands from various government entities, and this includes the August 2019 subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York,” the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. J&J said it understands the subpoenas are part of a “broader, industry-wide investigation” and said the company believes its anti-diversion policies and procedures complied with the law. Johnson & Johnson last week lowered its previously reported third-quarter profit to account for a proposed $4 billion cash settlement related to the opioid crisis. That followed a Reuters report citing sources that drug distributors McKesson Corp MCK.N, AmerisourceBergen CorpABC.N and Cardinal Health CAH.N had offered to pay $18billion in cash over 18 years, while J&J would pay $4 billion in cash. The drug industry faces roughly 2,600 lawsuits brought bystate and local governments, hospitals and other entities seeking to hold drugmakers and distributors responsible for the toll of opioid abuse. In August, an Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic, a sum that was substantially less than investors had expected."
16.696967539563172," Johnson & Johnson CEO testified Baby Powder was safe 13 days before FDA bombshell LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing off against a plaintiff’s lawyer for the first time about Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder, the company’s Chief Executive Alex Gorsky earlier this month insisted that the company’s iconic brand was safe. “We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos,” Gorsky testified in an Oct. 3 deposition in a case involving a retired Indiana college professor who alleges his cancer was caused by the Baby Powder he used for decades. The deposition has not been previously reported. Gorsky, citing “thousands of tests and studies” to support his testimony, said: “I’m not aware of our baby powder or talc containing asbestos.” That’s harder for him to say now. Last Wednesday, just 13 days after his deposition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the healthcare giant it had discovered asbestos, a known carcinogen, in a bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder. On Friday, a day after getting the full FDA test results, J&J recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder in the United States. It marked the first time the company has recalled Baby Powder for possible asbestos contamination and the first time U.S. regulators have announced finding asbestos in the product. The recall is the latest blow to a healthcare conglomerate that has for many years tried to project an image as a caring company. It is now facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including legal action by more than 15,000 consumers claiming its talc powders caused their cancers. Shares in J&J, which in February said it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations, dropped almost 6% on Friday after the recall was announced. The inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders, according to people familiar with the matter. In the deposition, Gorsky was pressed again and again to say - without qualification - that the company’s powders were asbestos free. But in answering questions under oath for the first time in the talc litigation, he stuck to his statement that he “believed” J&J’s powders were clean. The FDA finding will make it much more difficult for Gorsky and the company to continue saying that they “believe” the talc powders are free from asbestos, said Elizabeth Burch, a product liability expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. She said the test result and recall lend credibility to what plaintiffs have been arguing in court for months. J&J stands behind the safety of its talc and said it’s investigating the FDA test result. The company said it proceeded with the recall “out of an abundance of caution.” In a statement on Sunday J&J said: “Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.” In a written response to questions from Reuters on Monday, J&J added that Gorsky had no knowledge of the FDA finding of asbestos at the time of his deposition. The company also said the FDA notified it on Sept. 20 that a test of its Baby Powder did not find any asbestos. Neither had the regulator detected asbestos during testing in 2010 using the “most sophisticated testing techniques available.” Gorsky’s testimony echoed statements he made after Reuters on Dec. 14 last year published an investigation that found J&J knew for decades asbestos lurked in its talc. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, the Reuters investigation found. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public. Jim Kramer, the lawyer who deposed Gorsky this month, said he plans to ask the New York state judge in the case to allow him to question the CEO a second time in light of the FDA’s findings and the recall. J&J declined to comment on the possibility of a second round with Kramer or about its legal strategy following the FDA test result. Gorsky faces at least one more deposition, this one ordered by a Missouri judge for Baby Powder cancer cases pending in that state. That has yet to be scheduled. In his daylong videotaped deposition, Gorsky, a former Army Ranger, recounted his efforts to stem the growing controversy over one of the company’s signature products. Sitting at the head of a conference table with the blinds drawn in the midtown Manhattan offices of a mediation firm, he testified that J&J considered dropping talc powders. “We had discussions internally along the way regarding should we leave … talc on the market or not,” Gorsky said at the deposition. In the end, however, Gorsky said the company, which also sells Baby Powder made from cornstarch, stuck with talc because it was confident about its safety and because many consumers liked its feel. “We had the right testing procedures in place and so there was … no medical reason or safety reason to withdraw it,” he testified. “There were in fact differences between cornstarch and talc-based baby powder in its feel, in its absorbency,” said Gorsky, who has been J&J’s CEO since 2012. The company “felt it was important to have different options on the market based upon different consumer needs.” The plaintiff’s lawyer pressed the 59-year-old Gorsky on his use of the word “believe” when asked about asbestos in J&J’s talc. “My follow up is,” Kramer said, “can you not answer the question as I’ve presented it with a yes or a no?” Gorsky, who said in the deposition he uses Johnson’s Baby Powder and had also used it on his son, didn’t budge. “I did not personally conduct every single test. I can only … gauge it based upon the data and totality that’s been presented to me.” In its answers to Reuters questions on Monday, the company reiterated that “Mr. Gorsky is not a scientist and did not conduct the tests. He therefore relies on others to advise him.” Before the FDA test result, Gorsky’s focus on what he “believed” to be true was helpful to J&J’s legal position, said Andrew Bradt, a Berkeley Law professor at the University of California. Many state laws require plaintiffs to prove companies knew a product was defective, and if Gorsky had unequivocally said talc does not contain asbestos then opposing lawyers could seek to undermine his declaration by contrasting it with the results of tests J&J knew about over the years suggesting otherwise. However, in light of the FDA asbestos discovery, plaintiff lawyers could now make it sound like he was being hesitant in his deposition, Bradt said. ‘MAD MONEY’ Much of the testimony centered on Gorsky’s efforts to quell public and investor concerns raised by the Dec. 14 Reuters investigation and a story published hours later in the New York Times. The Reuters report had prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from the company’s market value in one day. In the subsequent days, J&J tweeted, posted on Facebook, ran a series of full-page newspaper ads, published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a $5 billion stock buyback. In video posted in December and still featured on J&J’s website, Gorsky emphasized that regulators “have always found our talc to be asbestos free.” Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC investing show “Mad Money,” gave Gorsky the chance to present his side of the story last December, according to copies of emails shown at the deposition. Hours after the Reuters and New York Times articles were published, Cramer sent a message to Gorsky’s work email, saying: “Dear Alex, if you feel these talc stories are not truthful, I would love to know how to refute them! – all the best, Jim.” And that evening, Cramer sent a followup: “Thank you, Alex. Do not be afraid to overwhelm me. I will work all weekend to tell the truth about your great company!!! -Jim.” Gorsky appeared in person in the “Mad Money” studio the following Monday, Dec. 17. “We want to make sure that our trust and integrity that we’ve earned over the last 130 years is maintained for the next 130 years,” he told viewers. “We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,” Gorsky said on the broadcast. In an email to Reuters, Cramer said his goal “was to get Alex Gorsky on CNBC first and to ask all the toughest questions … There were no ground rules and nothing was off the table.” At the end of the Dec. 17 broadcast, there was a disclosure that Cramer’s charitable trust owned J&J shares. It still has a stake today, Cramer said. When the question of previous test results came up in the deposition, Gorsky said occasional findings of asbestos in talc haven’t held up under scrutiny. Such tests were subsequently found to be “incomplete or inaccurate,” he said. A New Jersey judge overseeing thousands of talc lawsuits consolidated in a federal court is expected to rule soon on a J&J request to disqualify expert witnesses hired by plaintiffs, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in the company’s powders. In a filing Friday, plaintiffs’ lawyers drew the judge’s attention to the FDA finding of asbestos in the bottle of Baby Powder and said they have asked J&J to turn over documents related to the FDA test results and any communications with regulators. In a brief conference call Friday with analysts and journalists, J&J officials called the FDA test results “extremely unusual,” and suggested the sample may have been contaminated by an outside source or come from a counterfeit bottle. A few hours later, the FDA shot back with a defense of its laboratory analysis, saying it wasn’t aware of “any records pointing to counterfeit Johnson’s Baby Powder in the U.S. market.” The FDA declined to provide further comment for this article."

Target has removed all bottles of the product from its stores and Target.com following the recall, a spokeswoman said in an email on Friday. CVS Health Corp said on Thursday it would remove the bottles from its online store as well, out of caution and to prevent customer confusion. The pharmacy chain said all other sizes of the talc would remain on its shelves. “It’s not important at all in terms of the dollar figure to either CVS or J&J. What it tells you is that retailers are being extra cautious with how they are dealing with J&J’s voluntary recall,” Jefferies healthcare analyst Jared Holz said. All product returned to J&J through the recall process – whether the product is from the impacted lot or not – is removed from the marketplace permanently, the company said. Rite Aid had informed its stores to pull all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson’s Baby Powder from shelves on Oct. 18 and store them in a secure location, company spokesman Chris Savarese said. “Additionally, we’ve applied a point of sale system block for this product to prevent it from being sold.” Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has also removed and blocked all potentially impacted baby powder, a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. J&J’s voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, J&J said last week. The company added that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc. Commenting on CVS’s move, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said, “It’s temporary ... They are doing it storewide because they don’t have the resources to go through at the store level and check all the SKUs (stock keeping units), check all the lot numbers.” Other retailers are also expected to remove the product from their shelves as they want to avoid liability, said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch Organization. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see Amazon and other online retailers do the same,” he added. J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year.

17.622162990719744," J&J recalls 33,000 bottles of baby powder as FDA finds asbestos in sample (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it is recalling around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online. J&J shares fell more than 6% to close at $127.70. The move marks the first time the company has recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma. The recall is the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal. A jury last week ordered the company to pay $8 billion to a plaintiff in a case claiming J&J downplayed the risks of Risperdal. That award is not expected to stand, the company and legal experts have said. J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, caused their cancer. On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Dr. Susan Nicholson, head of Women’s Health in the company’s medical safety organization, called the asbestos finding “extremely unusual,” adding that it was “inconsistent with our testing to date.” The voluntary recall announced on Friday is limited to one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said. J&J in a news release said that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc. The FDA said in a statement that the latest sampling took place during its testing for asbestos in talc-containing cosmetics that it began reporting this year. A second Johnson’s Baby Powder sample from a different lot tested negative for asbestos, the agency said. The FDA said it stands by the quality of its testing and results and recommended consumers stop using the product if it comes from the affected lot. J&J said on the conference call that it received a report from the FDA on Oct. 17 alerting the company about the asbestos finding. It said it has started an investigation and is reviewing manufacturing records and collecting data on the distribution of the lot to determine where the product was shipped. J&J added that it is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample as well as the validity of test results. The type of asbestos discovered by FDA testing has not been found in the mine where the company sources its talc, J&J’s Nicholson said. She described it as an environmental contaminant most commonly found in building materials and industrial applications. J&J said it was too early to confirm whether cross-contamination of the sample had caused a false positive, whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the it was prepared in a controlled environment. It added that it could not confirm whether the tested product was authentic or counterfeit. “It is so critical that we perform a thorough investigation of the sample to determine the source of contamination,” Nicholson said. Since 2003, talc in Johnson’s Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in much of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found. J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer. The FDA test indicated the presence of no greater than 0.00002% of chrysotile asbestos in the tested sample, J&J said. The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Thousands of the lawsuits against J&J have been consolidated before a New Jersey federal judge, who is currently weighing company motions to disqualify plaintiffs’ expert witnesses, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who has testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in J&J powders. Leigh O’Dell, one of the lead plaintiff attorneys, on Friday said the recall “vindicates the position we’ve been taking for months.” Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note that the recall could encourage additional lawsuits and prompt the company to pursue a broader settlement. Jefferies healthcare strategist Jared Holz said J&J has already lost close to $10 billion in market value due to the talc issue over the past year. He said further downside to J&J stock is likely to be limited because legal concerns over talc are well known and have already taken a toll on the share price. “This is one single bottle within one lot with barely a trace here,” he said. J&J said in February that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations. A Bloomberg report, which Reuters has confirmed, said those inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been in its statements about the safety of its powders. While talc products make up less than 1% of J&J sales expected by analysts to reach $82 billion in 2019, the New Jersey-based healthcare-products maker considers its Baby Powder to be an essential facet of a carefully tended image as a caring company."

17.622162990719744," J&J's depression drug Spravato wins European panel vote (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s nasal spray for depression won recommendation for approval from a European Medicines Agency (EMA) panel, the regulatory body said on Friday. The treatment, Spravato, which is the chemical mirror image of the often-abused anesthetic ketamine, won U.S. approval in March, making it the first new type of drug for depression in more than 30 years. However, due to the potential for abuse, Spravato was approved with a host of restrictions that included requiring the drug to be administered only in a certified medical facility. J&J has said that over 2,000 centers in the U.S. have been certified to administer Spravato, which has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential. EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) backed the drug on Friday as a combination therapy for adults with major depressive disorder who have not benefited from prior antidepressants. Major depressive disorder affects over 300 million people globally. About 30% to 40% of these patients fail to respond to first-line treatments such as antidepressants, most of which take at least four weeks to show an effect. While final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the panel’s recommendation and announces its decision within a couple of months."
10.305876750325977," Johnson & Johnson agrees to pay about $117 million to settle U.S. states' mesh probe (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay nearly $117 million to resolve allegations that it deceptively marketed transvaginal surgical mesh devices, U.S. state attorneys general said on Thursday. The settlement resolves a multistate investigation that found J&J violated consumer protection laws by misrepresenting the safety and effectiveness of its devices and failing to sufficiently disclose risks associated with their use, the attorneys general said. Thousands of women have sued the company and its Ethicon unit alleging that they were injured by its pelvic mesh devices, which are used to treat bladder issues and pelvic organ prolapse, in which organs shift from their normal positions. The settlement resolves claims with 41 states and the District of Columbia. The deal does not cover lawsuits over J&J’s mesh marketing by four states, California, West Virginia, Kentucky and Mississippi, which remain pending. A trial in California’s case concluded in September, though a decision has not yet been issued. The state of Washington settled a similar case in April for $9.9 million. J&J in a statement on Thursday said the settlement contains no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of Ethicon. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered makers of all implants to immediately stop their sale and distribution amid claims that they caused pain, perforations, urinary problems, bleeding and other serious injuries. J&J in 2012 stopped selling mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse, though it continues to market devices for use in treating incontinence. J&J shares have been under pressure this year, widely underperforming the S&P healthcare sector, as the company faces tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing and harm from side effects caused by its products, including baby powder, opioid drugs and medical devices. On Wednesday, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters the company would pay $4 billion in cash to resolve lawsuits seeking to hold it responsible for partly fueling the U.S. opioid crisis. Last week, a jury hit J&J with $8 billion in punitive damages for a case involving its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal, highlighting the risks an all-or-nothing legal strategy could have."

10.39930725962213," Missouri appeals court overturns $110 million Johnson & Johnson talc verdict NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Missouri appeals court overturned a $110 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N in a lawsuit by a Virginia woman who says she developed ovarian cancer after decades of using of its talc-based products for feminine hygiene. The ruling, which reverses a 2017 judgment in favor of the plaintiff, said that the Missouri court lacked the authority to judge the case, citing a 2017 Missouri supreme court ruling that limited out-of-state plaintiffs’ ability to sue within the state. The state supreme court ruling could help reduce J&J’s liability and the number of large trials the healthcare company faces over allegations that its talc products, including baby powder, cause cancer. “The Missouri Court of Appeals ruled correctly in overturning a $110 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson. Of the four verdicts that Johnson & Johnson has appealed to this court, all four have been reversed,” the company said in a statement. “The facts are clear - Johnson’s Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos nor does it cause cancer, as reflected in more than 40 years of scientific evidence,” the statement added. New Jersey-based J&J is facing several other lawsuits in St. Louis, including a one brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside the city that in July of 2018 produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J. The company is appealing the verdict. J&J faces around 15,500 lawsuits related to products containing talc. It is also facing lawsuits tied to its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal, pelvic meshes, and opioid drugs. The verdict that was overturned stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Lois Slemp, who claimed she developed cancer after four decades of using talc-containing products sold by J&J, including Johnson’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower powder."
11.433691157021597," Prescription drugs boost drives J&J forecasts higher, shares rise (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N raised its full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday as it reported higher third-quarter sales of psoriasis treatment Stelara and cancer drug Imbruvica while attempting to alleviate investor concerns over mounting legal challenges. Shares of the U.S. healthcare conglomerate, which also has huge medical devices and consumer products units, rose 2% to $133.70, contributing to a strong early performance on Wall Street overall on Tuesday. J&J shares have been under pressure this year, widely underperforming the S&P healthcare sector .SPXHC, as the company faces more than 13,000 lawsuits tied to antipsychotic drug Risperdal as well as a range of potentially costly lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products. J&J did not report litigation expenses for the third quarter. Its legal costs over the first nine months remained at $832 million, as was reported at the end of the second quarter. It did not respond to a Reuters request for additional details on legal costs. The company is the first major drugmaker to report quarterly earnings and its upbeat outlook and results could be a positive sign for the sector. SVB Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said the quarterly results should be viewed positively by investors, but cautioned that the ongoing litigation overhang could limit any boost share boost. The company reiterated that it does not expect last week’s outsized jury award of $8 billion in punitive damages J&J was ordered to pay a man in a Risperdal product liability case to stand. “We will appeal the amount and you can expect that to come down should precedent hold,” said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk on a conference call. Bernstein analyst Lee Hambright was encouraged by J&J reassurances on its legal strategy. “I think they are fighting from a position of strength on talc and on opioids.” “They both emphasized on the strength of their case but also projected a sense of pragmatism to settle where it’s the right thing to do for all stakeholders,” Hambright added. J&J’s pharmaceuticals business has in recent years cushioned the impact of relatively slow growth in its medical device and consumer units. Much of the growth has come from newer treatments such as Stelara, which reported near 30% growth in sales to about $1.7 billion. Sales leukemia treatment Imbruvica rose about 31% to $921 million in the quarter. The company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range $8.62 to $8.67, up from its prior forecast of $8.53 to $8.63. Analysts were expecting $8.60 per share. Excluding items, the company earned $2.12 per share, beating analysts’ average expectations by 11 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total sales rose 1.9% to $20.73 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $20.07 billion. Pharmaceutical unit sales rose 5.1% to $10.88 billion, above analysts estimates of $10.28 billion."

JPMorgan Chase & Co gained 1.9% after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit by a wide margin, underpinned by strength in bond trading, underwriting and home lending revenue. But Goldman Sachs slipped 0.9% as it reported a 27% slump in quarterly profit, hit by lower fees from advising on deals and weakness in underwriting. Collectively, banks are expected to report a 1.2% decline in earnings, their first year-on-year drop in three, due in part to low interest rates and trade tensions. Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also due to report on Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley later this week. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc and Johnson & Johnson rose 2.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The healthcare companies reported strong quarterly results and raised their full-year profit forecasts. The earnings reports will indicate the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war on U.S. companies. The tit-for-tat tariff moves have already hit domestic manufacturing, dented business sentiment and rankled financial markets. S&P 500 companies were set to report their weakest quarterly performance in about three years for the September quarter, with industrial companies among those most at risk from the trade dispute.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes, which gained nearly 2% last month, are off about 0.4% in October. The benchmark index is now more than 2% away from its record high after coming within striking distance in September. At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 102 points, or 0.38%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.34% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 24.25 points, or 0.31%.

13.293060635126185," Massive jury award against J&J highlights risks of its legal strategy (Reuters) - A jury award that hit Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N with $8 billion in punitive damages for a case involving its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal highlights the risks of the drugmaker's all-or-nothing legal strategy, several legal experts told Reuters on Wednesday. The jury in a Philadelphia court awarded the $8 billion to a man who previously won $680,000 over his claims that it failed to warn that young men using Risperdal could grow breasts. J&J called the sum “grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award” and said it was confident it would be overturned. Legal experts agreed that the penalty was likely to be slashed. But the verdict, which helped drive J&J’s shares down 2% on Wednesday, is an example of how public outrage at the pharmaceutical industry for high drug prices has contributed to harsher verdicts against drugmakers accused of wrongdoing in recent years, legal experts said. Outsized penalties awarded by some juries highlight risks in a longstanding strategy by drugmakers such as J&J of taking their chances at trial rather then settle product liability lawsuits brought by patients. “Every pharmaceutical company needs to seriously consider if they want to litigate to verdict in the present environment, but with the settlement demands so incredibly high it’s not always clear what their alternative is,” said Barry Thompson, a partner at Baker McKenzie law firm who was not involved in the case. Drugmakers often prefer to litigate rather than settle in hopes of protecting their brands and discouraging future patient lawsuits, Thompson said. Companies also may use a series of early trial verdicts to gauge the size of any settlement it might eventually offer, as Merck & Co MRK.N did with its withdrawn Vioxx arthritis pain drug when facing thousands of lawsuits by patients who claimed harm from the drug. A 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision suggests that the upper limit of a fair punitive penalty in the Risperdal case would be about $6 million based on the earlier compensatory award. J&J could still get a favorable ruling on appeal that would give the company leverage in dealing with the remaining cases, said Benjamin McMichael, a professor at the Alabama School of Law who has researched punitive damage awards. “With such a large punitive damages award at issue, appellate courts may be more willing to come down hard on the plaintiffs,” McMichael said. J&J faces more than 13,000 lawsuits tied to Risperdal alleging that it caused a condition called gynecomastia in boys, in which breast tissue becomes enlarged. The company is also facing lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products. “We’re operating within a very litigious environment, and we must at times be willing to go to trial when the science, facts and law are on our side,” J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in an email. “We also have to remain open to resolving cases through settlement when and where that’s appropriate to do. We have a proven track record of being able to successfully and appropriately manage this balance,” Knewitz added. The company has had its share of legal wins, losses and settlements. An Oklahoma judge in August ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to that state for its part in fueling the opioid crisis by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, although the sum was substantially less than investors had expected. Johnson & Johnson has said it plans to appeal the ruling. Earlier this month, the company agreed to pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, avoiding a federal opioid trial. In 2013, J&J paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs."
13.293060635126185," Johnson & Johnson hit as jury awards ""excessive"" $8 bln in damages Oct 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Johnson & Johnson dipped 2% on Wednesday after a jury awarded $8 billion in punitive damages to a man who accused the drugmaker of failing to warn that young men using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts. Analysts called the amount excessive, particularly since the plaintiff, Nicholas Murray, had already won $680,000 in compensatory damages over his claims. But several said that J&J’s shares were now exposed to fears among investors that it would be hammered by further litigation costs as it battles other claims over Risperdal, its opioid treatments and talcum powder. “It’s definitely a disproportionate award,” Bernstein analyst Lee Hambright said, noting that the FDA-approved label for the drug does mention breast growth as a side effect. “(But) I think the stock reaction shows how sensitive investors are about litigation-related concerns for Johnson & Johnson.” Wells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen said the $8 billion figure will “almost certainly be reduced”. “The Supreme Court has said it should be a single digit ratio between compensatory and punitive damages,” he said. “The important number here is the compensatory damages.” J&J said the award was “grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award” and said it was confident it would be overturned. The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas verdict was the first in which a Pennsylvania jury had been able to consider awarding punitive damages in one of thousands of Risperdal cases pending in the state. In 2013, Johnson & Johnson paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs. According to a recent filing, the company faces some 13,400 lawsuits tied to Risperdal, which allege the drug caused a condition called gynecomastia in boys, in which breast tissue becomes enlarged. Risperdal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 to treat schizophrenia, but was not cleared for use in children until 2006. While the drug’s label does note that gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of Risperdal-treated patients in clinical trials involving 1885 children and adolescents, the lawsuits generally claim the company understated the risk. Johnson & Johnson is also among drugmakers named in lawsuits seeking to hold the pharmaceutical industry responsible for the nation’s opioid crisis and in August was asked to pay $572.1 million to the state of Oklahoma for its role in fueling the epidemic.

13.293060635126185," Jury says J&J must pay $8 billion in case over male breast growth linked to Risperdal NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson must pay $8 billion in punitive damages to a man who previously won $680,000 over his claims that it failed to warn that young men using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts, a Philadelphia jury said on Tuesday. The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas jury’s verdict in favor of Nicholas Murray came in the first case in which a Pennsylvania jury had been able to consider awarding punitive damages in one of thousands of Risperdal cases pending in the state. “This jury, as have other juries in other litigations, once again imposed punitive damages on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients,” Murray’s lawyers, Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, said in a joint statement. “Johnson & Johnson and (subsidiary) Janssen chose billions over children.” J&J said the award was “grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the company is confident it will be overturned.” It added that the jury in the case had not been allowed to hear evidence of Risperdal’s benefits. Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said he expects the punitive damages to be lowered on appeal, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision which found that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.” Tobias said the verdict was about sending a message. “A jury, if it’s outrageous enough conduct, will award a big number and let the lawyers and judges work it out,” he said. Tobias added that the verdict could be a sign that J&J will face more large damages awards in other Risperdal cases. “The kind of evidence in this trial may persuade another jury or judge to do something similar,” he said. Murray, like other male plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation over Risperdal, alleges that he developed breasts after being prescribed the medicine when he was a minor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in late 1993 for treating schizophrenia and episodes of bipolar mania in adults. Plaintiffs claim that J&J failed to warn of the risk of gynecomastia, the development of enlarged breasts in males, associated with Risperdal, which they say the company marketed for unapproved uses with children. In his lawsuit, Murray, now 26, alleged that he developed breasts after his doctors began prescribing him Risperdal off-label in 2003 after a psychologist diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines as they see fit, while companies are only allowed to promote their drugs for approved uses. A jury in 2015 awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding J&J was negligent in failing to warn of the risk of gynecomastia. A state appeals court upheld the verdict in February 2018 but reduced it to $680,000. Plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey, which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J’s home state, should be applied globally to the cases. But a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff’s state should instead apply."

11.349486363592495," Johnson & Johnson settles Ohio lawsuits to avoid federal trial (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday it will pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, allowing the U.S. healthcare giant to avoid an upcoming federal trial seeking to hold the industry responsible for the nation’s opioid epidemic. J&J became the fourth drugmaker to settle claims ahead of the Federal Court trial against multiple manufacturers and distributors in Cleveland scheduled for later this month. The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally. “The settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation’s opioid crisis,” J&J said in a statement. “The company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,” it added. Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. J&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability. The company will pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4 million to non-profit organizations that run opioid-related programs in the counties. Mallinckrodt Plc finalized a $24 million settlement with the same two counties on Monday. Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial.

7.278446243181735," Bayer hires former J&J executive for more pharma deals FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer BAYGn.DE said it hired Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N executive Marianne De Backer to manage acquisitions and licensing deals at its drugs unit, as the German drugmaker turns to outside sources to boost its development pipeline. De Backer will take the role of Head of Business Development & Licensing at Bayer’s pharmaceuticals division, joining from rival J&J, where she lead business development activities across different therapeutic areas and regions. Based in Berkeley, California, the Belgian national will have a more senior role than her predecessor, reporting directly to the head of pharmaceuticals, Stefan Oelrich, and taking a seat on the division’s Executive Committee. Bayer said last year it would lean more strongly on external firms and institutions for a better drug development pipeline, which most analysts regard as too thin to make up for an expected decline in revenues from its two pharma bestsellers from about 2024. Bayer has recently agreed deals to sell a stake in a chemical park operator, consumer health brands Dr. Scholl’s and Coppertone, as well as its animal health unit in a bid to reduce the debt burden from its $63 billion takeover of Monsanto."

U.S, stocks initially opened higher, building on Monday’s advance, as U.S. President Donald Trump predicted another round of talks with Beijing. China’s foreign ministry, however, reiterated on Tuesday that it had not received any recent U.S. telephone call on trade. Further weighing on sentiment was a deepening of the inversion in the yield curve between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasuries, underscoring worries about a weakening global economy. “The progression of trade talks seem to occur very much in real time and it is the primary influence around what it is driving the capital markets at this point,” said Bill Northey at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. “You have this degree of uncertainty and what has seemed to be a period of heightened uncertainty, that certainly does impact confidence and confidence does drive behaviors like spending and investing, which ultimately manifest in economic activity.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.15 points, or 0.36%, to 25,804.68, the S&P 500 lost 8.7 points, or 0.30%, to 2,869.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.57 points, or 0.41%, to 7,821.16. Financial shares, which tend to weaken in lower rate and soft economic environments, lost 0.84%, while defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate led advancing sectors. The S&P 500 has lost nearly 4% in August on worries the impact of the intensifying U.S.-China trade war will have on the slowing global economy and corporate profits, along with uncertainty around the pace of U.S. interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. With the next Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for mid-September, investors are gauging the strength of the U.S. economy for clues on where rates are headed. They will have data on the labor market and manufacturing next week to consider before the policy announcement.

U.S. stocks were up strongly earlier in the session, building on gains from Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ease tensions by predicting another round of talks with Beijing. China’s foreign ministry, however, reiterated on Tuesday that it had not received any recent telephone call from the United States on trade. Investor sentiment soured after the inversion in U.S. Treasury yield curve deepened further and the benchmark 10-year yields slipped, underscoring safe-haven demand and worries about a softening global economy. “There’s a lot of concern about what’s going on here and as much as the investors try and ignore it and accept the idea that the economy remains strong, the doubts seem to creep into this market,” said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments. “People are still concerned about the trade war with China and the inconsistencies in a lot of the administration’s comments.” The interest-rate sensitive financials sector slid 0.47%, weighing the most among all major S&P 500 sectors. An escalation in the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing has hit financial markets in the recent days after both sides threatened to slap tariffs on each other’s goods worth billions of dollars.

6.991968313478303," J&J liable for $572 million in Oklahoma opioid epidemic trial; shares rise NORMAN, Okla./BOSTON (Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, a sum that was substantially less than investors had expected, driving up J&J's shares. The state’s attorney general had filed the lawsuit, seeking $17 billion to address the impact of the drug crisis on Oklahoma. It had been considered a bellwether for other litigation nationwide over the opioid epidemic. “The expectation was this was going to be a $1.5 billion to $2 billion fine,” said Jared Holz, healthcare strategist for Jefferies & Co. “$572 million is a much lower number than had been feared.” J&J said it would appeal the decision. Shares of J&J were up 2% in extended trading following the decision, after an initial gain of more than 5%. Other drugmakers that sell opioid painkillers and are defending against similar lawsuits also rose after-hours, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA up 2.6%, and Endo International Plc ENDP.O, up 1.4% higher. Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2000, some 6,000 Oklahomans have died from opioid overdoses, according to the state’s lawyers. Roughly 2,500 lawsuits have been brought by states, counties and municipalities nationally seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for opioid abuse nationwide. Oklahoma’s case was the first to go to trial. Some drugmakers have chosen to settle cases. In holding J&J liable after a seven-week, non-jury trial, Judge Thad Balkman of Cleveland County District Court in Norman, Oklahoma, said the state proved that J&J’s misleading marketing and promotion of its Duragesic and Nucynta painkillers created a public nuisance. “The opioid crisis is an imminent danger and menace to Oklahomans,” Balkman said. Oklahoma wanted J&J to help it address the epidemic for the next 30 years by funding addiction treatment and prevention programs. Balkman said in his written ruling that the award covered only one year of addressing the crisis because Oklahoma did not demonstrate the time and costs needed beyond that. Lance Lang, a 36-year-old recovering user of opioids turned activist in Oklahoma City, said it was “short sighted” for the judge to have only ordered funding for a year. “There’s going to be people struggling with this for years,” he said in an interview. J&J said it will ask that the award be put on hold during an appeal process that could stretch into 2021. The company also said Oklahoma failed to show that its products and activities had created a public nuisance. “You can’t sue your way out of the opioid abuse crisis,” Sabrina Strong, a lawyer for J&J, said at a news conference after the verdict. “Everyone must come together to address this. But J&J did not cause the opioid crisis.” “ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS AND ADDICTIONS” The case was brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who alleged that J&J’s marketing practices helped fuel the opioid epidemic by flooding the market with painkillers. “Johnson & Johnson will finally be held accountable for thousands of deaths and addictions caused by their actions,” Hunter said. The trial came after Oklahoma had resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and Teva in May for $85 million, leaving J&J as the lone defendant. The verdict came as two Ohio counties prepare for a scheduled October trial before a federal judge in Cleveland. About 2,000 lawsuits out of some 2,500 filed nationwide are consolidated in the case in Cleveland. Endo International Plc ENDP.O and Allergan Plc AGN.N last week agreed to pay $15 million to avoid going to trial in October in a case by two Ohio counties, subject to court approval. Some plaintiffs’ lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998. Joe Rice, a lead plaintiff’s attorney for municipalities in the federal litigation, said if the Oklahoma award were extrapolated to other states, it could mean an annual abatement cost of around $38 billion. “It does indicate that if I’m in the pharmaceutical business, I’ve got to think long and hard about annual payments of my share of that,” he said. The judge overseeing the federal litigation in Ohio has been pushing for a global settlement. J&J, which is among multiple pharmaceutical companies that are defendants in the federal litigation, said it remains “open to viable options” to resolve the Ohio case, including through settlement. During the Oklahoma trial, lawyers for the state argued that J&J carried out a years-long marketing campaign that minimized the painkillers’ addiction risks and promoted their benefits. The lawyers called J&J an opioid “kingpin” and argued that its marketing created a public nuisance as doctors over-prescribed the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths. J&J countered that its marketing claims had scientific support and its painkillers accounted for a tiny fraction of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. The company said in a statement that since 2008, its painkillers accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. market, including generics. Teva said the ruling supported its rationale for settling the case before trial, and said it was preparing to defend itself in the upcoming trial in Ohio. Purdue, which is also among the defendants in the Ohio litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

After hearing seven weeks of evidence, Judge Thad Balkman in Norman, Oklahoma, is due on Monday to decide whether to hold J&J liable for creating a public nuisance in the state and whether it should be forced to pay $17 billion to redress it.

0.8957127037873495," GSK ends development of Ebola vaccine, hands work to U.S. institute LONDON (Reuters) - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L is giving up its work on developing three potential vaccines against the deadly Ebola and Marburg viruses, despite an ongoing Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo. While Ebola is a deadly and contagious disease, it is also still relatively rare, making the potential market for a vaccine sporadic and very likely unprofitable. This poses a dilemma for drug companies: With no real prospect of a financial return, can they justify the investment in expensive development and trials. GSK’s vaccine candidates - two designed to protect against Ebola and one against the Marburg virus - will be transferred to the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C., the British drugmaker said in a statement. There is no financial element to the agreement, a spokesman said. The transfer agreement will see Sabin continue to develop the candidate vaccines, one of which - a potential Ebola shot known as ChAd3 - has been through mid-stage, Phase II, trials in Africa and could possibly be used to halt or limit future Ebola epidemics. “Enabling Sabin to build on the scientific progress GSK has delivered up to Phase II increases the likelihood these candidate vaccines may help prevent potential future outbreaks,” Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines, said in a statement. GSK had put its Ebola vaccine work on hold after it was unable to progress the product through final stage, or Phase III, clinical trials toward the end of the 2014-16 epidemic, due to a dwindling number of Ebola cases. U.S. drugmakers Merck MRK.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N are also developing potential vaccines against Ebola, and have made more progress with them than GSK had in clinical trials. The Merck shot, known as VSV EBOV, is currently being used in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, which was last month declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease has killed more than 1,800 people in the Congo outbreak which began a year ago and has become the second-worst on record. GSK said Sabin had agreed a collaboration deal with the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to further develop the vaccine candidates. The ChAd3 shot was originally developed by NIAID in collaboration with the Swiss-based firm Okairos, which was bought by GSK in 2013. All three experimental vaccines have shown promise in safety trials after being administered to more than 5,000 adults and 600 children, GSK said."
1.453000594492667," Oklahoma makes final bid to hold J&J responsible for opioid epidemic (Reuters) - Oklahoma’s attorney general on Wednesday made his final bid to force Johnson & Johnson to pay $17 billion for its part in fueling the opioid epidemic, saying the drugmaker’s “egregious” marketing caused an oversupply of addictive drugs and overdose deaths. Attorney General Mike Hunter in a brief filed in a state court in Norman, Oklahoma, argued that evidence presented during the first trial nationally in litigation over the epidemic showed J&J was “at the root of this crisis.” The state’s lawyers said evidence presented during the seven-week trial that began in May showed J&J’s decades-long marketing campaign convinced doctors and the public that opioids could be a “go-to, first-line treatment for everything from headaches to sprained ankles.” They said J&J and its subsidiaries “abandoned all standards of responsible conduct in their blind resolve to make money from their drugs,” creating a public nuisance in the form of an opioid crisis that since 2000 has killed 6,000 Oklahomans. Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. J&J countered in its own brief that while opioid abuse is a real problem, its painkillers, Duragesic and Nucynta, were a tiny fraction of all opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. It also said its marketing claims had scientific support. New Jersey-based J&J’s lawyers also wrote that the state’s case rested on “radical theories” unmoored from more than a century of court cases interpreting the state’s public nuisance law, which it said only applies to property disputes. But the state’s lawyers said applying the state’s public nuisance statute to the epidemic was not an unprecedented expansion of the law. “While this opioid crisis is unprecedented, this exercise of the State’s power is not,” the state’s lawyers wrote. The briefs marked the final arguments both sides would make to Judge Thad Balkman, who is expected to rule next month. The case is one of around 2,000 lawsuits filed nationally by states, counties and cities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the opioid epidemic. The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly in 1,900 cases pending before a federal judge in Ohio who has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd were originally also defendants in the case. Purdue reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma in March and Teva settled for $85 million in May. Both deny wrongdoing.

1.3290660719416278," J&J says FTC probing efforts to protect arthritis drug Remicade WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission issued civil subpoenas to Johnson and Johnson in June as part of an investigation into whether contracting practices for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, violated antitrust laws, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. Shares of the company traded marginally down at $132.47, after having closed up 1.7% on Monday. (bit.ly/2ZkZGze) J&J said that the FTC had issued a “civil investigative demand,” or CID, the equivalent of a subpoena to determine if the contracting practices were legal. Pfizer Inc filed a lawsuit against J&J in 2017, saying its rival’s contracts with health insurers for blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, were anticompetitive and aimed at blocking sales of Pfizer’s biosimilar called Inflectra. Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J had contracted with many insurers to give discounts in exchange for giving preference to Remicade, and to only pay for Inflectra in cases where Remicade proved to be ineffective. Inflectra was approved in 2016 while Remicade went on the market in 1998. Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the lawsuit. J&J has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting the Pfizer lawsuit. Pfizer said in a statement that it had received a CID in June. “As Pfizer’s complaint alleges, J&J’s unlawful conduct is designed to prevent Inflectra from being able to compete on its primary point of differentiation – price. Today, Inflectra has an average selling price (ASP) that is more than 22% lower than Remicade,” the company said in a statement. “Despite these facts, J&J has not lost substantial volume or share of sales – counter to what should occur in a competitive market.” Biosimilars are intended to be lower-cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But since they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be. The drugs treat ailments like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis."
2.779531869283049," J&J warns of hit from generic drugs in third quarter, shares fall (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N on Tuesday boosted its 2019 sales forecast amid robust demand for its cancer drugs, but warned that competition from generic and copycat drugs could impact its third-quarter results, sending shares down 1.4% in noon trading. While J&J’s pharmaceuticals unit has in recent years cushioned the impact of relatively slow growth in the company’s medical device and consumer units, some of its older drugs have been hurt by competition from cheaper copies. “We expect the largest impacts from generics and biosimilars for the year in our pharmaceutical business to occur in the third quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said on a conference call. Once a drug begins facing competition from multiple generic versions, it can quickly lose more than 80% of sales. Sales of prostate cancer treatment Zytiga fell 23% in the quarter, hurt by generic copies, and sales of J&J’s blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade fell 16%, impacted by biosimilar rivals. Also weighing on the stock was the company’s decision to not raise its full-year earnings forecast, even as sales across all its business units largely beat analysts’ estimates. “We expect questions on the maintained earnings per share guidance but we point to the continued-to-be-improving strength across its franchises despite pharma headwinds,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch. Pharmaceutical sales in the quarter rose 1.7% to $10.53 billion, above analysts’ estimates of $10.27 billion, according to three analysts polled by Refinitiv. (For a graphic on 'J&J's newer drugs fuel pharmaceuticals unit sales' click tmsnrt.rs/2kbwYl2) The company raised its 2019 forecast for operational sales, which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, to a range of $82.4 billion to $83.2 billion, from a prior range of $82 billion to $82.8 billion.

-0.6492305216112686," Opioid 'kingpin' J&J fueled epidemic, Oklahoma argues at trial's end NORMAN, Okla. (Reuters) - Lawyers for the state of Oklahoma on Monday compared Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to a drug cartel leader as they sought to hold the drugmaker responsible for fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic in the first trial to result from lawsuits over the crisis. Lawyers for the state, including Attorney General Mike Hunter, told a judge in Norman, Oklahoma that J&J’s “greed” led the drugmaker to carry out a years-long marketing effort that caused “utter confusion” about the addictive painkillers’ risks. Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for the state, said J&J knew opioids were harmful, yet minimized the risk of addiction in their marketing, resulting in a surge in overdose deaths as doctors overprescribed the drugs and they flooded the state. “They didn’t get here from a Mexican cartel,” Beckworth said. “They got here from the pharmaceutical cartel, and the kingpin of them all is Johnson & Johnson.” The state urged Judge Thad Balkman, who presided over the nonjury trial for six weeks, to find J&J liable for creating a public nuisance and force it to pay up to $17 billion over 30 years to address the epidemic. Larry Ottaway, J&J’s attorney, countered its products, which had included the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, were minimally used in Oklahoma and that trial testimony showed doctors were not misled about the drugs’ risks before prescribing them. He said New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J strictly adhered to regulations governing opioids, which served a legitimate purpose, and called Oklahoma’s multi-billion dollar demand “untenable.” “Only a company that believes its innocence would come in and defend itself against a state, but we take the challenge on because we believe we are right,” Ottaway said in his closing argument. Balkman said he would rule after receiving briefs from both sides, due July 31. The case is one of around 2,000 actions by state and local governments accusing drug manufacturers of contributing to the opioid epidemic. Opioids were linked to a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Lawyers for Attorney General Mike Hunter and J&J are set to deliver closing arguments in state court in Norman, Oklahoma following six weeks of testimony from current and former J&J executives and victims of the epidemic. The case is one of more than 2,000 actions by state and local governments accusing drug manufacturers of contributing to an epidemic linked to a record 47,600 opioid overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly in 1,900 cases pending in Ohio brought largely by cities and counties against J&J and other companies. The federal judge overseeing that litigation has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial. Oklahoma says that starting in the 1990s, New Jersey-based J&J used misleading marketing to push doctors to prescribe more opioids. The state claims that J&J, which sold the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, marketed the opioids as “safe and effective for everyday pain” and downplayed their addictive qualities. The state has accused J&J of acting as the “kingpin” behind the epidemic and says it was motivated to boost prescriptions not only because it sold painkillers but because it also grew and imported raw materials opioid manufacturers like OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP used. J&J denies the allegations. Its lawyers have argued that its products made up a small share of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma and carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks. The company says the state lacks evidence linking J&J’s marketing to doctors writing unwarranted opioid prescriptions or that it caused the epidemic. The company also has said that the state is seeking to stretch the bounds of a public nuisance statute in order to force J&J to pay up to $17.5 billion to remedy the crisis.

-1.3202366489146375," J&J, pension funds file tag-team dismissal motions in shareholder arbitration case (Reuters) - Groundbreaking litigation can make for strange alliances. The latest example of that truism came Friday in litigation in federal court in Trenton, where a trust led by retired Harvard law professor Hal Scott is trying to establish for the first time that corporate bylaws can impose mandatory arbitration on shareholders. The litigation, as I’ve told you before, has been counterintuitive from its beginning in March. Scott’s trust is a shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, yet the trust is suing to force J&J to allow it to propose a mandatory arbitration provision to cut off all shareholders’ rights to sue for securities law violations. J&J, meanwhile, contends that mandatory shareholder arbitration is illegal under state and federal law so it has assumed the weird posture of defending shareholders’ right to file securities class actions. Noting that anomaly, two big state pension funds, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the Colorado Public Employees’ Retirement Association, moved last month to intervene in the litigation to assure that U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp of Trenton isn’t depending on J&J alone to represent shareholders’ interests. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. On Friday, Johnson & Johnson and the pension funds filed separate motions to dismiss the suit by Scott’s client, the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust. The two briefs assert overlapping but not identical arguments for why Judge Shipp should end the case now. Judge Shipp has not yet ruled on the funds’ motion to intervene, which may still be opposed by the trust. But the dismissal briefs show, if nothing else, that the pension funds, which own a combined 10 millions shares of J&J, deserve to be heard in a critical test of their right to sue for securities violations. Harvard professor Scott said in an email that he is not commenting on the litigation. The crux of arguments by both J&J and the pension funds is that corporate bylaws govern only a corporation’s internal affairs and cannot be used to restrict shareholders’ external rights under federal securities laws. Both briefs reminded Judge Shipp that the Attorney General of New Jersey, where J&J is headquartered, already made that very point to the Securities and Exchange Commission last January, when the SEC was weighing J&J’s request for permission to exclude the Behr trust’s mandatory arbitration proposal from the proxy materials sent to J&J shareholders. The New Jersey AG, as the briefs explained, sent the SEC a letter opining that the proposal would be illegal under New Jersey’s corporate law because corporate bylaws cover only internal corporate affairs. The state AG, Gurbir Grewal, cited, among other precedent, a December 2018 opinion from Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery court in Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, which examined the distinction between internal corporate affairs governed by bylaws and external affairs outside of their case in a case challenging the legality of forum selection clauses. The SEC considered the New Jersey AG’s opinion sufficiently weighty to make it the basis of the commission’s decision in February to bless J&J’s exclusion of the trust’s mandatory arbitration proposal. The company and the pension fund argued in Friday’s filing that there’s no doubt AG Grewal correctly interpreted the scope of corporate bylaws, citing case law and commentary dating all the back to Sir William Blackstone. “Bylaws are expressly limited to those matters that relate to a … corporation’s internal affairs, or those affairs relating to the rights and duties of the corporation, its officers and directors and its shareholders,” wrote J&J’s lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. Moreover, both briefs pointed out, when New Jersey’s legislature recently amended state corporate law to allow corporations to amend their bylaws to select a forum for certain internal affairs suits by shareholders, lawmakers left federal securities litigation off of the list. The trust, represented by Walter Zimolong of the Zimolong firm, has argued that under U.S. Supreme Court precedent on the Federal Arbitration Act, most recently in 2018’s Epic Systems v. Lewis, the FAA preempts state laws barring arbitration. Both the J&J and pension fund briefs refuted that assertion. I’m summarizing nuanced and multifaceted arguments, but, in essence, the briefs contend that the FAA preempts only state laws that disfavor arbitration provisions. Because New Jersey corporate law applies generally and doesn’t even mention arbitration, state law does not disfavor arbitration and therefore, according to J&J and the pension funds, is not preempted by the FAA. The company and the pension funds also argued that corporate bylaws are not a contract between a company and its shareholders – but the contention received considerably more weight in the funds’ brief than in the company’s. I mentioned above that the dismissal briefs underscore the importance of giving the pension funds a say in litigation that could have deep repercussions for shareholders’ rights. The funds’ analysis of whether bylaws should be considered an enforceable contract shows why. The funds’ lawyers from Gupta Wessler, Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman acknowledged that courts have construed bylaws to imply shareholder assent to their terms, notably in 2013’s Boilermakers v. Chevron, in which Delaware Chancery Court okayed forum selection clauses for shareholder litigation against corporate board members. Such decisions have been based on the premise that when shareholders buy stock, they’re on notice that the company’s board has unilateral power to change the bylaws, and that those bylaws are binding. But that precedent, according to the pension funds, has looked at the compact between shareholders and corporations as a matter of corporate law – not contract law. As the Supreme Court has interpreted the FAA, arbitration provisions are governed by contract, which means, according to the pension funds, that both companies and shareholders must agree to mandatory arbitration. Under that reasoning, the funds said, shareholder arbitration cannot be imposed by a unilateral corporate bylaw. Shareholder might not even know if a corporation decides to amend its bylaws to impose arbitration of securities claims. “This falls well short of the consent required to manifest agreement to an arbitration agreement,” the pension funds said. In the J&J case, of course, the Behr trust isn’t asking for J&J unilaterally to change its bylaws to impose arbitration but for the company to allow shareholders to vote on the trusts’ proposal to mandate arbitration. In fact, as I’ve explained, J&J explicitly opposes changing its bylaws, arguing that it would be illegal for the company to require shareholders to arbitrate. But the pension funds have an interest beyond the J&J case in establishing principles that will shut down shareholder arbitration proposals by companies that, unlike J&J, want to preclude securities class actions. J&J doesn’t have to worry that some other corporation might try to impose mandatory shareholder arbitration by changing its bylaws. CalPERS and the Colorado pension fund do. It’s going to be interesting to see how the Behr trust responds to the tag-team attack on its pro-arbitration arguments. Its brief is due on June 28."
-1.6211411864236476," J&J's greed helped fuel U.S. opioid crisis, Oklahoma claims at trial NORMAN, Okla. (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s greed led the drugmaker to use deceptive marketing to create an oversupply of painkillers that fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic, the state of Oklahoma alleged at the start of the first trial to result from lawsuits over the drug crisis. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who filed the multibillion-dollar case, argued in a state court in the city of Norman that J&J should be forced to pay for helping cause the “worst manmade public health crisis in our state’s history.” His case is the first to reach trial from around 2,000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for a drug epidemic the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says led to a record 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017. The non-jury trial came after Oklahoma resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Sunday for $85 million, leaving only J&J as a defendant. Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for the state, told Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman that New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, along with Purdue and Teva, used misleading marketing beginning in the 1990s to push doctors to prescribe more opioids. Beckworth said J&J, which sold the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, marketed the opioids as “safe and effective for everyday pain” while downplaying their addictive qualities, helping create a drug oversupply. He said J&J was motivated to boost prescriptions not only because it sold opioid painkillers, but because it also grew and imported raw materials opioid manufacturers like Purdue used. “If you have an oversupply, people will die,” Beckworth said. J&J lawyer Larry Ottway countered that its products made up a small share of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma and carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks. “You have to examine the details because facts are stubborn things,” he said. He also argued Oklahoma was seeking to “stretch” the bounds of a public nuisance statute in order to force it to pay up to $17.5 billion to help the state address the epidemic for the next 30 years. The case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly the 1,850 cases consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial. Some plaintiffs’ lawyers have compared the cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.

-4.711874283252113," Teva Pharm to pay Oklahoma $85 million to settle opioid claims BOSTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said on Sunday it had agreed to pay an $85 million settlement with the state of Oklahoma days before the company was set to face trial over allegations that it and other drugmakers helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic. Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, said the settlement “does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company” and denied contributing to opioid abuse in Oklahoma. Claims against Teva focused on the branded opioid products Actiq and Fentora as well as generic painkillers it produced. The trial against Israel-based Teva, along with Johnson & Johnson, was set to begin on Tuesday. The lawsuit alleged the companies’ marketing of the painkiller was to blame for the opioid epidemic. In a statement, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a J&J subsidiary, said it had acted responsibly and was ready for trial. It said it disagreed with what it called Oklahoma’s “overly expansive theories” of public nuisance law, and said they should not apply in this situation. “At the same time, as with all litigation, if an appropriate resolution is possible that avoids the expense and uncertainty of a trial, we are always open to that option,” the company said in a statement. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter has alleged that J&J and Teva, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, carried out deceptive marking campaigns that downplayed opioids’ addictive risks while overstating their benefits. The state also alleges the companies’ actions created an oversupply of painkillers and a public nuisance that will cost $12.7 billion to $17.5 billion to remedy. Oklahoma resolved its claims against Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million. The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid cases, particularly some 1,850 mostly municipal and state governments that have sued the same drugmakers in the federal court in Ohio. “Teva is pleased to put the Oklahoma case behind it and remains prepared to vigorously defend claims against the company, including the upcoming federal court trial in Cleveland where the majority of the cases are pending,” the company said. Attorney General Hunter’s office said in a statement the money would be used to address the opioid crisis in Oklahoma and that the J&J case is still scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday before Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman. “Nearly all Oklahomans have been negatively impacted by this deadly crisis and we look forward to Tuesday, where we will prove our case against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries,” Hunter said in a statement."

-3.8037097469773324," Modi’s jobs deficit: J&J’s largest India plant idle three years after completion PENJERLA/NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - It was supposed to be Johnson & Johnson’s biggest manufacturing plant in India. It was to eventually employ at least 1,500 people and help bring development to a rural area near Hyderabad in southern India. Yet, three years after the U.S. healthcare company completed construction of production facilities for cosmetics and baby products on the 47-acre site, they stand idle. Two sources familiar with J&J’s operations in India and one state government official told Reuters production at the plant, at Penjerla in Telangana state, never began because of a slowing in the growth in demand for the products. One of them said that demand didn’t rise as expected because of two shock policy moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a late 2016 ban on then circulating high-value currency notes, and the nationwide introduction of a goods and services tax (GST) in 2017. J&J spokespeople in its Mumbai operations in India and at its global headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, declined to respond to a list of questions from Reuters. Modi’s office did not respond to a call and an email with questions. Aimed at rooting out corruption and streamlining the tax system, the double whammy of ‘demonetization’ and GST – were two of Modi’s signature policy moves. But instead of encouraging economic activity as intended, they did the opposite, at least in 2016-2018, by sapping consumer demand, according to some economists. Many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, complained publicly – some in their financial statements - that they suffered a drop off in orders. The suspended J&J project stands as one of the most vivid examples of the impact on the broader investment picture. In the first month after demonetization, some business surveys showed that sales of products such as shampoos and soap fell more than 20 percent. Lack of jobs growth and a farm-income crisis because of low crop prices have hurt Modi in the current general election, according to several political strategists. Still, Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are expected by many of the strategists to be in a position to get a second term – probably with support of some other parties - when votes are counted on Thursday, partly because of his strong stance on national security issues. A range of Modi’s business policies, such as capping prices of medical devices, forcing tech companies to store more data locally and stricter e-commerce regulations have in the past two years hurt plans of American multinationals such as J&J, Mastercard, Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart. The groundbreaking of the J&J facility in Penjerla, its third in the country, was carried out with much fanfare in 2014, attended by Telangana state’s Chief Minister Chandrashekar Rao, who hailed the foreign investment as a big win for local communities. A document dated April 2017 that lists products the company planned to make at the facility, submitted to the Telangana government and reviewed by Reuters, names baby oil, baby shampoo, baby lotion, baby hair oil, face wash and creams. Shaukat Ali, running a tea shop under a bamboo stall on barren land outside the plant, said local workers check in routinely for possible vacancies at the J&J site, but nothing has come up in years. At the local pollution control board office, the member secretary Satyanarayana Reddy said the J&J plant had all the required approvals and he was not sure why it hadn’t started production. “It is unusual for such a big plant to stay idle for so long,” he said. “But there is no problem from our side.” Chandrasekhar Babu, an additional director at the Telangana industries department, said a J&J company official told him the plant hadn’t started due to lack of demand. GST and demonetization were two key reasons the plan didn’t kick off, one of the sources said, adding that lack of consumer demand since then dented company’s plans. The second source familiar with J&J’s plans said the company miscalculated Indian market demand. On a recent visit by a Reuters reporter to the J&J plant, plush, furnished conference rooms and cubicles sat inactive; M. Sairam, who said he was the site manager, told Reuters production areas with machines were idle too. Local officials had hoped the initial J&J plant would be only the beginning. After the groundbreaking in 2014, Pradeep Chandra, who was Telangana’s special chief secretary of industries, told Business Today magazine that “based on the extent of land (J&J) have acquired we believe that they are looking at much larger expansion here.” Local media reports at the time said the J&J facility would employ some 1,500 people. A J&J official, who was not identified by name, was reported subsequently in December 2016 in India’s Business Standard assaying that the $85 million plant would be operational by 2018 after it had overcome procedural delays. The official was quoted as saying the company had earmarked an additional $100 million for expansion. Vikas Srivastava, the managing director of J&J Consumer(India), who was at the 2014 groundbreaking, did not respond to calls for comment. Reuters also talked to two workers outside a sprawling Procter & Gamble facility making detergents and diapers, which is next to the J&J plant. They said they were part of the P&G plant’s production team and the plant had been running below capacity. A P&G spokesperson denied that, saying the plant was “operating at full capacity in line with our business plans”. “India is a priority market for P&G globally and in recent quarters, P&G’s business in India has registered strong double-digit growth consistently,” the company said. The weak rural economy, where most Indians work, has also hurt growth in sales of basic items such as detergents and shampoo in the past year. Hindustan Unilever Ltd, an industry bellwether that would compete with the likes of J&J and P&G in some categories, said its volume growth shrank to 7 percent in the quarter ended March 31, down from double-digit growth in the previous five quarters. The company warned that the daily consumer goods segment in India was “recession resistant ... not recession proof.”"

-4.391601715378949," Danish medical equipment maker Ambu sinks after departure of CEO COPENHAGEN, May 10 (Reuters) - Shares in Danish medical device maker Ambu slumped more than 10 percent on Friday after it surprisingly replaced its chief executive with a new boss hired from Johnson & Johnson. Departing Chief Executive Lars Marcher had led the company’s successful expansion of diagnostic and life-support devices for hospitals for more than 10 years, focusing on products such as single-use endoscopes. Ambu said Marcher had resigned and that Juan-José Gonzalez would start as CEO from May 15, joining from a position as president of Johnson & Johnson U.S. subsidiary DePuy Synthes, which makes orthopedic and neurosurgical products. The company gave no explanation for Marcher’s abrupt departure. “With Juan-José Gonzalez as CEO, we ensure that Ambu also has the necessary global experience to execute the announced strategy and ensure the successful commercialization of our product launches,” Chairman Jens Bager said in a statement. Shares in Ambu are up roughly 4,750 percent since he took the helm in 2008. The stock fell 12 percent by 0805 GMT on Friday set for their worst day since November 2018, Refinitiv data showed. “From a financial perspective with regards to the result, it is difficult to find fault with Marcher’s performance,” said Nordnet analyst Per Hansen. Ambu said there would be one-off costs of 38 million Danish crowns ($5.7 million) relating to Marcher’s departure -- covering his salary for a notice period and share options. It said its financial expectations for 2018-19 were unchanged. Gonzalez, who is 46, is an American citizen and will move from the United States to Denmark to take up the role.

-6.336374127725314," J&J agrees to pay about $1 billion to resolve hip implant lawsuits: Bloomberg (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay about $1 billion to resolve the bulk of lawsuits claiming the company sold defective metal-on-metal hip implants that ultimately had to be removed, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The agreement resolves over 95 percent of the 6,000 cases in which surgeons extracted the company’s Pinnacle implants because they left patients unable to walk and in pain, according to the report. The $1 billion total includes an earlier settlement for more than $400 million and there are still about 4,500 pending suits by patients with artificial hips that were not made totally of metal or haven’t been surgically removed, Bloomberg added. In February, Reuters reported J&J’s DePuy Orthopedics unit, which made the products, was in settlement talks to resolve most individual lawsuits alleging the company’s metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defective and caused severe injuries. The implants were said to cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations. Texas-based plaintiff lawyer Mark Lanier, one of the main attorneys for the consumers, declined to comment. Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment."

-3.3425659701307295," Pharmaceuticals drive J&J to better-than-expected quarterly profit (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported a first-quarter profit that exceeded Wall Street expectations on higher sales of its prescription medicines, including a double-digit increase for its psoriasis treatment Stelara, even as the company faces fierce competition for some of its other important drugs. The U.S. healthcare conglomerate said growth in its pharmaceuticals business was driven by volume rather than price hikes, and its shares rose more than 2 percent to $139.49. Sales of Stelara, which also treats Crohn’s disease, jumped about 32 percent to $1.41 billion, fueling a 4 percent rise for the pharmaceutical business, which accounts for more than half of the company’s total revenue. Double-digit increases for cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica also contributed to the earnings beat. “We’re really seeing the strength in pharma sales drive top and bottom line growth,” said John Ham, associate advisor at New England Investment and Retirement Group, which owns J&J shares. “We think growth in pharma sales not only in Asia but also in the United States will be a driver for the company going forward.” Excluding items, the company earned $2.10 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 7 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. J&J also tightened its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to $8.53 to $8.63 per share from its prior range of $8.50 to $8.65. The company on a conference call said 800 sites have already been certified to treat patients with its new nasal spray depression treatment Spravato, which won U.S. approval last month. “We believe that we’re off to a very, very strong start with Spravato and that is going to be an important growth driver for us,” said Jennifer Taubert, head of J&J’s pharma unit. Sales of prostate cancer drug Zytiga, which is now facing competition from cheaper generic versions as well as from branded rival Xtandi from Pfizer Inc and Astellas Pharma, fell 19.6 percent. But the company said it now sees the overall sales decline it expects due to competition from generics and biosimilars in 2019 coming in at the lower end of its prior $3 billion to $3.5 billion forecast. Overall sales increased slightly to $20.02 billion, topping analyst estimates of $19.61 billion. Sales from the medical device business fell 4.6 percent to $6.46 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $6.44 billion. Consumer health sales declined 2.4 percent to $3.32 billion. Net profit for the quarter fell 14.2 percent to $3.75 billion as the company recorded $423 million in litigation expenses."

-0.5596951250397063," Johnson & Johnson wins U.S. FDA approval for bladder cancer drug (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s drug Balversa won U.S. approval as the first targeted therapy for advanced bladder cancer, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Friday. The list price of the drug, known chemically as erdafitinib, will range between $10,080 to $22,680 for a 28-day supply, depending of the dose, J&J said. Balversa is the first approved drug in a class known as FGFR inhibitors that targets growth factor receptors involved in cell growth and division. The drug is approved for use in patients whose cancer has progressed during or after chemotherapy and have specific genetic alterations known as FGFR3 or FGFR2. Patients will be selected for therapy with Balversa using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic device that will identify the genetic mutations, the agency said. Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with the FGFR alterations present in about one in five patients. “We’re in an era of more personalized or precision medicine, and the ability to target cancer treatment to a patient’s specific genetic mutation or biomarker is becoming the standard,” Richard Pazdur, head of the FDA’s oncology products division, said in a statement. J&J shares closed up 0.5 percent at $135.98. Shares of Incyte Corp, which is also developing a FGFR inhibitor, closed down 2 percent at $79.40. The approval was based on a small 87-patient trial in which about a third of subjects experienced tumor shrinkage. The median duration before disease progression was 5.4 months. Common side effects of the drug include high phosphate levels, mouth sores and fatigue. The drug may cause serious eye problems, including inflamed eyes, the FDA said."

5.021456448100661," Special Report: As Baby Powder concerns mounted, J&J focused marketing on minority, overweight women LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pressure was mounting on Johnson & Johnson and its signature Baby Powder. In 2006, an arm of the World Health Organization began classifying cosmetic talc such as Baby Powder as “possibly carcinogenic” when women used it as a genital antiperspirant and deodorant, as many had been doing for years. Talc supplier Luzenac America Inc started including that information on its shipments to J&J and other customers. J&J, meanwhile, looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups of longtime users: African-American and overweight women. The “right place” to focus, according to a 2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, was “under developed geographical areas with hot weather, and higher AA population,” the “AA” referring to African-Americans. “Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers,” the presentation said. “This could be an opportunity.” In the following years, J&J turned those proposals into action, internal company documents show. It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and print promotions with weight-loss and wellness company Weight Watchers and launched a $300,000 radio advertising campaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach “curvy Southern women 18-49 skewing African American.” These are only some of the more recent examples of J&J’s decades-long efforts to offset declining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects of talc, based on a Reuters review of years of J&J print, radio and digital advertising campaigns and thousands of pages of internal marketing documents and email correspondence. Adults have been the main users of Johnson’s Baby Powder since at least the 1970s, after pediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc. As adults became ever more crucial to the brand – accounting for 91 percent of Baby Powder use by the mid-2000s – J&J honed its powder pitches to court a variety of targeted markets, from teen-focused ads touting the product’s “fresh and natural” qualities, to promotions aimed at older minority and overweight women. Today, women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13,000 plaintiffs alleging that J&J’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, a powder brand the company sold off in 2012, caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma. Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J&J cosmetic talcs – a claim supported by some studies showing an association between such use and increased cancer risk. The most recent cases have alleged that J&J’s talc products contained asbestos, long a known carcinogen. In an investigation published Dec. 14 here, Reuters revealed that J&J knew for decades that small amounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and in Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, based on test results from the early 1970s to the early 2000s – information it did not disclose to regulators or the public. J&J challenged the findings of the Reuters report, describing them as inaccurate and misleading. BABY POWDER “EVERYWHERE” Krystal Kim, a 53-year-old African-American, was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case in St. Louis resulted in a jury verdict last summer of $4.69 billion against J&J. Kim said Baby Powder and Shower to Shower were household staples among her family and friends when she was growing up in New Jersey. Kim played baseball as a teenager, she said, and her mother told her to apply Baby Powder to avoid being “the stinky girl.” “Every time I took a shower, I put Baby Powder on,” recalled Kim, whose ovarian cancer, first diagnosed in 2014, is now in remission. “I put it on my panties, on my clothes, everywhere.” J&J is appealing the St. Louis verdict. The company did not respond to requests for an interview with Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky or any other executive to discuss the company’s marketing of cosmetic powders. In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, J&J said its Baby Powder is safe and asbestos-free. It noted that the company’s marketing over the years has been directed at many demographics and groups, and that “we’re proud pioneers of the practice of multicultural marketing.” It also pointed out that some Baby Powder ads have featured the cornstarch version of Baby Powder, the safety of which isn’t questioned. Reports by Bloomberg News, the New York Times and the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, have cited some internal J&J documents revealing the company’s focus on African-American and overweight women at certain times. But the full timeline and scale of the marketing efforts, particularly those aimed at teenage girls, in minority communities and through organizations such as Weight Watchers, are reported here for the first time. Most businesses know the demographic profiles of those who buy their products and, as a matter of course, direct their marketing at those groups. Some – fast-food companies and soft-drink makers, for example – have courted minority customers to increase sales among heavy users at times of growing public concern about the possible health effects of their products. In a lawsuit filed in Mississippi state court in 2014, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood alleges that J&J failed to warn consumers of the risks associated with its talc products and accuses the company of implementing a “racially targeted strategy” for selling Baby Powder after J&J became aware of health concerns. The company focused its marketing on “minority communities expected to be more likely to use the talc products,” Hood claims in the lawsuit. J&J denied the allegations and last year filed a motion for summary judgment in the suit, arguing that the case involved matters of federal law, beyond the state’s purview. A judge in December denied J&J’s motion, a move the company has appealed. The case is scheduled for trial later this year. In its response to Reuters’ questions, J&J said: “Suggesting that Johnson & Johnson targeted a particular group with a potentially harmful product is incredibly offensive and patently false.” “DEEP, PERSONAL TRUST” Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder accounted for less than 1 percent of J&J’s $81.6 billion in revenue last year, but it is deemed critical to the company’s family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s “#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust.” Beginning in the 1950s, however, a series of case studies published in medical journals pointed to the dangers of breathing in talc. Pediatricians took notice. By the late 1950s, a third of them were recommending cornstarch or oil to treat diaper rash and chafing “because there is no dangerous dust” in them, according to an internal J&J report. A report in the June 1966 edition of the American Journal of Diseases of Children, citing the deaths of three children who inhaled large amounts of talcum powder, concluded there was “no justification” for using the product on babies because it has “no medicinal value.” By 1974, more than 60 percent of Johnson’s Baby Powder sales were “attributable to adults” who used it on themselves, according to a J&J analysis. Losing the connection to the product’s namesake – babies – left J&J eager to cultivate other markets. Beginning in the 1970s, J&J ran ads clearly intended to woo young women, in addition to its traditional marketing aimed at families with babies. “You start being sexy when you stop trying,” was the line from an ad that appeared in Seventeen magazine in 1972. The photo shows a young woman stroking a young man’s curly blond hair. “It’s a feeling you never outgrow,” is how an ad in Family Circle magazine from the mid-1980s put it, with a photo of a bottle of Baby Powder next to a teddy bear alongside the mirrored reflection of a young woman. In 1989, advertising firm Young & Rubicam submitted a plan to J&J to “initiate a high level of usage” among young women to “augment the weakening baby link.” Under the plan, ads in style magazines like Seventeen, YM, Glamour and Mademoiselle would try to convince teen girls that Johnson’s Baby Powder, “applied daily after showering, is a simple, feminine way to smell clean and fresh during the day.” Young & Rubicam, now known as VMLY&R, declined to comment on the document and referred questions to J&J. Baby Powder sales continued to fall throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Since health professionals had already recommended against using talc on infants, a 1986 internal report warned, a “last straw” safety concern could lead consumers to abandon the product altogether. As early as 1992, the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women. A J&J memo that year mentions “high usage” rates for Baby Powder of 52 percent among African-Americans and 37.6 percent among Hispanic customers – and notes that women of both ethnicities use the product more than the general population. The memo suggests investigating “ethnic (African American/Hispanic) opportunities to grow the franchise,” while referring to “negative publicity from the health community on talc,” including “inhalation, dust, negative doctor endorsement, cancer linkage.” Portions of that memo were cited in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times. By 2006, the company was recognizing that “consumers do not see a need for powder,” according to a sales presentation that year. Baby Powder shipments had been “stagnating” in recent years, the presentation said, and it was essential to “find a new business model” that “strategically and efficiently targets high propensity consumers.” Those groups, according to the presentation: African-Americans, nearly 60 percent of whom used Baby Powder by this time, compared to about 30 percent for the overall population; overweight people; and fitness-conscious people looking to lose weight. It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the World Health Organization, classified perineal use of talc as “possibly carcinogenic,” saying available research provided “limited evidence” it caused cancer in humans. That came about 20 years after IARC classified “talc containing asbestiform fibres” as “carcinogenic to humans,” its highest-risk classification. After the IARC’s 2006 move, talc supplier Luzenac America started including a note about the agency’s latest classification on a chemical safety document accompanying shipments to all customers, including J&J. Under a heading that reads “carcinogenic status,” the document says IARC “has concluded that perineal use of talc-based body powder is possibly carcinogenic to humans.” In a deposition for one of the ovarian cancer cases tried in St. Louis, a Luzenac America executive, Shripal Sharma, said the company felt it was important to add what he referred to as a warning to the safety document. Asked whether Luzenac knew that J&J did not pass on this warning, Sharma said: “It is not our job to tell our customers what to do with their products.” In a statement to Reuters, Imerys Talc America Inc, as Luzenac is now known, said: “Talc’s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies,” echoing J&J’s response. Through an Imerys spokeswoman, Sharma declined to comment. Two years after the IARC classification, J&J sought proposals for an “African American agency” to develop marketing campaigns for the company’s baby products line. A 2008 document sent to prospective agencies summed up the situation: “Johnson’s Baby Oil and Baby Powder products, while traditionally used only on babies, are today primarily consumed by adult AA women for use on themselves.” One way to reverse the brand’s decline, it said, was by “speaking to AA consumers with a more relevant message with the most effective media vehicles.” “ETHNIC CONSUMERS” That year, the company contracted with a North Carolina marketing firm, Segmented Marketing Services Inc, which says it specializes in targeted promotions to “ethnic consumers.” The firm would distribute 100,000 gift bags containing Baby Powder and other Johnson’s baby products in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago, according to a contract with J&J. Run by African-Americans who had been executives at Procter & Gamble Co and Quaker Oats, Segmented Marketing Services has said in past press releases and its own marketing publications that it hands out millions of free product samples and promotional offers through national networks of more than 10,000 African-American and Hispanic churches, and tens of thousands of “beauty salons, barber shops, entertainment venues and healthcare networks.” The company published an advertorial in 2008 prepared for distribution with Johnson’s baby products in which the firm’s founders, Sandra Miller Jones and Lafayette Jones, said they “welcome” J&J as a partner. “When caring rituals started in infancy continue through adulthood, a person’s self-confidence and even faith in the world are often strengthened,” the pamphlet said. “Whether in the gym, at work, at church or at the beach, Johnson’s Baby Powder helps grown-ups feel more comfortable in their own skin.” It came with a coupon for $1 off Baby Powder. Lafayette Jones and Sandra Miller Jones did not respond to calls, emails and LinkedIn messages seeking comment. J&J also launched campaigns to boost sales of Baby Powder to “curvy Southern women” and athletic adults who want to smell fresh, according to company documents. It advertised in Weight Watchers magazine and offered promotions through the Lane Bryant clothing chain for plus-size women and Curves, a women’s fitness and weight-loss franchise. Marketing plans also included ads to run in Southern Living magazine and during the Style Network show “Ruby,” a reality TV series that documented an obese Georgia woman on a mission to lose weight. A 2009 presentation laying out the “Powder media plan” highlights that it will reach 31 million people “in the South (hot climates/overweight states),” and that “43% of our plan will focus on the top 10 overweight states in the nation.” A 2009 ad in Weight Watchers magazine suggests readers “bust stress with a midday workout” and then “stay fresh post-exercise by applying Johnson’s Baby Powder.” Internal J&J marketing emails before the Weight Watchers campaign ran discuss whether the women featured are heavy enough to resonate with the intended audience. “Can you ask WW if they have any images of slightly bigger women? They don’t have to be super curvy, but a little bigger than the current image would be preferable,” wrote Grace Lee, a J&J brand manager, to others at the company and ad agency Lowe New York. Weight Watchers, now known officially as WW International Inc, declined to comment on the campaign. Lee & Interpublic Group of Companies Inc, which owns the former Lowe New York, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Weight Watchers campaign was successful, according to a 2009 internal J&J recap, which showed that sales of Baby Powder at Wal-Mart shot up as much as 9 percent during the summer months when the ads ran from the same months a year earlier, reversing a decline. J&J’s overall Baby Powder media advertising budget increased to a proposed $495,000 for 2010, up 71 percent from $288,000 in 2009, driven by more dedicated spending toward promotions for overweight women. The company in 2010 launched a radio campaign in the South targeting “Curvy Southern Women 18‐49 Skewing African American.” A presentation from TMPG, a marketing agency that handles promotions with radio DJs, said the campaign made more than 18 million impressions on the target audience through ads and promotions on “urban adult contemporary” radio stations in Southern markets, including Dallas; Atlanta; Nashville; Mobile, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi. The presentation slides feature some photos of plus-size African-American women holding Baby Powder samples at “targeted station events” that also included spa giveaways and “Baby Powder Stay Cool Cash.” TMPG did not respond to requests for comment. In a 2010 email, Debra DeStasio, a J&J promotions and marketing manager who oversaw the baby products line at the time, gave the green light to two proposed radio stations for the campaign in Dallas, saying “we are good with those general market stations that have good Hispanic reach and good AA reach.” In another 2010 email, she said the DJs will be the Baby Powder “brand ambassadors,” charged with “communicating our message, encouraging listeners to call in to talk about how they use Baby Powder and driving to retail where appropriate.” All the radio promotions would be “based on the weather,” she wrote. “If it’s hot and humid, we’ll run that week. If it’s rainy or colder, we won’t.” DeStasio, who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, did not respond to requests for comment. J&J’s spending on Baby Powder promotions – coupons, discounts, and samples – came to about $1.2 million in 2008 and again in 2010, almost half of it directed at overweight and minority women. By 2011, the company cut back its promotional spending to $752,000, mostly aimed at the general consumer market. In 2013, a jury found J&J negligent in the first case ever to claim that regular use of Baby Powder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer. The jury didn’t award monetary damages, but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits. Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far, four have resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs and one for the company. Three other verdicts against J&J were overturned on appeal. In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma, J&J was cleared of liability in five, and plaintiffs won three, resulting in a total of $172 million in damages. Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials. J&J is appealing all the verdicts against it. Meanwhile, J&J has pulled back from marketing specifically to minority and overweight women. A 2015 presentation makes no mention of minorities, suggesting the brand “target adults, with a focus on men.” Plaintiffs’ lawyers and other advocates have become more vocal in criticizing the targeted marketing campaigns. In its most recent newsletter, the National Council of Negro Women, a women’s leadership group with about 30,000 members, drew attention to the issue with an essay penned by civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing some Baby Powder plaintiffs.

3.929989632602185," Oklahoma drops several claims in opioid case against J&J, Teva (Reuters) - Oklahoma’s attorney general on Thursday had dropped all but a single claim against Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in a closely watched lawsuit alleging the drugmakers helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic. The move by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter came ahead of an upcoming May 28 trial, the first in the United States to result from roughly 2,000 lawsuits seeking to hold manufacturers of painkillers responsible for contributing to the epidemic. Opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hunter dropped the claims after announcing last week that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP had along with the wealthy Sackler family who own it reached a $270 million settlement. The 2017 lawsuit accused the three companies of engaging in deceptive marketing that downplayed the addiction risk from opioids while overstating their benefits. The Sacklers were not defendants in the case. The companies deny wrongdoing. Hunter said he would continue to bring a public nuisance claim against J&J and Teva but was dropping five other claims, including that they violated the Oklahoma Medicaid False Claims Act. Hunter said dropping those claims would not impact the amount of damages the state is seeking. Hunter had been asking for more than $20 billion before Purdue’s settlement. J&J in a statement said the state’s decision to drop most of its claims “underscores their lack of merit.” It said the evidence at trial will show that the company appropriately marketed its pain medications. Teva did not respond to a request for comment. Hunter said the decision to refocus the case around the single claim that the companies caused a public nuisance that needs remediated will obviate efforts by the companies to delay the upcoming trial. It will also transform what was to be a televised jury trial into a non-jury one in which a state court judge will decide the case, Hunter said. “The team and I remain laser focused on the goal we set since filing this lawsuit: holding those responsible for creating this crisis accountable and bring an end to the opioid epidemic in Oklahoma,” Hunter said. More than 1,600 other opioid-related lawsuits are consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October. Other cases, including Oklahoma’s, are pending in state courts."

0.9595449086416488," J&J baby shampoo samples fail Indian quality test; company rejects findings NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s baby shampoo samples failed quality tests conducted by the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, according to a public notice from the state’s drugs watchdog, findings that were rejected by the U.S. drugmaker. This comes just a few months after Indian authorities launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder to see if it contains cancer-causing asbestos. J&J said in late February it had resumed production of baby talc after government tests found no asbestos in the product. The Rajasthan Drugs Control Organisation's notice dated March 5 bit.ly/2FNMagi said that the samples of J&J's baby shampoo taken from two batches had failed the quality test as they contained ""harmful ingredients"". It did not elaborate. A J&J spokeswoman said that the results it received from the watchdog indicated that formaldehyde had been discovered in the samples. Formaldehyde, used in making building materials, is a known carcinogen. “We do not accept the interim results given to us, which mentioned samples to ‘contain harmful ingredients- identification positive for formaldehyde,’” she told Reuters. “We unequivocally maintain that our products are safe and our assurance process is amongst the most rigorous in the world,” the J&J spokeswoman said, adding that the company has contested the interim test results of the government analysis that were based on “unknown and unspecified methods”. The two batches of the baby shampoo tested are due to expire in September 2021 and were manufactured at the company’s plant in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, according to the watchdog’s notice. “We have confirmed to the Indian authorities that we do not add formaldehyde as an ingredient in our shampoo nor does Johnson’s baby shampoo contain any ingredient that can release formaldehyde over time,” the company spokeswoman said. The Rajasthan Drugs Control Organisation and India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) were not immediately available to comment. The federal regulator and its counterparts in Indian states launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder following a Reuters report in December that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. J&J has described the Reuters article as “one-sided, false and inflammatory”. J&J’s Baby Powder is one of the most recognized foreign brands in the country. The company leads sales in the Indian baby and child toiletries market, according to market research provider Euromonitor.

0.9742358157540855," New Jersey jury finds J&J not liable in talc cancer trial; company settles three other cases (Reuters) - A New Jersey jury on Wednesday cleared Johnson & Johnson of liability in a lawsuit brought by a man who said that asbestos in the company’s talcum powder products caused his mesothelioma. The jury delivered its unanimous verdict in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick, just miles from J&J’s headquarters, in the case of plaintiff Ricardo Rimondi. J&J, which faces some 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide, denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday also settled three other mesothelioma talc cases pending in state courts in California, Oklahoma and New York, Chris Panatier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Reuters. Panatier declined to provide further details, citing confidentiality agreements. Addressing the settlements, J&J in a statement said, “there are one-off situations where settlement is reasonable.” J&J said it stood by the safety of its talc and would continue to vigorously defend the safety of baby powder. “We do not have any organized program to settle Johnson’s Baby Powder cases, nor are we planning a settlement program,” the company said. Referring to the Rimondi verdict, J&J said the company’s track record in the talc litigation underscored “the decades of clinical evidence and scientific studies by medical experts around the world” supporting the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder. J&J shares, which had been down slightly, turned positive after the jury verdict was announced and closed up 13 cents at $138.70. Lawyers for the 58-year old Rimondi could not be reached for comment. Rimondi in 2016 was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that has been linked to asbestos exposure. He and his wife sued J&J in 2017. They alleged that Rimondi’s lifetime exposure to Johnson’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, another powder product containing talc sold by J&J in the past, caused his disease. The jury returned its verdict in favor of the company after just half an hour of deliberations, according to a livestream of the proceedings by Courtroom View Network. The healthcare conglomerate to date has faced 12 trials by plaintiffs claiming asbestos in talc caused their mesothelioma. J&J has now been cleared of liability in four trials, with another five resulting in hung juries and mistrials. Three juries have found J&J liable, awarding a total of $172 million in damages. J&J is appealing those verdicts. The majority of the 13,000 talc lawsuits against the company involve ovarian cancer claims. Juries in those cases have hit the company with verdicts as high as $4.69 billion. Some of the ovarian cancer verdicts have been overturned on appeal on technical legal grounds, while the company’s other appeals are still pending. “It remains true that of all the talc-related verdicts against Johnson & Johnson that have been through the appeals process, every one has been overturned,” the company said in its statement on Wednesday. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Reuters in December published a report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers. J&J denies the findings of the Reuters report, which it describes as inaccurate and misleading. In emphasizing the safety of its baby powder, the company says that repeated tests of the powder never found asbestos and that it has cooperated fully and openly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other global regulators."

2.1288044362692693," Shareholder pushing for mandatory arbitration seeks to block J&J's annual meeting (Reuters) - There has been a significant escalation in the fight over whether corporations can require shareholders to arbitrate claims against the company. A Johnson & Johnson shareholder pushing for mandatory arbitration moved Tuesday to enjoin J&J’s April 25 annual meeting, arguing that the company must allow investors to vote on a proposal that would require them to arbitrate their disputes with J&J. The preliminary injunction motion, filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey, will be, to the best of my knowledge, the first courtroom test of the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. The injunction motion, which follows a March 1 lawsuit against the company, was filed by the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust. The trust, which is advised by Harvard law professor emeritus (and arbitration proponent) Hal Scott, wants the court to compel J&J to allow shareholders to vote on a proposed bylaw precluding securities class actions and directing investors to resolve claims in individual proceedings before the American Arbitration Association. (Yes, that’s right: The trust, a shareholder, wants a bylaw that would end shareholder class actions.) J&J, as I’ll explain, opposes the bylaw. Its lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom didn’t respond to my request for comment on the trust’s preliminary injunction motion but said in a letter Wednesday to the judge overseeing the case that there’s no need for urgency and that the trust’s arguments are contrary to the weight of authority. Scott and the trust first proposed a shareholder vote on mandatory arbitration last November. That proposal, as you may recall, led to a blowup at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Johnson & Johnson’s Skadden lawyers informed the SEC in December that the company considered the proposal a violation of federal securities law. J&J, they said, intended to exclude the Behr trust’s proposal from proxy materials and from a shareholder vote. The company asked the SEC’s corporate finance division for reassurance that the commission would not bring an enforcement action against the company for blocking the proposed resolution. In the past, the SEC has pushed back hard against shareholder arbitration, including 2012 proposals by shareholders at Gannett and Pfizer that presaged the Behr trust’s J&J proposal. But some SEC commissioners have lately announced support for mandatory shareholder arbitration provisions and SEC chairman Jay Clayton has been notably non-committal on the issue. Arbitration opponents saw the trust’s J&J proposal as a threat - and mobilized opposition. The SEC ended up agreeing that J&J could block the proposal, relying mostly on a last-minute opinion from New Jersey’s attorney general that said mandatory arbitration was illegal under state law. Notably, however, the SEC seemed to back away from its previous position that requiring shareholders to arbitrate would violate federal law – possibly in recognition of pro-arbitration rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013’s American Express v. Italian Colors and 2018’s Epic Systems v. Lewis. That shift by the SEC, Scott told me Wednesday, was critical to the trust’s decision to go to court to demand J&J put its arbitration proposal to a shareholder vote. By basing its decision on the New Jersey AG’s view of New Jersey law, Scott said, the SEC left open the question of whether the AG’s interpretation is correct – and failed entirely to address the trust’s arguments that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts state law no matter what New Jersey has to say about mandatory shareholder arbitration. The trust, which is represented in the new litigation against Johnson & Johnson by Jonathan Mitchell of Mitchell Law, lays out its case comprehensively in Tuesday’s preliminary injunction brief, which seeks a declaration that J&J violated federal securities laws by excluding the trust’s proposal and an injunction requiring J&J to announce in a supplemental proxy statement that mandatory shareholder arbitration is legal under state and federal law. J&J has already sent out proxy materials for the scheduled April 25 meeting, omitting mention of the Behr trust’s proposal. According to the trust’s injunction brief, J&J bears the burden of proving its proposal is illegal and the company has been unable to identify any federal statute or New Jersey law or legal precedent that precludes mandatory shareholder arbitration. The trust argues that after the Supreme Court’s decisions in Epic and Italian Colors, such provisions are permissible under federal law because nothing in the Securities and Exchange Act implies a partial repeal of the Federal Arbitration Act. (I’m condensing a nuanced, multi-pronged argument but that’s the gist.) The trust contends that the New Jersey AG erroneously based his conclusion about the state-law legality of mandatory arbitration on a recent Delaware ruling on forum selection in corporate charters – and even if the AG were correct in his interpretation, the FAA trumps state law. “There is no need for this court to explore the contours of New Jersey law or engage in … guesses about what the New Jersey courts might do,” the brief said. “If the law of New Jersey purports to prohibit a corporation and its shareholders from agreeing to arbitrate their disputes, then that law is preempted by the FAA.” In a letter filed Wednesday with U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp of Trenton, J&J counsel Andrew Muscato of Skadden said the trust has manufactured urgency after waiting weeks to file a complaint and injunction motion. “Conspicuously absent from the application is any attempt to demonstrate emergency circumstances,” the letter said. “Plaintiff did not file suit until March 21 — more than four and a half months after it knew Johnson & Johnson intended to exclude the proposal, almost six weeks after the SEC issued its no-action letter and eight days after the company filed (and mailed and/or made available electronically) its proxy materials.” J&J also previewed the merits of its argument against mandatory shareholder arbitration. “(The trust’s) theory is built upon the notion that everyone else got it wrong,” the company’s letter said. “In actuality, (the trust) has no likelihood of success, as evidenced by the numerous authorities it dismisses as wrong, including the State of New Jersey’s chief legal officer.” Muscato didn’t respond to my email request for comment. Plaintiffs’ advocacy groups will probably also want a say in this case. After the trust sued, the American Association of Justice and the Secure Our Savings coalition, which is led by Public Justice and the Consumer Federation of America, issued statements warning that the mandatory arbitration provisions the Behr trust is advocating will make it easier for corporations to defraud investors. “We will continue to oppose this effort and any others that aim to shield unscrupulous corporations from accountability by hiding behind forced arbitration clauses,” the AAJ statement said. Trust lawyer Scott told me he just wants to give J&J shareholders a chance to vote on mandatory arbitration. “I believe it’s they who should make the decision,” he said. “I want to give them a choice.”"

6.307685786429046," Oklahoma top court clears way for Purdue, J&J, Teva to face opioid trial (Reuters) - Oklahoma’s top court on Monday declined to delay a landmark trial set for May in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit accusing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and two other drugmakers of helping fuel an opioid abuse and overdose epidemic in the state. The Oklahoma Supreme Court’s decision was a win for the state’s attorney general, whose case is set to be the first to face trial of roughly 2,000 lawsuits nationally seeking to hold opioid manufacturers responsible for contributing to the epidemic. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter’s 2017 lawsuit accuses Purdue, Johnson & Johnson & Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd of engaging in deceptive marketing that downplayed the risks of addiction associated with opioid pain drugs while overstating their benefits. The companies deny wrongdoing. They had sought to delay the May 28 trial to Sept. 16, citing the need to review records the state belatedly turned over that could be critical to their defense. The state is seeking over $20 billion in damages. The trial delay bid came as Purdue, owned by members of the wealthy Sackler family, was exploring filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to address potential liabilities stemming from the lawsuits, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Purdue did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. After the trial judge declined on March 8 to delay the trial, Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue denied that his ruling would have any affect on whether it files for bankruptcy. “We appreciate the quick action taken by the court and for not rewarding the defendants with more time for a problem of their own making,” Hunter said in a statement. J&J and Teva did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The epidemic has prompted lawsuits by state and local governments accusing Purdue and other drugmakers of contributing to the crisis. More than 1,600 lawsuits have been consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October. Other cases, including Oklahoma’s, are pending in state courts."
6.307685786429046," Bayer, J&J settle U.S. Xarelto litigation for $775 million (Reuters) - Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson have agreed to settle more than 25,000 U.S. lawsuits over their blockbuster blood thinner Xarelto for a total of $775 million, court documents on Monday showed. The amount will be shared equally between the two companies that jointly developed the drug. Bayer and J&J do not admit liability under the agreement. The settlement will resolve all pending U.S. lawsuits over Xarelto, which plaintiffs claimed causes uncontrollable and irreversible bleeding leading to severe injuries and even death among thousands of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs accused the drugmakers of having failed to warn about the bleeding risks, claiming their injuries could have been prevented had doctors and patients been provided adequate information. Bayer in a statement on Monday said it continues to believe the claims are without merit. “However, this favorable settlement allows the company to avoid the distraction and significant cost of continued litigation,” the company said. J&J in a statement said it continued to believe in the safety of Xarelto, but that the settlement was the right thing to do for patients and their doctors. Xarelto is Bayer’s best-selling drug. It contributed 3.6 billion euros ($4.07 billion) in revenue to the German group’s pharmaceutical business last year. Bayer on Monday said its share of the settlement amount will be partially offset by product liability insurance. Bayer jointly developed Xarelto with J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit, which sells the blood clot preventer under a licensing agreement in the United States.

The company had recorded a partial impairment charge of about $630 million related to the treatment in the third quarter last year after having suspended trials in August. J&J added AL-8176 to its pipeline through its $1.75 billion buyout of Alios Biopharma Inc in 2014. The drug was being developed to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) that cause respiratory tract infections in children and adults.

2.146055230705828," J&J and Sientra get FDA warning letters over breast implants (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to Sientra Inc and a Johnson & Johnson unit for failing to comply with the post-approval study requirements for their breast implants. The long-term safety of breast implants has been questioned over the years. Last month, the FDA issued a statement warning doctors about a type of lymphoma linked to breast implants after receiving reports of the disease. The agency’s letters, dated March 18, highlighted issues in the companies’ post-approval studies, which included evaluating the long-term performance and safety of the implants, used for breast augmentation and reconstruction procedures. The letter to J&J’s medical aesthetics unit Mentor Worldwide LLC noted “several serious deficiencies” in the company’s post-approval study for its MemoryShape breast implant approved in 2013. Failure to enroll the required number of patients in the study and data inconsistencies, including poor patient accounting and missing race and ethnicity data, were identified as violations in the letter to Mentor. Mentor said it was disappointed with the FDA’s decision to issue a warning letter, even as the company attempted to address post-approval study requirements with the agency. “Despite multiple attempts to discuss this with FDA, Mentor has not received feedback,” Mentor spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said in an emailed statement. Sientra had reported a poor patient follow-up rate of 61 percent for the post-approval study of its silicone gel breast implants, which required the company to evaluate the study subjects annually for 10 years, according to the FDA letter. The agency said failure to make good the violations may result in the withdrawal of the premarket approval granted to the products. The FDA asked the companies to provide responses within 15 working days with details about how the noted violations will be corrected. Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Sientra’s former chief executive for fraudulently concealing problems with his company’s breast and other implants while raising $61.4 million in a public stock offering. Shares of Sientra were down 1.8 percent at $8.65, while J&J shares were flat in after market trading."
2.194276974759251," California jury awards $29 million to woman with cancer who used J&J talc (Reuters) - A California jury on Wednesday awarded $29 million to a woman who said that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson’s talcum-powder-based products caused her cancer. The verdict, in California Superior Court in Oakland, marks the latest defeat for the healthcare conglomerate facing more than 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide. J&J said it would appeal, citing “serious procedural and evidentiary errors” in the course of the trial, saying lawyers for the woman had fundamentally failed to show its baby powder contains asbestos. The company did not provide further details of the alleged errors during the trial. “We respect the legal process and reiterate that jury verdicts are not medical, scientific or regulatory conclusions about a product,” J&J said in a statement on Wednesday. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown that its talc is safe and asbestos-free. The lawsuit was brought by Terry Leavitt, who said she used Johnson’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower - another powder containing talc sold by J&J in the past - in the 1960s and 1970s and was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. It was the first of more than a dozen J&J talc cases scheduled for trial in 2019. The nine-week trial began on Jan. 7 and included testimony from nearly a dozen experts on both sides. The jury deliberated for two days before delivering its verdict, which was broadcast online by Courtroom View Network. Jurors found that J&J’s talc-based products used by Leavitt were defective and that the company had failed to warn consumers of the health risks, awarding $29.4 million in damages to Leavitt and her husband. The jury declined to award punitive damages. “Yet another jury has rejected J&J’s misleading claims that its talc was free of asbestos,” said Moshe Maimon, a lawyer for Leavitt, in a statement on Wednesday. “The internal J&J documents that the jury saw, once more laid bare the shocking truth of decades of cover- up, deception and concealment by J&J.” Leavitt’s was the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. Leavitt’s trial originally included J&J’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SE, as a co-defendant. California Superior Court Judge Brad Seligman, who oversaw the trial, told jurors in February that the company was no longer part of the case after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the weight of the talc litigation, which stayed lawsuits against it. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs’ lawyers have more recently focused on arguing asbestos contamination in talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three have resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal.

-1.060323552165504," J&J nasal spray gets U.S. approval as first new type of anti-depressant in decades (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it approved a Johnson & Johnson nasal spray antidepressant for people resistant to other treatments but placed restrictions on use of the drug, which it warned could be misused and abused. The approval of nasal spray esketamine marks the first new type of treatment for depression in more than 30 years and has raised hopes for its relatively fast action and ability to treat some otherwise unreachable patients. Esketamine would be sold under the brand name Spravato and is a chemical mirror image of anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug and goes by the street nickname “Special K”. To prevent abuse, patients must take the drug in a doctor’s office or medical facility and cannot take it home. Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly and Co’s Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). “Spravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,” said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J’s Janssen Research & Development. Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J’s pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars. The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA’s harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug. Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement here. During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico. The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks. However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study. The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide. Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood. J&J’s drug helps restore these nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms, according to the company. Over 300 million people globally live with major depressive disorders, and the incidence of attempted suicide in people with this condition is about 20-fold higher than that among those without the disorder."
-1.060323552165504," J&J prices ketamine-like depression treatment at $590-$885 for two doses (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday its nasal spray depression treatment, called Spravato, will be priced at $590 for a 56 mg dose and $885 for 84 mg. During the induction phase of the therapy, which lasts for a month, patients will be treated twice a week with either dose, resulting in a wholesale acquisition cost or list price in the range of $4,720 to $6,785, Janssen spokesman Greg Panico said in an email statement. Subsequent maintenance doses will be provided either once a week or every two weeks, adding up to monthly costs ranging from $2,360 to $3,540. The list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. Out-of-pocket costs vary based on an individual’s healthcare plans and the duration of treatment. J&J’s Spravato, which is chemically similar to commonly-abused ketamine, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday, making it the first new depression treatment in more than 30 years."

Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that the federal regulator had not found any asbestos in the company’s talc, citing sources familiar with the matter.

2.6432039210851337," Court ruling could help J&J defeat St. Louis talc lawsuits NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Missouri Supreme Court ruling on talc lawsuits could reduce the liability and number of large trials Johnson & Johnson faces over allegations its talc products, including baby powder, cause cancer. The ruling will likely offer some respite to the healthcare conglomerate as it deals with growing pressure over the safety of its talc products, some defense lawyers said. The company revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to talc litigation. Some plaintiffs’ lawyers, however, played down the impact of the ruling. It was a trial in St. Louis’s 22nd Circuit Court, brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside of the city whose cases were joined to that of a single St. Louis resident, that in July produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J. The company is facing several more such lawsuits in St. Louis. However, Missouri’s high court on Feb. 13 ruled in a separate talc case that allowed a non-resident to participate in joined cases was “a clear and direct violation” of state law barring the use of joinder - combining two or more cases - to allow courts to hear cases they otherwise could not. Most state courts can only hear cases involving plaintiffs or defendants from that state or alleging injuries occurring within their jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court strengthened those restrictions in a 2017 decision. But the St. Louis court had allowed out-of-state residents to continue to sue New Jersey-based J&J through liberal use of joinder. In the case that produced the July verdict, 18 of the plaintiffs were from outside Missouri and three were from outside the city of St. Louis. Of the roughly 700 talc cases filed in St. Louis, only 40 involve Missouri residents, according to court filings. If the Feb. 13 ruling closes off the St. Louis court to non-resident claims, J&J may have a stronger hand defending itself in smaller talc cases spread out among other, potentially less plaintiff-friendly state and federal courts. “There’s no real way of reading this decision other than this court clearly saying you can’t join claims if the injury did not occur in the venue,” said Mark Cheffo, a New York-based product liability defense lawyer not involved in talc litigation. J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the decision. “One claim that is properly before a court cannot provide a basis for drawing into a trial other claims that are not. We believe that decision is clearly correct, and we continue to believe that the science doesn’t support plaintiffs’ claims,” the company said, declining further comment. Some plaintiffs’ lawyers said the Feb. 13 ruling was not as definitive as Cheffo suggests. “If defendants are celebrating this ruling as the end of St. Louis mass tort, they have not read the entire Missouri case law,” said Eric Holland, a St. Louis-based plaintiff lawyer involved in the talc litigation. Holland pointed to a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court decision that upheld a $38 million verdict in a pharmaceutical product liability case the defendant claimed had been improperly joined. The court let the result stand, saying that even an improper joinder did not render the trial unfair to defendants. Though the 2016 ruling involved a case already decided, Holland and other plaintiffs’ lawyers said they planned to argue its fairness analysis also applies to out-of-state talc claims in cases yet to go to trial. They said they would also argue joining the cases was the most efficient use of judicial resources. Defense lawyers said the Feb. 13 decision would likely mean dismissal or severing of the out-of-state claims from four upcoming multi-plaintiff cases scheduled for trial in St. Louis. Two of the cases were halted by the Missouri Supreme Court ahead of its ruling. Holland and other plaintiff lawyers said they would challenge J&J requests to sever or dismiss talc cases by arguing the Feb. 13 decision did not overrule the 2016 ruling. Cheffo said the 2016 ruling could make it harder for J&J to overturn the July verdict and its record penalty because the company would have to prove the joinder led to an unfair trial. ‘FORUM SHOPPING’ BY OUT-OF-STATE PLAINTIFFS The St. Louis court has been a venue for more talc trials and has seen larger verdicts than any other jurisdiction. Outside of St. Louis, the only other significant talc verdicts against J&J to date have come in lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs in New Jersey and California, where the company is currently facing jury verdicts totaling $142 million. A Los Angeles jury delivered a $417 million talc verdict against J&J in 2017, but the judge threw out the award weeks later as unsupported by the evidence. All talc verdicts against J&J are on appeal. The St. Louis court has a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and has often been criticized by business groups as allowing “forum-shopping” by out-of-state plaintiffs. While J&J faces some trials brought by individuals in other jurisdictions, the multi-plaintiff St. Louis cases are the largest and have the most potential to produce additional billion-dollar verdicts. Plaintiffs allege that the talc in Johnson’s baby powder and other J&J products causes ovarian cancer, or that asbestos contamination in the talc causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma. J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a co-defendant in the litigation, deny the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. (reut.rs/2Gh88KO) J&J is currently facing roughly 13,000 lawsuits over talc, most of which have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey. Many plaintiff’s lawyers have fought to keep cases out of federal court, which they feel favors corporate defendants. Three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma. Five other juries have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials. In a statement, Imerys Talc America said the Missouri ruling affirmed legal arguments it has made in litigation for the last four years. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Feb. 13, saying it lacked the financial clout to defend against talc lawsuits."

2.722184519351283," Johnson & Johnson supplier seeks bankruptcy over talc lawsuits (Reuters) - A key supplier of talc used in Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday in the wake of multibillion-dollar lawsuits alleging its products caused ovarian cancer and asbestos-related mesothelioma. Imerys Talc America, the U.S. unit of French group Imerys SA, said it filed for bankruptcy because it lacks the financial clout to defend against nearly 15,000 lawsuits over its talc mineral product. Imerys said that while it continued to believe the lawsuits are without merit, the prospect of rising settlement and defense costs over the next few years prompted the decision to file for bankruptcy. They also cite a multibillion-dollar verdict against Johnson & Johnson and the ensuing media attention as factors that led to the Chapter 11 filing. In July, a Missouri jury ordered J&J to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who said asbestos in talc caused ovarian cancer. The healthcare conglomerate has said it is appealing that verdict. Imerys settled for an undisclosed amount prior to the trial. Imerys and J&J have repeatedly denied the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe. J&J on Wednesday declined to comment on Imerys Talc America’s Chapter 11 filing. Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. J&J has said that its talc products do not contain asbestos. Bankruptcy provides Imerys a single forum to settle the widespread litigation. A similar strategy has been used by numerous companies facing litigation over faulty breast implants, asbestos-tainted products and recalled automotive airbags. “After carefully evaluating all possible options, we determined that pursuing Chapter 11 protection is the best course of action to address our historic talc-related liabilities and position the filing companies for continued growth,” Imerys Talc America said in a statement. Two North American subsidiaries of Imerys, Imerys Talc Vermont and Imerys Talc Canada, also filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. Mark Lanier, a Texas-based lawyer representing many of the more than 11,700 talc plaintiffs, on Wednesday said Imerys Talc America’s bankruptcy would not change the litigation. “We have always targeted our cases against J&J and Colgate Palmolive, the companies that put the asbestos laced talc into the products,” Lanier said. Colgate-Palmolive is another defendant in the U.S. talc litigation. The New York-based company sold Cashmere Bouquet, a cosmetic talcum powder, from 1871 to 1995. Colgate did not respond to a request for comment. It has denied allegations that its talc products cause cancer."
2.722184519351283," Shareholder arbitration advocates see silver lining in SEC rebuff in J&J case (Reuters) - On Monday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton announced that the SEC will not countenance the latest attempt to curtail securities class action litigation via mandatory shareholder arbitration. But for shareholder arbitration advocates, the news wasn’t all bad: The SEC seems to have backed away from its longstanding position that shareholder arbitration runs afoul of federal securities laws, leaving open an avenue for future investor arbitration proposals. Technically, Clayton simply announced his support for a recommendation from the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance that the SEC decline to bring an enforcement action against Johnson & Johnson if the company refuses to allow shareholders to vote on a mandatory arbitration proposal by a J&J investor. Harvard emeritus law professor Hal Scott, who serves as trustee of the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust, notified J&J in November of the trust’s proposal that the company allow shareholders to vote at their annual meeting in April to amend J&J’s bylaws to require investors to arbitrate any disputes with the company as individuals. (Yes, it may seem counterintuitive that a shareholder wants to force a corporation to allow fellow shareholders to vote to give up their right to sue, but such is the nature of shareholder proposals.) Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. Johnson & Johnson, represented by Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, sent a letter to the SEC in December, asking for the SEC’s blessing to exclude the trust’s proposal from shareholder proxy materials. J&J’s argument in that December letter was that mandatory shareholder arbitration violates the anti-waiver provisions of federal securities laws, which preclude delegation of enforcement to arbitrators. Skadden pointed out that in 2012, when the SEC was reviewing mandatory arbitration proposals pushed by Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard on behalf of shareholders at Pfizer and Gannett, SEC staff agreed that such proposals could “cause the company to violate the federal securities laws.” In those cases, the SEC allowed Pfizer and Gannett to exclude the shareholder proposals from a vote based on the potential federal securities law conflict, so, according to Skadden, it should do the same for J&J. Scott replied that since 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed arbitration as an alternative forum for the vindication of rights conferred by federal law, most recently in 2018’s Epic Systems v. Lewis. The Epic decision, Scott argued, stands for the proposition that oversight by federal agencies, whether the SEC in the case of mandatory shareholder arbitration or the National Labor Relations Board in the Epic case, is no bar to resolving disputes by arbitration. In January, the back-and-forth between Scott and J&J in letters to the SEC shifted from federal securities law to state corporate law. (The letters are included in Monday’s public filing by the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance.) Last December, as you may recall, Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery Court ruled, in a case considered a harbinger of a prospective test of the legality of mandatory arbitration, that Delaware corporate law does not allow companies to select the forum for the resolution of external claims by shareholders, including claims under federal securities law. After Laster’s decision in Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, Johnson & Johnson, which is incorporated in New Jersey, obtained an opinion from counsel at Lowenstein Sandler that New Jersey law would also preclude mandatory shareholder arbitration. The attorney general of New Jersey, Gurbir Grewal, subsequently sent the SEC a Jan. 29 letter advising that the J&J shareholder proposal would violate state law. The New Jersey AG cited Delaware’s Sciabacucchi ruling, explaining that New Jersey courts often look to Delaware for guidance. “The proposal’s provisions on mandatory arbitration of federal securities law claims are not ones which New Jersey law permits to be set forth in the bylaws of a business corporation,” the AG letter said. “These provisions would not address the internal concerns of Johnson & Johnson, but rather would seek to regulate external relationships of the company that are governed by federal law. Accordingly, the proposed bylaw amendment would violate New Jersey corporate law.” The New Jersey AG’s opinion carried the day for the SEC’s corporate finance staff. The SEC’s no-action letter to Johnson & Johnson said it regarded the AG’s letter as “a legally authoritative statement that we are not in a position to question,” and that, in light of the AG’s position, the SEC would not recommend an enforcement action if J&J excluded the mandatory arbitration proposal from a shareholder vote. The SEC said it was not expressing a view on whether the New Jersey AG was right or wrong, suggesting that if J&J or Hal Scott wanted a definitive determination on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration under New Jersey law, they should go to court. The SEC letter ducked the federal-law question that had dominated early arguments by both Scott and J&J. “We are also not expressing a view as to whether the proposal, if implemented, would cause the company to violate federal law,” the letter said. “Chairman Clayton has stated that questions regarding the federal legality or regulatory implications of mandatory arbitration provisions relating to claims arising under the federal securities laws should be addressed by the Commission in a measured and deliberative manner.” Clayton’s announcement emphasized that the Corporate Finance division’s no-action recommendation was based on the New Jersey AG’s interpretation of state law – and also warned, once again, that no one should expect quick answers from the SEC on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration under federal securities laws. “Since 2012, when this issue was last presented to staff in the Division of Corporation Finance in the context of a shareholder proposal, federal case law regarding mandatory arbitration has continued to evolve,” the SEC chair wrote. “Further, I am not aware of any circumstances where the Commission has weighed in on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration in the context of federal securities law. In light of the unsettled and complex nature of this issue, as well as its importance, I agree with the approach taken by the staff to not address the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration in the context of federal securities laws in this matter, and would expect our staff to take a similar approach if the issue were to arise again.” So why do Hal Scott and Adam Pritchard say the SEC’s handling of the J&J case represents some progress for shareholder arbitration proponents? Because the SEC did not contend mandatory shareholder arbitration is illegal as a matter of federal law, which was the basis of the 2012 no-action letters to Pfizer and Gannett. “The SEC has reversed its position,” Scott told me in an interview Wednesday. “The most significant thing about this letter is that the SEC didn’t say the proposal would be illegal under federal law.” Added Pritchard: “They’ve backed away from an obviously frivolous position.” Scott said he plans to appeal the SEC staff’s recommendation to the commissioners. He said he doesn’t expect to win, but believes that the SEC’s framing of its recommendation as a matter of state law leaves room for him to argue that the commission must confront the federal law issue because federal securities laws preempt state law. In the past, Scott said, the SEC has said it would not issue no-action letters based on ambiguous state law – a rule, he said, that should certainly apply in these circumstances. At the very least, Scott said, the SEC’s no-action letter leaves open the prospect of mandatory shareholder arbitration for corporations based in states whose corporate codes would permit it. (I should point out that Vice-Chancellor Laster’s Sciabacucchi ruling is on appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court so we can’t be sure even what Delaware’s final word will be on corporations picking a forum for federal securities claims.) I asked Scott whether he’s working on more shareholder proposals calling for mandatory arbitration, perhaps in a state with an AG who won’t put up a fight. He declined to say. The SEC declined to provide a statement responding to comments from Scott and Pritchard, and J&J counsel Marc Gerber of Skadden declined to comment through a firm spokeswoman. But I did talk to Paul Bland of Public Justice, whose group has been a stalwart opponent of shareholder arbitration, about whether we should read the SEC’s handling of the J&J case as a sign that the commission will no longer rely on its previous view of mandatory arbitration and federal securities law. “I don’t see anything in the staff letter or the chairman’s statement that says the Federal Arbitration Act overrides federal securities law,” Bland told me. He said it makes sense that the SEC didn’t address that question because it didn’t need to. The New Jersey AG’s letter made the case an easy call for the SEC, Bland said: “The SEC dodged a thorny legal issue and went with an answer that was much more straightforward.” I asked Bland whether he’s frustrated that the SEC has assiduously avoided reaching a conclusion, as the debate over mandatory shareholder arbitration has intensified, about whether the FAA trumps federal securities laws. Arbitration proponent Pritchard told me, for instance, that he thinks SEC Chair Clayton is putting off a reckoning on that question because he doesn’t want to face Congressional criticism. (In fairness, Clayton has said repeatedly that when the issue is ripe, the entire commission will reach a decision on shareholder arbitration as a matter of federal law, rather than leaving the matter in the hands of Corporate Finance staffers; his implication in the J&J case was that the New Jersey AG’s opinion obviated the need for a final decision as a matter of federal securities law.) Bland told me he can’t criticize Clayton at all. “I feel like the chairman did investors a huge service,” he said. “This is a huge victory for shareholders.”"
2.722184519351283," Johnson & Johnson to buy surgical robotics firm Auris for $3.4 billion (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it would buy Auris Health Inc for $3.4 billion in cash, gaining access to the privately held company’s surgical robotic scope used in respiratory procedures and the detection of lung cancer. The deal marks J&J’s expansion into the healthcare robotics market that is expected to reach nearly $12 billion by 2023, and pushed down shares of Intuitive Surgical Inc , the current leader in minimally-invasive robotic surgery. J&J has sold some divisions such as diabetes care, as it tries to focus on and improve sales at better-performing businesses like cancer treatments. “We are encouraged to see J&J moving more aggressively in the robotics field, which has been a gap for its medical device business,” Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said. Sales in J&J’s medical device unit have been recovering since turnaround efforts began in 2016, and the company now expects that unit to achieve above-market growth in 2020. Auris was founded by surgical robotics pioneer Frederic Moll, who also co-founded Intuitive Surgical. Moll will join J&J after its acquisition closes, the company said, but did not disclose what role he would play. J&J’s shares were up marginally at $134.24 in midday trade, while Intuitive Surgical fell as much as 2.5 percent to $526.36 as analysts said Auris could become a formidable competitor given J&J’s commercial scale. Auris’s flagship product is a robot used by surgeons via a controller to direct a scope through a patient’s body with cameras. The device, called Monarch, was approved by U.S. regulators last year for diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures, where an instrument is inserted into the nose or mouth. Auris initially focused on lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. J&J said the acquisition would complement its purchase last year of Orthotaxy, a privately held developer of software-enabled robotic technology for surgery. J&J’s Ethicon unit, which will absorb Auris, has a partnership with Alphabet Inc’s Verily Life Sciences, under which the companies formed a surgery-focused company called Verb Surgical Inc in 2015. “Investors have been yearning for an acquisition for JNJ’s MedTech and while this entity may not have been top of mind, it complements JNJ’s Ethicon franchise and its respiratory health focus,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said. J&J’s agreement also includes additional payments to Auris of $2.35 billion, based upon Auris hitting certain milestones, which J&J did not specify."

2.722184519351283," Johnson & Johnson's nasal spray for depression wins FDA panel backing (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday voted in favor of Johnson & Johnson’s experimental nasal spray, which has a compound similar to often-abused ketamine, bringing the drug closer to approval. The panel voted 14-2 in favor of the drug esketamine, developed to treat major depression in patients who have not benefited from at least two different therapies, saying its benefits outweighed the risks. One panel member abstained from voting. Esketamine is a chemical mirror image of anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug and goes by the street nickname “Special K”. “I think esketamine has the potential to be a game-changer in the treatment of depression ... I use the term potential because the issues of cost and patient accessibility need to be addressed,” said Walter Dunn, who voted in favor of approval. However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers on Friday regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study. The FDA recommended implementing a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program which included ensuring esketamine is only dispensed and administered under supervision. “Ketamine is a nasty drug ... should (J&J’s) drug get approved, I think a strong effort has to be given as part of REMS ... so that patients really know what they are getting themselves into,” said Steven Meisel, another member who voted ‘yes’. Major depressive disorder affects over 300 million people globally. About 30 percent to 40 percent of these patients fail to respond to first-line treatments such as antidepressants, most of which take at least four weeks to show effect. However, depression is a tricky area of development. Patients in clinical trials often show a big placebo response, masking the efficacy of the drug being tested. Currently, Eli Lilly and Co’s Symbyax is the only FDA-approved drug for treatment-resistant depression. “There is a lot of potential for people that just want that quick fix. I really would be cautious,” said Kim Witczak, a panel member who voted ‘no’. J&J’s esketamine, used in combination with a newly prescribed antidepressant, works by restoring the nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms. The FDA, although not mandated to follow the panel’s recommendation, is expected to announce its decision on esketamine by March 4."
2.9442141190865736," U.S. FDA panel recommends approval of Johnson & Johnson's depression drug Feb 12 (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday recommended Johnson & Johnson’s experimental nasal spray, which has a compound similar to often-abused ketamine, for patients suffering from depression. The panel voted 14-2 in favor of the drug esketamine, developed to treat major depression in patients who have not benefited from at least two different therapies, saying its benefits outweighed the risks. One member in the panel abstained from voting on the question. Esketamine is a variation of the anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug with the street nickname Special K.

6.700702585362809," J&J becomes first drugmaker to add prices to television ads CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Thursday it will start adding the price of its medicines to television commercials by next month, becoming the first drugmaker to heed a call by U.S. President Donald Trump for price transparency of drugs advertised directly to consumers on TV. The healthcare conglomerate said it will include both the list price of a product - the price before any rebates or discounts to insurers or pharmacy benefit managers - as well as potential out-of-pocket costs that patients will pay. The move, announced in a statement on J&J’s website, won swift praise from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Last May, Azar’s office released a blueprint for reducing the cost of drug prices, which included a proposal to require disclosure of list prices in TV ads for drugs. “We commend Johnson & Johnson for recognizing the value of informing consumers about list prices and for doing so voluntarily. We call on other manufacturers to follow their lead,” Azar said in a statement. Trump made lowering the cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign and emphasized it again in his State of the Union Address this week. Ads for the blood thinner Xarelto, J&J’s most widely prescribed medicine, will be the first television spot to include pricing information, the company said. The treatment used to prevent blood clots costs about $450 to $540 a month. Congress has increased its scrutiny of U.S. drug pricing since Democrats took over control of the House of Representatives in January, while pressure is also coming from the Republican-led Senate. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, ranking member of the committee, on Monday invited executives from seven pharmaceutical companies, including J&J, to testify at a Feb. 26 hearing on rising drug prices."

6.700702585362809," Idorsia 'cuts Actelion umbilical cord', says cash pile suffices ZURICH (Reuters) - Idorsia founder and CEO Jean-Paul Clozel said his biotech group has the resources to assess trial data and decide what to do with assets, as spending on projects led to a 386 million Swiss franc ($385 million) loss in 2018. The Swiss company still has total liquidity of 1.22 billion francs, down from 1.35 billion francs on Sept. 30. Clozel, who spun Idorsia out of Actelion after that drugmaker’s $30 billion sale in 2017 to Johnson & Johnson, last year initiated four late-stage trials of medicines, including against insomnia, brain bleeding, resistant hypertension and rare Fabry Disease. Clozel, who said Idorsia “cut the umbilical cord” from Actelion over the course of 2018, sees operating expenses of around 570 million francs in the current year, up from 432 million last year, as trials on these and other molecules advance. “The level of financing required for a diversified drug pipeline can pose certain challenges for a young company,” Clozel said in a statement. “The 505 million francs raised in July 2018 should give us the necessary leeway to assess the clinical data for our late-stage pipeline and then make the appropriate strategic decisions regarding commercialization.”"
7.640269093954721," J&J, plaintiffs 'close' to deal on Pinnacle hip implant lawsuits: lawyer (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Orthopaedics unit is in settlement talks to resolve the bulk of individual lawsuits alleging the company’s metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defective and caused severe injuries, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said on Monday. Texas-based plaintiff lawyer Mark Lanier said lawyers for the consumers had talked to the company in recent days to reach an agreement to resolve the long-running litigation that includes more than 10,000 cases. “It’s still not a done deal, but we’re getting close,” Lanier said, adding that plaintiffs hope to reach a final agreement by the end of the year. Lanier said it was uncertain at this point how many of the roughly 10,000 Pinnacle lawsuits would be subject to the settlement. He declined further comment. A spokeswoman for DePuy on Monday declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported on the settlement talks. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations. Metal-on-metal hip implants have come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. J&J denies those allegations, saying the company acted appropriately and responsibly in the development, testing and marketing of the devices. Last month, J&J agreed to pay $120 million to resolve deceptive marketing claims by several U.S. states over metal-on-metal hip implants. DePuy said the settlement involved no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies. J&J to date has faced several federal jury trials over the Pinnacle hip implants. It won the first case in 2014, but lost all subsequent trials, with verdicts ranging from $151 million to $540 million. J&J has appealed those verdicts. News of the settlement talks on Monday caused a federal judge overseeing an ongoing Pinnacle trial in Dallas to dismiss the jury in that case. Lanier said that case, involving five Texas plaintiffs, has not been settled yet."
6.476482976224472," Missouri Supreme Court suspends second talc cancer trial in weeks (Reuters) - The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday halted an upcoming trial in a case brought by women who claim talc supplied by Imerys Talc America for use in Johnson & Johnson products gave them cancer, saying it wanted to consider a jurisdictional challenge by Imerys. It is the second major talc case the Missouri high court has stayed in recent weeks on jurisdictional grounds. Both were in the St. Louis’ 22nd Circuit Court, which has issued several large verdicts against J&J and Imerys, including one for $4.7 billion in July. The vast majority of the plaintiffs in the St. Louis cases are from other states, and the defendants have repeatedly challenged their right to sue in Missouri as opposed to their home states or in states where the companies are headquartered or have a substantial presence. J&J is based in New Jersey and Imerys, a unit of Imerys SA, is based in California. In the case stayed on Thursday, which had been scheduled to go to trial on April 8, only two of the 24 plaintiffs were from Missouri. The plaintiffs claim asbestos in Johnson’s Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their cancer, alleging that J&J and Imerys knew of asbestos contamination since at least the 1970s, but failed to warn consumers. Reuters on Dec. 14 published a Special Report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for cancer-causing asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers. J&J and Imerys, a unit of Imerys SA, deny those allegations and have repeatedly said decades of studies have shown their talc products to be safe and free of asbestos. “Imerys Talc America is pleased the Missouri court has ordered the trial court to take no further action while it reviews the merits of whether the Missouri court has personal jurisdiction over the company in this product liability matter,” the company said in a statement on Thursday. Mark Lanier, the plaintiff’s lawyer in the case stayed on Thursday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He also represented the plaintiffs in the $4.7 billion case, most of whom were also from outside Missouri. J&J, which is a co-defendant with Imerys, said it had also asked to postpone the upcoming trial and its petition remained pending. The company declined comment on Thursday. The Missouri Supreme Court previously stayed a talc case against J&J and Imerys that was due to begin on Jan. 21 on the same jurisdictional grounds. A number of multi-million-dollar talc verdicts against J&J and Imerys in the St. Louis court have been thrown out following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting state courts’ jurisdiction over claims by non-residents against out-of-state companies. However, the St. Louis trial court has allowed many out-of-state plaintiffs, including most of those who won the $4.7 billion verdict, to proceed based on state ties the defendants say are tenuous. That verdict is now under appeal at an intermediate court."
6.805255829485341," Exclusive: Sri Lanka halts imports of Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder pending asbestos tests COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has halted imports of Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder until the company proves its product is free from cancer-causing asbestos, two government officials and the product’s local distributor told Reuters. Stocks of the product already in Sri Lanka can still be sold, but there will be no new imports of the talc, a popular healthcare product across Sri Lanka and much of Asia, until J&J India, from where Sri Lanka imports the product, provides fresh test results. On Dec. 14, Reuters reported that the U.S. drugs and consumer products group knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder, leading to tests in several countries, including in India. The report was based on thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports, and other confidential documents. J&J has described the Reuters story as “one-sided, false, and inflammatory”. Kamal Jayasinghe, chief executive of Sri Lanka’s National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA), which is part of the health ministry, said it had informed the distributor, A.Baur & Co., that it would require further tests for it to continue importing the powder. “We have held their re-registration and informed the distributor to submit quality reports from an accredited laboratory to ensure there is no asbestos in their products,” Jayasinghe told Reuters. The license for A.Baur & Co to import the product expired in December, a second person at the NMRA said. Shalutha Perera, head of consumer for A.Baur, told Reuters the firm has informed J&J in India of the suspension of the licensing process. “J&J India directly handles all the regulatory matters,” he said. Perera said the NMRA contacted A.Baur in December regarding new asbestos testing. A spokeswoman for J&J India declined to comment on the halt of shipments to Sri Lanka but said the company “is in full compliance with current Indian regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and testing of our talc”. “We are fully cooperating with the Indian government and are awaiting results from their testing,” she added. The spokeswoman said the product was routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure it is free of asbestos."
8.008484140439782," U.S. senator asks J&J for documents on talc, baby powder safety (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Patty Murray sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday seeking information related to allegations in a Reuters Special Report that the healthcare company knew about the presence of asbestos in its talc-based baby powder. The letter addressed to J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky asks for documents and information related to testing of its talc products for the presence of carcinogens and “how it presented that information to regulators and consumers.” Reuters on Dec. 14 published a Special Report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for cancer-causing asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers. While exposure to asbestos has been linked to mesothelioma, J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz, in an emailed statement, acknowledged receiving the letter and said the company looks forward to sharing its response with the senator. “As we have consistently stated, we firmly stand behind the safety and purity of our talc, which has been confirmed by thousands of independent tests by regulators worldwide, including the U.S. FDA and many of the world’s leading independent laboratories,” the company statement said. Murray, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, referred to the Reuters report in her letter. It began, “I am troubled by recent reports of an alleged decades-long effort by Johnson & Johnson to potentially mislead regulators and consumers about the safety of one of its products, which may have resulted in long-term harm for men, women, and children who used Johnson & Johnson baby powder.” J&J is facing more than 11,000 lawsuits alleging that use of its talc products, including baby powder, caused cancer. Murray asked for documents to support the company’s claim that its current talc products do not contain any level of asbestos, documents on the testing of its talc products and communications with the Food and Drug Administration about the safety of its baby powder dating from 1966 to present."

9.338406503350216," J&J forecasts disappointing 2019 sales, defends talc safety (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday forecast 2019 sales that fell short of analysts’ estimates and said it expected further pressure on U.S. prescription drug prices, weighing on the broader pharmaceutical sector. J&J, the first major drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, said it expects full-year sales of $80.4 billion to $81.2 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $82.69 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also said it expected adjusted 2019 earnings of $8.50 to $8.65 per share, putting the midpoint below analysts’ expectations of $8.60 per share. J&J shares were down 2 percent at $128.02, while the broader S&P 500 healthcare sector was off 1.1 percent. The healthcare conglomerate on a call with analysts said that net prices of its medicines declined 6 percent to 8 percent in 2018 after falling 4.6 percent in 2017. J&J did raise U.S. list prices on about two dozen prescription drugs earlier this month, including on its top-selling products. The company is “obviously engaged with the (Trump) administration and a lot of different groups right now on the issue of pharmaceutical pricing,” Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said on call with analysts. He said the company had some concerns related to reference pricing, a proposal to tie U.S. drug pricing to the average price paid for drugs in a handful of other developed nations, where the governments directly or indirectly control medicine costs. “We are concerned about some unintended consequences around access and innovation as it relates to some of the proposals,” Gorsky said. Drugmakers have come under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress to lower out-of-pocket medical costs for consumers. Gorsky attempted to deflect some of that responsibility, saying medicines and medical devices combined for about 20 percent of costs to patients. The remaining 80 percent, he said, comes “from outside our industry.” While J&J has huge medical device and consumer health divisions, its pharmaceuticals unit has been its main growth driver in recent years. Strength in the pharmaceuticals business also helped offset higher costs, including a doubling of litigation expense in the fourth quarter to $1.29 billion. Most of that was related to resolving older lawsuits in its medical devices business, spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in an email response to Reuters. For the full year, litigation expenses rose to $1.9 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017. About 10 percent of that total was related to talc, Knewitz said. J&J is facing more than 11,000 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products, including baby powder, alleging that its use caused cancer. “We remain committed to ensuring the facts about our talc are understood and we will continue to defend the safety of our products,” Gorsky said. Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing that the company knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in its talc. J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer. Excluding items, J&J said it earned $1.97 per share for the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents. Sales in the quarter rose about 1 percent to $20.39 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $20.20 billion. Sales of Stelara for psoriasis and Crohn’s disease jumped 33.6 percent to $1.44 billion. Cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica also had double-digit sales increases to $584 million and $703 million, respectively."
9.338406503350216," J&J, U.S. states settle hip implant claims for $120 million (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit have agreed to pay $120 million to resolve deceptive marketing claims by several U.S. states over the company’s metal-on-metal hip implants. Attorneys general of 46 U.S. states announced the settlement agreement in statements on Tuesday. They alleged DePuy engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the promotion of its ASR XL and Pinnacle Ultamet hip implant devices. DePuy in a statement said the settlement involves no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies. “DePuy Synthes remains committed to meeting the current and future needs of orthopedic surgeons and patients,” the company said. The states claimed J&J made misleading claims about the longevity of its metal-on-metal hip implants, with patients frequently having to undergo a revision surgery before the company’s advertised timeframe of five years. Under Tuesday’s settlement agreement, DePuy is required to maintain a post-market surveillance program and update procedures to track complaints over the hip implants, according to a statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James. DePuy in 2010 announced a worldwide voluntary recall of 93,000 of its ASR hip implant systems, saying that 12 percent of them failed within five years. Saying it would pay at least $2.47 billion, the company has since settled thousands of lawsuits by patients who had to have the ASR implant removed. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. Metal-on-metal hip implants have also come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. The company faces some 10,400 lawsuits in the United States over its Pinnacle device in connection with those claims.

The company’s prostate cancer drug Zytiga, an important growth driver, is expected to be pressured by generic competition, while sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade has been slipping due to competition from cheaper biosimilar versions. The company said it expects full-year sales in the range of $80.4 billion to $81.2 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $82.69 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In the fourth-quarter, sales rose about 1 percent to $20.39 billion, topping the average Wall Street estimate of $20.20 billion, helped by double-digit percentage growth in sales of Crohn’s disease treatment Stelara and cancer drugs such as Darzalex and Imbruvica. Strength in the company’s pharmaceuticals business also offset higher costs. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company’s litigation expense doubled to $1.29 billion.

9.831159087457136," U.S. drugmaker J&J's India sales dip 3 percent in 2017/18: filing NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N sales in India dipped 3 percent in the year to March 2018, a regulatory filing showed on Thursday, as the U.S. drugmaker grappled with the country's stringent medical device pricing policies. The company, currently mired in a controversy surrounding the safety of its baby talcum powder, reported overall sales of 58.28 billion rupees ($829 million) in India for the year, its filing with the country’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs shows. But its after-tax profit for the period rose 18 percent to $98 million on other income, including foreign exchange gains. J&J’s medical device sales in India have been hit following the federal government’s move in 2017 to cap prices of devices such as orthopedic knee implants to help poor patients. The restrictions were part of a broader push by India to end what it called “illegal profiteering” by companies. The company has recently been in the news after a Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in its baby powder. The report prompted drug inspectors across India to collect talc samples from J&J facilities for testing. J&J has said the Reuters article was “one-sided, false and inflammatory”, adding that its Baby Powder was “safe and asbestos free”. J&J’s Baby Powder is one of the most recognized foreign brands in India. The company leads sales in the Indian baby and child toiletries market, which Euromonitor International estimates was worth $178 million last year. J&J’s consumer segment in India, which includes baby care products such as soap and talc, recorded sales of 31 billion rupees in the year to March 2018, marginally lower than the previous year, the company’s India filing showed. Sales in its medical segment, which includes its orthopedic products, fell 7 percent to 19.6 billion rupees."

The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), under the Industries Ministry, said it will either do the tests inside or outside the country. Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs/2rAz2TO “We take this issue seriously and within a couple of days we will collect samples from the market ...,” S.M.

J&J said on Thursday that its talc is routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure that it is free of asbestos.

8.529872557426874," Indian regulator orders J&J to stop using raw material to make Baby Powder in India NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's drugs regulator has ordered Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to stop manufacturing its Baby Powder using raw materials in two of its Indian factories until test results prove they are free of asbestos, a senior official said on Thursday. The official at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter, said a written order had been sent to the U.S. company telling it to stop using the “huge quantities” of raw materials stocked in its plants in northern and western India. Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs/2rAz2TO The company said on Wednesday that Indian drug authorities visited some of its facilities and took “tests and samples” of its talcum powder. It also said that the safety of its cosmetic talc was based on a long history of safe use and decades of research and clinical evidence by independent researchers and scientific review boards across the world. The CDSCO also collected samples of the company’s baby shampoo and soap products as a matter of routine, the official said. “Whenever inspectors feel there is contamination in one thing they also take samples of (other products) from the same company,” the official said. The visits came as the CDSCO and state-based food and drug administrations launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder following a Reuters report last Friday that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. J&J has described the Reuters article as “one-sided, false and inflammatory”. The company told Reuters that it is in full compliance with the current Indian regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and testing of its talc. “All talc in India is sourced and exclusively sold in India and surrounding markets – including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives – and fully meets the regulatory standards of the Government of India,” the company said in an emailed statement. J&J also said its talc is routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure that it is free of asbestos. Asked if the order meant the company would have to stop producing its ubiquitous Baby Powder in India for now, the official at the drugs regulator said that was “the inference you have to take” at least as far as the stores of raw materials were concerned. “We have told them until this investigation concludes, you should not use the raw material. Test results will take time,” the official said. “Testing for asbestos is not a routine procedure. It might be in traces. It will require us to develop a method and all those things.” J&J’s Baby Powder is one of the most recognized foreign brands in India. The company started selling its Baby Powder in India in 1948, just a year after the country won independence from Britain. Presenting gift boxes containing the product and others aimed at newborns is almost a family ritual in this country of 1.3 billion people, 28 percent of whom are aged 0-14. The company also commands a strong retail distribution network through small pharmacies, larger stores and the internet. There is yet to be any significant signs of a backlash against J&J products in India. At eight pharmacies across India visited by Reuters reporters on Thursday, seven said J&J remained the No. 1 seller of powder for babies. That doesn’t mean it isn’t under pressure from local and international competitors who sell talc-type powders, such as Bengaluru-based Himalaya Herbals, and Italy’s Artsana, which produces Chicco baby brands. And some individual consumers say they are now very wary of J&J’s Baby Powder. “It is really very, very shocking,” said Sitaram Beria, a chartered accountant in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar. He said he stopped applying J&J powder to his six-month old baby after hearing about the Reuters report over the weekend. J&J leads sales in the Indian baby and child toiletries market, which market research provider Euromonitor estimates would be worth 12.5 billion rupees ($178 million) this year, and forecasts will grow 84 percent to 23 billion rupees in 2022. Euromonitor did not give a breakdown for baby powder alone but said J&J was the biggest player in the overall segment, followed by Mumbai-based VVF Ltd, Artsana, Wipro of Bengaluru and Himalaya. Himalaya said in a statement that its herbs-based baby care products “are exclusively promoted and recommended by over 40,000 doctors in the country, which is the greatest endorsement for us,” while declining to provide any financial figures. The other companies could not be reached for comment."
8.529872557426874," Two lawmakers question EPA on asbestos after Reuters report WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. lawmakers have called on the Environmental Protection Agency to answer questions about asbestos exposure after Reuters reported that documents showed Johnson & Johnson knew for decades of the mineral’s presence in its popular baby powder. Whether asbestos in the talc supply in Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder caused cancer has been the subject of litigation for years. The lawmakers, Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative Suzanne Bonamici, did not mention Johnson & Johnson by name but expressed “deep concern” about Friday’s Reuters report, according to a copy of their letter dated Dec. 19 and reviewed by Reuters. Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs/2rAz2TO In their letter, the two lawmakers asked the EPA how it was regulating potentially unsafe asbestos-containing products. J&J has disputed the Reuters report, calling it a “misrepresentation.” The company says its talc is safe and has never contained asbestos, adding that decades of studies and regulatory assessments confirm the safety of its product. Representatives for the EPA did not be respond to an email or a telephone call seeking comment on the congressional letter. Asked about the lawmakers’ letter, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz declined to comment but said the Reuters report was “one-sided, false and inflammatory.” According to the Reuters report, documents as well as deposition and trial testimony showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed did not find asbestos. The company has defended its products in recent days with a series of full-page newspaper advertisements and a television interview with its chief executive. Shares of the company have fallen about 12.5 percent since the Reuters report on Friday. Merkley and Bonamici also asked the EPA to detail what steps it was taking to help prevent vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and infants from being exposed to products containing asbestos, including other products with talc, a mineral. Although baby powder is subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other talc products sold to consumers would be within the purview of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and thus the responsibility of the EPA, they wrote in the letter. Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey separately called on the FDA to investigate the findings in the Reuters report in a letter on Friday. The FDA could not immediately be reached for comment. “Asbestos is a known carcinogen, and one for which there is no controlled use or safe level of exposure,” Merkley and Bonamici wrote. “Fifty-five countries have already banned asbestos. Unfortunately, the United States still permits the use of asbestos.”"
7.741890070943313," J&J loses bid to have $4.7 billion talc verdict set aside, vows to appeal (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson failed to persuade a Missouri trial judge to set aside a July verdict awarding a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company’s Baby Powder and other talc products. The healthcare company faces thousands of lawsuits over the safety of talc in its Baby Powder, a fixture of its consumer products division that has been core to J&J's reputation as a family-friendly company. (Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs/2rAz2TO) J&J has fought back, saying its talc is safe and has never contained asbestos or any carcinogens. The trial was the first in which plaintiffs claimed that asbestos fibers in J&J’s talc caused ovarian cancer. It relied on unsealed internal company documents that the plaintiffs allege detail J&J’s knowledge of asbestos contamination since at least the 1970s. St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Rex Burlison in the ruling on Wednesday denied a J&J request to toss the verdict, saying the jury’s decision and the large award of punitive damages was justified. The judge said: “substantial evidence was adduced at trial of particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of defendants, including that defendants knew of the presence of asbestos in products that they knowingly targeted for sale to mothers and babies, knew of the damage their products caused, and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades.” Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. The company’s stock has dropped more than 13 percent since Friday, wiping out more than $45 billion in J&J’s market value. Shares on Wednesday were up about 0.4 percent at $128.17. J&J in a statement said the failed motion was merely a formal step required before appealing the verdict. “The same judge has denied similar motions on prior verdicts in his court that were ultimately overturned by the appellate courts. We are confident this verdict will also be overturned on appeal,” J&J said. The St. Louis jury in July awarded $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. Mark Lanier, the women’s lawyer during trial, in a statement said plaintiffs were pleased with Burlison’s decision. The women and their families said decades-long use of baby powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their illness. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks. While plaintiffs in the long-running litigation in the past had claimed talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiff lawyers in recent months shifted their claims to allege asbestos in the talc causes mesothelioma, a cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, and ovarian cancer. J&J denies that its talc products ever contained asbestos and says decades of studies and regulatory assessments show its talc to be safe. Missouri’s appeals court has overturned two prior ovarian cancer talc verdicts against J&J on technical legal grounds, saying the decisions could not stand following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting where companies can be sued for personal injuries. The company in its September motion made a similar argument, telling Burlison that the women, the majority of whom were from out-of-state, had no right to sue in Missouri. J&J also said Lanier during the trial “substituted proof and evidence with misleading and inflammatory graphics,” including an image depicting J&J pushing a woman off a cliff into ovarian cancer. But Burlison in his Wednesday ruling said the cases rightly belonged in Missouri court due to J&J’s connection to the state. More than 9,700 talc lawsuits, the vast majority of those J&J faces, allege asbestos-laced cosmetic talc caused ovarian cancer, while a smaller number claim its use led to mesothelioma. J&J has won a total of four jury trials, involving both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma claims. A California trial court judge in October 2017 threw out a $417 million ovarian cancer verdict against the company, saying there had been insufficient evidence to support the award. Juries in four additional mesothelioma trials could not reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials."
7.741890070943313," Indian regulator orders J&J to stop using raw material to make Baby Powder in India-source NEW DELHI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - India’s drugs regulator has ordered Johnson & Johnson to stop manufacturing its Baby Powder using raw materials currently in two of its Indian factories until test results prove they are free of asbestos, a senior official said on Thursday. The official at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter, said a written order had been sent to the U.S. company telling it to stop using the “huge quantities” of raw materials stocked in its plants in northern and western India. The company said on Wednesday that Indian drug authorities visited some of its facilities and took “tests and samples” of its talcum powder. It also said that the safety of its cosmetic talc was based on a long history of safe use and decades of research and clinical evidence by independent researchers and scientific review boards across the world. The visits came as the CDSCO and state-based food and drug administrations launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder following a Reuters report last Friday that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. J&J has described the Reuters article as “one-sided, false and inflammatory”. The company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Asked if the order meant the company would have to stop producing its ubiquitous baby powder in India for now, the official at the drugs regulator said that was “the inference you have to take” at least as far as the stores of raw materials were concerned. “We have told them until this investigation concludes, you should not use the raw material. Test results will take time,” the official said. “Testing for asbestos is not a routine procedure. It might be in traces. It will require us to develop a method and all those things.” (Reporting by Krishna N. Das and Rahul Singh Edited by Martin Howell)"
7.741890070943313," Novartis oncology boss Barrett makes quick exit ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis is getting its third oncology chief in less than a year after Liz Barrett said on Thursday she was leaving the Swiss drugmaker to become chief executive of a U.S. biotech firm only 11 months after taking up the role. Barrett, a U.S. citizen who previously worked at Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson J&J.N before joining Novartis in February, will be replaced from January by Susanne Schaffert, a longtime Novartis executive. Barrett, who could not be reached for comment, cited challenges in moving her family to Basel, Novartis’s headquarters, as the reason for her departure. She did not name the biotechnology firm she was joining. Novartis is trying to build up its oncology portfolio with new therapies including its costly Kymriah cell therapy, nuclear-based medicines and immuno-oncology. “After much personal reflection, it became clear that my family would be unable to relocate,” said Barrett, who had replaced Bruno Strigini as oncology chief less than a year ago. A Novartis spokesman said he did not know where Barrett had taken a job. Schaffert, a 20-year Novartis veteran, had for five years been Region Head, Novartis Oncology Europe, before this year taking over at its Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) unit, purchased late last year for $3.9 billion. AAA makes therapies that deploy trace amounts of radioactive compounds to treat cancer. Schaffert will replace Barrett on the Novartis executive committee, where she will report to Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan. “She has our full support and confidence as we continue to invest in both our internal pipeline as well as external assets to strengthen our presence,” Narasimhan said in a statement."
7.741890070943313," J&J says Indian drug regulators visited facilities, took talc samples NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian drug authorities visited some of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N facilities on Wednesday and took ""tests and samples"" of its talcum powder, the company said in a statement. The visits came as regulators in India launched an investigation into J&J’s Baby Powder following a Reuters report last Friday that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. The company told Reuters in a statement that the facilities were visited by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and some state-based food and drug administrations (FDAs). “Today, a few of our facilities were visited by the CDSCO and local FDA authorities and we are fully co-operating with them by providing tests and samples,” the J&J statement said. “The characterization of these visits as ‘raids’ or ‘seizures’ is incorrect as has been reported in some instances,” it said. “The tests have been conducted in the regular way that the FDA collects samples.” J&J added that the safety of its cosmetic talc was based on a long history of safe use and decades of research and clinical evidence by independent researchers and scientific review boards across the world. It also said Indian FDAs and the CDSCO have in the past confirmed that its products “comply with Indian standards and are free of asbestos”. Quoting an industry source with knowledge of the matter, Reuters reported earlier in the day that drug inspectors had taken samples of Baby Powder from its Baddi factory in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. A source at the CDSCO said its officials lifted samples for testing from nine Indian cities - Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Chandigarh and Ghaziabad. J&J did not immediately specify how many manufacturing plants the company has in India. A CDSCO spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Surendranath Sai, a regional drug officer in the southern state of Telangana, on Wednesday said he would instruct inspectors to collect samples there. “On the basis of the news report, we are alerting staff to pick up samples. We will test them in a drug control lab here,” said Sai. “We will take action accordingly. Certainly we are worried because millions of babies may be affected.” Earlier, the Times of India quoted an official source as saying 100 drug inspectors had been assigned to examine different manufacturing facilities, wholesalers and distributors linked to J&J India, starting early on Wednesday. A health ministry spokeswoman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. However, a senior official at the ministry said the report was worrying. “We are concerned about it and will take action,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified due to the matter’s sensitivity. The official did not elaborate on what kind of action the ministry could take. A Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. It also showed that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over how to address the problem while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public. The documents also depicted successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans regarding limiting asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on talc’s health effects. J&J said on Monday it planned to buy back up to $5 billion of its stock, after $40 billion was wiped from its market value following the Reuters report."

Chancellor Dewayne Thomas of the Chancery Court of Mississippi’s First Judicial District in Hinds County on Tuesday said the court would be “remiss” if it tossed the case before allowing the “full development of all potentially relevant facts.” A trial in the case is set for the fall of 2019.

5.873146430097231," J&J moves to limit impact of Reuters report on asbestos in Baby Powder NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Monday scrambled to contain fallout from a Reuters report that the healthcare conglomerate knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder, taking out full-page newspaper ads defending its product and practices, and readying its chief executive for his first television interview since investors erased tens of billions of dollars from the company’s market value. J&J shares fell nearly 3 percent Monday, closing at $129.14 in New York Stock Exchange trading. That drop was on top of the 10 percent plunge that wiped out about $40 billion of the company's market capitalization following the Reuters report here Friday. J&J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to $5 billion of its common stock. Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J&J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety. J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, in his first interview since the Reuters article was published, defended the company during an appearance on CNBC’s “Mad Money” with host Jim Cramer on Monday night. J&J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. In response to the report, J&J said on Friday that “any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.” A Monday full-page ad from J&J -- headlined “Science. Not sensationalism.” -- ran in newspapers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The ad asserted that J&J has scientific evidence its talc is safe and beneficial to use. “If we had any reasons to believe our talc was unsafe, it would be off our shelves,” the ad said. J&J rebutted Reuters’ report in a lengthy written critique of the article and a video from Gorsky. In the written critique, posted on the company’s website here, J&J said Reuters omitted information it supplied to the news organization that demonstrated the healthcare conglomerate’s Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer; that J&J’s baby powder has repeatedly been tested and found to be asbestos-free; and that the company has cooperated with the U.S. FDA and other regulators around the world to provide information requested over decades. “Since tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J’s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,” Gorsky said in the video here. He added that regulators “have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.” A Reuters spokeswoman on Monday said the agency “stands by its reporting.” Reuters’ investigation found that while most tests in past decades found no asbestos in J&J talc and talc products, tests on Baby Powder conducted by scientists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1971 and Rutgers University in 1991, as well as by labs for plaintiffs in cancer lawsuits, found small amounts of asbestos. In 1972, a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called “incontrovertible asbestos” in a sample of Shower to Shower. Other tests by J&J’s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s. The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company’s talc. The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer. Asbestos, however, is a carcinogen. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos-contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987. Reuters also found that J&J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold. The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer-review scientific journal in 1991. The ad J&J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with “independent studies from leading universities, research from medical journals and third-party opinions.” That website has changed since early December, according to a Reuters review of online archives. The website, for instance, no longer contains a section headlined “Conclusions from Global Authorities” that as recently as Dec. 5 listed organizations including the U.S. FDA, the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have “reviewed and analyzed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer.” On Dec. 14, the day Reuters published its report, that section of the website had been removed. It is not clear exactly when the online page changed. The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a “consistent and statistically significant positive association” between talc exposure and ovarian cancer. The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic. The draft report put forth proposed conclusions that are subject to a public comment period and confirmation in a so-called final screening assessment, Health Canada said. If the conclusions are confirmed, Canadian officials will consider adding talc to a government list of toxic substances and implementing measures to prohibit or restrict use of talc in some cosmetics, non-prescription drugs and natural health products, Health Canada said. A J&J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report. “We chose to be conservative while that draft is under review,” the spokeswoman said. While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed less than 0.5 percent of J&J’s $76.5 billion in revenue last year."

4.144804050035953," Breakingviews - J&J’s talc crisis will linger for years NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Johnson & Johnson’s talc crisis will linger for years. Investors erased $40 billion of its market value on Friday, after Reuters revealed the U.S. healthcare giant knew for decades its baby powder was sometimes tainted by asbestos. The company says the story is an “absurd conspiracy theory” as “every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free.” If history is a guide the market may have over-reacted, but lawsuits and brand damage don’t easily dissipate. J&J faces thousands of lawsuits from users that claim the company’s talc resulted in health problems. In July, a jury in Missouri ordered the company to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed their ovarian cancer was caused by asbestos in J&J’s products. The market had shrugged off that decision. The company’s stock by Thursday had risen nearly 5 percent since January, giving it a market capitalization of almost $400 billion. Lopping off 10 percent of that may be an overreaction. Investors tend to panic when multibillion-dollar settlements become likely. Drugmaker Merck lost $27 billion, or 27 percent of its market value, when it pulled painkiller Vioxx in 2004 after studies linked it to heart attacks and strokes. The company ended up settling most cases for under $5 billion. Likewise, investors have discounted a $15 billion liability at Bayer for lawsuits that claim a weedkiller made by Monsanto, the U.S. company it acquired this year, caused cancer, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bank believes the payout will probably be somewhere below $5 billion. The legal bills won’t abate anytime soon. Merck was still dealing with Vioxx-related litigation more than a decade after the drug was pulled from the market. But the hit to J&J’s reputation may be the most difficult to fix. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking Tylenol painkillers that had been laced with cyanide. The company’s response to that tragedy – recalling 31 million bottles, taking out advertisements warning customers, and introducing tamper-proof packaging – became a staple business-school lesson in reputation-buffing. If the company really sat on troubling data relating to a product used on babies around the world, it might end up being taught as a counter-example."
4.462709716037357," J&J kept a guiding hand on talc safety research LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson developed a strategy in the 1970s to deal with a growing volume of research showing that talc miners had elevated rates of lung disease and cancer: Promote the positive, challenge the negative. That approach was summed up by a J&J applied research director in a “strictly confidential” March 3, 1975, memo to managers of the baby products division, which used the talc in J&J’s signature Baby Powder. “Our current posture with respect to the sponsorship of talc safety studies has been to initiate studies only as dictated by confrontation,” the memo said. “This philosophy, so far, has allowed us to neutralize or hold in check data already generated by investigators who question the safety of talc.” Also, the memo said, “we minimize the risk of possible self-generation of scientific data which may be politically or scientifically embarrassing.” J&J’s effort to protect its iconic Baby Powder franchise by shaping research was led by physician and scientist executives. An early 1970s study of 1,992 Italian talc miners shows how it worked: J&J commissioned and paid for the study, told the researchers the results it wanted, and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal. The effort entailed other attempts to influence research, including a U.S. government study of the health of talc workers in Vermont. J&J’s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary, one of several mine operators involved in the study, developed a relationship with the U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health researchers to “even influence the conclusions” through suggestions of “subjective interpretations,” according to a 1973 Windsor Minerals memo. Peter Bicks, outside counsel for J&J, told Reuters in an email that for the Vermont study, company “representatives acted in an ‘educational and advisory capacity’ to provide the researchers with a realistic study plan.” A 1979 article in the Journal of Environmental Pathology and Toxicology detailing the findings of the study was not good news for talc. It reported a “significant increase” in “respiratory cancer mortality” among miners. A subsequent analysis of the underlying data published in 1988 determined that at least one of the workers died of mesothelioma, the cancer most closely associated with asbestos. The proposal to study the health of miners of the Italian talc used in Baby Powder for decades came from William Ashton, J&J’s longtime talc supply chief. Ashton had obtained a summary of miners’ medical records compiled by an Italian physician, who also happened to control the country’s talc exports. J&J should use those records “for maximum benefit,” Ashton said in a May 8, 1973, letter to Dr Gavin Hildick-Smith, J&J’s director of medical affairs. “It seems to me that the Italian records give us the opportunity to fortify a position on talc safety.” At the time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was considering a limit on asbestos in talcs. In an Oct. 18, 1973, memo, Hildick-Smith advised J&J: “The risk/benefit ratio of conducting an epidemiological study in these mines must be considered.” By early 1974, the study was a go. Hildick-Smith sent money to the Italian talc exporter-physician to hire a team of researchers. Hildick-Smith told the lead researcher in a June 26, 1974, letter exactly what J&J wanted: data that “would show that the incidence of cancer in these subjects is no different from that of the Italian population or the rural control group.” That is exactly what J&J got, Hildick-Smith told colleagues a few months later. At a meeting on Sept. 27, 1974, for a “Talc/powder Safety Studies Review,” he reported the Italian study would dispel the “cancer concern associated with exposure to talc.” The following spring, Hildick-Smith got a draft of the Italian study from the lead researcher. It needed work to meet the “form and style” requirements of the target journal, he told colleagues in a March 31, 1975, memo. He added that he would send it to a scientific ghostwriter “who will hold it in confidence and rewrite it.” The article that appeared in 1976 in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported results even better than J&J had bargained for. The study found fewer lung cancer deaths than expected, a result that the authors said supported “the thesis of no cancerogenic effect attributable to pure talc.” It also found no mesothelioma, the signature cancer of asbestos exposure. There is no evidence J&J manipulated or misused the data. Experts for plaintiffs have testified that the Italian study was too small to draw any conclusions about the incidence of such a rare cancer. J&J’s expert witnesses have concluded the opposite. Bicks noted that the Italian study has been updated three times – in 1979, 2003 and 2017 – “confirming the lack of association between exposure to asbestos-free talc, lung cancer and mesothelioma.” J&J got a lot of mileage out of the study. It was cited in a review article titled “The Biology of Talc,” published Nov. 1, 1976, in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine. In addition to dozens of published studies, the review cited unpublished research, including one experiment that used a doll as a proxy for infants and that supported the company’s position on the safety of talc. It didn’t disclose that J&J had commissioned the unpublished research. The author of the review article concluded that the “concern that has been expressed about the possible health hazard from consumer exposure to cosmetic talc is unwarranted … There is no evidence that its normal use poses a hazard to health.” The author was Hildick-Smith, the J&J physician executive who had overseen the Italian study and played a key role in the company’s talc safety research. The article did not disclose his J&J connection, identifying him only as a Rutgers University clinical assistant professor. Hildick-Smith died in 2006."

The decline in shares erased about $40 billion from the company’s market capitalization, with investors worrying about the impact of the report as it faces thousands of talc-related lawsuits. The stock was the biggest drag on the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX indexes and was among the most traded on U.S. exchanges. About 28 million shares exchanged hands by 1830 GMT, more than three times its 25-day moving average. J&J was found to have known about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products from as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. The report also said the company had commissioned and paid for studies conducted on its Baby Powder franchise and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal. In response to the report, the company said “any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.” “This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer,” Ernie Knewitz, J&J’s vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to the report. The company also said Baby Powder was asbestos-free and added it would continue to defend the safety of its product. At least two Wall Street analysts said the stock appeared to be oversold on the news. “In our opinion litigation overhangs are real, and we do not minimize the situation, but the stock pull back does seem over done to us,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said. J&J, in 1976, had assured the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that no asbestos was “detected in any sample” of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 when at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc. The company has been battling more than 10,000 cases claiming its Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The products have also been linked with mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer that affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities. “We believe it is highly unlikely the company’s exposure to this talc issue will even come close to the $40 billion in lost market cap today,” J.P. Morgan analysts said. They added that talc was not an issue that would resolve quickly for J&J and expect shares to trade at a lower multiple pending further clarity on the company’s exposure to the issue. While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed to a mere 0.5 percent of its revenue of $76.5 billion last year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against the company. However, Baby Powder is considered essential to J&J’s image as a caring company – a “sacred cow,” as one 2003 internal email put it. CFRA Research analyst Colin Sarcola said, “We see today’s news potentially impacting sales of everything from baby shampoo to prosthetic hips.” “Given these elevated risks, we no longer feel JNJ shares are attractive at recent prices,” Sarcola added. Shares were last down 8 percent at $135.85, also pulling down the broader S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC."

-4.756559749860997," J&J says its psoriasis drug superior to Novartis treatment in study (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said its drug, Tremfya, was found to be more effective than a rival medicine from Novartis AG in reducing the severity and affected area in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a late-stage study. After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the 1,048 participants treated with Tremfya showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, compared with 70 percent on Novartis’s Cosentyx, J&J said. J&J is positioning Tremfya as a better alternative to Cosentyx as it seeks to take market share away from Novartis’s drug, which was launched two years ago and is among the top-selling treatments in the $11 billion global psoriasis market. That market is expected to double to $21.11 billion by 2022, according to U.S. consultant Grand View Research. With $2.1 billion in sales in 2017, Cosentyx has become one of the top revenue earners for Novartis and is expected to make up for falling revenue from its blood cancer treatment, Gleevec, whose patent expired two years ago. On a media briefing following the release of J&J’s trial results, Novartis said it expected the data to have “limited clinical relevance” and no impact on plans to expand the Cosentyx label. J&J also said Cosentyx demonstrated quicker effectiveness than Tremfya during the study. “These results imply that Cosentyx remains a good option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients that want to achieve more rapid skin clearance,” brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note following the results. “We see Cosentyx secure as a mainstay psoriasis therapy.” Psoriasis is a chronic condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells, resulting in inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful. About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have moderate-to-severe form of the disease, J&J said. Tremfya, first approved in July 2017 as a plaque psoriasis treatment in the United States, is also being tested as a for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Shares of J&J closed up marginally at $148. U.S.-listed shares of Novartis closed up 1.2 percent ."

The settlement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc, which became a subsidiary of J&J following a 2017 acquisition, was the largest so far to result from an industry-wide probe into drugmakers’ support of patient assistance charities. The government said Actelion from 2014 to 2015 used a charity as a conduit to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of thousands of Medicare patients using its pulmonary artery hypertension treatments Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Opsumit. That charity, Caring Voice Coalition (CVC), has stopped providing aid after the government in 2017 revoked its approval to do so because of concerns drugmakers had improper influence over it. Actelion did not admit wrongdoing. Caroline Pavis, a company spokeswoman, in a statement said the conduct pre-dated New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J’s acquisition of Actelion and that it was committed to following the law. Richmond, Virginia-based CVC said it cannot comment on “ongoing legal matters.” Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent. Amid increased attention on rising drug prices in the United States, there has been concern that donations from drugmakers to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation. A probe led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts has led to allegations that several drugmakers used these charitable foundations as a means to pay Medicare patients’ co-pays in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. In Actelion’s case, the government said it routinely obtained data from CVC regarding the extent that patients it helped used its drugs. Actelion then used that information to budget for future payments to the charity. CVC was at the center of an earlier, $210 million settlement by United Therapeutics Corp in December 2017, which resolved claims the company improperly used the charity to cover co-payments. Several other drugmakers have, since 2015, disclosed receiving subpoenas related to the investigation. Pfizer Inc in May resolved similar allegations involving a different charity for nearly $23.85 million. Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc and Lundbeck earlier this year disclosed they had reached agreements to resolve similar claims for $57 million and $52.6 million, respectively."

-4.541238481901959," JNJ-AbbVie cancer drug Imbruvica succeeds in late-stage trial (Reuters) - Johnson and Johnson said on Tuesday a combination therapy containing its blockbuster cancer drug Imbruvica significantly improved survival in blood cancer patients, compared with drugs currently used as the standard of care. In the study, Imbruvica, jointly sold with AbbVie Inc, was given to newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients aged 70 or younger, in combination with Roche AG’s Rituxan. The combination was tested against Rituxan administered with chemotherapy drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and patients showed a 65 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death, AbbVie said in a statement. “We have been eagerly awaiting a new treatment regimen that could help younger chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. These findings further support Imbruvica-based therapy as an efficacious first-line treatment for many patients with CLL,” said Danelle James, head of clinical science at Pharmacyclics LLC, a unit of AbbVie. The treatment also significantly improved overall survival of patients, compared to the standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen, the two companies said. The drug was first approved in November 2013 for adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy. CLL is one of the two most common forms of leukemia in adults and is a type of cancer that can develop from cells in the bone marrow that later mature into certain white blood cells. About 115,000 patients in the United States suffer from the disease with nearly 20,000 new diagnoses every year, AbbVie said."

The injection when used with standard of care drugs, Celgene Corp’s Revlimid and dexamethasone, reduced the risk of the disease spreading or death by 44 percent at about 28 months in patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. At 30 months, the cancer did not spread in 71 percent of patients who were administered the Darzalex combination therapy, compared with 56 percent of patients on the standard of care treatment, the company said. The company plans to make its regulatory submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next year for the treatment, which was first approved by the FDA in November 2015 as a monotherapy for multiple myeloma patients who had received at least three prior therapies. “The median age for diagnosis is the 70s and this study involves patients who are over 65. So this study allows us to compare adding Darzalex to the standard of care in essentially the largest portion of patients with multiple myeloma, which are elderly patients,” Mark Wildgust, the vice president of global medical affairs at J&J unit Janssen Oncology, told Reuters. Darzalex, chemically known as daratumumab, had third quarter sales of $498 million and is expected to bring in $2.01 billion this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

-5.9877662810449," New jury fails to reach verdict in J&J South Carolina talc cancer trial (Reuters) - A second South Carolina jury on Thursday failed to reach a verdict in the retrial of a case by a woman whose family said her long-term use of Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder led to her death from asbestos-related cancer. The case of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, is the latest in a series of trials in the United States that centre around allegations that the company’s talc-based powder contains cancer-causing asbestos. In May, a deadlocked jury at the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas in Charleston failed to reach a verdict in the first trial. J&J, which denies the allegations, to date has lost two trials and won three in the litigation over whether Johnson’s Baby Powder causes mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. Jury trials in another four mesothelioma cases have resulted in mistrials because jurors could not agree on a verdict or because the plaintiff died. J&J, faced with some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, in a statement on Thursday said it believed the mistrials, as well as the verdicts clearing it of liability reflected the “diligent review” by juries in the cases. “We look forward to a new trial to present our defence, which rests on decades of independent, non-litigation-driven scientific evaluations, none of which have found that Johnson’s Baby Powder contains asbestos,” the company said. Christopher Swett, a lawyer for Boyd-Bostic’s family, in a statement said plaintiffs were disappointed with Thursday’s result. Swett said the trial court judge had urged the parties to consider a settlement, but that J&J “refuses to be reasonable and take responsibility.” The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company in the past has said that it was not considering to settle talc cases and currently is appealing all jury verdicts against it.

-6.297876120078241," Jury clears J&J of liability in California talc cancer case (Reuters) - A California jury on Wednesday cleared Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N of liability in a case involving a woman who alleged that the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused her cancer, the company said. The jury in Humboldt County Superior Court in Eureka, California rejected claims by Carla Allen who said that her mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, was caused by the company’s talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder. J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that J&J knew of asbestos fibers in its cosmetic talc and concealed risks associated with the products. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company faces some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, according to an October regulatory filing. More than 9,700 of those cases involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in New Jersey federal court, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed. The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J’s talc caused them to develop mesothelioma. J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it was pleased with the jury’s decision in the case of Allen. “While we deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from any form of cancer, the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by her use of our talcum-based products,” the company said. The California jury reached its decision following a roughly seven-week long jury trial, court records showed, but further details were not immediately available. Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J to date has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases. It has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, with juries awarding a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are under appeal. Four additional mesothelioma cases resulted in a mistrial because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died. In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal."

-6.701060684505261," Johnson & Johnson makes $2.1 billion offer to buy out Japan cosmetics firm Ci:z TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Tuesday it will buy all outstanding shares of Japanese skincare firm Ci:z Holdings Co Ltd 4924.T that it does not already own for 230 billion yen ($2.05 billion) in cash. J&J is betting the deal - which will give it ownership of popular brands such as Dr.Ci:Labo, Labo Labo and Genomer - will help it strengthen its international innovation pipeline. The purchase adds to a flurry of cosmetics deals in Asia in recent years, as global brands seek to expand in a booming region that includes the $53.5 billion China market by leveraging Asian brands’ smart online marketing and fast turnaround times for new products. France's L'Oreal SA OREP.PA agreed to buy South Korean makeup and fashion firm Nanda in May, and Unilever NV UNc.AS bought cosmetics firm Carver Korea for $2.7 billion last year. LVMH LVMH.PA and Estee Lauder Companies Inc EL.N have also invested in South Korean cosmetics firms. J&J will pay 5,900 yen per Ci:z share, a 55 percent premium over Tuesday’s closing price, and also acquire the shares owned by the Japanese firm’s founder Yoshinori Shirono, J&J said in a statement.

J&J is the second-largest shareholder, owning 19.9 percent through an affiliate since 2016, allowing it to distribute Ci:z’s brands outside of Japan. J&J expects the full acquisition will help it leverage the large consumer database of the collagen gel and medical skin products maker. “This transaction will maximise value creation ... by bringing in an agile innovation model and rapidly accelerating sales through our global commercialization expertise,” Jorge Mesquita, worldwide chairman at Johnson & Johnson’s consumer division, said in the statement.

-5.641952510708454," J&J beats profit estimates, lifts outlook on pharma unit strength (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson reported slightly better-than-expected third quarter profit and raised its full-year forecast on Tuesday as increased demand for cancer drugs and immune disorder treatments powered strong results for its pharmaceutical unit. Shares of the healthcare conglomerate were up 2.3 percent at $137 in morning trading after it raised its adjusted 2018 earnings forecast to a range of $8.13 to $8.18 per share from a prior view of $8.07 to $8.17. Solid prescription drug sales helped offset continued disappointment in the medical devices segment. Executives on a conference call said that business would start to grow in-line or better than the market by 2020. “We are not satisfied with the performance in medical devices,” Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said after the unit’s quarterly sales missed Wall Street estimates. Pricing pressure has impacted all categories in orthopedics, the company said, adding that it will consider both transformative acquisitions and smaller, tuck-in deals to support the business. The company has been selling off certain businesses, such as diabetes care devices, to focus on better performing units and development of new products. Overall sales rose 3.6 percent to $20.35 billion in the quarter, exceeding analysts’ average estimate of $20.05 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Pharmaceuticals sale rose 6.7 percent to $10.35 billion, fueled by double-digit sales growth for prostate cancer drug Zytiga and Stelara for Chrohn’s disease and psoriasis Zytiga sales surged 43 percent to $958 million, blowing past the consensus estimate of $795 million, according to Barclays. Stelara sales jumped 16.5 percent to $1.31 billion, above expectations of about $1.27 billion. Sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade fell 16.3 percent to $1.38 billion due to increasing competition from cheaper biosimilar versions. Newer blood cancer drug Darzalex brought in sales of $498 million, falling short of lofty Wall Street estimates of about $510 million. Medical device sales were down 0.2 percent at $6.59 billion, while consumer products sales rose 1.8 percent to $3.42 billion, helped by the U.S. relaunch of the Johnson’s baby brand. Excluding items, the company earned $2.05 per share, edging past analysts’ average forecasts by 2 cents. Wolk said on Tuesday that while J&J was supportive of more transparency in drug pricing, the company does not believe a Trump administration proposal for requiring the list price of medicines at the end of television ads would be helpful. He said including those prices in commercials could be somewhat confusing and “act as a deterrent to good responsible healthcare.”"

-5.641952510708454," CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Johnson & Johnson edges past profit estimates, lifts outlook (Corrects to “applauds” from “agrees” in last paragraph) Oct 16 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson reported slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and pushed its full-year forecast higher, as demand for its cancer drugs Zytiga and Imbruvica helped offset falling sales of arthritis treatment Remicade. Shares were unchanged in premarket trading, with the company forecasting adjusted 2018 earnings per share in the range of $8.13 and $8.18, marginally up from a previous range of $8.07 to $8.17. Overall sales rose 3.6 percent to $20.35 billion in the quarter, higher than the average estimate of $20.05 billion. “This is exactly how we want to start the third earnings season,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch wrote in a note, referring to the overall sales number. As Remicade faces increased competition and sales of medical devices and some consumer products weaken, J&J has been relying on its new cancer drugs as well as deals like the $30 billion purchase of rare disease specialist Actelion last year. Sales of prostate cancer drug Zytiga surged ahead of analysts’ estimates and raked in $958 million in the quarter, compared with the consensus estimate of $795 million, according to Barclays. Sales of Stelara, which is used to treat psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, jumped 16.5 percent to $1.31 billion, above the average estimate of $1.27 billion. Remicade sales fell 16.3 percent to $1.38 billion, but narrowly beat the consensus estimate of $1.36 billion.

-2.460399168070837," Jury clears J&J of liability in New Jersey talc cancer case (Reuters) - A New Jersey jury on Thursday cleared Johnson & Johnson of liability in a case involving a woman who alleged that the company’s talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused her cancer. After less than a day of deliberations, the jury in New Brunswick, New Jersey rejected claims by Rosalind Henry and her husband, who had alleged that Henry’s mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure, was caused by the company’s talc products. J&J is facing some 10,600 liability lawsuits across the United States over its talc products, most involving claims that they caused ovarian cancer, and that the company knew of and concealed risks associated with the products. The company, which is based just a few miles from the courtroom where the latest case took place, said it was pleased with the unanimous jury verdict. “We have deep sympathy for anyone diagnosed with any form of cancer and appreciate that people are looking for answers. However, Johnson’s baby powder is not the cause of this disease,” the company said in a statement. It said decades of scientific testing by academic institutions and regulators have shown its talc to be safe and free of asbestos. A lawyer for Henry did not immediately return a request for comment. During trial, Henry’s lawyers said J&J had known for decades about asbestos fibers in its talc, but hid the evidence from regulators and consumers. J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. In April, J&J lost the first trial over such allegations when a jury in New Jersey awarded $117 million to a man suffering from mesothelioma and his wife. It lost another trial in May, when a California jury awarded $25.7 million to a woman diagnosed with mesothelioma. Both decisions are under appeal. Since then, the company has had four mistrials in similar cases because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died. In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal."

Two doses of Stelara, already approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, was tested in 961 patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who had failed prior therapy. Both 6 mg/kg and 130 mg doses of the intravenous treatment showed clinical remission in significantly more patients, compared with those on placebo, after eight weeks, the company said. The treatment and the placebo arms reported similar proportion of side effects, with one patient on the 6 mg/kg dose dying following excessive bleeding, J&J said. The patient had no prior history of high blood pressure or cirrhosis, the drugmaker said. “More than half of UC patients have not experienced remission with currently available treatment options,” the study’s lead investigator Bruce Sands said. Stelara, which brought in sales of $1.34 billion in the second quarter of 2018, is also being tested in autoimmune disease lupus. Ulcerative colitis, which affects about 38,000 people in the United States annually, is a chronic condition causing abdominal pain, intestinal ulcers, bloody diarrhea and weight loss.

-7.233842751170627," Fund gives J&J, Oxford experts $19 million to fight deadly viruses LONDON (Reuters) - A global coalition set up to fight emerging epidemics said on Thursday it would give up to $19 million to drugmaker Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine unit and Oxford University experts to work on immunisations against three major diseases. Research will focus on the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, the brain-damaging Nipah virus, and the Lassa virus, which causes haemorrghagic fever, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said. Both J&J’s Janssen Vaccines unit and specialists at Oxford’s Jenner Institute were involved in the development of vaccines against Ebola during the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The hope is that some of that experience will speed up work against new emerging infectious diseases, CEPI’s chief executive officer Richard Hatchett said in a statement. MERS first emerged in humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to infect more than 2,200 people in dozens of countries. The vast majority of the cases - around 1,800 of them - have been in Saudi Arabia. MERS is related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and kills one in three of those it infects. Oxford has started early-stage development of a potential MERS vaccine. In collaboration with Janssen, it will receive $14.6 million from CEPI to fund manufacturing of a batch for second-phase testing, with an option to provide extra funds for possible stockpiling if the results look promising. CEPI will also provide funding of up to $2.1 million for early-stage development of a Lassa vaccine and up to $2.0 million to explore Nipah vaccine potential. Both Lassa and Nipah viruses cause small but frequent outbreaks of disease in Asia and Africa, and experts say they have shown the capacity to spread across borders and become fast-growing and potential deadly epidemics. Hatchett said the deal showed the coalition’s aim: “To drive development of vaccines to protect humanity against threats posed by emerging infectious diseases and to bring together the expertise of academia and the public and private sectors”. CEPI, set up in January 2017, was designed to avoid the kind of slow response seen in the West African 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, which killed more than 11,300 people before an effective vaccine was developed. The group is funded by Norway, Germany, Japan, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Britain’s Wellcome Trust."

6.580324930912182," J&J to work with India on compensation for recalled hip implants MUMBAI (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (J&J) said it would work with the Indian government to compensate patients who had suffered from hip implants that were recalled by the U.S. healthcare firm eight years ago after data showed high failure rates. This follows last week’s recommendation from a government panel that J&J pay at least 2 million rupees ($27,812) to each patient for the faulty ASR hip implant. The federal government has asked states to help patients get relief soon. About 93,000 people worldwide received ASR implants which were recalled in 2010. The Indian panel said in its report that about 4,700 of those people were in India. Given the recent committee report, “we are seeking to work with the Indian government to develop an appropriate process for providing further support and compensation for patients in need”, a J&J spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters, adding the firm was committed to support all ASR patients in India. Sushobhan Dasgupta, a senior J&J executive in India, has, however, told Indian newspaper Mint that the company “will not pay people who had an ASR implant if they are doing well”. The company is not okay with the methodology used by the Indian panel, Dasgupta told the paper in an interview here published on Friday. The report has ""factual inaccuracies"" and ""the conclusions could also be inaccurate"", he added. In 2013, J&J agreed to pay reut.rs/I20AZB nearly $2.5 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits from patients in the United States who said they were injured by the implants. In India, the company paid $2 million to patients for repeat surgeries and about $250,000 in related diagnostic costs under its ASR reimbursement program, but the government panel has criticized J&J for offering no compensation. Metal hip implant systems such as ASR were designed to be more durable than a traditional metal-on-plastic, ball-and-socket design. But many Indian patients suffered adverse reactions to the implant, the panel said. J&J entered the Indian market in 1947 when it started selling its now-ubiquitous baby powder. It has in recent years faced issues such as price caps on medical devices. ($1 = 71.9100 Indian rupees)"

6.827772173164656," Bayer, J&J's bid to further widen use of Xarelto hits snag FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s campaign to widen the patient group for their heart drug Xarelto hit a snag when two smaller studies failed to show a statistically reliant benefit. The blockbuster clot prevention drug could not be shown with statistical significance to help heart failure patients after an acute worsening of their condition, results from the so-called Commander HF trial showed on Monday. The primary goal of showing a reduction in the risk of death, heart attack and stroke was not reached. On Sunday, a separate study called Mariner produced no clear evidence that Xarelto reduced the rate of dangerous blood clots among a certain group of high-risk patients after discharge from hospital. [L8N1VF3OK] Bayer chalked up 3.3 billion euros ($3.84 billion) in Xarelto revenues last year, mainly from stroke prevention in the elderly, and expects annual sales to rise above 5 billion euros. A Bayer spokesman said that the latest results, also presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Munich, did not change its peak sales estimate or have any implications for other conditions that Xarelto is approved for. It is a reversal of fortunes for Bayer, which in July won approval for additional Xarelto use in the potentially lucrative market for atherosclerosis patients. Bayer has the marketing rights for the drug outside the United States while partner J&J sells Xarelto in the U.S., with Bayer being eligible for royalties on U.S. sales of 20 to 30 percent."

6.364937579346015," Missouri judge affirms $4.69 billion talc verdict, J&J vows to appeal (Reuters) - A Missouri trial court judge has affirmed the massive $4.69 billion verdict against Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N in a case involving 22 women and their families who alleged the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it would continue to pursue all available appellate remedies. The company, which denies the allegations and says its talc is safe, previously said it was confident the verdict would be overturned on appeal. In a series of orders on Tuesday evening, Judge Rex Burlison of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis affirmed the jury’s July 12 decision in favor of the women, six of whom have died. “The Court finds there is no just reason for delay and hereby certifies this judgment as final for purposes of appeal,” Burlison wrote in the judgments. Defendants in civil cases can generally file so-called post-trial motions, asking the trial court judge to reduce a verdict or set it aside entirely, but J&J did not file such motions. It can now take up the cases with a Missouri appeals court. The jury found the company’s talc-based products had caused the women’s cancer, awarding $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages to all plaintiffs. Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the women, in a statement on Wednesday said he was confident the judgment would be upheld on appeal. “We hope this judgment will compel Johnson & Johnson to take responsible, effective action in acknowledging the inherent dangers of the use of talc, and specifically the use of Johnson’s Baby Powder and similar products,” Lanier said. The verdict was the largest to date arising from lawsuits alleging products like J&J’s Baby Powder cause cancer. The company faces some 10,600 cases nationwide over talc, according to an August regulatory filing. J&J has called the five-week St. Louis trial “fundamentally unfair” and its Chief Executive Alex Gorsky has expressed confidence the jury decision will be overturned on appeal. J&J has been successful at having other talc verdicts in Missouri thrown out on appeal. A lawyer for the company told Reuters J&J would focus on jurisdictional arguments and put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company’s talc-based products never contained asbestos."

6.874610242868351," U.S. insurers grilled on exposure to $4.7 billion J&J talc verdict (Reuters) - Wall Street is trying to figure out whether the U.S. insurance industry will bear any costs from a record $4.69 billion judgment against Johnson & Johnson awarded to customers and their families who claimed that asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer. Analysts have flagged talc litigation as a financial risk for insurers, including Travelers Companies Inc, Chubb Ltd and The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. On company earnings calls in recent days, they peppered executives with questions about where exposure might lie. Many of the policies were written decades ago, and some liability may have been offloaded to reinsurers, making it hard to tell who might be on the hook for payments. “I wanted to get a sense as to whether this is going to turn into a bigger deal and catch us by surprise,” said Buckingham Research Group analyst Amit Kumar, who asked about the issue during W.R. Berkley Corp’s call last week. “The J&J news prompted us to revisit this topic.” J&J has repeatedly denied that its talc products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos or cause cancer. Insurance executives have not given definitive answers, citing uncertainty about how litigation will play out or what role reinsurance might play. Policies that may cover asbestos liability were underwritten at least as far back as the 1970s. “In J&J’s case, we would not be surprised if the plaintiffs’ bar found a way to trigger coverage under its old liability policies, which we think could lead to additional exposure for insurers,” Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote in a research note on Tuesday. Travelers, Chubb and The Hartford may have exposure, Gelb said. Representatives for Chubb, Travelers, the Hartford and W.R. Berkely declined to provide additional comments beyond their executives’ remarks during the calls. Asked whether the J&J judgment is launching a new era of risk for insurers, Chubb Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said he is not concerned. He noted that asbestos litigation against different industries crops up every few years. “It could have been Congoleum manufacturers who made floor tiles,” Greenberg said last week. “This gets a headline because it’s baby powder.” The $4.69 billion verdict by a Missouri on July 12 is the largest judgment against J&J to date over decades-long allegations that its talc-based products cause cancer. [L1N1U81WS] The New Jersey-based healthcare conglomerate has said it believes the verdict will not stand on appeal. “We are confident that there are multiple grounds for reversal of this jury verdict and that, ultimately, the case will be reversed,” J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this month. The company has had previous success overturning large verdicts in cases alleging harm from its products. J&J, which faces 9,000 cases nationwide over talc, stopped buying product liability coverage in 2005 because it was expensive and not widely available, according to a regulatory filing. Instead, it has a self-insurance program through a subsidiary, Middlesex Assurance Company Ltd, according to a filing and court documents. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz did not respond to requests for comment on its insurance coverage. It is unclear how much of a role reinsurance will play for insurers or J&J. The Hartford entered a reinsurance pact with Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s National Indemnity Company in 2016 for asbestos and environmental claims. But the terms excluded coverage for “alleged connections between talc and ovarian cancer,” Hartford Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara said during a conference call on Friday. The Hartford spokesman Matthew Sturdevant declined further comment. Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman for insurance operations, Ajit Jain, declined to comment. Other insurance executives said they have been monitoring talc litigation for years and will continue to do so. “The general theme is to let the process play out,” Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan said in an interview.

11.145496983329581," Women who sued J&J declare victory after $4.69 billion talc verdict NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who claimed her cancer was caused by using Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder for decades said she believes justice was served after a jury found the company should pay her and 21 other women $4.69 billion in damages. A St. Louis jury on July 12 concluded that J&J’s talc-based products contained asbestos, causing the 22 women, six of whom have died, to develop ovarian cancer. J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky earlier this week expressed confidence that the jury decision will be overturned on appeal. “Justice has been served” regardless of the ultimate outcome, Toni Roberts, 62, told Reuters in a telephone interview. “We have made a difference. We have alerted the public,” said Roberts of Philadelphia, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014. New Jersey-based J&J, which is battling some 9,000 talc product liability cases, has consistently denied that the products cause cancer and says they never contained asbestos. The St. Louis trial was the first to allege asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer. J&J has successfully overturned prior verdicts in the talc litigation. A company lawyer told Reuters J&J would argue on appeal that the case was based on flawed science, and that it should not have been heard in Missouri because many of the defendants were from out-of-state. A 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision severely restricted state courts’ jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies. One of the women in the Missouri case, Krystal Kim, from West Chester, Pennsylvania, told Reuters she had been using J&J baby powder several times a day since she was 10. The now 53-year-old Kim said she put the powder on bed sheets, carpets, her hair, face and body and even on her dog. Kim said she put her faith in the brand because of its promise of purity. “They call it baby powder to make it seem innocuous,” she said. Kim and Roberts said J&J should take its talc-based powder off the market or add a warning label. J&J has said those steps were unnecessary, citing scientific tests concluding talc does not cause cancer or contain asbestos. During the trial, the company’s lawyer, Peter Bicks, said J&J had deep compassion for the women, but that the company was not to blame for their diseases. “Just because something terrible happened doesn’t mean that Johnson & Johnson had anything to do with it,” Bicks said."
8.736245444055841," Dollar firms after Fed chair's upbeat remarks, global stocks gain NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Tuesday against a basket of major currencies following an upbeat economic assessment from the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, while world stocks climbed as a heavy week of corporate earnings also kicked into gear. Wall Street’s main indexes erased losses from the start of the session to end solidly positive. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level in nearly a decade, with the yield curve at its flattest in nearly 11 years. In testimony, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he sees the United States on track for years more of steady growth. “He reiterated the view of the economy as being strong, growing at a solid pace with recent inflation data as more or less encouraging,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Powell was challenged in a congressional hearing by senators worried the Trump administration’s trade policies were already damaging businesses. Concerns over a global trade dispute have roiled markets over the past few months. But in written testimony to the Senate Banking Committee and in his response to questions about a possible “trade war,” Powell largely discounted the risks. “He basically completely dismissed any concerns about a trade tariff war,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.

8.736245444055841," J&J beats quarterly expectations on drug sales surge, shares jump (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported better-than-expected second quarter profit as sales of pharmaceuticals surged 20 percent despite a sharp decline in blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade, and its shares rose more than 4 percent. The healthcare conglomerate also expressed confidence that last week’s finding by a Missouri jury that J&J’s talc-based products caused cancer, and an order to pay a record $4.69 billion to defendants, would not stand. “We are confident that there are multiple grounds for reversal of this jury verdict and that, ultimately, the case will be reversed,” Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said on a call with analysts. He said the products do not contain asbestos or cause ovarian cancer. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said he expects J&J to be aggressive in fighting these lawsuits, “and the final related payments will not cause a major impact to its valuation.” J&J shares were up 3.2 percent at $128.70 after earlier climbing as much as 4.6 percent - the biggest one-day percentage gain in over two years. Gorsky acknowledged that sales growth in the consumer products division and some segments of medical devices were disappointing. New drugs and those in development “position us well to outgrow the market for many years to come,” he said. As the first major drugmaker to report second quarter results, Gorsky addressed intensifying political pressure to reduce costs of prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. J&J said overall net prices of its drugs would be about 4.5 percent lower this year after rebates and discounts. It did not say anything about lowering list prices of its medicines. When looking for potential solutions, Gorsky said: “We need to be extremely careful and cognizant about avoiding unintended consequences which may ... decrease patients’ access to affordable and quality health care.” J&J narrowed its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast, raising the midpoint by 2 cents. It now expects $8.07 to $8.17 per share, up from its prior view of $8.00 to $8.20. Excluding items, the company reported a profit of $2.10 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents. Sales of Stelara for psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases jumped 36 percent to $1.34 billion, while sales of prostate cancer drug Zytiga surged 63 percent to $909 million. The company said it does not expect generic competition for Zytiga this year. Cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica also experienced high double-digit sales increases that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, with sales of $511 million and $620 million, respectively. New psoriasis drug Tremfya was off to a strong start, taking in $126 million, above analysts’ estimates of about $70 million. Sales of Remicade, faced with competition from cheaper biosimilar versions, fell 13.7 percent to $918 million. Net earnings rose to $3.95 billion, or $1.45 per share, from $3.83 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. Total sales rose 10.6 percent to $20.83 billion, topping analysts’ estimates of $20.39 billion. J&J lowered its full-year sales forecast to $80.5 billion to $81.3 billion from $81.0 billion to $81.8 billion, citing a strengthening dollar for the trim."

Powell, discounting the risk that a trade war may throw a global recovery off track, said there were still “several years” of strong jobs and low inflation ahead for the United States, and that an era of stable growth may continue provided the Fed gets its policy decisions right. “He reiterated the view of the economy as being strong, growing at a solid pace with recent inflation data as more or less encouraging, and he’s taking the same stance he did in the last statement,” Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “His takeaway was job market is strong, inflation is going to stay near 2 percent, that means two more hikes this year, in line with the dot plot.” Powell’s comments come as investors focus more on company forecasts to assess the sustainability of earnings growth in the wake of escalating U.S.-China trade dispute. Analysts have forecast a near 21 percent surge in second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Helping bolster market optimism was Johnson & Johnson , which rose 4 percent after the healthcare giant beat quarterly profit estimates on strong demand for cancer drugs. The stock gave the biggest boost the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. Netflix slumped 7.9 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day drop in two years after the company’s quarterly subscriber growth missed expectations, fanning fears that its rapid expansion is slowing. The stock, one the best performing this year, weighed the most on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. At 11:19 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.26 points, or 0.07 percent, at 25,081.62, the S&P 500 was up 5.82 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,804.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 14.21 points, or 0.18 percent, at 7,819.93. Three of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by 0.4 percent decline in energy stocks due to drop in U.S. crude oil prices. The top gainer was the materials index , which rose 0.9 percent. UnitedHealth dropped 3.5 percent and was the biggest drag on Dow after the health insurer reported quarterly medical costs that were slightly higher than expectations. Goldman Sachs slipped 1.3 percent after reporting trading results that were weaker than some rivals, with analysts pointing out that its better-than-expected profit was due to low-profile businesses such as investing and lending. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.49-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.69-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded six new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 32 new lows.

7.0135201961170806," J&J vows to overturn $4.7 billion talc verdict but experts see hurdles NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has vowed to appeal a $4.7 billion verdict awarded to 22 women who claim asbestos-contaminated talc in the company’s products gave them ovarian cancer by arguing the plaintiffs’ science was flawed and the case should not have been heard in Missouri. But several legal experts said that even though J&J has been successful in winning appeals of other talc cases in Missouri, it will face a challenging road in appealing the verdict handed down on Thursday in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis. John Beisner, a lawyer for Johnson & Johnson, said, “One of the hardest things will be prioritizing what to appeal first.” He described to Reuters the company’s jurisdictional and scientific arguments for overturning Thursday’s verdict. In a statement responding to the verdict, J&J reiterated its position that its products never contained asbestos and were not carcinogenic. Thursday’s verdict is the largest to date arising from lawsuits alleging talc-based products like J&J’s baby powder have caused cancer. The jury reached its decision in less than a day, following five weeks of expert testimony from both sides. The stakes are potentially high for J&J, which is facing 9,000 cases nationwide over talc. The company has had previous success in overturning large verdicts in talc cases as well as others alleging harm from its products. But several legal experts said Missouri courts, including at the appellate and supreme court level, were historically plaintiff-friendly and could prove unreceptive to J&J’s arguments. “J&J has strong arguments, but unless they get to certify this case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which are very long odds, this decision is likely to stand,” said Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida. He said he expected J&J would go through the appeals process but would ultimately wind up settling the case. Beisner said he was not aware of any interest in settlement. “Our attention will remain focused on the appeals from this and the other trials awaiting review.” Beisner said jurisdiction will be one major basis for J&J to appeal Thursday’s verdict. Most of the 22 plaintiffs were not Missouri residents, and he said they should not have been allowed to sue New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson in St. Louis under a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that severely restricted state courts’ jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies. J&J seized on that decision to successfully overturn previous talc verdicts in Missouri. Mark Lanier, the plaintiffs’ lawyer who won Thursday’s verdict, said he was ready for that argument. Lanier said his team amassed “hundreds of pages of evidence” showing lobbying efforts and baby powder focus groups J&J conducted in the state. He also spotlighted the claim by 15 of his non-resident clients that they used a specific short-lived J&J talc-based product manufactured by Missouri-based contractor. “I hope they focus their appeal on jurisdiction because I’m confident we’ll win that,” Lanier said. He did say that he expects the punitive damages award to be halved during the appeals process due to a Missouri state law that caps such damages, but is confident the verdict would stand overall. The $4.69 billion in total damages includes $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, said that even under the new Supreme Court guidance, the women’s claim that they used the specific product, if true, provided “a pretty strong link to Missouri.” At trial J&J had unsuccessfully sought to cast doubt on the 15 women’s claims to have used the same product that was only available for a few months, depicting it as a ruse designed to bypass the jurisdiction issue. Beisner said J&J would make the same argument on appeal. Along with jurisdictional arguments, Beisner said the company would continue to put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company’s talc-based products never contained asbestos. “None of plaintiffs’ experts were able to put forward a valid theory and there is simply no science to support what they call asbestos in the product,” said Beisner. J&J says decades of testing by laboratories and independent agencies, including a study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, support its position. The company said plaintiffs’ tests showing asbestos contamination were “junk science.” But Lanier argued that it was the agencies and labs cited by J&J that used flawed testing methods that failed to detect asbestos. Noah said Missouri judges have historically applied a lower standard than federal court for admitting scientific evidence. Last year the state passed a law requiring its courts to adopt the federal standard, but he said state courts would be interpreting that requirement for years to come. “Missouri judges aren’t going to suddenly change their tune,” Noah said."
7.0135201961170806," Jury orders J&J to pay $4.7 billion in Missouri asbestos cancer case (Reuters) - A Missouri jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who alleged the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. The verdict is the largest J&J has faced to date over allegations that its talc-based products cause cancer. The company is battling some 9,000 talc cases. J&J denies both that its talc products cause cancer and that they ever contained asbestos. It says decades of studies show its talc to be safe and has successfully overturned previous talc verdicts on technical legal grounds. Thursday’s massive verdict, handed down in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, was comprised of $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network. J&J in a statement called the trial “fundamentally unfair” and said it would appeal the decision. J&J shares fell $1.31, or 1 percent, to $126.45 in after-hours trading following the punitive damages award. They had risen $1.52 during regular trading. The jury’s decision followed more than five weeks of testimony by nearly a dozen experts on both sides. The women and their families said decades-long use of Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their diseases. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks. “Johnson & Johnson is deeply disappointed in the verdict, which was the product of a fundamentally unfair process,” the company said in a statement. The company said it remained confident that its products do not contain asbestos or cause cancer. “Every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed,” J&J added, saying that it would pursue all available appellate remedies. J&J has successfully overturned talc verdicts in the past, with appeals courts pointing to a 2017 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that limits where personal injury lawsuits can be filed. Of the 22 women in the St. Louis trial, 17 were from outside Missouri, a state generally regarded as friendly towards plaintiffs. The practice of combining plaintiffs in such jurisdictions, commonly criticized as “forum shopping” by defendants, will be challenged on appeal. Mark Lanier, the lawyer for the women, in a statement following the verdict called on J&J to pull its talc products from the market “before causing further anguish, harm, and death from a terrible disease.” “If J&J insists on continuing to sell talc, they should mark it with a serious warning,” Lanier said. The majority of the lawsuits that J&J faces involve claims that talc itself caused ovarian cancer, but a smaller number of cases allege that contaminated talc caused mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. The cases that went to trial in St. Louis effectively combine those claims by alleging asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer. Previous talc trials have produced verdicts as large as $417 million. But that 2017 verdict by a California jury, as well as other verdicts in Missouri, was overturned on appeal, and challenges to at least another five verdicts are pending. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioned a study of various talc samples from 2009 to 2010, including of J&J’s Baby Powder. No asbestos was found in any of the talc samples, the agency said. But Lanier during the trial told jurors that the agency and other laboratories and J&J have used flawed testing methods that did not allow for the proper detection of asbestos fibers. Talc, the world’s softest rock, is a mineral closely linked to asbestos and the two substances can appear in close proximity in the earth. Plaintiffs claim the two can become intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. J&J denies those allegations, saying rigorous testing and purification processes ensure its talc is clean."

15.8900206809226," Missouri appeals court tosses $55 million J&J talc-powder verdict (Reuters) - A Missouri appeals court on Friday threw out a $55 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson in a lawsuit by a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using talc-based products, including J&J’s baby powder, citing a U.S. Supreme court ruling on where such cases can be brought. South Dakota resident Gloria Ristesund had been awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages in the 2016 verdict. She alleged that her decades-long use of J&J talc-based products for feminine hygiene caused her cancer, and that the company had failed to warn consumers about the risks. J&J denied the allegations, saying decades of testing have shown its cosmetic talc-based products to be safe. The healthcare conglomerate is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer and, in some cases, mesothelioma, a rare cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, amid allegations the products were contaminated with asbestos fibers. J&J has said its talc products do not contain asbestos or cause any form of cancer. The unanimous three-judge panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals in the Eastern District, in overturning the verdict, did not rule on the merits of the allegations. The judges instead said the verdict could not stand following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limits where companies can be sued for personal injuries. The high court ruled that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state or when the alleged injuries did not occur there. J&J is based in New Jersey and Ristesund exclusively purchased and used the company’s talc products in South Dakota and Minnesota, according to court records. J&J, in a statement, said it was extremely pleased with the court’s decision to recognize that the trial should have never occurred. Ristesund’s case was one of more than 60 related talc lawsuits consolidated in Missouri state court, where juries have a reputation for issuing high-paying verdicts. But only one of those cases involved a woman from Missouri, leading many of the cases to be tossed on jurisdictional grounds. During the appeals process, Ristesund asked the court for permission to present additional evidence tying J&J to Missouri. The judges on Friday rejected her request, saying she had ample opportunity to present such evidence over the past two years."

14.008854317901207," Stada buys rights to anti-dandruff shampoo Nizoral from J&J MUNICH (Reuters) - German generic drug maker Stada STAGn.DE is buying the rights to anti-dandruff shampoo Nizoral from Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N Janssen Pharmaceutica and could announce further product acquisitions soon, its interim chief executive told Reuters. “I can imagine that we will announce another product deal before I leave,” Claudio Albrecht told Reuters, two months before permanent CEO Peter Goldschmidt is due to take over the helm. Stada, which is controlled by private equity firms Bain and Cinven, said financial details of the deal were confidential. A person familiar with the deal said Stada was paying more than 200 million euros ($231 million) for the rights to Nizoral, sold under the brand name Terzolin in German pharmacies. That compares with sales of around 33 million euros in the EMEA region in 2017. Albrecht also reiterated that Stada aimed to reclaim the rights to a number of its products, following the early termination in January of its license agreement with Sanofi for head lice lotion Hedrin. “We want to buy back (sun cream) Ladival. We are in good talks about that,” he said. In addition, Stada is looking for opportunities to take over entire companies to strengthen its generic drug business in countries including Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.

The Swiss drugmaker said Zessly, its Remicade biosimilar, matched the original medicine for safety and efficacy at 54 weeks, including in patients who switched from the original. Switching from Enbrel to its Erelzi also did not impact efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis at 48 weeks, it said in a statement. Novartis’s generics unit Sandoz is among companies producing cheaper biosimilar copies of some of the most lucrative drugs for autoimmune diseases, in hopes of capturing a share of sales. But it also must convince doctors that its versions are as effective as the original products, including for patients who switch. “It is our hope that these studies will help healthcare providers and patients have confidence that switching to Zessly or Erelzi will continue to deliver the benefits they are receiving from their existing treatment,” said Mark Levick, who heads development of biologic drugs at Sandoz.

13.674411978820064," Investors ready to resuscitate Johnson & Johnson's ailing stock NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N shareholders have endured a painful year amid worries about prospects for its many businesses, but investors capitalizing on the stock's relatively cheap valuation may be set to apply a Band-Aid to the declines. Shares of J&J, the largest U.S. healthcare company by market value, had slumped 11.2 percent this year as of Friday's close, although recent gains may indicate the start of a rebound. The stock's year-to-date decline compares to more than 2 percent gains for both the S&P 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, of which J&J is a member. If J&J ends the year with its current 11.2 percent decline, 2018 will be the worst calendar-year performance in 25 years for the stock, a bellwether for the healthcare sector and one traditionally considered a safe-haven investment during periods of market uncertainty. The diversified company, whose products include Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol pain reliever, replacement knees and cancer and immunology medicines, faces concerns in all three of its main segments - pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer. But the stock’s swoon makes it look particularly cheap, based on its price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 times forward earnings estimates, which is enticing investors, along with the stock’s above-market dividend yield of 2.9 percent. “We are much more upbeat about J&J today than we were six months ago,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York, as the stock traded just above $120 a share. “We definitely think it’s an attractive investment opportunity,” Katz said. J&J shares are up more than 3 percent in June, following five straight months of declines, the stock’s longest such losing streak in over a decade. J&J’s pharmaceuticals segment, roughly half of company revenue, saw sales jump by 19 percent in the first quarter. But concerns about generic-drug competition eroding sales of prostate cancer medicine Zytiga, a standout in the first quarter, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade have investors leery about the segment’s future performance. Pharmaceuticals has been the strongest segment of J&J’s businesses, but “the ability to sustain an above-average growth rate has been a question,” said Dean Dillard, senior research analyst at USAA Investments in San Antonio. J&J’s medical devices segment including its orthopedics business has been losing market share, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager focusing on healthcare for Gabelli & Co. Performance in J&J’s consumer segment has been “pretty lackluster for a few quarters,” Jonas said. The division also may be subject to weak investor sentiment in general for consumer brand companies, amid fierce competition and other concerns. “There is concern around all three of the businesses,” Jonas said. (GRAPHIC: J&J shares in 2018: A stock in need of Tylenol - reut.rs/2Mg5dRC) J&J shares may also be suffering from concerns about scrutiny over prescription drug costs that are undermining pharmaceutical shares broadly. “Sentiment remains fairly negative for the group, so that by and large does not help Johnson & Johnson,” said Kevin Gade, a portfolio analyst, who follows pharmaceutical stocks at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. The stock’s recent valuation at 14.8 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months is its lowest since late 2015 and well below its five-year average of 16.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. J&J is also trading at a nearly 10 percent discount to the S&P 500 .SPX, compared to the slight premium it has held over the benchmark index on average over the past five years. Also appealing, investors said, is J&J’s dividend yield of 2.9 percent compared to 1.9 percent for the S&P 500, as well as the company’s track record of consistently raising it. Aside from paying its dividend, some investors want J&J to use its cash for a stock buyback or for an acquisition to improve its growth prospects. J&J is “capable of doing 10 $5 billion transactions. We don’t have to do a $50 billion transaction,” Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told an investor conference last week. J&J’s broad healthcare portfolio, which offers products that people will require even in economic down times, helps position it as a safe-haven stock in the event of market volatility or an increasingly uncertain economy. “If and when the economy sees negative growth,” Gade said, “relative to the market, Johnson & Johnson is the type of company and business model an investor would want to hold.”"
12.0855873939116," In Missouri, J&J faces biggest trial yet alleging talc caused cancer NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawsuit by 22 ovarian cancer patients against Johnson & Johnson went to trial on Wednesday in Missouri state court, marking the largest case the company has faced over allegations its talc-based products contain cancer-causing asbestos. The women and their families suing in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis say decades-long use of J&J’s Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their disease. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks. J&J denies both that its talc products cause cancer and that they ever contained asbestos. J&J is battling some 9,000 cases brought by users of its Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc products, the latter of which was sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals [VAPI.UL] in 2012. The majority of those lawsuits claim talc caused ovarian cancer in women who used it for feminine hygiene. A smaller number of cases allege talc contaminated by asbestos in the mining process caused mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. The cases that went to trial on Wednesday effectively combine those claims by alleging the women’s ovarian cancer was caused by asbestos in J&J talc products. J&J lawyer Peter Bicks told the jury on Wednesday that the causes for ovarian cancer are often unknown, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network. He said gene mutations and a family history of cancer played an important role and that asbestos was not known to cause ovarian cancer. Bicks added that testing done by independent laboratories, universities, government agencies, talc suppliers and J&J itself has shown that there is no asbestos in the company’s talc. But plaintiff’s lawyer Mark Lanier said asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. Lanier said there was “no doubt” that talc caused his clients’ ovarian cancer. “This case is as simple as asbestos breathed in or put inside of you,” Lanier told the jury. J&J has lost two talc mesothelioma jury trials in the past weeks. Those cases are currently under appeal. Juries in California and Missouri have also issued verdicts in ovarian cancer cases totaling more than $720 million in damages. Those decisions have either been tossed out or are still under appeal."

J&J has been reviewing its portfolio of businesses and had recently said it was nearing a sale of its diabetes device unit for $2.1 billion. At the same time, the company has been building its drug pipeline and last year acquired Swiss biotech company Actelion in a $30 billion deal. “J&J over the last couple of months has focused on managing its portfolio a little bit better to offset some of the slower growing assets,” Raymond James analyst Dennis Ding said. “I would think by offloading this business it should improve overall organic growth.” J&J’s advanced sterilization products (ASP) business, part of its Ethicon Inc unit, generated revenue of about $775 million in 2017. The drugmaker said it had 120 days to accept the offer and, if it does so, the deal would be expected to close no later than early 2019. For Fortive, which makes industrial products, the deal would provide an entry into the “strong growth” medical sterilization and disinfection market. The company said it planned to finance the acquisition through debt or equity and with available cash. It also expects the deal to add to adjusted earnings in the first full year after the transaction. Everett, Washington-based Fortive was spun off in 2016 from Danaher Corp DHR.N, which develops technology for dental, life sciences and diagnostics industries. Goldman Sachs & Co LLC was the financial adviser to Fortive, while Sidley Austin LLP and WilmerHale served as legal advisers."

Imerys, which did not acknowledge the talc was tainted or dangerous, faces about 9,000 claims that allege the product it supplied to J&J contained asbestos and caused cancers, according to the report. “Imerys has reached a resolution with the 22 Ingham plaintiffs and is being dismissed from the action,” company spokeswoman Gwen Myers said in an emailed statement, without disclosing the details of the settlement. J&J remains the named defendant in a trial set to start June 6 in St. Louis, Missouri. “Johnson’s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause ovarian cancer and we will continue to defend the safety of our product,” J&J spokeswoman Carol Goodrich told Reuters.

11.920602351051237," U.S. jury fails to reach verdict in latest J&J talc trial NEW YORK (Reuters) - A South Carolina jury on Friday could not agree on a verdict in a case of a woman whose family said her long-term use of Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder led to her death from asbestos-related cancer, resulting in a mistrial. The case of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, is the latest in a series of trials in the United States that center around allegations that the company’s talc-based powder contained asbestos. “We’re disappointed the jury did not reach a unanimous verdict for Johnson & Johnson,” the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. “The talc in Johnson’s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos, which is supported by more than 50 years of independent, non-litigation driven scientific evaluations.” Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma, the type of cancer Boyd-Bostic had been diagnosed with at the age of 29. After two weeks of trial, the jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas said it could not decide whether J&J was responsible for the disease. Under South Carolina law, a jury has to make a unanimous decision. Christopher Swett, a lawyer for the family of Boyd-Bostic, said in a statement that the plaintiffs would retry the case at the earliest opportunity. “We continue to believe that the daily use of baby powder on Bertila from birth led to her death,” Swett said. The case also named as a defendant the U.S. unit of talc supplier Imerys SA, as well as a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman. Gwen Myers, a spokeswoman for Imerys Talc America, said: “We remain confident that talc does not cause cancer. Imerys follows all FDA and other regulatory guidelines and utilizes rigorous testing to ensure that our talc meets the highest quality standards. We continue to stand by the safety of our product.” Rite Aid did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination. A California jury on Thursday awarded $25.7 million in damages to a woman and her husband over allegations that the company’s baby powder had caused her mesothelioma.

11.920602351051237," U.S. jury fails to reach verdict in latest J&J talc trial over asbestos claims NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - A South Carolina jury on Friday could not agree on a verdict in a case of a woman whose family said her long-term use of Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder led to her death from asbestos-related cancer, resulting in a mistrial. The case of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, is the latest in a series of trials in the United States that center around allegations that the company’s talc-based powder contained asbestos. J&J said that its widely-used baby powder never contained asbestos or causes cancer and denies the accusations, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma, the type of cancer Boyd-Bostic had been diagnosed with at the age of 29. After two weeks of trial, the jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas said it could not decide whether J&J was responsible for the disease. Under South Carolina law, a jury has to make a unanimous decision. J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Christopher Swett, a lawyer for the family of Boyd-Bostic, said in a statement that the plaintiffs would retry the case at the earliest opportunity. “We continue to believe that the daily use of baby powder on Bertila from birth led to her death,” Swett said. The case also named as a defendant the U.S. unit of talc supplier Imerys SA, as well as a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman. Imerys Talc America and Rite Aid did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.

The decision in Los Angeles Superior Court comes on top of $21.7 million in compensatory damages that the same jury awarded to the woman and her husband on Wednesday. Joanne Anderson, 68, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. The case marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations. J&J has denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. Of Wednesday’s $21.7 million in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent of the liability, Anderson’s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said. In addition to J&J, Anderson and her husband last year sued a unit of Imerys SA, Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag, Honeywell International and other talc suppliers. It was not immediately clear whether any companies besides J&J were subject to the verdict. The Imerys unit, Imerys Talc America, was previously dismissed from the lawsuit, a spokesman said.

10.256835759510317," J&J hit with $21.7 million verdict in another talc asbestos cancer case NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and its talc suppliers on Wednesday were hit with a $21.7 million jury verdict in a lawsuit by a woman who said she developed cancer after being exposed to asbestos in the company's Baby Powder. The verdict by a Los Angeles jury came down in the case of 68-year-old Joanne Anderson, who was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, and marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations. Of the $21.7 million the jury awarded in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent, with the rest distributed among other defendants. J&J has vehemently denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim that asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. Anderson and her husband in 2017 had sued J&J, a unit of Imerys SA IMTP.PA, Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag BNRGn.DE, Honeywell International HON.N and other local talc suppliers, but it was not immediately clear which of those companies were subject to the remaining damages award. Damages could still grow as the jury debates whether to award punitive damages, Anderson’s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said, declining to comment further. “While we are disappointed with this decision, the jury has further deliberations to conduct in this trial and we will reserve additional comment until the case is fully completed,” J&J said in a statement. J&J has also been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder caused ovarian cancer, but the talc litigation has taken a new focus in recent months with plaintiffs claiming the widely used product causes mesothelioma due to alleged asbestos contamination.

9.036773654258072," Johnson & Johnson scraps Alzheimer's trials on safety concerns (Reuters) - Johnson and Johnson said it would stop mid-stage trials testing its experimental Alzheimer’s drug after observing safety issues, the latest drugmaker to abandon developing treatments for the memory-robbing disease. Some trial participants showed serious elevations of liver enzymes and the company concluded that the benefit-risk ratio offered by the drug, atabecestat, no longer supported its development, said Janssen, a unit of Johnson and Johnson. Atabecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer’s drugs called BACE inhibitors that block an enzyme involved in the production of a protein that creates brain plaques, which are considered a major cause for the disease. Analysts expect the successful development of a treatment for the disease, which affects about 5.7 million Americans, to virtually guarantee multi-billion dollar annual sales. However, several drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc, Merck and Co Inc, have been forced to abandon trials over lack of effectiveness or safety concerns. Eli Lilly & Co and AstraZeneca Plc are testing their BACE inhibitor, lanabecestat, in late-stage trials and are due to report results next year. Johnson & Johnson was testing atabecestat to slow cognitive decline in certain patients identified to be progressing to Alzheimer’s dementia."
5.008676293490195," Pfizer's biosimilar of Amgen, J&J's anemia treatments gets FDA nod (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s Retacrit was approved by U.S. health regulators as a biosimilar to current anemia treatments from Amgen Inc and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday, setting it up to compete against more established brands. A year ago the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected Retacrit as a copy of Amgen's Epogen and Johnson & Johnson's Procrit, citing here issues with a potential manufacturing facility in Kansas. Shares of the rival companies dipped in afternoon trade. “People were surprised last time when Pfizer didn’t get a first round approval for a biosimilar, so I think people certainly expected it this time. Its not a surprise,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney said. Epogen’s $1.10 billion in sales accounted for about 5 percent of Amgen’s 2017 revenue, but analysts believe a competing product is unlikely to hurt the company. “Its nice to see that the FDA is moving along and approving biosimilars but the commercial impact to Amgen is quite minimal,” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, who has a “buy” rating on Amgen’s stock, told Reuters. Johnson & Johnson’s Procrit brought in sales of $972 million in 2017, accounting for 2.7 percent of its total sales. The FDA has been pushing to approve copies of expensive branded drugs to increase competition in the market as the Trump administration rallies against exorbitantly priced medicines. Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, but they can never be exact duplicates. Tuesday’s approval allows Retacrit’s use as a treatment for a drop in red blood cells caused by chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy, or the use of zidovudine in HIV patients. The biosimilar was also approved for use before and after surgery to safeguard against the need for red blood cell transfusions due to blood loss from surgery. Shares of Johnson & Johnson dipped 1.2 percent and Amgen’s shares fell 2.5 percent in afternoon trading. Pfizer’s shares were down about 1 pct."

In opening statements, a lawyer for the family of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, told a jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas that J&J had known for decades that its baby powder contained asbestos. J&J and its supplier, a unit of Imerys SA, deny the allegations, and their lawyers said their talc product did not cause any form of cancer, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.

He accused the company of concealing knowledge of asbestos contamination since the 1970s and choosing not to warn consumers of the risks. Bruce Bishop, a lawyer for J&J, said there was no evidence in Boyd-Bostic’s medical records that her mesothelioma was in any way related to asbestos exposure. Michael Brown, another J&J lawyer, said millions of people had used Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder without developing any diseases. “And that’s because it does not contain asbestos,” he said."

The lawsuit by Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear was his fifth to date seeking to hold a drug manufacturer or distributor responsible for its role in the national opioid epidemic. The lawsuit, filed in McCracken Circuit Court, accused J&J and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit of misrepresenting that its opioid medications were safer than alternatives and were “rarely addictive” when used for chronic pain. Those opioids included Duragesic, which before 2009 accounted for at least $1 billion in annual sales, and Nucynta and Nucynta ER, the lawsuit said. Janssen sold the rights to Nucynta to another drugmaker in 2015. The lawsuit seeks penalties and compensatory and punitive damages. “Janssen has profited from their illegal conduct, and my office is taking action to make sure they pay for ravaging our communities and destroying our families just to make a profit,” Beshear said in a statement. J&J in a statement said that it marketed and promoted opioids appropriately and that its products’ labels provided information about their risks and benefits. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive pain-killers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders. Eight other states have sued J&J.

The healthcare conglomerate, whose stock had climbed about 3 percent over the previous six days, reported better-than-expected profit in the first quarter, helped by strong demand for its cancer treatments. J&J said it was not revising its earnings forecast higher for the year because certain divestments it previously expected to make this year might be pushed into 2019. “I’m definitely surprised by the stock reaction,” said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. “There was some expectation that they would raise EPS guidance this quarter just because foreign exchange has gotten better and the business did do pretty well.” Shares were down $1.99 at $129.63 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Quarterly sales of its cancer treatments surged 45 percent to $2.31 billion, accounting for nearly a quarter of its pharmaceutical unit’s revenue. The company’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade has come under pressure from cheaper copies, pushing the company to focus on newer treatments such as cancer drugs. Remicade’s first-quarter sales fell 16.9 percent to $1.39 billion. The company said it plans to streamline its global supply chain and expects pretax savings of $600 million to $800 million by 2022. J&J said it would boost capital expenditure by 15 percent in the United States, bringing the total to $30 billion over the next four years as it reinvests a windfall from U.S. tax reforms. For the full year, J&J raised its sales forecast to a range of $81.0 billion to $81.8 billion, from $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion estimated previously. Sales at J&J’s consumer products unit, which makes Band-Aids, Neutrogena beauty products and Tylenol, rose 5.3 percent to $3.40 billion.

-4.663935881146556," J&J Baby Powder litigation takes new focus with asbestos claims NEW YORK (Reuters) - A $117 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson and a supplier in favor of a man who said his asbestos-related cancer was caused by long-term use of J&J’s Baby Powder could open a new front for thousands of cases claiming the widely-used product caused cancer, legal experts and plaintiffs lawyers said. J&J has been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The $117 million verdict by a New Jersey jury last week, however, involved a different form of cancer that is clearly linked to asbestos. Plaintiffs lawyers claim that internal J&J documents seen in that trial show that baby powder had been contaminated with asbestos. They now plan to use the documents in upcoming ovarian cancer trials to allege that the asbestos contamination also caused that form of cancer. J&J and Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SA, have vowed to appeal the New Jersey verdict and deny asbestos has ever been present in their products or that their talc can cause any form of cancer. The case of Stephen Lanzo, a New Jersey resident who claimed he developed mesothelioma after using baby powder since his birth in 1972, was the first time a jury saw the internal J&J documents which plaintiffs claim show that J&J knew since the 1970s that the talc in its baby powder was contaminated by asbestos during the mining process. J&J says the documents present no such evidence, but merely show the company’s caution. Peter Bicks, a lawyer leading J&J’s talc asbestos defense, said that in the early 1970s, the company was looking at how it could potentially remove asbestos from talc if the two became intermingled in the mining process. He says no contamination was ever found, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. Bicks called the claims of a link between talc and asbestos “junk science.” Mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos, affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities. While the link between asbestos and mesothelioma is sufficiently established, scientists are divided on whether asbestos exposure can cause ovarian cancer. Some studies have shown an association between the two, while other studies have found no such link. Elizabeth Burch, holder of the Charles H. Kirbo Chair of Law at the University of Georgia, said it remained an open question whether talc contained asbestos and that each case would turn on the facts. But J&J, which had $76.5 billion in sales in 2017, gives the plaintiffs’ bar an enticing new target, said Nathan Schachtman, a lecturer at Columbia University who used to defend asbestos cases. Some 3,000 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year, according to the American Cancer Society, a number that Howard Erichson, a law professor at Fordham University who specializes in mass tort litigation, called significant from a legal standpoint. But the roughly 22,000 women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year, according to the National Cancer Institute, provide lawyers with a potentially much larger pool of plaintiffs to tap. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers representing consumers, who said plaintiffs would file thousands of additional mesothelioma and ovarian cancer cases. New Jersey-based J&J in a statement after the Lanzo verdict said plaintiffs’ attorneys had shifted their strategy to focus on asbestos after a series of losses at trial and in court rulings over previous allegations that the talc itself causes cancer. Of the six ovarian cancer trials to date, juries found J&J liable five times, but a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict and a California judge tossed another. Appeals of the other cases are pending. J&J in November also won the first trial over allegations that its talc contained asbestos and caused a woman’s mesothelioma. Plaintiffs lawyers say the jury in that case did not see the documents presented during the Lanzo trial. But Erichson said the widespread use of J&J’s consumer products generally make the company an attractive litigation target. “Baby powder is as ubiquitous a product you can think of and there are lots of people who can testify they’ve been exposed to it,” he said."
