Shares in the lender jumped 6% on Wednesday. The bank declined a Reuters request for comment.

But the original enforcement action adopted in 2018 lays out the lengthy process the bank must undertake to be relieved of the cap, including overhauling its board effectiveness and risk management.

55.242076595048275," Wells Fargo CEO Scharf's pay drops nearly 12% in 2020 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf’s annual pay fell by about $3 million, or 12%, in 2020, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. Scharf will receive $20.3 million for his work during the year, compared with $23 million in 2019, the bank said. bit.ly/3ahptPv Scharf, who served as a top lieutenant to JPMorgan Chase and Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon during the financial crisis of 2008, took over the reins at Wells Fargo in 2019. The fall in Scharf’s pay compares with a 36% drop in Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon’s salary and a 20% jump in compensation for Morgan Stanley’s top boss James Gorman. JPMorgan held CEO Dimon’s annual pay at $31.5 million. Wells Fargo’s board cited the drop in the bank’s financial results for 2020 as one of the reasons for Scharf’s lower compensation, noting that the results were significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank last year posted its first quarterly loss since 2008 and also saw its profit plunge to just 1 penny per share in the first quarter of 2020. However, Wells Fargo ended the year with a rare quarterly profit beat.

32.252413631582186," Wells Fargo records rare profit beat as credit costs fall (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted a small rise in quarterly profit on Friday that beat Wall Street estimates, as stabilizing credit costs helped buffer historic near-zero interest rates meant to prop up the ailing economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The country’s fourth-largest bank, which has been plagued by hefty costs tied to litigation over the past several years, reported a drop in overall fourth-quarter expenses. But costs are still high due to a sales practices scandal that has haunted it since 2016. Wells Fargo paid $321 million in customer remediation costs in the quarter, despite bank executives repeatedly signaling that the worst of the fallout, which has cost it billions, is in the past. The company also took $781 million in restructuring charges as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf takes tough measures to shift fortunes at the bank that he joined in 2019. Scharf has targeted $10 billion in savings annually over the long term. The bank has also been offloading assets, including a possible sale of its asset management business to a private equity consortium. Wells Fargo was once seen as the crème de la crème of U.S. banks: it avoided the kind of problems that Wall Street rivals encountered during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. But it has operated under a dark cloud since 2016, when details emerged about millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets. There have been revelations about other customer abuses, and Wells Fargo has been unable to shake the damage caused by all the blunders. “Our results continued to be impacted by the unprecedented operating environment and the required work to put our substantial legacy issues behind us,” Scharf said in a statement. Wells Fargo is also constrained by growth restrictions the U.S. Federal Reserve placed on its balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses. “There’s no question that the impact on our financial performance is material in this environment,” Scharf said about the asset cap it operates under. Because the bank does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup Inc - which also reported results on Friday - it has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low interest rates. Total revenue fell 10% to $17.93 billion, missing average analyst estimates, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Net-interest income fell 17% to $9.28 billion in the quarter. Shares of Wells Fargo were down more than 7% in morning trade after the bank warned 2021 net interest income would be flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion. Deposit growth has boomed across the industry as cautious consumers and companies save more and spend less during the pandemic. Wells Fargo added deposits at a much slower rate compared to peers. Total deposits rose 4%, compared with a 20% jump at Citigroup and a 35% rise at JPMorgan. The bank did manage some bright spots. It reported net income of $2.99 billion, or 64 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $2.87 billion, or 60 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of 60 cents on average. The bank missed estimates in the first three quarters of last year. Costs pegged to bad loans fell $823 million compared to last year and remained far below the level seen in the first half of the year when the bank racked up more than $14 billion in provision expenses. Wells Fargo said it expects total 2021 expenses of about $53 billion excluding one-off charges."

The divestment would represent the U.S. bank’s biggest shake-up since former Bank of New York Mellon Chief Executive Charles Scharf joined as CEO in 2019. The exact price being negotiated could not be learned, but Reuters previously reported that Wells Fargo was seeking more than $3 billion for the unit. The talks could still end without a deal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. Wells Fargo declined to comment. Chicago-based GTCR and New York-based Reverence did not respond to requests for comment. The sale of the asset management business is one of many steps taken by Scharf to turn Wells Fargo around following a years-old sales practices scandal. He has been cutting costs and shedding noncore businesses. Earlier on Thursday, Wells Fargo announced a deal to sell its Canadian direct equipment finance business to Toronto-Dominion Bank. Last month, Wells Fargo said it would sell its private student loan portfolio to a group of investors. The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and Scharf is expected to unveil a new strategic plan for the bank. Reverence Capital, co-founded by Goldman Sachs alum Milton Berlinski, and GTCR have been active in acquiring businesses in the asset management sector. In 2019, Reverence bought 75% of Phoenix-based independent financial advisory firm Advisor Group Inc, while last year GTCR took a minority stake in Raleigh, North-Carolina’s CAPTRUST Financial Advisors, which valued the registered investment adviser at $1.25 billion."

21.21691622178473," Wells Fargo CEO to unveil cost-cutting plan (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Charlie Scharf will give investors more details on his long-awaited turnaround plan for the scandal-plagued bank this week. Although Wall Street expects Wells Fargo to report a 38% profit decline on Friday against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, investors have become more bullish in anticipation of details about expansive cost-cutting plans. Wells Fargo shares have jumped 45% since Scharf teased a strategic update in October, outperforming JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. Wells Fargo management has promised transformation since its 2016 fraudulent account scandal with little to show for the effort, but it feels different now, Raymond James analyst David Long said. Scharf’s “really changed the internal attitude to make improving the bank’s governance the number one priority,” Long said. Scharf started making changes shortly after taking the helm in October 2019, though he has not yet provided firm targets or timelines for progress. He installed a slew of external leaders, overhauled the reporting segments, and began to shed non-core businesses. He also implemented weekly and monthly reviews to increase oversight and address regulator concerns more efficiently. In a sign of progress repairing Wells Fargo’s relationship with regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ended a consent order related to anti-money laundering compliance on the bank earlier this month. But Wells’ largest hurdles remain and it has a long way to go to catch up with peers. Efficiency ratios across Wells’ largest business lines dramatically lag other big banks. Further, the ongoing need for spending to satisfy regulators and the presence of punitive asset cap until Wells proves it fixed the risk management failures that led to the widespread customer abuses will continue to hinder the bank’s ability to compete effectively. “Other banks have not been operating under these consent orders so they’ve been able to spend a good amount of their mindshare thinking about operating efficiency and the future,” Long said. “Wells has not.”"

The end of the consent order is a positive sign for the bank, which has been trying to repair its frayed relationship with regulators, particularly the OCC, which has taken a tough line on the fourth-largest lender in the United States. Wells Fargo is still working on a separate 2018 sweeping OCC consent order related to the mis-selling of mortgage and auto-insurance products, which imposes a number of constraints on the bank’s business. The anti-money laundering consent order terminated on Tuesday required the bank to implement customer due diligence standards, which included the collection of current beneficial ownership information for certain business customers. Wells Fargo said on Tuesday it had undertaken significant work to enhance its bank secrecy act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) compliance program. The end of the consent order provides new Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf momentum going into the January earnings call, where he plans to unveil his vision to reshape the scandal-plagued bank.

The potential deal would illustrate how Scharf is looking at drastic moves, beyond cost cuts, as he seeks to turn Wells Fargo around following a years-old sales practices scandal. He has said he is targeting $10 billion in savings annually over the long term. Wells Fargo’s asset management arm, which managed $578 billion on behalf of customers as of the end of June, could fetch more than $3 billion in a sale, two of the sources said. The San Francisco-based bank has discussed a potential deal with asset management companies and private equity firms, according to the sources, who cautioned that a divestment is not certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Wells Fargo reported a 57% drop in its third-quarter profit earlier this month, missing Wall Street’s expectations, as persistent costs continued to haunt the bank. The bank has been grappling with these costs since 2016, when it entered a settlement with regulators that detailed millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets. Bank executives have signaled repeatedly that the worst of the fallout is in the past, but elevated operating losses have persisted. The U.S. Federal Reserve has placed restrictions on Wells Fargo’s balance sheet, to be lifted only when the management team can prove it has sufficiently improved risk management and controls. Scharf told analysts on the bank’s third-quarter earnings call this month that he expected to create some room on Wells Fargo’s balance sheet by exiting non-core businesses. “I just want to be clear. We are exiting them because they are not core to serving our core customer base on the consumer and large corporate side. We are not exiting them because of the asset cap,” Scharf said. The asset management business, which is part of Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment management division, offers mutual funds and retirement products. Wells Fargo plans to keep its wealth management business that caters to high-net worth clients, the sources said. The wealth and investment management division is led by Barry Sommers, the former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s wealth management business that Scharf recruited in June. Wells Fargo had started to trim the division even before Scharf because CEO. It sold its retirement plan services business to Principal Financial Group Inc last year for $1.2 billion."
41.61639328026355," U.S. banks sweat regulatory exposure from pandemic loans BOSTON/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Banks that facilitated the U.S. government’s Paycheck Protection Program at first saw the effort as a small revenue booster with a patriotic bonus, shepherding $525 billion in loans to businesses slammed by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. But as taxpayers begin to take on the cost of forgiving those loans, lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp, are girding for what is likely to be years of regulatory scrutiny for their role in doling out the money, according to industry insiders, securities filings and government watchdogs. “The sense of anxiety is high,” said Vivian Merker, a management consultant to financial services firms at Oliver Wyman in New York. “They are gearing up for years of requests from regulators and there’s still reputational risk from PPP fraud even if they did all the right things to follow program rules.” Banks participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) issued more than 5.2 million loans, to be repaid by the government as long as borrowers demonstrated financial need and used most of the cash to make payroll. Fraud by borrowers popped up almost as quickly as the program, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA), began in April. The Department of Justice has so far brought charges against 82 individuals in 56 cases for around $250 million in loans, according to a review by the Project On Government Oversight. So far, the burden on lenders has mostly been administrative. One veteran attorney who advises major banks on compliance matters said clients were responding to as many as 20 law enforcement subpoenas a week, producing documents and making employees available for interviews. There is increasing concern, though, that the lenders themselves will face legal challenges over PPP, already leading to internal compliance reviews, investor warnings and even the outright sale of loan portfolios, according to public statements and people familiar with the situation. At least four banks have warned investors in shareholder filings about PPP regulatory and legal risk. Bank of America, for example, said in a July filing that its participation in government stimulus programs “could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions.” “We fully cooperate with government inquiries,” said Bill Halldin, a Bank Of America spokesperson. Among the possible hazards, experts have pointed to potential violations of the program’s first-come, first-served application rules, disadvantaging minority-owned and women-owned businesses; maintaining adequate documentation, especially for loan forgiveness applications; and abiding by broader “know your customer” rules, which could have spotted more fraud. Congress passed the $2.2-trillion Cares Act bailout in March which included nearly $350 billion for PPP loans, with the pot later increasing. Under pressure to get the cash out the door fast, banks were initially concerned they would be taking on too much liability, even if they stood to earn origination fees of up to 5%, and 1% interest payments on government-guaranteed loans. Lenders secured a promise from the government that they would not be held responsible if borrowers broke the program rules. An October congressional report said that several lenders, including JPMorgan, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Truist Financial Corp, processed larger PPP loans for wealthy customers at two to four times the speed of smaller loans for the neediest small businesses. It also said some banks limited their PPP loan programs to existing customers. That decision, the report said, had a disproportionately adverse effect on women-owned and minority-owned businesses, because they are less likely to have pre-existing banking relationships, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data. Depending on the circumstances, policies that hurt such “protected” groups - even if inadvertently - can violate fair lending rules. Citing an internal April presentation, the report said that Citigroup identified the negative effect on these businesses as a possible compliance risk, but decided to initially prioritize existing customers because demand was high and it required less manual intervention. Citi declined to comment. A Truist spokesman said that it handled PPP applications through a single portal on a first-come, first-served basis, “without any preference to larger or more affluent clients.” JPMorgan declined to comment. PNC did not respond to requests for comment. Bank groups pushed back on the House report. The Consumer Bankers Association said lenders were denied waivers that would have made it easier to lend to new borrowers, and that larger borrowers had dedicated staff and documentation that accelerated their applications. “When Congress, the SBA and Treasury designed the Paycheck Protection Program they prioritized getting money into the hands of small businesses very quickly, issuing confusing and changing operational and legal guidance for banks,” said Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute. People familiar with the situation say that virtually every large PPP lender, including JPMorgan, Citi, Truist and KeyBank, conducted standard internal reviews to spot violations by their own employees of program rules. “As we participate in efforts to make critical government stimulus programs available ... we continue to execute on our controls to identify, address and report fraud,” a Truist spokesman told Reuters via email. KeyBank declined to comment. Wells Fargo said in a May filing that it had received “formal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans.” Wells Fargo spokesman Manny Venegas said the filing was referring to industry-wide inquiries from regulators over PPP fraud, which the bank had worked to spot and report. He declined to comment on whether the probes also concerned bank employees or processes. Regulators have signaled there’s much more to come. The SBA plans to review PPP loans over $2 million and its inspector general recently said there were “strong indicators of widespread potential abuse and fraud.” A recent U.S. House committee analysis found tens of thousands of PPP loans could be subject to fraud, waste, or abuse, including more than $1 billion in multiple loans to the same company, a violation of program rules. James Stevens, an attorney who advises lenders at Troutman Pepper in Atlanta, said banks did their best to get money to needy small businesses, but that fast-changing program rules created “fertile ground” for fraud and internal errors. “Regulatory scrutiny of banks is always in hindsight,” Stevens said. “It’s going to come.”"

Like chief executives before him, new CEO Charlie Scharf, now one year on the job, has made cost cuts a cornerstone of his turnaround plan. He targeted $10 billion in savings annually over the long term, but investors are growing impatient. “Why is that the number?” asked UBS analyst Saul Martinez about Wells’ core cost guidance. “Because you haven’t been anywhere near that number for five years.” The San Francisco-based bank, which has been in regulators’ penalty box since 2016, spent $961 million on customer remediation accruals in the quarter, indicating that the bank was still feeling the burn from its sales practice scandal has already cost it billions. Bank executives have signaled repeatedly that the worst of the fallout is in the past, but elevated operating losses have remained constant. Wells Fargo has reported large litigation or remediation charges in 7 of the last 11 quarters, according to filings. Outgoing Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry made the same assurance last quarter. “That is what I said and I was wrong when I said it,” Shrewsberry told reporters on a call discussing results, adding that he still felt confident lumpy costs were in the past. “It wouldn’t surprise me if people waited until the end of the next quarter to make sure that we lived up to that.” Cost-cutting initiatives are under way as Scharf begins implementing changes across the bank. Headcount fell by more than 1,000 from the prior quarter. But firm-wide expenses inched up slightly due to scandal-related operating losses and a $718 million restructuring charges tied to severance. Rising costs, however, do not help as the banking industry deals with near-zero interest rates and slower loan growth. Net-interest income at the fourth-largest U.S. bank was $9.4 billion, down $512 million from the second quarter, as its loan book shrank 2%. Total revenue fell 14%. Because Wells does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase JPM.N or Citigroup Inc C.N, it has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low interest rates. Banking rivals including Bank of America Corp BAC.N have also said net interest income should start to recover after the third quarter as loan demand picks back up. But Wells Fargo offered a more bearish outlook for its own revenue due to a growth restriction on its balance sheet imposed by regulators after the scandal. “We won’t be expanding the size of our balance sheet, really much for any reason because we’re operating under an asset cap,” Shrewsberry said. “We’re not at it but we’re pretty close.” The U.S. Federal Reserve capped Wells Fargo’s assets at $1.95 trillion in February of 2018 until the proves it fixed the risk management failures that led to widespread customer abuses. The bank has not given guidance on when it expects the cap to be lifted. Total period-end loans fell nearly 4% to $920.1 billion, hurt by a $30 billion fall in commercial loans, a bigger slump than expected, Jefferies analysts said. The U.S. Federal Reserve placed restriction’s on Wells’ balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses, to be lifted only when the management team can prove they have sufficiently improved risk management and controls. Wells Fargo posted net income applicable to common stock of $1.72 billion, or 42 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $4.04 billion, or 92 cents a year earlier. Analysts expected a profit of 45 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Shares of the bank were down 5% at $23.51."

35.36271133782288," Wells Fargo cuts more jobs as part of earlier cost-cutting drive (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has started to cut jobs at its commercial banking unit as part of larger reductions that will impact nearly all of its functions and business lines, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The bank resumed job cuts in early August after it paused layoffs in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wells Fargo said in July it would launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year as the bank braces for massive loan losses caused by the pandemic and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal. “We are at the beginning of a multiyear effort to build a stronger, more efficient company for our customers, employees, communities, and shareholders,” a spokeswoman said via email on Wednesday. “The work will consist of a broad range of actions, including workforce reductions, to bring our expenses more in line with our peers,” she added, without specifying the number of job cuts. Wells Fargo has cut 700 jobs as part of workforce reductions that could ultimately impact “tens of thousands” of staff, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing people with knowledge of the matter. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last spring, the heads of large U.S. banks including Morgan Stanley MS.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and others had pledged not to cut any jobs in 2020. However, as executives prepare for an extended recession and loan losses that come with it, layoffs are back on the table. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N said last month it plans to move forward with ""a modest number of layoffs""."

27.12288704510269," U.S. Fed to extend curbs on big bank buy backs, dividends through end of year WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will curb big bank capital distributions through the end of the year, meaning the likes of JPMorgan Chase & CoJPN., Citigroup Inc.C.N, Wells Fargo & CoWFC.N and Bank of America Corp.BAC.Nwill be barred from share buy backs and will have to cap dividends. The central bank announced it would extend its existing policy of limiting capital payouts for banks with at least $100 billion in assets, to ensure lenders have enough capital to weather the economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions, which apply to 34 banks, including the U.S. operations of several large foreign firms, were extended “due to the continued economic uncertainty from the coronavirus response,” the Fed said. The Fed announced in June it was taking the unprecedented step of limiting bank payouts after finding lenders faced significant capital losses under a pandemic-informed stress test. Under the new policy, banks cannot pay higher dividends than they did in the second quarter, and payments cannot exceed a firm’s average net income over the last four quarters. Large banks will face a second pandemic Fed stress test later this year, with results to be announced by the end of 2020. The Fed found in its original stress test that lenders could endure as much as $700 billion in loan losses under a severe economic downturn caused by the outbreak. Banks were expected to stay afloat amid those losses, but several skirted close to violating minimum capital levels required by regulators, the Fed said at the time."

28.546332169487155," Wells Fargo signs data exchange agreement with Envestnet Yodlee (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and data aggregator Envestnet Yodlee said on Thursday they had signed a data exchange agreement, the latest move in an ongoing tug of war between fintechs and large banks over information sharing. The deal will enable the bank’s customers to share their account information with fintech apps connected to Envestnet Yodlee. Wells Fargo and other large U.S. banks have been pushing to move fintechs and data aggregators away from so-called screenscraping and towards what they have said is a more secure method of accessing sensitive data. Through screenscraping, fintechs collect information by logging into a user’s bank account on their behalf. “This is a significant milestone, we now have 99% of current third party app screenscraping under data exchange agreements,” said Ben Soccorsy, senior vice president in Wells Fargo’s strategy, digital and innovation group. Fintech startups, such as those providing automated wealth management or budgeting tools, often need to connect to a user’s bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some collect the information through aggregators such as Yodlee and competitor Plaid, while others request that customers provide their password to access their information. Through Wells Fargo’s new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers’ passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to the bank’s application programming interface, a set of programming code, that will only send specific account information authorized by the consumer. The changes come as banks and fintechs scuffle over data access. Banks have said their reluctance to share customer information with third parties reflects a need to protect sensitive data. Fintechs have expressed skepticism, suggesting that consumers should decide who can access their data. Soccorsy declined to say whether Envestnet Yodlee would be paying Wells Fargo for access to customer-permissioned data and said the bank could not disclose the details of any of these agreements as the terms are confidential. Envestnet Yodlee also declined to comment on the agreement’s terms."
28.546332169487155," Exclusive: Wells Fargo CEO ruffles feathers with comments about diverse talent (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N Chief Executive Charles Scharf exasperated some Black employees in a Zoom meeting this summer when he reiterated that the bank had trouble reaching diversity goals because there was not enough qualified minority talent, two participants told Reuters. He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo June 18 that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody. “While it might sound like an excuse, the unfortunate reality is that there is a very limited pool of black talent to recruit from,” Scharf said in the memo, seen by Reuters. Scharf spent more time listening than speaking during the previously unreported 90-minute call which he initiated. His comments about Black talent rubbed some attendees the wrong way, according to the two employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions. Not all attendees recalled being offended. “The meeting was incredibly constructive. ... I walked away being incredibly surprised at how genuine and sincere he is,” said Alex David, president of the Black/African American Connection Team Member Network. But several Black senior executives across corporate America said they are frustrated by claims of a talent shortage, and called the refrain a major reason that companies have struggled to add enough racial and ethnic diversity to leadership ranks, despite stated intentions to do so. ""There is an amazing amount of Black talent out there,"" said Ken Bacon, a former mortgage industry executive on the boards of Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, Ally Financial Inc ALLY.N and Welltower Inc WELL.N. ""If people say they can't find the talent, they either aren't looking hard enough or don't want to find it."" Bacon said he was “shocked and puzzled” by Scharf’s comments. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Beth Richek defended Scharf’s record on diversity. The CEO of the largest U.S. bank employer has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals. He is also requiring hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant, and ensure diversity on interview teams. Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens, head of Operations; and Ather Williams, head of Strategy, Digital and Innovation. Wells Fargo’s latest proxy disclosed more diversity data than those of many other companies, including that two of 12 directors at the time were Black and one was “Latino/Hispanic.” Scharf “is committed to deep and systemic change to increase diversity and has held several forums where there has been candid conversation and unfiltered feedback,” Richek said in a statement. “TALENT IS THERE” Introspection across corporate America during the Black Lives Matter movement has cast a harsh light on the lack of diversity. In boardrooms, African-Americans made up 10% of new director appointments in the Fortune 500 last year compared with their 13% of the U.S. population, according to a 2020 report from executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles. New Hispanic directors were even more scarce, the study found. Only 7.3% of the five highest-paid executives at financial companies in the Russell 3000 were racial or ethnic minorities, according to data from ISS ESG, an arm of the proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. That number has risen in recent years, yet remains far below the percentage of minority groups in the general U.S. population. Senior corporate executives and recruiters said the notion of a shallow minority talent pool is frequently cited as a hurdle to improving diversity but probably reflects insular professional and social networks. Lauren Holland, who chairs a word-of-mouth professional network called Wall Street Friends, said she has 8,000 members in minority communities, and sent out more job posts to them in the last two months than in the last five years. “I literally get emails every single day from people asking to be added to our list,” she said. “The talent is there. It’s just a matter of the firm accessing it and connecting with it.” Experts said one reason board rooms and C-suites lack diversity is that such jobs are often filled by people who have managed businesses, while many people of color have tended to be stuck in roles that lack a direct connection to profits. ""As women and minorities started to gain traction in corporate America, they were trapped in certain jobs companies felt comfortable placing them in, like human resources, administrative-support type functions,"" said Teri McClure, former general counsel and chief human resources officer at United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, who sits on several boards, including that of JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O. McClure said she frequently hears comments like Scharf’s when companies have not tried hard enough to find diverse candidates or give them the experience to qualify for senior roles. Some Black directors and executives said they were unhappy with the progress in improving diversity. ""Unless I practically get on a soapbox about it and ask about it every meeting, it gets pushed out,"" said Mary Winston, a director at companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N, about some of her past work on boards. ""It's just not as robust a conversation as it should be, and no progress has been made."" Winston, adding that she is often the only person of color in board rooms, also disagreed with the notion of a talent shortage. One of the Wells Fargo employees said there simply was no lack of talent: “I can get them 10 to 15 resumes today.”"
28.546332169487155," Wells Fargo CEO sorry for 'insensitive comment' on diversity (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf has apologized for making insensitive remarks around race and diversity, seeking to quell a row over his references to a shortage of talent among minority groups. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Scharf had exasperated some Black employees in a Zoom meeting this summer when he reiterated that the bank had trouble reaching diversity goals because there were not enough qualified minority candidates. He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody. “There are many talented diverse individuals working at Wells Fargo and throughout the financial services industry and I never meant to imply otherwise,” Scharf said in a statement on Wednesday. “Across the industry, we have not done enough to improve diversity, especially at senior leadership levels.” The remarks on a shortage of candidates were widely criticized by politicians and business leaders after the Reuters report was published on Tuesday. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the most prominent Wells Fargo critics, said the bank’s problem begin with its leadership. “Its CEO has an unfathomable blind spot about how and why this giant bank fails to hire, promote, and fairly compensate Black talent – and continues to be a core part of a financial system that scams Black families disproportionately and fuels structural racism in our economy and our society,” she said in a statement. “Perhaps it’s the CEO of Wells Fargo who lacks the talent to recruit Black workers,” U.S. Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. Scharf listed a handful of appointments the bank has made recently as evidence of its commitment to diversity and went on to lay out details of the steps it was taking to recruit more from minorities. As the head of the largest U.S. bank by number of employees, he has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals. He has also told hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant and to ensure diversity on interview teams. ""Anyone who's open to re-evaluating their position, their perspective and taking into consideration a new set of facts, you have to give him the benefit of the doubt,"" said Teri McClure, a former executive with United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N who had been among those criticizing Scharf on Tuesday. “The Wells Fargo team should use that as an opportunity to move forward,” she added. Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens as head of operations and Ather Williams as head of strategy, digital and innovation. “There is no question Wells Fargo has to make meaningful progress to increase diverse representation,” Scharf said on Wednesday."

23.484484858134884," U.S. bank regulator fines three former Wells Fargo executives over sales scandal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator announced Monday it had fined three former executives at Wells Fargo Bank WFC.N for their roles in the company's sales practices scandal. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it had imposed the fines on three former executives from the bank’s community bank arm, arguing they either did know or should have known about long-running problems with the bank’s sales practices. The OCC imposed a $925,000 fine on Matthew Raphaelson, the former community bank group finance officer, and barred him from the banking industry. It also imposed a $400,000 fine on Kenneth Zimmerman, the bank’s former head of community bank deposit products group, and a $350,000 fine on Tracy Kidd, the former head of community bank human resources. The fines come nine months after the regulator imposed fines on eight other former bank executives, including former CEO John Stumpf. In a statement, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman acknowledged the bank’s community bank had a “flawed” model, but that the firm was committed to fundamental changes. “At the time of the sales practices issues, the company did not have in place the appropriate people, structure, processes, controls or culture to prevent the inappropriate conduct,” said spokeswoman Jennifer Langan. “The company is different today, and we are doing what’s necessary to regain the trust of all stakeholders.” The regulator added that the settlements also require the individuals to cooperate with any other investigation related to the sales practices."
15.854264358862249," U.S. homebuilder confidence hits record high in September WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilder confidence increased to a record high in September as historically low mortgage rates continue to boost the housing market despite the COVID-19 recession, which has left tens of millions of Americans unemployed. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) rose five points to an all-time high of 83 this month, data showed on Wednesday. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor. Builders, however, remained concerned about rising costs for materials and delivery delays, especially for lumber. “Lumber prices are now up more than 170 percent since mid-April, adding more than $16,000 to the price of a typical new single-family home,” said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz. “That said, the suburban shift for home building is keeping builders busy, supported on the demand side by low interest rates. In another sign of this growing trend, builders in other parts of the country have reported receiving calls from customers in high-density markets asking about relocating.” The housing market has pushed ahead despite nearly 30 million people being on unemployment benefits. Economists say unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.86%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The HMI survey’s current sales conditions index rose four points to 88 this month. The component measuring sales expectations in the next six months increased six points to 84 and the measure of prospective buyers jumped nine points to 73."

Buffett began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989, but has been reducing Berkshire’s stake as the bank struggles to recover from a series of scandals over its treatment of customers, including the opening of accounts without their knowledge. Wells Fargo’s ability to grow remains subject to a Federal Reserve limit. Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday lowered its rating outlook on the bank to “negative” from “stable”, citing the bank’s slower-than-expected ability to resolve governance and oversight issues from previous years. Berkshire still owns shares of several other banks, including Bank of America Corp BAC.N, which became its largest common stock holding other than iPhone-maker Apple Inc AAPL.O.

18.040510727744046," U.S. regulator sanctions Wells Fargo over variable annuity switches (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N agreed to pay $2.12 million in fines and restitution to settle U.S. regulatory charges its brokers failed to properly account for the costs of switching customers who owned variable annuities to new investments. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said Wells Fargo failed to supervise the suitability of recommendations that customers sell variable annuities carrying “surrender” fees, and use proceeds to buy mutual funds and unit investment trusts carrying upfront sales charges. FINRA said the cost of switching could more than offset the higher returns available on the new investments, leaving customers with less income than if they had stayed put. It said it identified at least 101 potentially unsuitable switches, including a customer who incurred $14,037 in fees and charges when surrendering a $180,500 annuity. The payout by Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network includes $1.45 million in restitution and $675,000 in civil fines. Neither entity admitted or denied wrongdoing. Both have taken steps to improve supervision, including developing a “switch alert” for when customers move money. FINRA said the wrongdoing occurred from January 2011 to August 2016, the month before Wells Fargo became enmeshed in a series of scandals over its treatment of customers, including the opening of accounts without their knowledge."

Chief Compliance Officer Mike Roemer will be replaced by Paula Dominick, who has been chief compliance officer for Credit Suisse Americas and previously worked for Bank of America Corp BAC.N, according to the report here. Wells Fargo declined to comment on the report.

-13.002229488226414," Wells Fargo appoints CFO as part of leadership shakeup (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Tuesday Mike Santomassimo would replace John Shrewsberry as chief financial officer when he retires in the fall after more than two decades at the firm. Since taking over as chief executive in October, Charles Scharf has shaken up leadership at the bank and installed a slew of former colleagues and confidants in top positions. Santomassimo most recently served as Scharf's CFO at Bank of New York Mellon BK.N and previously led the finance teams for various business lines at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N. Shrewsberry, who told Scharf he was considering retirement when he joined the company, will stay on to ensure a smooth transition, the company said. Shrewsberry was named CFO in 2014 after running Wells Fargo Securities and Wells Fargo’s commercial capital division. When Santomassimo joins the company in the fall, the top three executives will be based in New York, away from the bank’s official San Francisco headquarters. Santomassimo will receive an annual base salary of $1.75 million and a minimum variable compensation of $9.25 million for the performance year 2020, the bank said in a filing. The change at Wells Fargo comes as it gears up to launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal. On an earnings call last week, Scharf slammed prior management for failing to run the bank in an efficient and compliant manner, saying the firm’s underperformance was “because leadership didn’t make the difficult decisions necessary.” However, he struck a different tone on Tuesday talking about out Shrewsberry, a 22-year Wells Fargo veteran. “Throughout his tenure, John has served as an excellent financial and strategic leader for our company,” Scharf said. “He is well-respected throughout the company and the financial community.”"

-3.729149533701049," Wells Fargo will cut costs further after first loss since 2008 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year, executives said on Tuesday, as the bank braces for massive loan losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal. The news came as Wells Fargo posted its first quarterly loss since 2008 and slashed its dividend to preserve capital after performing poorly on the Federal Reserve’s stress test. Rivals that reported results on Tuesday also posted big loan-loss reserves, but analysts said Wells Fargo’s problems run deeper. “We don’t see anything positive from Wells Fargo to hang our hats on,” David Hendler, a longtime bank analyst and founder of research firm Viola Risk Advisors, said in an interview. “The company has messed up for a generation.” Hendler pointed to what he described as problems with Wells Fargo’s organizational structure and balance sheet exposures that cannot quickly be resolved. Shares were down 4.8% at $24.19. Wells Fargo was once seen as the crème de la crème of U.S. banks: it avoided the kind of problems that Wall Street rivals encountered during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and investors viewed its management team as a crew of wholesome, if profit-driven, traditional bankers. But that perception has been upended since 2016, when the bank entered a settlement with regulators that detailed millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets. Since then, there have been revelations about other customer abuses, and Wells Fargo has been unable to shake the damage caused by those sales practices. Cost-cutting goals have been a hallmark of management’s promises to improve profits for investors throughout the scandal, but it has so far been difficult for Wells Fargo to achieve them. On Tuesday, Chief Executive Charlie Scharf, who took over in October, said he found $10 billion to slash from annual expenses. His predecessors had focused on costs relative to revenue. “While our balance sheet is strong, our margins are too narrow,” Scharf said on a call with analysts. “We need to begin to take action to improve our results.” Layoffs, branch closures and cuts to third-party spending are on the table, executives said. The San Francisco-based bank also announced it would slash its dividend starting in the third quarter, to 10 cents per share from 51 cents. Wells Fargo reported a net loss of $2.4 billion, or 66 cents per share, compared with a profit of $6.2 billion, or $1.30 per share, in the year-earlier period. It underperformed expectations by a mile: analysts had expected a loss of 20 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. The main factors weighing on results were $9.5 billion loan-loss reserves and a $1.2 billion loss tied to the sales scandal. Total non-interest expenses jumped 8% to $14.6 billion. Because Wells does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America Corp, its Main Street lending woes are even more painful. It is also constrained by a growth restriction the Fed placed on its balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses. Only when the management team can prove they have sufficiently improved risk management and controls will the regulator lift that penalty. “This will be the toughest quarter for the banking industry since the financial crisis in 2008,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders. “Wells’ results will be the worst of the bunch as the Fed’s asset cap makes an already challenging environment even more difficult.”"

Fercho will oversee home lending operations of the largest mortgage lender in the United States during a time of uncertainty in the industry. She had run Flagstar’s mortgage business for the past three years. Wells Fargo has pared back some mortgage offerings and raised requirements for certain kinds of loans during the coronavirus-fueled economic downturn. As of last month, the bank had received forbearance requests for roughly 13% of its mortgage balances, it has said. Since taking over as chief executive late last year, Charles Scharf has shaken up leadership at the bank and installed a slew of former colleagues in top positions. In the wake of racial tensions across the United States, Scharf has also pledged to diversify the bank’s leadership team. “She has been an inspiring and vocal leader across the mortgage industry while driving transformational growth at Flagstar,” said Mike Weinbach, new CEO of Consumer Lending at Wells Fargo, referring to Fercho, who is Black. DeVito, who ran the mortgage division for two years, will retire later this summer. Separately, Wells Fargo’s former chief operational risk officer, Mark Weintraub, has left the bank following a broad overhaul of its risk management structure, according to sources familiar with the matter.

5.674333238107957," Wells Fargo pledges $400 million in support of small business after PPP payout (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N will donate over $400 million toward helping small businesses recover from the coronavirus pandemic, giving away all proceeds from its participation in the Payroll Protection Program. At least $28 million is earmarked for non-profit community lenders catering to Black entrepreneurs, the bank said. “The hardest hit business in this are minority owned,” president of consumer banking Mary Mack said in an interview. “If we look at the communities we serve and the intent and spirit of the program, we believe it was to lean in to help those businesses that were perhaps the most fragile.” More than half of all small business owners do not expect to grow revenue over the next 12 months, a Wells Fargo survey found. The pandemic has shuttered Black owned-businesses at twice the rate of small businesses overall. Other major lenders, including Citigroup Inc C.N, have made similar pledges not to profit from the government stimulus program meant to help small businesses hard hit by mandatory COVID-19 related shutdowns. But those banks have said they will use some of the fees generated to cover costs associated with quickly rolling out the hulking infrastructure needed to run the program. As of June, Wells Fargo funded $10.1 billion in PPP loans and focused its participation on smaller business owners, the bank said. Out of 179,000 loans Wells Fargo processed, 84% went to companies with fewer than 10 employees and 60% were under $25,000. Its average loan size was $56,000, the bank said. That compares with an average loan size of $123,00 at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N. Chase and Bank of America Corp BAC.N provided 4,258 and 3,345 loans of $1 million or more, compared with Wells Fargo’s 929, according to a Reuters analysis of program data released on Monday."

The bank’s operating committee decided this week on the tentative date, he added. Roughly 200,000 of the San Francisco-based bank’s 265,000 employees have been working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those still reporting to the office primarily include employees working from bank branches or operations centers. The bank had already cautioned workers that its coronavirus-related policies would likely stay in place even after governments loosen lockdowns. States including Georgia and Texas have started non-essential businesses, and hard-hit New York is preparing to ease business restrictions in some regions as soon as this week. Before July, Wells Fargo executives may consider minor changes to current policies, like allowing customers to use teller windows at branches that have been converted to drive-through only during the pandemic, or resuming some operations in other countries where conditions have eased, the memo said.

The San Francisco-based bank has received ""formal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans,"" it said in a regulatory filing without elaborating. (bit.ly/3b6ctuF) A spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the probes. Wells Fargo faced a string federal investigations for most of the last three years after a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. It wrapped up the last major probe into the issue in February, in a $3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission.Small businesses have filed lawsuits against U.S. banks including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America alleging unfair practices in processing loans under the program, including prioritizing larger loans over smaller ones. Wells Fargo started taking applications for the $350 billion rescue fund on April 4, one day after the official launch and a day later than Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co. As of April 27 the bank had submitted more than 100,000 PPP applications to the Small Business Administration for review, Wells Fargo spokesman Manuel Venegas said on Tuesday. Companies with fewer than 25 employees account for 90% of those applications and 80% generate less than $2 million in annual revenue. The average loan size was less than $110,000, Venegas said. Wells Fargo initially capped its participation in the program at $10 billion due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s punitive curbs on increasing its balance sheet following its sales practices scandals.

-13.422176766091548," Exclusive: Wells Fargo shifts energy bankers to focus on bankruptcies (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has revived its special group for bad energy loans in recent weeks as the bank braces for more pain from the sharp downturn in oil prices, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Sitting inside the credit-resolution group, where Wells Fargo handles struggling borrowers, the team includes many bankers who previously worked with the same oil and gas producers in its investment bank. They work alongside bankruptcy specialists who have been reassigned to focus exclusively on energy to help Wells Fargo wade through the expected flood of restructurings. “It’s a bloodbath,” said one person with knowledge of the bank’s oil and gas portfolio, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Michelle Palomino said Wells Fargo maintains a strong energy and power group within its corporate and investment bank. The bank is committed to helping borrowers in the energy industry during this challenging time, she added. Global energy markets are awash with crude oil because of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that boosted supply while demand was cratering due to the global coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. benchmark oil price briefly traded negatively last week for the first time in history. The U.S. energy industry was already struggling with high debt levels and profitability problems before this maelstrom. Bankruptcies have begun, with an April 7 survey of producers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City forecasting 40% would be insolvent within a year if oil prices were $30 per barrel. That is nearly double the current value. [O/R] Banks have worried for months about their loans to U.S. oil and gas producers, which could not tap other avenues to raise money. Lenders have been trying to pare back exposure by, for instance, ascribing less value to the collateral behind reserve-based loans (RBLs), the energy industry’s main source of cash. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N are considered to be the two largest lenders to U.S. energy companies. Citigroup Inc C.N had the largest energy loan book of any U.S. bank at the end of 2019 because of its international business. As of the end of March, Wells Fargo had $14.3 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding, according to filings. Roughly 15% of Wells Fargo’s oil and gas team now reports to the credit resolution group on a special energy team, two bank sources said. The corporate banking energy group had already been reduced by about 7% after a round of layoffs last summer. Bart Schouest, who heads Wells Fargo’s energy lending unit, and Michael Thomas, a restructuring executive, are leading the new team. It is reminiscent of another workout team Wells Fargo assembled in 2015, as oil was plunging from over $100 per barrel the prior year to a nadir of $26 in early 2016. That group wound down in 2017 as the market recovered, although not before Wells had experienced billions of dollars in losses on its energy book. Wells Fargo’s exposure to the industry has fallen by roughly $3 billion since then and bank sources say the bank learned lessons that should help it navigate this storm, but many are still preparing for the worst. The industry’s largest lenders have studied how they would take ownership of energy assets if borrowers proved unable to repay their debts to banks, and some are preparing to set up legal entities which would own stakes in seized properties. Wells Fargo is instead hoping to capitalize of its internal resources. The special workout team is a way for Wells Fargo to manage relationships during the current downturn, hoping to maintain ties with those that survive, sources said."
-9.772303305805504," Wells Fargo's relationship with NRA is 'declining': CEO (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N relationship with the National Rifle Association (NRA) is ""declining,"" Chief Executive Charles Scharf told investors on Tuesday. “I don’t think we participate any longer in the organization’s line of credit and mortgage loan commitments,” Scharf said at Wells Fargo’s annual shareholder meeting, adding that the bank’s exposure to the firearms lobbying group was minimal. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has been quietly winding down its relationship with the NRA for nearly two years, a bank spokesman said. But Tuesday’s comments marked a change in tone at the San Francisco-based lender, which has been known as one of the largest financiers of the firearms sector, even as other large bank rivals backed away. Past Wells Fargo executives defended the bank’s relationship with the NRA and lending policies, saying that gun violence solutions should come from the government not banks. Wells Fargo’s continued relationship with the organization after 2018 caused it to lose its mortgage partnership with the American Federation of Teachers, a major U.S. union. Major finance firms including Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Citigroup Inc C.N placed limits on their lending to gun makers and retailers in 2018 in response to a widespread backlash after a school shooting in Florida. Last year Wells Fargo said it would invest more than $10 million over three years to support nonpartisan research on gun violence prevention. “That we’ll continue to support as we move forward,” Scharf said on Tuesday."

-3.3941368273710095," Wells Fargo, BofA and JPMorgan grant overdraft relief as stimulus checks roll in (Reuters) - The top U.S. retail banks said on Wednesday they would provide relief to customers who had overdrawn checking accounts, so that they could reap the full benefits of the federal government’s cash stimulus program. Americans stand to receive payments of up to $1,200 each as part of Congress’ $2.2 trillion aid package meant to stem the fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak that has shuttered businesses and left more than 10 million people unemployed. The first wave of the payments began to hit bank accounts through direct deposits this week. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are pausing collection on negative balances or offering temporary credits to customers who have overdrawn their accounts. Without the relief, the payments would be reduced by the amount of the negative balance, which can include hefty overdraft fees. The number of checking-account customers with negative balances varies widely each day and often peaks at the end of months, when people face bills, and falls on common paydays, like the 15th. “We hope this gives them a chance to catch their breath,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Anne Pace said. Chase and Wells Fargo are also waiving fees for non-customers who come in to cash their checks. “We encourage customers who receive a stimulus payment check to use mobile deposits or ATMs to deposit the checks if possible,” Wells Fargo said in a statement."
-18.016148109271146," Wells Fargo profit decimated as coronavirus-led loan defaults loom (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N eked out a first-quarter profit of one penny per share as the bank set aside nearly $4 billion to cover expected loan losses due to the coronavirus pandemic. Banks were largely expected to take large blows to their earnings as they braced for consumers and companies being unable to pay their bills in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak which has shuttered businesses and put nearly 10 million people out of work. But Wells Fargo is unique in contending with an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet, which has limited its ability to make loans to corporate clients and customers looking for funds to help them through the crisis. In 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve restricted the bank’s balance sheet to $1.95 trillion until it can prove it has the risk management structures which led to the 2016 sales practices scandal. At the end of the quarter, the bank’s total assets were $1.98 trillion, above the level allowed by the Federal Reserve’s consent order, but the bank is managing its average asset level so that it remains in compliance. “During these challenging times, we expect loan-to-deposit growth could continue but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth, and we’re actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers,” said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. The U.S. government has poured trillions of dollars into financial markets and launched stimulus programs to support the economy stalled by the lockdowns put in place to contain the pandemic, but unpaid bills are already piling up. On a call with analysts, Chief Executive Charlie Scarf called the government actions “swift” and “impressive,” but added that the length of the shutdown will ultimately determine the severity of the economic blow. Wells Fargo has already deferred roughly $2.8 billion of payments and $30 million worth of fee waivers, Scharf said. The San Francisco-based bank set aside some $3.83 billion in credit loss provisions, up from $845 million a year earlier. The bank also suspended its guidance for lending revenue for the year, and put its cost cutting initiatives on pause in light of the crisis, executives said. Total loans rose 2% to $965 billion as an uptick in corporate loans outweighed a drop in consumer credit card balances and some mortgage loans being refinanced away.

-17.276014845313018," Fed modifying asset cap so Wells Fargo can make more small business loans WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would ""temporarily and narrowly"" modify the growth restriction on Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N balance sheet, allowing the bank to make more loans under government assistance programs for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus disruption. The change will allow the bank to make additional loans under the $350 billion small business payroll protection program approved by Congress last month and the Fed’s forthcoming Main Street Lending Program, and will be in place as long as those facilities are active, the central bank said. The announcement prompted Wells Fargo to announce it was expanding its participation in the small business rescue program after initially restricting its lending capacity at $10 billion due to regulatory requirements despite seeing high demand. Wells Fargo, one of the largest U.S. small business lenders, received over 170,000 indications of interest for the program within the first two days. Small businesses have been hit hard by the COVID1-19 pandemic, which has shuttered, at least temporarily, non-essential businesses in many states and curbed consumer spending. The bank has been urging the Fed to lift the asset cap so it can unleash its full lending capacity to support struggling businesses and consumers, but regulators were initially cold to the idea, Reuters has reported. The liquidity crunch facing Main Street has helped the scandal-plagued bank pick up unlikely advocates, including Wall Street watchdog group Better Markets and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) chair Sheila Bair, who have said the Fed should grant the bank more leeway to make sure small businesses can access much-needed funds. Loans made under the new government programs will not count toward the $1.95 trillion asset cap the Fed imposed on the bank in February 2018. The Fed has said it would only remove the cap when Wells Fargo had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals. “To date the firm has to date not satisfied all of the requirements for removal of the asset growth restriction,” Fed officials said in the amended consent order on Wednesday. Under the new conditions, Wells Fargo will have to turn over any fees generated from its participation in the program to the U.S. Treasury or to nonprofits approved by the Fed."

-9.15848908178165," Wells Fargo reduces mortgage products amid coronavirus outbreak (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is offering fewer home loan products during the coronavirus-fueled economic downturn, a spokesman said on Monday. The bank has paused many kinds of loans including cash-out refinance loans, most home equity loans above $250,000 and riskier non-conforming purchase loans, according to a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the company. Applications for those loan types were automatically turned down as of Friday. Underwriting some of those loans has become harder, and Wells Fargo suspended home interior inspections last week after governments across the country urged or mandated social distancing, the spokesman said. Some rivals are working around the problem by doing drive-by appraisals or having customers take pictures of properties with their phones, bank sources said. The change comes as the coronavirus pandemic has put increased pressure on Wells Fargo’s balance sheet which has been capped by regulators since 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve restricted the bank’s balance sheet at 2017 levels until it can prove it has the risk management structures which led to the 2016 sales practices scandal. Up to now, the bank has been operating with room under its $1.95 trillion dollar cap, but amid tense demand for cash, Wells Fargo has said the cap is preventing it from helping customers and lending more. The bank is shunning riskier non-conforming loans with downpayments of less than 20% and home equity lines of credit above $500,000, according to the memo. Home equity loans above $250,000 on properties worth more than $1 million or for 2-4 unit properties are being declined. Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender, originating $201 billion in 2019, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. “These difficult business decisions reflect efforts to prioritize how we serve customers and maintain prudent balance sheet discipline,” spokesman Tom Goyda said. “High-balance conforming loans will be originated only as agency loans and will not be placed on our balance sheet.” Conventional loans guaranteed by agencies like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac move quickly off a bank’s balance sheet as they are packaged into mortgage securities to be sold to investors. But non-conforming loans with smaller downpayments and large home equity lines of credit are considered riskier and may stay on the bank’s books. The bank has also stopped buying non-conforming loans from third parties and will only accept jumbo refinancing applications from customers with at least $250,000 at the bank, the spokesman said."
-9.15848908178165," Wells Fargo caps role in coronavirus rescue program at $10 billion (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said late Sunday that it will cap its participation in the U.S. government's small business coronavirus rescue program at $10 billion due to regulatory constraints. The $350 billion loan program, which launched on Friday, will provide low-interest loans to help small businesses cover payroll and other fixed costs such as rent, mortgages and utilities over the next eight weeks. “While we are actively working to create balance sheet capacity to lend, we are limited in our ongoing ability to use our strong capital and liquidity position to extend additional credit,” Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement. The Federal Reserve in early 2018 ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals. The bank started 2020 with roughly $20 billion of room under the cap, according to filings. Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. lender, has urged the U.S. Federal Reserve to lift the asset cap on the bank to help it support businesses and customers hit by economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. But so far regulators have been cold on the idea. “We are committed to helping our customers during these unprecedented and challenging times, but are restricted in our ability to serve as many customers as we would like,” Scharf said. The San Francisco-based lender said it has likely reached its $10 billion limit based on the applications it has already received, and will prioritize giving loans to non-profits and businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The bank will also give fees received from the program to non-profits focused on small business. Small businesses, which employ about half of U.S. private sector employees, have been dramatically hurt by the coronavirus pandemic as states have halted non-essential businesses and consumers curb their spending. Banks have been flooded with applications from clients looking for a piece of bailout fund. Bank of America Corp BAC.N, the first large bank to begin accepting applications on Friday morning, said it received 85,000 applications requesting $22 billion on the first day. Wells Fargo opened its portal on Saturday. The bank said it was helping customers in other ways including deferring payments and waiving fees. Last month the bank deferred nearly $1.8 billion in payments and waved more than $28 million in fees for customers affected by the coronavirus recession."

-3.6514939243150994," Exclusive: U.S. prosecutors probe former Wells Fargo executive over scandal - sources WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating the former head of Wells Fargo & Co’s community banking division for her role in the lender’s product mis-selling scandal, two sources said. The Department of Justice is investigating Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the bank’s retail and small business lending business from 2007 to 2016, the sources said. The criminal inquiry into Tolstedt’s actions has not been previously reported. The development marks a rare instance of a senior bank executive facing criminal inquiry as a result of their job. Wells Fargo, which paid $3 billion in February to settle federal civil and criminal probes, has admitted that it pressured employees between 2002 and 2016 to meet unrealistic sales goals, which led them to open fake accounts for customers. Reuters was unable to determine whether the criminal investigation will lead to any charges against Tolstedt. Tolstedt is also contesting a $25 million fine and civil charges brought by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a banking regulator in January. Tolstedt and Enu Mainigi, Tolstedt’s counsel at Williams & Connolly LLP, did not respond to several requests for comment about the criminal inquiry. Mainigi has previously said that Tolstedt acted “appropriately and in good faith at all times.” “Throughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing,” she said in January in response to the OCC’s charges. “A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie.” A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, which has led the Department of Justice’s Wells Fargo criminal investigation, declined to comment. The prosecution of Wells Fargo executives who oversaw the bank’s activities is seen by lawmakers and investors as one of the final pieces of the scandal’s fallout for the bank. Wells Fargo has paid out more than $7 billion to settle multiple probes and private litigation. Prosecutors had been probing Tolstedt as one among a short list of people with a view to bringing criminal charges, the sources said. One of the sources added that the list has narrowed to focus on Tolstedt. Tolstedt is the individual described as “Executive A” whom the Justice Department singled out in a document detailing its evidence against the San Francisco-based lender in February, one of the sources said. In the document, a statement of facts published alongside the deal agreed by the bank and the government prosecutors, said “Executive A” ran Wells Fargo’s community banking division from 2007-2016 and led its strategy to sell additional products to existing customers. “Executive A” helped cultivate a high-pressure sales culture, in which “onerous” sales goals led thousands of employees to engage in unlawful and unethical conduct, they wrote. The executive also ignored repeated complaints about the practices, prosecutors wrote. In its charges, the OCC said Tolstedt was “directly and significantly” responsible for the business model that incentivized the misconduct. She invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the civil inquiry, the OCC said in January."
-7.846723300410746," Wells Fargo to pay special compensation to front-line workers amid coronavirus outbreak (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N will join other large U.S. banks in paying out special compensation to front-line employees, according to a memo seen on Monday by Reuters. The San Francisco-based bank said all of its domestic full-time employees who make less than $100,000 a year would receive a pre-tax payment of $600 and part-time employees would get a $300 bonus. Front-line employees like branch workers, call-center staff and technology specialists who are required to come into the office as others work from home because of the coronavirus outbreak will receive an additional $200 per pay period starting April 17 for up to five paychecks, the memo said. Management has also decided not to pay out a discretionary profit-sharing 401(k) contribution for 2019, citing the bank’s financial performance last year and the “extraordinary environment,” said the memo signed by Chief Executive Charlie Scharf. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo. Banks have largely been excluded from government-mandated shutdowns across the country because they are considered an essential industry by the federal government, meaning most bank branches, call centers and trading floors have stayed open even as many firms send their employees home. “During this global public health emergency, we are especially grateful for those of you who continue to come into our branches, contact centers and other offices to serve customers and colleagues,” the memo said. Earlier on Monday, Citigroup Inc C.N said it would pay $1,000 to U.S. employees who make $60,000 or less in base salary. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said in a memo on Friday it would give workers who are staffing branches and call centers through the coronavirus pandemic a onetime $1,000 bonus. Bank of America Corp BAC.N will also pay an additional $200 per pay period to front-line workers in branches, call centers and operation centers, with enhanced overtime pay, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday."

The Federal Reserve in early 2018 ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Arati Randolph on Saturday said the bank could not comment on regulatory matters, adding that it was focused on satisfying the requirements of the consent order. “During these challenging times, we are very focused on doing all we can for our clients while operating under the constraints of the asset cap,” Randolph said in an email. The Federal Reserve declined to comment. The central bank imposed the unprecedented cap as a penalty for sales practices and abuses at Wells Fargo, including the opening millions of phony accounts and overcharging customers on products ranging from mortgages to auto loans. The cap has been a drag on Wells Fargo’s reputation and earnings. Chief Executive Charles Scharf, who took over in October, has made it a priority to resolve outstanding regulatory matters. Wells Fargo said on Friday it was suspending residential property foreclosure sales, evictions and involuntary automobile repossessions due to the coronavirus outbreak. The bank also said it was temporarily closing some branches, adjusting the operating hours of others, relocating employees and increasing charitable donations.

-13.587031577049679," Wells Fargo directors step down days before grilling by U.S. Congress (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Monday two directors, including Chairwoman Elizabeth Duke, have resigned, effective from March 8, days before they were set to appear before the U.S. Congress as part of an investigation into bank’s sales practices. In a statement, the bank named James Quigley as the other board member who stepped down. The two were set to testify at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, where the committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said she would call for their resignations. The hearing has not been removed from the committee’s official calendar. A representative for Waters was not immediately available for comment. The committee has been investigating the bank and its relationship with regulators after a sales practices scandal that began in 2016, when it was revealed the bank opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The bank has paid over $7 billion in penalties and fees related to the scandal. The enquiry unearthed documents and emails that showed a complacent attitude on the part of some directors toward the company’s regulatory issues, according to a report released last week. For example, Quigley complained about having to reschedule his vacation plans to meet with one of the bank’s top regulators. The report also found that Duke was reluctant to properly oversee one of the bank’s consent orders and suggested that regulators reach out to management instead of to her. Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor, joined Wells Fargo’s board in 2015. She was elected vice chairwoman in 2016 and became chairwoman in 2018. Quigley, who joined the board in 2013, and Duke were among the few remaining directors who have been with Wells Fargo since before the scandal came to light. After the resignations, just two of the of the bank’s 10 directors will have been on the board before 2016. The bank declined to comment on whether the bank was searching for replacements for Duke and Quigley. However, current board Vice Chairman Charles Noski, former finance chief at Bank of America Corp, will now lead the board. He joined the board in 2019. The departures take place a month after Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf announced his first major reshuffle since taking over in October, naming several executives to new roles and a JPMorgan Chase & Co veteran to head consumer lending."

-12.878147538838677," Former Wells Fargo CEO Sloan may face Justice Dept. probe over Congressional testimony WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A key congressional panel’s chair on Thursday said she may ask the Justice Department to probe whether former Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan misled lawmakers, and called for bank Chair Betsy Duke to resign following a yearlong investigation into its sales practice scandals. Speaking to reporters, Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters, who chairs the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said Sloan gave “inaccurate and misleading testimony” when he told the panel last year that the bank was in compliance with a settlement to remediate customers harmed by its sales practices. Waters also called for the resignations of Duke, who chairs the Wells Fargo board, and director James Quigley, saying they failed to appreciate or swiftly act on the bank’s problems. The conclusions of the House Financial Service Committee staff report relating to Sloan are completely unfounded, said Sloan’s lawyer Josh Cohen. Representatives for Wells Fargo and the Justice Department declined to comment. While Waters does not have the power to order a Justice Department probe or remove bank executives, the report threatens to taint more senior executives at the bank, which lost two CEOs and several senior managers to the scandal. Her comments also indicate Duke, previously a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve board, will be in for a rough ride next Wednesday when she testifies alongside Quigley before Waters’ panel, preceded by new CEO Charles Scharf on Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, Waters released a report finding that the bank’s leadership and its regulators failed for years to address long-running issues at the bank regarding its culture and sales practices. The report also said Sloan wrongly testified in March 2019 that the bank was in compliance with a 2018 consent order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) relating to mis-selling of mortgages and auto loans. Emails between OCC staff later showed that the bank was not in compliance with one aspect of the order’s customer remediation plan.

In January, the OCC banned fined former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf $17.5 million to settle charges he failed to halt the misconduct and brought charges against eight other former executives. Wells Fargo has also paid out more than $7 billion in penalties related to the scandal since 2016.

-16.93188451498585," Wells Fargo to raise minimum pay in most of its U.S. markets (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday it plans to increase minimum wage to between $15 and $20 per hour for most of its U.S. markets, joining other Wall Street banks that have raised hourly pay in recent years. The pay hikes, which will take effect by the end of 2020, will increase the wages for more than 20,000 U.S.-based employees and will be based on employee location. (reut.rs/3cvH0DU) In recent years, Wells Fargo has increased its minimum hourly base pay in the U.S. by 32%, most recently to $15 in March 2018, the company said. Employees working in the cities of New York or San Francisco will receive a minimum hourly pay rate of $20, while employees in Charlotte or Des Moines will receive a minimum of $16 per hour, according to the company. Last year, Bank of America Corp said it would raise its minimum wage to $20 per hour over a two-year period. JPMorgan Chase & Co has been raising hourly wages to between $15 and $18, but has fielded criticism from U.S. lawmakers that it should raise it further. The announcement from Wells Fargo comes a week before Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf is scheduled to testify before the U.S. Congress over measures the bank taken related to its sales scandal."
-16.93188451498585," Wells Fargo says DACA recipients to get access to credit products (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Thursday it plans to provide access to a suite of its credit products to recipients of the DACA program that protects from deportation some young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The move comes ahead of hearings next week that will see the bank’s Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf and its Chair Betsy Duke testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee for the first time. The credit products will include education loans, personal lines and loans, and credit cards among others, the U.S. lender said in a statement. The DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, which was introduced in 2012, has shielded from deportation a group of immigrants dubbed “Dreamers” and has given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. Wells Fargo also said it will make mortgage and home equity loans to eligible DACA customers, except where prohibited by specific investors. The bank will roll out the new offerings in phases starting in the first half of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, it said. Earlier in the day, House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters said that she applauds the bank’s recent actions like raising minimum wage and addressing consumer issues like excessive overdraft fees, but said the bank has more work to do. “It goes a lot deeper than several actions that are taken prior to coming to the board to change our opinion,” she told reporters."

-16.93188451498585," Congressional report says Wells Fargo not complying with regulatory settlements WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo is not complying with the terms of multiple settlements related to its sales scandal, according to a Congressional report released on Wednesday that also faulted regulators for failing to aggressively enforce the agreements. The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee released the findings of its year-long probe into the bank ahead of hearings next week that will see its new chief executive, Charles Scharf, and its chair, Betsy Duke, testify before the committee for the first time. Drawing on internal emails and meeting notes, the report paints a picture of a complacent Wells Fargo board and management who did not take seriously settlements the bank agreed with federal regulators between 2016 and 2018 to resolve charges it had abused customers. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank was reviewing the report. Specifically, according to the report, Wells Fargo’s board of directors allowed management to repeatedly submit materially deficient plans to regulators in response to the consent orders. The report said the regulators, for their part, failed to hold Wells Fargo accountable for its wrongdoing. The report also says former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan gave “inaccurate and misleading testimony” to Congress during a March 2019 committee hearing when he said the bank was in compliance with a 2018 consent order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) relating to mis-selling of mortgages and auto loans. Emails between OCC staff-members late showed that the bank was not in compliance with one of two aspects of the order’s customer remediation plan, and that the OCC staff concluded that Sloan gave inaccurate testimony to Congress, the report says. Sloan could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. Spokespeople for the OCC did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Wells Fargo has paid out more than $7 billion in fines and penalties related to the scandal since 2016, including to the U.S. Department of Justice. Internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo’s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank.

-27.422183603842825," Wells Fargo to introduce no overdraft fee bank account, limited overdraft fee account (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Tuesday that will launch new bank accounts to limit overdraft fees for customers. One bank account will charge a $5 monthly fee, exclude checks, and limit spending to the amount available within the account. Customers who want to be able to write checks can opt for an account that limits overdraft fees to one per month for a $10 monthly fee. The new accounts are expected to launch early next year. Other Wells Fargo deposit accounts give customers the option to avoid a monthly fee so long as their account meets certain requirements like having a direct deposit or making a number of purchases per month. Overdraft fees have drawn scrutiny from regulators and politicians for years since they are typically only paid by customers with the least money. In 2009 the Federal Reserve issued a rule that prevented banks from charging overdraft fees on ATM and one-time debit card transactions unless the customer opted into overdraft protection. The rule did not apple to recurring payments like subscriptions and auto-pay. Since the beginning of 2020 Wells Fargo has received dozens of complaints related to overdraft fees, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database. Wells Fargo has taken a number of measures to help customers avoid overdraft fees. In 2017 the bank started provided real-time balance alerts to customers whenever their account fall to zero or less, stopped charging fees on accounts that were overdrawn by less than $5, and introduced a overdraft rewind feature that refunded fees charged when a covering direct deposit was received the next day. The moves have been a drag on fee income for the bank."

-32.01206103508492," SEC orders Wells Fargo pay $35 million for recommendations of high-risk products WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday it ordered Wells Fargo & Co to pay $35 million to settle charges it failed to adequately supervise investment advisers who were recommending high-risk products. Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network failed to supervise investment advisers who recommended single-inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The advisers recommended the investments to customers with conservative or moderate risk tolerances, including senior citizens and retirees, the SEC said in a filing. The order comes just a week after Wells Fargo & Co agreed to a $3 billion deal with the regulator and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve criminal charges over its fake-accounts scandal. Wells Fargo did not admit or deny the SEC’s findings from Thursday’s order. The $35 million will be distributed to certain people who received the recommendations and suffered losses, the SEC said. When asked to comment on the settlement or charges, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors said the firm no longer sells the products in the full-service brokerage. “Firms must maintain effective compliance and supervisory programs to ensure that the securities they recommend are suitable for their clients,” Antonia Chion, associate director of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement. The firm’s policies were not “reasonably designed” to prevent and detect unsuitable recommendations of single-inverse ETFs from April 2012 to September 2019, the SEC said. The recommendations came after Wells Fargo received notice from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority warning on sales practices for the risky products. FINRA’s 2009 notice said that single-inverse ETFs were “not suitable for retail clients who plan to hold them for more than one trading session, particularly in volatile markets,” according to the order."

-39.29866298895721," Wells Fargo workers seek Washington's help with internal gripes (Reuters) - A contingent of aggrieved Wells Fargo & Co workers are taking complaints to Capitol Hill, saying they feel brushed aside by management. On March 25, an advocacy group called The Committee for Better Banks will participate in a House Financial Services Committee hearing titled “Holding Wells Fargo Accountable: Examining the Impact of the Bank’s Toxic Culture on Its Employees.” Two bank workers plan to testify. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said management takes their concerns seriously. The scheduled hearing is one of three focused on Wells Fargo, which has been beset by scandal since 2016, when it acknowledged its employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales targets. Last week, the bank reached a $3 billion deal with U.S. authorities over the matter - the latest in a string of costly settlements and regulatory penalties. Since then Wells Fargo has overhauled performance goals, compensation formulas and risk management to avoid such problems in the future. However, the advocacy group says problems still exist, citing layoffs, excessive workloads and a stressful work environment. Brian Jackson, a Wells Fargo mortgage underwriter who is part of The Committee for Better Banks, said the group has helped elevate concerns that might otherwise be ignored. “They’re able to work with Congress and representatives and kind of gives us a voice where they’ll actually do something about it,” Jackson told Reuters. The group has been trying in vain to get management’s attention for years. (reut.rs/2zV73TF) Charlie Scharf is the fourth Wells Fargo chief executive in place since the 2016 scandal. The group has not gotten an audience with any of the CEOs, but they have had success with Federal Reserve governors, Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and an Iowa lawmaker who used Wells Fargo employees as the face of her campaign to prevent offshoring. In response to their most recent request for a meeting, Scharf suggested the employees talk to the head of human resources and operating chief instead. However, future meetings have not been ruled out, Folk said. “Charlie takes employee concerns seriously and will continue to consider opportunities to meet with these employees as part of his ongoing internal engagement,” he said. The group also includes consumer advocates and organized labor representatives. Wells Fargo workers are not unionized."
-40.61708034922262," For Wells Fargo and former executives, $3 billion-deal with U.S. may not be the end WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Although Wells Fargo & Co settled major probes with federal agencies over abusive sales practices last week, the bank and its former executives are not out of the woods yet, legal and regulatory experts said. Wells, the fourth-largest U.S. lender, reached a $3 billion deal with the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday related to opening fake customer accounts. Prosecutors agreed not to pursue criminal charges against the bank if Wells cooperates with other investigations and complies with relevant laws for three years. However, the deal did not address issues with Wells’ mortgage and auto-lending businesses, where customers were enrolled in unwanted products that charged fees. Nor does it preclude potential charges against individuals who were in charge at the time of sales abuses. “The damage train for Wells Fargo may keep rolling along,” said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf on Friday said the bank is “committing all necessary resources” to prevent anything similar in the future. Ex-CEO John Stumpf and onetime head of community banking Carrie Tolstedt were among eight former Wells Fargo executives sanctioned by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) last month. The regulator banned Stumpf from the banking industry and sought over $58 million in civil penalties. Five of the bankers are contesting the matter. U.S. authorities have been investigating individuals, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. It is not clear they will pursue anything beyond monetary penalties or that they will be successful. U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray on Friday described the wrongdoing as “known to, if not encouraged by, the highest levels within Wells Fargo.” The Justice Department also outlined “extreme” pressure that executives placed on employees to hit sales targets, which encouraged the unlawful and unethical conduct at the heart of the customer abuses. The agreement was the latest in a string of regulatory and legal settlements Wells Fargo has reached since the scandal erupted in 2016. The bank is still operating under consent orders, which include an unprecedented asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve. Its CEO and board of directors will come under fresh scrutiny at congressional hearings next month. Investors are hoping management can resolve all the outstanding issues to help Wells Fargo’s share price recover, but there may still be hurdles, said analysts. The resolution was seen as positive, but the Fed’s consent order remains the “bigger overhang on shares,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note."
-48.299579343961575," Wells Fargo to pay $3 billion to U.S., admits pressuring workers in fake-accounts scandal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has agreed to pay $3 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes into fraudulent sales practices and has admitted to pressuring employees in a fake-accounts scandal, U.S. officials said on Friday, wrapping up one of the last major investigations looming over the bank. Wells Fargo will pay the penalties to the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission and enter into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement during which the San Francisco-based bank will continue to cooperate with any ongoing government investigations, Justice Department officials said. As part of the deal, Wells Fargo admitted that between 2002 and 2016 it pressured employees to meet “unrealistic sales goals that led thousands of employees to provide millions of accounts or products to customers under false pretenses or without consent, often by creating false records or misusing customers’ identities,” the department said in a statement. In a statement, Charles Scharf, Wells Fargo’s new chief executive, described the past conduct as “reprehensible.” Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest U.S. lender. “This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within the bank. Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way,” Nick Hanna, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement. Top managers within Wells Fargo’s Community Bank division were aware of the “unlawful and unethical” practices as early as 2002, and many of the practices were referred to as “gaming” within the bank, the Justice Department said. The agreement resolves the civil and criminal liability regarding Wells Fargo’s fake-accounts scandal. About $500 million of the penalties will go to the SEC to be distributed to investors to settle charges that the bank committed fraud by misleading investors about its sales practices, an SEC official said on a call with reporters about the resolutions settlement. Settling the multi-agency investigation marked an important milestone for Scharf, who joined the company from BNY Mellon in September shortly after the third anniversary of the scandal. “We are committing all necessary resources to ensure that nothing like this happens again, while also driving Wells Fargo forward,” Scharf said. ‘GHOST IN A MACHINE’ Watchdog group Public Citizen criticized the deal, saying it does not go far enough. “Any resolution for Wells Fargo’s massive, management-directed misconduct must hold individuals to account. We know many of the crimes, and we know that real executives, not some ghost in a machine, committed them,” said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate with the Washington-based group. The deal does not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals, Justice Department officials told reporters. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, wrote on Twitter, “This is a small step in the right direction, but it’s not a substitute for holding senior executives individually accountable - and bringing criminal charges against them if the evidence justifies it.” The probe examined activities in Wells Fargo’s community bank unit, with Justice Department citing pressure coming from the division’s leadership. In a rare move last month, a U.S. bank regulator charged several former Wells Fargo executives for their roles in the scandal. That included a settlement with former CEO John Stumpf and civil charges against Carrie Tolstedt, former head of the community bank unit. “Ms. Tolstedt acted appropriately and in good faith at all times, and the effort to scapegoat her is both unfair and unfounded,” her lawyer Enu Mainigi said on Friday. The Justice Department inquiry was seen by analysts and investors as a key hurdle the bank had to clear before it could focus on its growth strategy, which includes convincing the Federal Reserve to remove an unprecedented growth restriction placed on Wells Fargo’s balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls. Wells Fargo had already paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties related to the scandal since 2016. Internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo’s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold three hearings on Wells Fargo’s conduct next month. Over the past three years, Wells Fargo has taken various steps to fix its issues and rebuild trust with customers, investors and regulators. They include changes to its board, centralizing risk teams and hiring an external chief executive. However, ongoing reputation issues and unresolved legal matters have weighed on the bank’s stock price and profitability, which have lagged peers since 2016."
-47.67925930454028," Factbox: Remaining hurdles for scandal-hit Wells Fargo (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has racked up well over $7 billion in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds. Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop: More hearings: The House Financial Services Committee said on Friday that it will conduct three Wells Fargo hearings next month where new Chief Executive Charles Scharf and other company officials will be probed about the scandal. The bank’s executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank’s wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing “historical” and “legacy” issues, but lawmakers will rehash Wells Fargo’s mistakes in public. Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation. Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank’s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls. Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public conference call last month, Scharf did not set a new timeline. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo’s asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to “Needs to Improve” from “Outstanding” shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank’s ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business."

The San Francisco-based bank made the decision following a shareholder proposal from Clean Yield Asset Management which has since been withdrawn, asking for a public analysis of mandatory arbitration’s impact on sexual assault claims within the company. “Wells Fargo has zero tolerance for sexual harassment,” David Galloreese, head of human resources at Wells Fargo, wrote in an article posted on the company’s internal and external websites. “The treatment of sexual harassment claims has become an increasingly prominent issue across industries.” The new policy applies to all future harassment claims. Since 2015, Wells Fargo has required employees to sign arbitration agreements when they are hired to that require them to settle workplace disputes privately, not in court. In December, a representative from Clean Yield Asset Management, an impact investing firm with a roughly $2,000 stake in Wells Fargo, submitted a proposal asking the board to conduct a review of mandatory arbitration’s effect on sexual harassment claims and make the report public. “Wells Fargo has raised the bar for financial institutions aiming to root out sexual harassment in the workplace,” said Clean Yield’s Director of Shareholder Advocacy, Molly Betournay. “We urge other companies, particularly other big banks, to follow suit.”"

-47.315070580765415," Wells Fargo CEO Scharf shakes up management at scandal-hit bank (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N Chief Executive Charles Scharf on Tuesday announced his first major reshuffle since taking over in October, naming several executives to new roles while also tapping a JPMorgan veteran to head consumer lending. The shakeup is aimed at putting a new structure in place as the bank looks to rebuild its reputation and increase accountability, Wells Fargo said in a statement. The new structure, which increases the bank's business lines to five from three, closely resembles that of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, where Scharf was mentored by CEO Jamie Dimon earlier in his career. Scharf has already brought on several former colleagues from the No. 1 U.S. bank. The latest addition, Mike Weinbach, will join the firm after 16 years at JPMorgan to lead the San Francisco-based lender’s new consumer lending division in May. Wells Fargo also hired a third executive from Santander Holdings USA, Andrew Heller, to serve as strategy and operations planning leader. The consumer bank will be split into a consumer lending division and a retail banking division, and the wholesale bank will be divided into a commercial banking unit, and a corporate and investment banking unit. The wealth management division was left unchanged. As part of the management overhaul, the bank is seeking to fill a number of new executive positions. It is searching, among other openings, for a segment leader for its small business unit, a consumer banking marketing head and an executive to run its digital strategies for the consumer and small business unit, according to internal memos seen by Reuters. The bank is also seeking a lead business control executive to supervise control executives across its business lines, the memos said. Additionally, Wells Fargo has disbanded its Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation Group and formed a new group called Strategy, Digital Platform & Innovation focused on digital strategies and customer experience. New Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell, a former JPMorgan and Santander executive, will run the unit until a permanent replacement is found."

The company had total long-term debt of $230 billion as of Dec. 31. Its problems began to unfold in September 2016, when the bank revealed that employees had opened potentially millions of bogus accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets set by management. Since then, Wells Fargo has found other problematic practices that cost customers money or otherwise harmed their financial well-being.

-42.805918012788084," Remaining hurdles for scandal-hit Wells Fargo (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and its officials have racked up well over $4 billion (3 billion pounds) in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds. Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop: Probes: A number of federal agencies are examining the bank and its employees for potential wrongdoing. The Department of Justice is looking into whether executives withheld details about fake accounts to the Wells Fargo board of directors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the lead regulator for national banks, Reuters has reported. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Philadelphia office, meanwhile, has been investigating whether Wells Fargo misled investors by inflating performance metrics and whether the bank penalized whistleblowers, Reuters also reported. The Department of Labor is also examining whether the bank acted on staff whistleblower complaints. Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the OCC, SEC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation. Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank’s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls. Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public call with the company earlier this month, new Chief Executive Charlie Scarf did not set a new timeline. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo’s asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to “Needs to Improve” from “Outstanding” shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank’s ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business that requires a higher CRA rating. More hearings: The bank’s executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank’s wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. New CEO Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing “historical and “legacy” issues during his first call, but lawmakers are likely to continue rehashing Wells Fargo’s mistakes in public. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, House Financial Services Committee chair, said she plans to call Wells Fargo board members to testify this year."
-42.805918012788084," U.S. bank regulator sharpens teeth on Wells Fargo, surprising critics WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long accused of being too soft, a U.S. bank regulator has surprised its critics with tough treatment of scandal-ridden lender Wells Fargo, culminating on Thursday in more than$58 million in fines against eight former executives at the bank. Consumer groups had worried that the Trump administration’s pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Joseph Otting, would do little to change its reputation for leniency. A former chief executive of California’s OneWest Bank, Otting as comptroller has referred to lenders as his “customers” and pursued rule changes pushed for by bank lobbyists. But when it comes to Wells Fargo’s sales practices, Otting has consistently been a harsh critic, driving penalties against the bank which have broken new ground. One person with knowledge of the matter said Wells Fargo’s failure to swiftly fix systemic misconduct has angered Otting, precisely because he spent decades as a banker and felt he was held to high standards. “You would get far more significant penalties from someone who has been in the business and is disappointed in what Wells Fargo has done,” said Thomas Vartanian, a law professor at George Mason University and former OCC official. On Thursday, the OCC banned former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf from the banking industry and fined him $17.5 million to settle charges he failed to put a stop to sales misconduct - the most it has ever secured from an individual. Among other former executives charged was retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who has not yet settled and is potentially facing a whopping $25 million penalty. After watchdogs including the OCC failed to charge senior Wall Street executives for their role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis, lawmakers have pressed them to hold more individuals responsible for corporate wrongdoing. Proving personal culpability, though, is legally tough, which makes Thursday’s charges all the more striking. “The OCC actions are eye-popping in terms of the number and seniority of the individuals charged,” said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado, adding there had not been such a high profile executive crackdown in recent memory. Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University, said he was “surprised” the OCC had pursued such drastic charges. “It’s fair to say they’ve always been viewed as probably the most bank-friendly regulator,” he added. On Thursday, Otting said in a statement that the charges “reinforce the agency’s expectations that management and employees ... provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly and comply with applicable laws.” “LOW BAR” In addition to Thursday’s charges, the OCC fined Wells Fargo $500 million in 2018 for product mis-selling, only the second time it has dished out a penalty of that size. That settlement requires the bank to make extensive fixes and to repay harmed customers, an effort the OCC has been monitoring closely. It also imposed novel restrictions on the bank by giving the OCC the right to remove current executives and to vet new ones. Otting’s frustration with Wells Fargo’s slow progress on its remediation effort was laid bare in March last year. Then-CEO Tim Sloan had just finished telling Congress the bank was back on track, when the OCC responded with a rare public rebuke saying it continued to be “disappointed” in the bank. The comptroller’s public loss of confidence in Sloan contributed to his abrupt departure later that month, Reuters reported at the time. Wells Fargo has said repeatedly it was making every effort to fix its problems. On Thursday, the bank’s new CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement Wells Fargo had made “fundamental changes to its business model, compensation programs, leadership, and governance.” By being strict with Wells Fargo, the OCC may also be trying to shed its image as a soft touch, said Wilmarth. “You hammer this one bank and its executives ... and when people accuse you of being bank-friendly, you say, ‘Look how tough we were on Wells Fargo!’” he added. The OCC was lambasted for missing signs of the brewing financial crisis and was again criticized for failing to catch Wells Fargo’s problems in the first place. An internal OCC review found its examiners failed to follow-up on red flags, including hundreds of whistleblower complaints. While Otting is personally aggrieved by the bank’s lapses, he has also been under pressure from lawmakers to take a tough line. The pressure has come particularly from progressive U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has voiced sometimes stinging skepticism of the agency. “No one has been tougher on Wells Fargo than myself,” Otting told Warren when defending his record before Congress in May. “At the OCC?” Warren replied. “That’s a low bar.”"
-44.39430994776698," U.S. bank regulator charges ex-Wells Fargo executives for role in sales scandal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s U.S. regulator on Thursday announced it had banned former Chief Executive John Stumpf from the banking industry and charged him and seven other former executives combined more than $58 million in civil penalties for their roles in the bank’s multi-year sales practices scandal. The action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marks a rare example of senior executives being held personally accountable for failing to put a stop to misconduct at their bank. It also broke new ground for the regulator, which forced Stumpf to pay $17.5 million to settle the charges against him - the largest ever penalty it has secured from an individual. The OCC’s probe is one of several into the San Francisco-based lender, with investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission ongoing. One person with knowledge of the OCC probe said it was far-reaching and that more individuals could be charged. “We do not expect these penalties will end Wells Fargo’s troubles in Washington...Yet this is still a positive development for Wells Fargo as this was a hurdle that the bank was always going to have to clear,” said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note. Some of the OCC’s findings, though, contradict Wells Fargo’s 2017 board report into the scandal, which largely pinned the blame on a small number of executives, in particular the bank’s former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt. But on Thursday, the OCC said many members of the bank’s senior leadership were culpable, a finding that is likely to spark further questions by lawmakers who may push for criminal convictions, said Sieberg. In addition to Stumpf, former human resources head Hope Hardison and Michael Loughlin, former chief risk officer, settled the OCC’s charges for $2.25 million and $1.25 million, respectively, the OCC said. Stumpf, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also agreed to a lifetime ban on working for an OCC-regulated bank. He abruptly left the company in October 2016 after a nearly a decade at the helm. Five other former executives refused to settle, including Tolstedt who is facing a potential $25 million civil monetary penalty, James Strother, the former general counsel, and Claudia Russ Anderson, the former community bank group risk officer, who both face $5 million fines. They and two auditing executives may ultimately fight the charges before a judge under the OCC’s administrative process. “Throughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing. A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie,” a lawyer for Tolstedt said in a statement. In a statement, Strother’s lawyer said the former Wells Fargo executive “acted with the utmost integrity and transparency” and that the OCC’s charges are “false and unfounded.” Russ Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment. In a memo to Wells Fargo employees, CEO Charlie Scharf said the company was reviewing Thursday’s filings and will determine what, if any, further action is appropriate in respect to any of the individuals who were named. The memo added that the bank would not make any remaining compensation payments that may be owed to those individuals in the meantime. Wells Fargo, the country’s fourth largest U.S. lender, has paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties since the 2016 revelation that the bank’s sales practices encouraged employees to open potentially millions of unauthorized bank accounts in order to hit lofty sales targets. Since then, internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo’s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. The fallout has also resulted in the Federal Reserve imposing an unprecedented growth restriction on Wells Fargo’s balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls. While Wells Fargo has inked multiple federal and private settlements for its sales practices, the OCC action marks the first federal action against individuals for their roles in the scandal, instead of just the institution. In its complaint, the OCC said that senior bank leadership must have been aware of rampant sales misconduct, citing large numbers of employee complaints and years’ worth of other evidence. For example, an internal investigation conducted by the bank in 2004 found that instances in which staff “gamed” the sales system to meet targets climbed 979% from 2000 to 2004. The number of calls to the bank’s internal ethics hotline steadily climbed from 2006 through 2014, the OCC said, with nearly half of all cases investigated related to sales misconduct."

-38.129807019426174," Wells Fargo's new chief pledges more cost cuts as profit slumps (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N profit slumped 55% in the fourth quarter as new boss Charles Scharf set aside another $1.5 billion for legal costs related to the bank's sales scandal and promised ""fundamental changes."" The bank racked up operational losses of $1.9 billion in the final quarter of the year, partly for reserves to cover pending litigation related to its fake-account scandal that erupted more than three years ago. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line while its revenue growth has been sluggish. However, a raft of fines and costs relating to sales abuses first uncovered in 2016 have been hard to control. Scharf said the bank’s cost structure is simply too high, and pledged to improve performance once he gets through regulatory issues that need attention. “There is no reason why we shouldn’t have best-in-class efficiency with these businesses at this scale, and that ultimately will be our goal,” the new chief executive said on a call with analysts. He declined to give specific targets or a time frame for reaching them. Wells Fargo shares fell about 4% to $50.01. Cost-cutting was also a cornerstone of former CEO Tim Sloan’s recovery plan, but the bank acknowledged last year that technology and compliance costs would remain high as it tried to satisfy regulators. Wells Fargo’s non-interest expenses jumped 17% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period, due to the litigation costs, as well as higher compensation expenses. It spent 78.6 cents for every dollar of revenue it generated, up from 63.6 cents a year earlier, and far above Sloan's targeted range of 55-59 cents per dollar, or rival JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N 55.9 cents. Investors watch that ratio closely to determine how well a company manages expenses. Wells is operating under heavy scrutiny as it tries to rebuild its reputation, including an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve and frequent criticism from prominent U.S. politicians. Its problems began to unfold in September 2016, when the bank revealed that employees had opened potentially millions of bogus accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets set by management. Since then, Wells Fargo has found other problematic practices that cost customers money or otherwise harmed their financial well-being. Scharf is the fourth CEO in place since that time, and investors are hopeful he can finally get his arms around the problems. Although the bank has reached settlements with some regulators and private parties, there are still outstanding probes by U.S. authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also operates under consent orders with regulators, as well as the Fed’s asset cap. Scharf would not provide guidance on when Wells Fargo might resolve its regulatory issues. Wells Fargo’s profit fell to $2.55 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. Its adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share compared with analyst estimates of $1.12, on average, according to Refinitiv. Revenue of $19.86 billion came in below expectations of $20.12 billion. The bank’s net interest income fell 11% as the Fed lowered interest rates three times last year to support the economy. However, its mortgage business benefited from lower rates, with income rising to $783 million from $467 million. Wells Fargo also continued to add deposits in the most recent quarter, with interest expense linked to deposits jumping 17%."

-39.041750742921785," New Wells Fargo CEO brings Wall Street swagger to storied bank (Reuters) - Charles Scharf will make his public debut as Wells Fargo & Co’s WFC.N chief executive during the bank’s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, and those who have worked with him in the past say he is likely to strike a much different chord than his predecessors. For years, Wells CEOs spoke with Midwestern lilts and have sprinkled their public events with folksy anecdotes. John Stumpf, who ran the San Francisco-based bank from 2007 to 2016, spoke publicly about being raised on a Minnesota farm with 10 siblings, and once recounted his own experience being upside down on a mortgage during the foreclosure crisis in 2010. Tim Sloan, who took over the reins as the bank’s fake accounts scandal unraveled, once brought his family, including grandchildren, on stage at a shareholder meeting in Iowa. But Scharf is not known for such pleasantries, several analysts who have worked with him said. He tended to give short, blunt answers when he was CEO of Visa Inc V.N and Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N, or when he was a senior executive at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, they said, noting that he is not shy about showing annoyance if he does not appreciate a question or comment. “He’s not polite necessarily,” said MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis, who covers Visa. “His bedside manner needs improvement,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy, who interacted with Scharf at BNY Mellon. “He has a straight-between-the-eyes kind of delivery,” said Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar, who has followed Scharf at each of his companies so far. A Reuters review of a dozen transcripts for conference calls Scharf led in previous jobs offered a glimpse of his tendencies. He started sentences with phrases like, “As I’ve said many times,” or “As I know you already know,” when he seemed to think questions were repetitive. He frequently directed analysts to do their own math, rather than offering guidance. Wells Fargo declined to comment for this story. Analysts who cover Wells Fargo said they will appreciate directness in a CEO, after years of feeling whipsawed by a sales scandal whose breadth and consequences have taken unexpected turns. Prior management teams initially downplayed the extent of the problems, and how they might affect profits, regulatory relationships and Wells Fargo’s reputation with customers. (reut.rs/2FEiKQW) Although associates say Scharf can be blunt at times, they also view him as knowledgeable, honest and experienced. Some compared him to his one-time mentor, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who is known to speak his mind. (reut.rs/2umViTT) “There’s a bit of Jamie Dimon in him I would have to say,” Biggar said. Scharf may be the first Wells Fargo CEO with more credentials on Wall Street than Main Street. In hiring him, the bank’s board agreed to let the native New Yorker keep his main work location in Manhattan, though Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, with big hubs in Minneapolis and Charlotte, North Carolina. Analysts do not expect Scharf to give off the same vibe as his predecessors — though they said he may make an extra effort to be courteous, given the amount of attention Wells Fargo receives. In his first internal town hall as Wells Fargo CEO, Scharf painted himself as a family man. “I don’t expect too much oomph,” said Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby. “I think its going to be very collegial.”"
-36.36596182144929," Democratic lawmaker rebukes Wells Fargo rebate request (Reuters) - Democratic Representative Katie Porter, a first-term lawmaker known as a tough Wall Street critic, accused Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N of passing on costs associated with its wide-ranging scandals to third parties, in a scathing letter sent to the bank's new chief executive on Thursday. A copy of the letter was viewed by Reuters. Last summer, Wells Fargo asked 14 of its IT vendors to return 2.5% of revenue earned in 2018, claiming that the vendors benefited from increased business as a result of its sales-practices scandals. Reuters reported in November that several of the vendors had paid Wells Fargo, and some felt pressured to do so out of fear of lost future business. “These small businesses played no role in the misdeeds committed by the Bank,” Porter, who serves on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said in the letter to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charlie Scharf. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo representatives have said participation in the voluntary rebate would not be considered when awarding future contracts. Asking for a rebate and linking it to higher costs due to regulatory backlash goes against the intent of regulator actions, Porter said. “When federal watchdogs ... assess fines against bad actors, a major purpose of those fines is to discourage continued bad behavior,” she said in the letter. “When those bad actors then pass the cost of those fines down to their vendors ... the purpose of the fine is subverted.” Porter requested that Wells Fargo refund the rebates by Jan. 30. The letter is the second Porter has sent to Scharf since he took over in October and the latest sign that the company’s woes in Washington are unlikely to abate any time soon. Last month, Representative Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said she would ask Wells Fargo board members to testify this year. Wells Fargo has been under intense scrutiny since 2016 revelations that employees opened up potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The scandal sparked multiple probes that uncovered issues in each of its main business lines and resulted in over $4 billion in fines and penalties. The San Francisco-based bank has leaned on cost cuts in recent years as the fallout from the scandal stunted revenue growth. However, increased spending on headcount and technology to satisfy regulators has caused the bank to back away from its expense targets."
-46.68685032481298," Senior U.S. lawmaker to seek testimony of Wells Fargo's board WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee will ask Wells Fargo & Co’s board of directors to testify about the bank’s sales scandal next year, a senior Democrat told Reuters on Thursday. Lawmakers want to press the board on its role in righting the bank after years of problems, said Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. “We’re going to get some of their board members up here, and see what kind of responsibilities their board members are taking for the management of Wells Fargo,” she said. “We’re going to have hearings, absolutely.” Wells Fargo declined to comment. The bank’s executives have been called before Congress multiple times since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted in 2016, but board members have so far avoided direct public interrogation. The majority of Wells Fargo’s current directors joined the board after the scandal came to light. Former chief executives John Stumpf and Tim Sloan stepped down shortly after testifying before lawmakers in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, is too big to be properly managed and should be broken up, Waters said. The San Francisco-based bank is on its third chief executive since 2016. Charles Scharf, the former CEO of Bank of New York Mellon, took the lead role at the bank in October. Scharf sits on the bank’s board, which is currently chaired by Elizabeth Duke, who once served on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Wells Fargo has been under intense scrutiny in Washington since revelations that employees opened potentially millions of fake accounts emerged more than 3 years ago.The bank is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders, including an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet from the Fed until the bank proves it has fixed its risk controls. Additionally, Wells Fargo faces federal probes by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor. Clearing Wells Fargo’s regulatory hurdles is the top priority for Scharf, who has already started making changes in his 2 months at the company. So far he has tapped his trusted adviser and former Obama administration chief of staff, Bill Daley, to lead public affairs and named his former colleague, Scott Powell, as chief operating officer to focus on the bank’s regulatory issues."
-46.68685032481298," UPDATE 1-Senior U.S. lawmaker to seek testimony of Wells Fargo's board (Adds Wells Fargo declining to comment, paragraph 8) WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo’s board of directors will be called to testify before Congress about the bank’s numerous scandals sometime in 2020, a senior U.S. House lawmaker told Reuters Thursday. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a brief interview she wanted to press the board on their role in righting the bank after years of fines, regulatory penalties, and business upheaval. “We’re going to get some of their board members up here, and see what kind of responsibilities their board members are taking for the management of Wells Fargo,” she said. “We’re going to have hearings, absolutely.” Waters, a Democrat from California, added that she remains convinced that Wells is too big to be properly managed and should be broken up. “We’re going to focus especially on Wells Fargo,” she said of her panel’s agenda next year. “There’s a new CEO there, but I think the culture of Wells Fargo has developed in such a way that it’s going to be very difficult for this new CEO to get his arms around it.” The San Francisco-based bank is on its third chief executive since disclosing a wide-ranging sales practice scandal in 2016. Charles Scharf, the former CEO of Bank of New York Mellon, took the lead role at the bank in October.

As part of its latest overhaul, the bank also hired a new head of public affairs, William Daley, who worked with Scharf at BNY Mellon and previously served as chief of staff to President Barack Obama. Separately in 2020, Waters also said she plans to pursue legislation that would set a national interest rate cap of 36% on consumer loans, continue to scrutinize Facebook’s attempts to establish a new digital currency, Libra, and redouble efforts to address homelessness in America.

Powell, who worked with Scharf at Bank One and then JPMorgan Chase & Co, most recently was chief executive officer of Santander Holdings USA Inc, as well as of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. Starting Dec. 9, Powell will focus on Wells Fargo’s relationships with regulators, which have been strained since the bank became tangled in a wide-ranging sales practices scandal in 2016. The San Francisco-based bank is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders, including an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet from the Federal Reserve until the bank proves it has fixed its risk controls. Additionally, Wells Fargo faces federal probes by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commision and the Department of Labor. “I wouldn’t count on any quick wins,” Powell told Reuters by telephone. “This is tough stuff, but it’s all very doable over time.” During his tenure at Santander US, Powell was credited with turning around the bank’s financials and fixing regulatory issues, experience he said will help him in his new role. Last month the bank hired another former JP Morgan executive and previous White House official, William Daley, to head public affairs. Wells Fargo’s board set a goal of hiring an outsider to lead the company following former CEO Tim Sloan’s retirement to satisfy critics who claimed an insider could not transform the bank’s culture. Scharf, who joined in October from Bank of New York Mellon Corp, is known to shake up leadership. Since he took over, general counsel and former interim CEO Allen Parker, and company veteran Avid Modjtabai have made plans to leave. The chief operating officer position has been vacant since October 2016, when Sloan was promoted as CEO. Powell, like Scharf, will be based in New York.

-8.89049127026691," Wells Fargo former interim CEO Parker steps down as general counsel (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Thursday general counsel Allen Parker, who briefly served as interim chief executive of the scandal-hit U.S bank, will step down next year. The departure, effective March 2020, comes at a time when Charles Scharf is beginning to put his own mark on the bank’s leadership team. Last week, the fourth-largest U.S. bank hired former JP Morgan Chase JPM.N executive and previous White House official, William Daley, to head public affairs. The appointment of Daley, a former Bank of New York Mellon executive, was an early sign that Scharf might bring in more of his long-time lieutenants. Parker, who has focused on cleaning up existing issues and preventing them from spreading during his time at Wells, had earlier signaled that he had no plans to leave, and reiterated his desire to stay on when Scharf became CEO in late October. “As interim CEO, Allen often spoke of the need for everyone at Wells Fargo to conduct our business with the highest levels of integrity,” Scharf told bank employees in a memo. Parker joined Wells as general counsel in March 2017, served as interim CEO and president from March 2019 to October 2019, and then returned to the general counsel role. In September, the Wall Street bank named Scharf as its next leader, after a wide-ranging sales practices scandal claimed two CEOs. Parker was thrust into the top position when former CEO Tim Sloan retired, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank. At one point, some analysts and people within the bank believed Parker should take on the role permanently. However, regulators were keen on Wells Fargo appointing an outsider to clean up its operations with a fresh perspective. Parker joined the bank as general counsel from law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he was partner in charge of managing the firms operations. Through his work at the firm defending high-profile clients like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, he also developed relationships in Washington that were helpful while navigating Wells Fargo’s regulatory problems. After becoming interim CEO, Parker made one of his priorities settling regulatory probes from agencies including the U.S. Department of Justice. Wells Fargo said it would start a search for Parker’s replacement immediately."

-10.918679450968344," Vendors squeezed in Wells Fargo cost cutting push (Reuters) - At least seven vendors have given Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N a partial refund for their services after bank executives pressured the contractors to return 2.5% of revenue earned last year, according to sources familiar with the matter. In a bid to cut costs to offset higher regulatory spending, Wells Fargo gathered about 14 of its IT vendors in Charlotte in July and asked for a rebate for 2018. In doing so, the bank claimed the vendors had benefited from increased business from its various scandals. Many vendors felt compelled to pay up out of fear they may lose out on future business from the Wall Street giant. Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist said participation in the voluntary rebate would not be considered when awarding future contacts. “Wells Fargo’s investment in technology remains a strong priority, and we value the strategic relationships we have with our vendors.” Still, many vendors feared not fulfilling the refund request would make their firms less competitive as Wells Fargo scales back its use of outside contractors. The bank is expected to issue a new request for business proposals from its IT vendors in the first quarter of next year. The San Francisco-based bank has leaned on cost cuts in recent years as the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal has stunted revenue growth. However, increased spending on headcount and technology to satisfy regulators has caused the bank to back away from its expense targets. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry recently pointed to professional services, or work by consultants, as a expense line that analysts and investors can expect to be reduced in the next quarter. Costs attributed to outside professional services and data processing declined 17% last year. In 2018, the bank spent $660 million on outside data processing, according to financial filings. If the bank recouped 2.5% of that cost, or $16.5 million, it would only make a small dent in its $56 billion annual budget. But for smaller IT firms like Richmond, Virginia-based Apex Systems, giving a 2.5% refund to a large client like Wells Fargo could mean paying employees less or taking a hit to earnings. A Wells Fargo representative urged vendors not to pass on the expense to employees in the form of pay cuts, according to an email exchange viewed by Reuters. Some of Well Fargo’s IT vendors have already paid the 2018 rebate in full while others have asked to pay by installments, according to the sources familiar with the situation. But the sources, who requested anonymity since the matter is private, said at least two vendors have refused to pay the rebate as a matter of principle. “They’re just expecting to unfortunately have the relationship end,” one of the sources said."
-10.627671331011248," U.S. CFTC orders Wells Fargo to pay $14 million over unfair foreign exchange trade WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N to pay more than $14 million to settle charges it provided ""misinformation"" when conducting a large foreign exchange trade with a counterparty, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The CFTC said it ordered Wells Fargo Bank NA to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10 million and restitution of $4.475 million, and required the bank to cease and desist violating the CFTC’s business conduct standards. In a statement, Wells Fargo said it cooperated with the CFTC and was pleased to have resolved the matter. Specifically, the CFTC said that Wells Fargo failed to properly price a $4 billion foreign exchange forward contract with an unnamed counterparty from 2014. Rather than calculate an agreed upon weighted average price for the deal, the bank simply picked a rate it thought would be in the average range and acceptable to the counterparty, according to the regulator. The CFTC said the bank provided a spreadsheet to the counterparty that supposedly showed how that average was calculated, even though the bank lacked the ability to track the trades that would provide the basis for the calculation. The CFTC said the bank lacked adequate supervisory policies to ensure counterparties did not receive inaccurate information regarding such trades, and those shortcomings were not fixed until 2018."

Daley, who was named vice chairman of public affairs, will report directly to Scharf and joins the fourth-largest U.S bank from Bank of New York Mellon, where Scharf was chief executive officer prior to his latest assignment. “I am delighted to welcome Bill to Wells Fargo,” said Scharf in a statement on Thursday. “I have known Bill and worked with him for many years and know we will benefit from his unique background.” Daley, who left BNY Mellon days after Scharf’s exit, had previously served at the White House twice - he was Secretary of Commerce during the Clinton administration and was handpicked by Barack Obama in 2011 to be his chief of staff. In 2000, Daley also served as chairman of Al Gore’s presidential campaign. Daley’s appointment at Wells Fargo marks the first significant top-level hire under Scharf, an early sign that the new CEO may bring in more of his long-time lieutenants to the scandal-plagued bank. Wells Fargo is operating under a regulatory microscope, as it tries to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians after employee whistle-blowers revealed in 2016 that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.

-8.21379236150403," New Wells Fargo CEO says he wants to fix problems, isn’t a 'wallflower' (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s WFC.N new chief executive, Charlie Scharf, told employees this week he is more hands-on in his early days than at his previous CEO roles in order to tackle the bank’s regulatory and operational problems as staff grilled him about everything from growth targets to his family dog. When he started as CEO jobs in that past, Scharf focused on learning about the companies but at Wells Fargo, the need to develop controls has brought a sense of urgency, he told employees on Tuesday at Wells Fargo’s campus in Charlotte, North Carolina. A source provided Reuters a recording of the event. “If I’ve got a point of view and think I can be helpful where I think we can help bring resources to bear, I’m not going to sit there like a wallflower,” he said at the town hall. Scharf, 54, took over the CEO role on Oct. 21, as the bank entered its fourth year of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. Approved by regulators and cheered by investors as an outsider who could bring fresh perspective to Wells Fargo’s C-suite, he must now try to settle outstanding regulatory probes, repair the bank’s image and improve morale among staff. Scharf said he is up to the task. “We all have to act a little bit more impatient for some of these things, and demand more of each other,” he said. “I’m going to constantly ask the question, ‘Can we do a better job? Can we do something faster?’” Scharf came to Wells Fargo after CEO stints at Visa V.N and Bank of New York Mellon BK.N and several years working in the top ranks at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N. His first days on the job were spent at board meetings in St. Louis and then with regulators and senior management at the bank’s headquarters in San Francisco, he said. This week, he met with regulators and politicians in Washington and with other key executives including Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton in Charlotte. In the town hall meeting, Scharf said he is trying to bring a fresh sense of urgency to solving Wells Fargo’s regulatory woes. The bank has already paid billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements, faced 14 consent orders with government agencies and remains under an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Other strategy decisions like growth targets are secondary. Sources who have worked with Scharf described him has a detail-oriented leader who is more at home with numbers than people. However, during he town hall, his first event with the company, Scharf framed himself as a family man who places a lot of value on relationships, especially with his yellow Labrador, Bebe. Winning over employees is also key for Scharf to achieve operational targets while those matters move toward resolution. Wells Fargo has posted sluggish revenue growth and had trouble cutting expenses since the scandal erupted in September 2016. Initially, the sales abuses centered around millions of phony customer accounts but eventually revealed overcharges on auto and home loans and other improper practices. In an internal survey this year, just 38% of employees said they felt senior management understood obstacles faced by workers. With roughly 262,000 employees, Wells Fargo has the largest employee base of the major U.S. banks."

-7.40882866461922," Exclusive: Wells Fargo lays off more than 200 business bankers in U.S. - sources (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has laid off more than 200 bankers in its U.S. lending divisions in recent months, as the bank reacted to business trends and restructured some units, sources familiar with the matter said this week. Most of the cuts were in Wells Fargo’s commercial bank and many impacted its team that gives loans to farmers. The bank has also made cuts to its energy lending group. Energy and agriculture are two portfolios in which the company is traditionally strong. The fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets cut the unit that specializes in agricultural lending by at least 25%, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Representatives for Wells Fargo confirmed the cuts but did not elaborate on how many agricultural bankers were laid off. Over the summer, 22 bankers were axed from its energy team, according to two other sources. The cuts represented about 7% of the energy group, a spokeswoman said. The energy lending team sits within the investment bank and the agriculture group is part of commercial banking. The company has about 6,000 commercial bankers in the United States. Many of the agriculture cuts were concentrated in rural areas, one source told Reuters, including North Dakota and South Dakota where staff was cut in half. Wells Fargo plans to create a smaller group of agricultural bankers in one of its new centralized hubs who will work with customers, the person said. While the move marks Wells Fargo’s latest bid to centralize operations and shed risk, the move comes as a blow to energy companies and increasingly cash-strapped farmers. With fewer bankers on hand in local markets, some small companies and family farmers will likely need to find a new lender, said three sources familiar with the businesses. The staffing cuts are particularly ill-timed for the bank’s soybean, corn and grain farm customers, who are looking to renew loans to finance their spring planting operations. Wells Fargo is the biggest bank lender to the U.S. agriculture sector, according to the American Bankers Association. An Wells Fargo executive told Reuters the bank intends to retain that position and there has been no strategic move to reduce exposure. The moves were made because the commercial bank wants to align resources to better serve clients who do more business with the bank. The bank is currently hiring agricultural bankers in markets like California, Wyoming and Idaho, a bank spokeswoman said. After the hires the total reduction to the team will be 5%. Federal data analyzed by Reuters shows Wells Fargo is following other large U.S. banks in scaling back exposure to farmers. The bank’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured units have pared $1.24 billion, or 15.3%, of their farm-loan holdings between the end of December 2016 and June 30 of this year, according to the most recent data from the regulator. Wells Fargo has also been traditionally regarded as one of the most active lenders to the U.S. oil and gas sector. But its energy team was still recovering from hefty losses it booked in 2016, when crude prices plunged to $26 a barrel and forced a number of bankruptcies in the sector. (here) The unit created a separate credit resolution group to try to work with customers to stem the losses. Since then the bank has put less emphasis on lending, two of the sources said. Also, the Energy Capital Group has been rolled into its larger strategic capital group. Another Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Hannah Sloane, said the bank remains committed to the sector and has expanded the business over the past three years. “We regularly review and evaluate the needs of our clients and the dynamics in the markets we serve in order to ensure we align our resources accordingly,” she said. Wells Fargo has been working to centralize operations to improve risk controls since 2016, when a wide-ranging sales practices scandal erupted and placed the bank under a regulatory microscope. The Federal Reserve has prevented the bank from increasing its balance sheet until it believes it has made significant changes to its risk management and compliance structures. Revenue in Wells Fargo’s wholesale bank, which houses the merged banking unit, has fallen every year since the scandal and fell another 2% during the first six months of 2019. The unit has had some trouble attracting new business in the wake of the scandal, Reuters has reported."
-2.649310368265297," Wells Fargo reports falling profit as legal costs mount (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N reported lower profits on Tuesday as the bank braced for additional legal expenses tied to a scandal that erupted more than three years ago. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets set aside $1.6 billion for legal expenses related to previously disclosed sales practices. It has been operating under heavy scrutiny since 2016 revelations that employees opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The fallout has led to multiple internal and regulatory probes and resulted in billions of dollars in fines over the past three years. Executives declined to specify the litigation the expected charge is related to. The largest lingering legal issues include investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commision and the Department of Justice, according to filings. “We’ll all be happier when it moves through and is behind us,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call with journalists. Expenses also have risen since 2016 as the company has reimbursed customers who were overcharged for its services, and as the bank upgraded its technology to meet regulatory requirements in the wake of the scandal. This year the bank said it was hiring thousands of employees to improve its risk management and work through regulatory mandates, which has partially offset cost savings elsewhere in the bank. Additionally, the bank acknowledged that plans to beef up its mortgage business and add staff to meet a surge in demand would contribute to costs this year. The plans, which Reuters exclusively reported on last week, is a change of course after the bank laid off more than 1,000 employees in the division last year. Overall for the quarter the company posted falling loan revenue due to lower interest rates, but showed deposit and loan growth, a sign of increased business. Net interest income fell 7.5% to $11.63 billion and average loans and deposits rose 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively. Profit fell in Wells Fargo’s retail and commercial banks. “We have more work ahead, but I’m confident that our focused efforts and the fundamental strengths of Wells Fargo will continue to enable us to achieve success,” Interim Chief Executive Allen Parker said. Parker will hand over the reins to Bank of New York Mellon CEO Charles Scharf next week. Net income applicable to common stock fell to $4.04 billion, or 92 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $5.45 billion, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the lender earned $1.07 per share, compared to analysts’ consensus of $1.15, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Wells Fargo’s provisions for future credit losses jumped 20% to $695 million from a year earlier. The lender’s shares closed 1.8% higher at $50.14."

6.906538307139836," Wall Street Week Ahead: Bruised U.S. banks expected to report third quarter earnings decline NEW YORK (Reuters) - The biggest U.S. banks are expected to kick off the earnings season on a sour note next week due to falling interest rates, which may have pressured net interest margins enough to cause the sector’s first year-over-year earnings per share decline in three years. While strength in mortgage banking and cheap valuations could provide support to the S&P 500 bank index, its performance depends on what reassurance executives provide on credit conditions, the outlook for loan growth and their ability to reduce deposit costs during their conference calls. Tuesday brings third quarter profit reports from Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo and Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Goldman Sachs. Bank of America reports on Wednesday. The biggest U.S. banks will report a 1.2% decline in third-quarter earnings, while revenue is seen rising 0.9%, according to data aggregated by Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio. This would be the first profit decline since the same quarter in 2016, according to data from Factset. “Overall it’s shaping up to be a pretty challenging quarter because of the net interest rate environment,” said Fred Cannon, director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, citing the flattening and temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury 2-year/10-year yield curve during the quarter. Bank profits depend heavily on net interest income, or the difference between the rate they charge for long-term loans and the rate they pay for short-term borrowing. Executives from Citi, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all cut their full-year forecasts for net interest income last month, citing macroeconomic concerns. Part of the problem is U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in July and September. And futures traders are betting on more Fed rate cuts going forward, including one in October. As a result, bank investors will listen for executive reassurance on the net interest margin outlook and their ability to mitigate weakness, said Manulife Investment Management’s Lisa Welch, who manages the John Hancock Regional Bank Fund. One offset to lower lending profits would be a reduction in interest rates banks pay their customers for deposits, as those rates rose while the Fed was hiking interest rates. “There’s going to be a lot of questions on how fast banks are able to bring down their deposit costs as loan yields are coming down,” said Welch, adding that she does not expect deposit costs “to come down as quickly as loan yields have fallen.” Mortgages may be another silver lining to lower rates in third-quarter numbers and future quarters as borrowers avail of cheaper rates. Refinancing, which accounts for most mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday. “With rates being lower, we think mortgage activity will be very strong,” said Welch, pointing to First Horizon as one bank that could benefit from mortgage demand. Bank of America and Wells Fargo should also benefit, according to KBW’s Cannon. To cope with rising demand, Wells Fargo is boosting its mortgage team, according to a memo seen by Reuters this week. But investors will also be on high alert for signs slowing U.S. economic growth is hurting debt repayments, said Mike Cronin, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Given that we’ve had some economic data that’s been a little weaker is there any trend in credit costs that raises concerns going into 2020?” said Cronin. So far, strong credit quality and bank balance sheets have reassured KBW’s Cannon, who is neutral on the sector. “But if we start to see meaningful credit deterioration that would change our minds about how we think about the banks,” he said. Cannon did not recommend buying banks going into earnings season due to the likelihood “consensus estimates come down in the quarter.” But on the plus side, he said, valuations do seem to reflect an expectation for further weakness. (GRAPHIC - S&P bank index valuation vs S&P 500: ) The S&P Bank index has gained 14% year-to-date, compared with a 16.5% advance for the S&P 500. But the sector’s trading multiple of 10.2 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compares well to its historical average of 12.6 and the benchmark S&P’s current trading multiple of 16.4. Bank valuations look attractive to Manulife’s Welch, who does not expect a recession any time soon. “If we’re wrong and go into a mild recession we think the banks will hold up much better” than going into financial crisis, she said, citing underwriting improvements. But, after a spate of weak manufacturing data, Aberdeen Standard’s Cronin is looking for data to stabilize before recommending the sector. “There is a lot of downside priced into the stocks but overall I’d still say I’m not really positive on the group just yet,” he said."
8.946413645431333," Exclusive: Wells Fargo beefs up mortgage division to cope with higher volumes (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is boosting its teams that process mortgage loans to prepare for higher mortgage volumes, changing course after it laid off about 1,000 employees here in the division in 2018, according to a memo viewed by Reuters. Many of the hires will be in Des Moines, Iowa and Minneapolis, according to the memo. Yet, Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage originator according to Inside Mortgage Finance, laid off hundreds of mortgage employees in these cities just last year. Representatives from Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear how many employees the bank will add. The about-face comes as banks brace for a surge in mortgage activity fueled by lower interest rates. Refinancing activity, which accounts for a majority of mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to data released by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday. Purchase activity has climbed 10% from a year ago. Indeed, business could boom further if mortgage rates drop even more, with U.S. monetary policymakers expected to cut the benchmark interest rate a third time this year at the end of October. Other large banks that also let go of staff here in 2018 will likely follow Wells Fargo in staffing back up, according to banking sources. They said some lenders have been struggling to keeping up with the wave of originations following sweeping headcount reductions across the industry. Large banks have laid off thousands of mortgage employees over the past two years as refinancing applications plunged and amid increased competition from non-bank entrants like Quicken Loans Inc. The financial services industry tends to fire and rehire thousands of employees as revenue fluctuates, but analysts thought the most recent decline in the mortgage business would be permanent as the process has become more automated. The Wells Fargo staffing plans will be fluid, allowing the bank to adjust to the market, the memo said. The latest hiring initiative could throw a wrench into Wells Fargo’s plans to cut costs. In July, the bank warned investors that 2020 costs would not be lower as previously expected since the bank hired thousands of employees to improve its risk management and work through the regulatory fallout from its various scandals. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottomline amid sluggish revenue trends. Now, the San Francisco-based bank must also contend with fresh macroeconomic uncertainty from a changing interest rate environment that’s pressuring lending margins across the industry."

7.347738762685791," Wells Fargo taps one-time Dimon protégé Scharf to lead turnaround (Reuters) - After a difficult, months-long search for a new chief executive, scandal-plagued Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N named as its next leader Charles Scharf, a one-time Jamie Dimon protégé known on Wall Street as a detail-oriented number cruncher who excels in streamlining operations. Scharf, 54, who joins the fourth-largest U.S. bank next month, has been the CEO of Bank of New York Mellon BK.N and Visa Inc V.N. He served as a top lieutenant to JPMorgan Chase and Co’s JPM.N Dimon during the financial crisis of 2008. He will become Wells Fargo's third CEO in as many years after a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. Some analysts said Scharf’s departure from Bank of New York Mellon, where he served only for two years, would hurt the custodian bank. Bank of New York Mellon named former finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis. Its shares closed 4.2% lower, while Wells Fargo rose 3.5% on Friday. “He’s a good choice,” said former Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kovacevich. “He’s very experienced in almost all of these financial services areas.” Scharf has his work cut out for him. Wells Fargo is operating under a regulatory microscope, as it tries to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians after employee whistleblowers revealed in 2016 that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Since then, internal and regulatory probes have discovered other issues in the bank’s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties. Its core businesses and shares have lagged. From 2016-2018, Wells Fargo was the only bank among the top four U.S. lenders to not grow loans or deposits, according to Refinitiv data. Wells Fargo shares have fallen short of the KBW Bank Index as the board looked for a new CEO. Analysts cited uncertainly about management and future financial targets as a top concern. On Friday, Wall Street analysts applauded the bank’s pick but warned that major regulatory hurdles remained. “The appointment of Mr. Scharf removes a major overhang,” Saul Martinez of UBS wrote in a note to clients. While the news cheered Wells Fargo investors, analysts said it was a negative for Bank of New York Mellon. KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells’ CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years. He added that at Bank of New York, Scharf had gone “on a hiring spree to bring in his people, and now that he has left, long-term strategy is in flux.” Scharf’s appointment is a win for Wells Fargo. Sources have said that the board’s search process was fraught, with limits on how much the bank could have paid its new chief executive and the requirement that regulators approved of their choice. The board had said it wanted to find an outsider, a key parameter for satisfying critics in Washington. The board also initially looked the possibility of hiring a diverse candidate, especially a woman, sources have previously said. But several candidates that the board approached were not interested in the job. At one point, the board considered keeping its interim CEO, Allen Parker, on a permanent basis. Parker will return to his previous role of general counsel and help the company through its transition. “They really realized that they needed a competent CEO who could handle the issues at Wells and the regulators, and it didn’t matter – race, gender, those things were secondary,” one of the sources familiar with the matter said, referring to the board. Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the search process. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of Currency said the banking regulator had signed off on Scharf’s hiring, clearing a major hurdle in the executive search process. Two sources who know Scharf describe him as someone more at home with numbers. When he became the CEO at Visa, people joked the company had two chief financial officers - the actual CFO and Scharf, one of the sources said. At Visa, he is credited with transforming the payment giant’s technology platform and saw the stock price more than double. Scharf was tasked with reinvigorating growth at BNY, a custodian bank which executes back office operations for asset managers. There he quickly made changes designed to make the company more efficient like overhauling meetings and making leadership changes. So far those changes have not paid off as BNY shares are trading lower than when Scharf took the helm. One of the sources said Scharf always had aspirations to be the chief executive of a big bank. If his tenure at the San Fransico-based bank goes well, Scharf will have a claim to the same fame as his one-time boss Dimon, the source said."

12.510376182000247," Wells Fargo tests cryptocurrency for internal transactions (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Tuesday it will pilot its own digital currency powered by blockchain to help move cash across borders and between branches in real time. The currency, called Wells Fargo Digital Cash, will be linked to the U.S. dollar and transferred using the bank’s distributed ledger technology to keep track of payments within its internal network. The system will allow the bank to bypass third parties in the asset transfer process saving costs and time, said Lisa Frazier, head of the Innovation Group at Wells Fargo. “We are eliminating the intermediaries which can often extend the timeline to be able to do cross border money transfers,” she said. The fourth largest U.S. bank’s corporate clients will not have to make any changes to the way they interact with the bank since the currency will not be client-facing. The pilot will begin next year but the bank has tested the technology by moving money between Canada and the United States. Following the broader roll-out the company hopes to expand to multi-currency transfers. Though Wells Fargo executives have been bullish on the potential for blockchain technology in financial services, the company has been more skeptical of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which launched the system into the spotlight. Last year, Wells Fargo joined U.S. rivals in banning the purchase of Bitcoin by credit-card customers, due to the volatility of the investment. Blockchain technology has attracted billions of dollars in investments from banks and other companies, but concerns about implementation and scalability has hindered many blockchain projects so far. Early roadblocks have not stopped banks from experimenting aggressively in the space. In February, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N launched its own digital currency, also linked to the U.S. dollar, that allows its corporate clients to transfer funds instantly across its internal blockchain network."

23.366662317895607," Wells Fargo pays $6.5 million to Navajo Nation over 'predatory' practices WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay the Navajo Nation $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit over “predatory and unlawful practices” by the bank, the Native American tribe said on Thursday. The Navajo Nation sued Wells Fargo in federal and tribal courts in 2017, alleging the San Francisco-based bank had opened unauthorized accounts for vulnerable tribe members as part of the potentially millions of fake accounts opened by bank employees nationwide. The settlement “puts other companies on notice that harmful business practices against the Navajo people will not be tolerated,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in the statement, which referred to Wells Fargo’s “long campaign of predatory and unlawful practices.” Wells Fargo said in a statement that the agreement demonstrates the bank’s “commitment to make things right regarding past sales practices issues.” The settlement with the Navajo Nation followed a $575 million deal in 2018 with U.S. states over claims that Wells Fargo opened phony customer accounts and improperly referred and charged customers for financial products. The settlement comes as Wells Fargo continues its attempt to overcome the fallout from its earlier practices. The bank said last year it had “re-established” itself, but has continued to face harsh criticism from politicians and consumer advocates. The bank has seen two chief executives exit the firm in the wake of the series of scandals, and is still searching for a replacement for former CEO Timothy Sloan, who abruptly stepped down in March."

7.8522400300031405," Major U.S. banks lower benchmark interest rates following Fed rate cut NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. banks lowered their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans on Wednesday, following a rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Starting on Aug. 1, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said they will reduce rates by 25 basis points to 5.25%. The banks use different names, with Citi calling this its “base rate,” and JPMorgan and Wells Fargo referring to it as a “prime rate.” However, lowering this benchmark rate means lower interest rates on loans that are based off the Fed’s main short-term rate. The move could result in lower revenues for the banks in the coming quarters. Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the overnight lending rate to a target range of 2.00% to 2.25% due to concerns about the global economy and muted U.S. inflation. The U.S. central bank signaled a readiness to lower borrowing costs further if needed. Although banks were expected to lower rates in line with the Fed, the moves were notable because rates had been rising for more than a decade. The last time JPMorgan reduced its prime rate was in December 2008, when it cut the rate to 3.25% from 4%. The bank maintained a 3.25% prime lending rate for the next seven years, eventually raising it to 3.5% in December 2015."

10.702663950538001," Wells Fargo tempers cost-cutting outlook (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday, due in part to lower expenses, but the bank reined in its outlook for cost cuts to invest in improving its risk management. Executives warned on a call with analysts that expenses will come in at the high end of its forecasted range for 2019 and that 2020 expenses will likely be flat with 2019, instead of lower as previously expected. Lower costs were a primary driver of earnings in the most recent quarter and were a cornerstone of former CEO Tim Sloan’s plan to deliver higher profits while the bank worked on moving past its scandals. The bank’s new strategy shows the two goals may have been incompatible. “We’ve seen a greater need for us to make investments in terms of risks, compliance and audit, all those things that we’re going to need to make investments in, in order to satisfy the requirements of our regulators,” said Interim Chief Executive Allen Parker. Parker was thrust into the job in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank. Wells Fargo has been under a regulatory microscope since revelations that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in each of the bank’s primary segments, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve. During his tenure so far, Parker has prioritized resolving lingering issues from the bank’s scandals. In May, he formed a new unit tasked with satisfying U.S. regulatory requirements. The bank has hired thousands of employees to focus on risk controls and those personnel expenses have partially offset the bank’s other cost-saving initiatives like headcount reductions in other areas of the bank and branch closures, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. The fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line amid sluggish revenue trends in the wake of its scandals. Now the San Francisco-based bank must also contend with fresh macroeconomic uncertainty from a changing interest rate environment that’s pressuring lending margins across the industry. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates later this month. Wells Fargo became the third big bank to report contracting net interest margins, a closely watched metric that measures the difference between how much a bank is charging on its loans and how much it pays for deposits. The figure dropped 11 basis points to 2.82% in the most recent quarter. Wells Fargo has cut its net interest income guidance twice to reflect the broader economic outlook. Wells Fargo relies heavily on interest rates to pad its revenue since it has tons of rate sensitive deposits and mortgage securities. Still, The bank showed that it was it was able to grow its loan book despite macroeconomic headwinds.

Deposits were roughly flat at $1.3 trillion. Net income applicable to common stock rose here to $5.85 billion, or $1.30 per share, in the second quarter, from $4.79 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.

4.174212348592145," Wells Fargo fined in Ireland over reporting breaches DUBLIN (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N Irish subsidiary was fined 5.9 million euros on Friday for a prolonged series of regulatory reporting breaches, the second largest fine ever handed down by Ireland's Central Bank. The Central Bank said Wells Fargo Bank International Unlimited Company admitted to five breaches from 2014 to 2019, including a failure to accurately report its capital position that revealed “serious and systemic weaknesses” in its reporting capability. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo said the bank took its regulatory obligations seriously and had made significant improvements to its systems and processes since the breaches occurred. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been beset by a string of mis-selling scandals in its home market, prompting billions of dollars in fines and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve. Its Irish incorporated business has branches in London and Frankfurt, offering corporate lending across Europe, according to the bank’s website. It had a turnover of $586 million in 2018, the central bank said. “It is a minimum requirement of being regulated by the Central Bank that firms submit accurate and timely regulatory returns,” Director of Enforcement Seana Cunningham said in a statement. “This enforcement action refers to failings in relation to both capital reporting and liquidity testing. For that reason it is considered to be particularly serious.” The other breaches included a failure to properly document processes and procedures, the lack of robust board and senior management oversight and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements in relation to liquidity testing. Weak IT systems also necessitated an excessively high level of manual adjustments in the preparation of regulatory returns, which the central bank said contributed to incorrect calculations. Wells Fargo initially did not complete required remedial action in 2017 but has since taken the necessary steps to rectify the failings, the regulator said. That reduced the fine from the ""appropriate level"" of 8.4 million euros ($9.46 million), in line with central bank settlement procedures. The 5.9 million euro fine is the second largest after a 21 million euro fine imposed on Irish lender Permanent TSP IL0A.I for overcharging mortgage customers, a central bank spokesman said. It was also the second reprimand for an Irish subsidiary of a major U.S. bank in the space of 10 days after JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N was fined 1.6 million euros ($1.8 million) for regulatory breaches in outsourcing."

Speaking at an investor conference on Wednesday, Treasurer Neal Blinde said the current rate environment was already baked into the bank’s guidance of a 2 to 5% decline, but downward pressure on interest rates moves sentiment to the lower end of the range.

The defendants will also pay up to $36.5 million for the customers’ legal costs, court papers showed. In an email, Wells Fargo called the settlement “an important step in making things right for customers.” “We will continue sending individualized letters to customers that clearly set out the remediation amount due to them, as well as a check for that amount,” it added. Lawyers for the customers did not immediately respond to requsets for comment.

3.8345628187781906," Wells Fargo hires former Deutsche Bank executive for risk management team (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Thursday that it had appointed Deutsche Bank’s Kate Clifford-Toomey to be chief operating officer for corporate risk. Clifford-Toomey joins the risk management team, led by Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton, at a time when the bank is working to overhaul its risk management procedures to satisfy regulator demands. Regulators have held the San Francisco-based bank under a microscope since 2016 when whistleblowers revealed Wells Fargo had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The scandal led the bank to uncover issues in each of its primary business segments, and has resulted in billions of dollars in fines and penalties. The appointment is effective Sept. 3. Prior to Wells Fargo, Clifford-Toomey was chief operating officer of the Americas and head of Americas regulatory transformation at Deutsche Bank. She has also worked at Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Deutsche Bank has also had to overhaul its risk management processes in recent years to satisfy U.S. regulators after failing to prove that its business could withstand an economic downturn during the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests. Wells Fargo is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders."
5.006815971289531," Exclusive: Wells Fargo board weighs keeping interim CEO in place - sources (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co board members are considering keeping interim Chief Executive Allen Parker in the job permanently even after saying they would seek an outsider to fill the role, according to two sources familiar with the board’s thinking. Parker, 64, was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank. Critics like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, had argued Sloan’s 30-year tenure made him incapable of changing an internal culture that fueled a string of customer abuses. Sloan was the second Wells Fargo CEO to depart following revelations in 2016 that employees had opened potentially millions of fake customers accounts. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has paid billions of dollars in fines and is still being investigated by various federal agencies. The board had set a goal of hiring an outsider, with Chair Betsy Duke saying the position should attract the top talent in banking. Reuters reported in April the bank had hired search firm Spencer Stuart and was focused on finding female candidates. But the external search has been complicated by concerns Wells Fargo could not pay the big dollars necessary to lure talent from competing banks. The board’s pick would also be subject to an unusual vetting by U.S. regulators. Board members started warming up to the idea of keeping Parker after he made a good impression on stakeholders including regulators, investors and employees. “He’s obviously exceeded expectations and that’s a credit to him,” said Steven Potter, CEO of executive recruiting firm Odgers Berndtson U.S. Sources familiar with the board’s thinking said Parker has not been tainted by the scandal since he joined in 2017, the year after customer abuses first emerged. One of the sources said Parker’s two years at the bank have given him enough understanding of lingering problems to fix them quickly. It could take months for the search committee to come to a final decision about who is the best person to lead the San Francisco-based bank. Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting would then need to privately review and sign off on that pick. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Representatives from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank’s primary regulators, declined to comment. Parker joined Wells Fargo as general counsel from law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he was partner in charge of managing the firms operations. Through his work at the firm defending high-profile clients like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, he also developed relationships in Washington that will be helpful while navigating Wells Fargo’s regulatory problems. At Wells Fargo, he has been focused on cleaning up existing issues and preventing them from spreading. Parker spent his first two months as interim CEO meeting with regulators in Washington, employees in Charlotte, North Carolina, and investors in New York City. He has said his priorities as interim CEO are to improve customer service, satisfy regulatory requirements and continue making operations more efficient. At an investor conference last week, Parker said the bank had entered a new stage of understanding with regulators and that, based on his meetings, the relationships were more constructive than before. “We are probably a little bit more attentive now to everything they’re saying,” he told investors. “And frankly, in some cases, they’ve been speaking with greater clarity.” Still, with Parker at the helm the bank could face even more pressure from lawmakers who wanted to see an outsider, industry analysts said. Turning inside to find a successor could also make some investors feel the board was unable to find a desirable candidate interested in the job. Since Parker became CEO, Wells Fargo created a new unit charged with working through the 14 regulatory consent orders the bank is operating under and expanded its board to include a director who has experience managing a bank."
5.006815971289531," Wells Fargo to donate $1 billion toward affordable housing by 2025 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday it will narrow the focus of its philanthropy toward three causes including affordable housing and will donate $1 billion to housing over the next few years. The San Francisco-based bank named Brandee McHale to be the new head of the Wells Fargo Foundation which will be focused on addressing housing affordability, improving financial literacy and growing small businesses. McHale joins the bank from Citigroup Inc and replaces Jon Campbell whose retirement was previously announced. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has ramped up its charitable giving following a profit boost from tax reform and in the wake of a wide-ranging sales scandal which has badly tarnished its reputation and weighed down its financial performance. Wells Fargo gave away $444 million to charitable causes last year, potentially positioning it as the top corporate cash giver in the country. The bank has pledged to donate 2% of its after-tax profit annually. As part of its renewed focus on promoting home-ownership, Wells Fargo said it will donate $1 billion to organizations that support affordable housing through 2025 and launch a $20 million grant to encourage organizations to find new solutions for the lack of lack of low-to-moderate income housing options. Wells Fargo has already donated over $460 million in down-payment assistance grants since 2012. By focusing on housing, financial literacy and small businesses the bank will be donating more money toward causes that align closely with its business expertise, spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said. Wells Fargo will still support causes like arts, education and disaster relief through local projects but broader initiatives will be focused on the three primary areas."

Noski’s appointment, effective on June 1, expands the board to 13 seats. He will serve on its audit and examination committee. Wells Fargo’s board has been shuffled many times since the bank became mired in scandal roughly 2-1/2 years ago. More than half of the company’s independent directors joined the board after 2016. Noski joined Bank of America in 2010 as chief financial officer while the bank was still trying to turn itself around and recover from the financial crisis. He retired in 2012 after helping the bank change its mortgage lending business model. Noski currently serves on the boards of Microsoft Corp and Booking Holdings Inc and has held director positions at companies including Morgan Stanley, AT&T and Northrop Grumman."

-2.2009658302821062," Wells Fargo and Barclays back fintech company OpenFin NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial services software startup OpenFin has raised $17 million in a funding round led by Wells Fargo & Co with participation from Barclays, the company said on Thursday. Existing investors including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bain Capital Ventures and Pivot Investment Partners, also participated in the round, the company said. OpenFin, which is headquartered in New York and London, will use the cash injection to accelerate sales efforts and for product development, it said. Founded in 2010, the company has developed an operating system that enables financial institutions to more easily create and upgrade their computer applications, similarly to how consumer apps are updated on smartphones. This can help large firms cut down on the time and money needed to modernize the software they use for a wide array of both front- and back-office functions, such as trading or risk management. It would otherwise take between 6 to 18 months for a financial institution to deploy or update an application, OpenFin said. Over the past few years, banks have been ramping up partnerships and investments in young companies that create products and services which can help large financial institutions remain competitive in an increasingly digital world. “Banks know that they need to significantly reduce their cost of doing business and they need to increase productivity,” Mazy Dar, chief executive and co-founder of OpenFin, said in an interview. “All of this heavy infrastructure needs to be replaced with something that is a lot more agile and nimble.” OpenFin’s operating system is used on nearly 200,000 desktops at 15 global investment banks and more than 1,500 other banks and buy-side firms, it said. The latest investment brings the company’s total amount of venture funding to $40 million."

Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), told Congress he would use special legal powers that the regulator typically reserves for overseeing financially troubled lenders to review any proposed candidate. But Otting said he does not plan to make findings from the review public, despite pressure from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who pressed him on the issue during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. “At this point in time I do not have plans to release that information,” Otting told Warren in a heated exchange. Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have accused the OCC of being too soft on Wells Fargo, a claim Otting disputed on Wednesday.

0.3182210006226156," Wells Fargo CEO search hobbled by pay limitations: sources (This May 10th story corrects paragraph 7 to say Wells Fargo may need to match stock-based compensation a candidate has at a current employer, not that company may need to match vested shares.) NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s hunt for a new CEO is being impeded by limits on how much the bank can pay its next leader, a person close to the search and several industry insiders told Reuters. A handful of top candidates have already said they would not pursue the job because Wells Fargo is unlikely to meet their pay requirements, said the person, who spoke about private negotiations on the condition of anonymity. Wells Fargo declined to comment on the search process. The San Francisco-based bank has been looking for a new leader since March, when Tim Sloan became the second CEO to abruptly depart in the wake of a sales scandal that has badly bruised the bank’s reputation and crimped its financial performance. Wells Fargo’s CEO pay package has trailed peers in recent years in the aftermath of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. Wells Fargo is also the smallest of the top four retail banks by assets. The board will likely pay the next CEO $15 million-$20 million a year, said Robin Ferracone, the chief executive of compensation consultancy Farient Advisors LLC. That compares with the $25 million that CEOs of top retail banks earned last year on average. Wells Fargo may also need to set aside funds to match stock-based compensation a candidate has at a current employer, compensation consultants and recruiters said. That could be difficult in an environment where politicians, regulators and investors are closely scrutinizing Wells Fargo. “If you think about the Wells situation, it has a lot of distressed features to it,” Ferracone said. The banking industry faces special restrictions on compensation that regulators imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Relative to other sectors, a bigger portion of executive pay comes in deferred stock, and contracts feature clawback provisions, which require money to be paid back under certain circumstances. Among peers, Wells Fargo’s CEO pay package is at the bottom of the pack. Sloan’s $18.4 million pay package last year compared with $31 million for JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Jamie Dimon, $26.5 million for Bank of America Corp’s Brian Moynihan and $24 million for Citigroup Inc’s Michael Corbat. Executives in other industries, and even other parts of Wall Street, get paid significantly more. Blackstone Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman, for instance, earned $69.1 million last year. Alphabet Inc Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a former Morgan Stanley executive considered a solid candidate for a bank CEO role, earned $47.3 million. Wells Fargo Chair Betsy Duke has said the board wants to attract the “top talent in banking.” Directors want the next CEO to be an outsider, following critiques from lawmakers that company veterans are incapable of turning things around. The board has discussed approaching JPMorgan's finance chief, Marianne Lake, as well as Citigroup's head of Latin America, Jane Fraser, Reuters previously reported reut.rs/2PvxOo0. They have unvested stock awards worth $18.4 million and $11.2 million, respectively, according to recent filings. Offering a signing bonus to cover such awards is harder at banks than other types of companies because of heightened scrutiny on the sector, industry experts told Reuters. Last year, UBS Group AG’s Andrea Orcel left the Swiss bank to run Banco Santander SA. But the deal fell apart after Santander refused to pay Orcel $50 million in deferred compensation he accrued at UBS. There may be even bigger hurdles in Wells Fargo’s case because of the sales scandal that erupted in late 2016. Regulators including the U.S. Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are also closely monitoring progress of its operational overhaul, including executive changes. The new CEO’s pay package is sure to be “very carefully scrutinized,” said Evan Stewart, who litigates compensation disputes as a partner at the law firm Cohen & Gresser."

Derek Flowers, who has been with the San Francisco-based bank for more than two decades, will become head of strategic execution and operations and will focus on the bank’s regulatory priorities, said the memo, sent by interim chief executive Allen Parker on Wednesday. In his current role as chief credit and market risk officer, Flowers would have had frequent contact with regulators. The new unit, whose creation was reported earlier on Wednesday by the Financial Times, will be charged with working through the more than a dozen regulatory consent orders the bank is operating under - agreements between regulators and the bank that it will work to satisfy certain requirements. It will also implement new business and risk-management processes. Parker has said he wants to “redouble” the bank’s efforts to satisfy and exceed regulatory expectations. Regulators have demanded change from Wells Fargo after employee whistleblowers revealed it had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in each of the bank’s primary segments, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve. The bank has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has so far payed out tens of millions of dollars. However, regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have publicly criticized the bank’s progress within the past month.

3.787718436438292," Exclusive: Wells Fargo taps headhunter Spencer Stuart to find new CEO - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s board has retained executive search firm Spencer Stuart to hunt for a new chief executive, ideally a woman who can tackle its regulatory and public perception issues, two people familiar with the matter said. Wells Fargo’s ambition to become the only major U.S. bank with a female CEO underscores the need to restore its image with a wide range of constituents, including customers, shareholders, regulators and politicians, after it became mired in a scandal in 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Former CEO Tim Sloan left abruptly last month, becoming the second CEO to leave the bank in the scandal’s fallout. The board plans to approach Citigroup Inc’s Latin America chief Jane Fraser, one of the sources said. During Fraser’s 15-year tenure at Citigroup, she has gained experience running consumer and commercial businesses as well as its private bank. Fraser could not be immediately reached for comment. The board also discussed approaching JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Marianne Lake, but after the bank named her to run JPMorgan’s consumer lending business last week, that option became less viable, the source added. The board wants someone who can convince regulators, employees, investors and customers that the bank has fixed problems underpinning the sales scandal, the sources said. The bank’s board feels that choosing a woman might please lawmakers in Washington who have been critical not only of Wells Fargo’s misbehavior, but of the broader banking industry for a lack of diversity and gender equality, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It also believes that such a move could bolster Wells Fargo’s image with the households of customers where women play a leading role in managing finances, one of the sources added. The new CEO will also have to resolve litigation and regulatory matters. There are 14 outstanding consent orders with government entities, as well as probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice. To be sure, Spencer Stuart will approach and consider several male candidates for the CEO job as well, one of the sources said. The top priority is to find an external candidate who can navigate the bank’s regulatory issues, the source added. Finding an outsider who meets all those qualifications and wants the job will be difficult, the sources said. There are few people with the necessary experience, even fewer of those who are women, and it is not clear if any of the obvious candidates would be open to taking the role. The sources asked not to be identified because Wells Fargo’s board deliberations are confidential. Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and Spencer Stuart declined to comment. Wells Fargo’s board has not made any public statements about its requirements for a new CEO, beyond Chair Betsy Duke saying the job should attract the “top talent in banking.” The board wants to complete the search within the next three to six months, one of the sources said. After Sloan’s ouster, Wells Fargo’s board appointed Allen Parker, who had been general counsel, as interim CEO. The board has said it is looking for an external candidate as a permanent replacement. It is not clear whether Parker will stay at the bank. Others whose names have been mentioned by analysts, recruiters and industry sources as perspective CEO candidates include Alphabet Inc finance chief Ruth Porat and Bank of America Corp’s chief technology officer Cathy Bessant. Wells Fargo shares have stalled since Sloan’s departure on March 29th, while the KBW Bank index has rallied more than 7 percent. Wells Fargo would be “the best stock on earth to buy” if it had the right CEO, said Greg Donaldson, chairman of Donaldson Capital Management in Indiana. Donaldson held about 50,000 Wells Fargo shares, but sold the stake last year as problems mounted. The CEO change could convince him to re-invest, depending on who it is, he told Reuters. “It would be very smart for them to get a woman,” he said."

The majority of the San Francisco-based bank’s 12 board members joined Wells Fargo after the bank became mired in scandal in late 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Board Chair Betsy Duke and interim Chief Executive Allen Parker faced questions about why investors should vote for the five directors who were at the bank at the time of the wrongdoing. Last month, proxy research firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised “cautionary support” of directors who were at the bank prior to 2017. About 15 activists were kicked out of the meeting for interrupting Parker’s remarks, as part of coordinated demonstrations by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA). Parker had repeatedly asked them to wait for the question-and-answer segment before having security evict them. “One of the wonderful things about shareholder democracy is that we have meetings like this,” said Parker as the activists were escorted out. NACA CEO Bruce Marks, who has a history of protesting at bank shareholder meetings, helped members buy individual shares so they could attend the meeting, he told Reuters. The group, a non-profit mortgage broker, plans to attend Bank of America Corp’s shareholder meeting on Wednesday to thank the bank for committing billions of dollars to low- and moderate-income mortgages. The demonstrators spoke about fair lending practices, African American homeownership and fake accounts. Some called Wells Fargo executives “frauds” and said the bank could not be trusted. Wells Fargo’s annual meetings have drawn protesters every year since its fake account scandal in 2016. Since the initial revelations, regulators and the bank have uncovered problems in each of the bank’s primary business segments. The scandals at the fourth-largest U.S. lender have resulted in billions of fines and penalties and claimed two CEOs after Tim Sloan announced his resignation last month. Board Chair Duke said at the meeting Tuesday a search for an external candidate is underway and that the board would not comment on the search process until a selection is finalized. Shareholders also approved executive pay and other management proposals. Two shareholder proposals that were rejected called for transparency about incentive pay and closing of the median gender pay gap."

2.856173023603425," Wells Fargo's revenue outlook spooks investors NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co shares fell as much as 3 percent on Friday after the bank dialed back its net interest income outlook for this year and reported a decline in total quarterly revenue. The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown, which investors have feared could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits. The lowered outlook comes at a time of uncertainty for the fourth-largest U.S. lender following the abrupt departure of former Chief Executive Tim Sloan last month. The bank has been working to keep a tight grip on costs as it continues to battle the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal that first erupted in 2016, efforts that helped profit rise in the first quarter even as revenue slipped. Interim CEO Allen Parker said on Friday he was working on improving relations with regulators and making the bank more efficient but acknowledged “we have more work ahead of us.” On a call to discuss the results, analysts repeatedly asked why the bank was lowering its net interest income outlook while peers remained more optimistic, and for details on how non-interest-related revenues from fees would shape up. “If the revenue base keeps splitting down, I’m afraid that some of your loyal shareholders are going to start to exit before you have a new leadership in place,” Bank of America analyst Erika Najarian said. Parker said Wells Fargo’s board is pressing forward with the CEO search, but has “complete confidence” with current leadership. He did not give a timetable for when a new CEO might be announced. Finance chief John Shrewsberry reaffirmed that the lender was on track to hit its 2019 cost target. But the longer-term outlook is less certain, since the bank suspended its expense targets for 2020 after Sloan’s exit. Parker also did not give updated guidance for when a punitive asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve would be lifted, saying he felt it was not appropriate to do so. Former CEO Sloan had twice pushed back when he expected to get the cap removed, which the Fed says will happen when risk management and internal controls improve. Wells Fargo expects net interest income to fall 2 percent to 5 percent this year from 2018. It previously forecast between a 2 percent rise and a 2 percent fall. In the first quarter, net interest income fell 1 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the prior period. The bank blamed the decline from the previous quarter on a flattening yield curve, even though JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that higher rates had helped boost its net interest income. Wells Fargo also appeared more cautious on the economy than other banks reporting on Friday. Its provision expense rose to $845 million from $654 million a year earlier, and the bank flagged the potential for less favorable economic conditions. On a call with reporters Shrewsberry pointed to economic indicators forecasting higher unemployment rates as a cause for concern and also said the bank expects deposit costs to continue to creep up. “Between bigger banks there seems to be some disagreement about where we are in the cycle,” he said. Wells Fargo shares erased earlier gains during the conference call with analysts and were last down 2.7 percent. Wells Fargo's net income applicable to common stock rose reut.rs/2P8a214 to $5.51 billion, or $1.20 per share, from $4.73 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. But on an adjusted basis, the bank earned $1.03 per share, short of analyst expectations for an adjusted profit of $1.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The bank’s non-interest expenses fell 7.5 percent to $13.9 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The company is targeting expenses for 2019 of $52 billion to $53 billion. The decline in expenses outpaced a 1.5 percent fall in total revenue. As signs of a slowing U.S. economy mount, analysts have focused on efficiency in anticipation of slower revenue and loan growth. The lender’s efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of cost per dollar of revenue, improved from a year earlier but was higher than in the fourth quarter. Average loans rose slightly from the prior quarter but were still below last year. Average deposits were down 1 percent from the previous quarter and fell 3 percent from a year earlier."

0.3165124292025489," Principal Financial to buy Wells Fargo's retirement unit for $1.2 billion (Reuters) - U.S. retirement plan administrator Principal Financial Group said on Tuesday it would buy Wells Fargo & Co’s retirement plan services business for $1.2 billion, as it seeks a larger presence in markets serving mid-sized companies. The move, first revealed last month by Reuters, marks the latest divestment from Wells Fargo, which has been streamlining its business as it grapples with the fallout of customer abuse scandals. Combining the Wells Fargo and Principal businesses will create one of the largest U.S. retirement services providers, with 7.5 million customers, the companies said in separate statements announcing the deal. The agreement also includes a provision for payments worth up to $150 million from Principal to Wells Fargo that are tied to exceeding revenue retention targets. These would be triggered two years after closing, which is likely in the third quarter, Principal Financial said. ""Principal will gain a strong foothold with mid-sized employers as more than two-thirds of Wells Fargo's institutional retirement assets are in plans ranging from $10 million to $1 billion,"" the company said. reut.rs/2uRbzQ2 The deal, to be financed with cash and between $400 million and $500 million of debt, will add to Principal’s net income and adjusted earnings per share in 2020. The company said in a separate presentation that its share buybacks would be suspended, resuming no later than the first quarter of 2020. The buyback news weighed on Principal’s stock, which was 2.5 percent lower in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Wells was down 1.4 percent. Once the unit is fully integrated in 2022, Principal said it could see annual net revenue of around $425 million, and pre-tax return on net revenue of 28 percent to 32 percent. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company will take over Wells’ contribution, benefit, executive deferred compensation, employee stock ownership plans, institutional trust and custody and institutional asset advisory businesses. Wells Fargo has been looking to trim its business since it came under regulatory scrutiny following a sales practice scandal. In 2018, the Federal Reserve slapped it with an unprecedented asset cap, citing “widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.” The bank is scheduled to announce its first-quarter results on Friday.

-1.123824415976132," Big banks to report first quarter results with lowered expectations NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will focus on falling profits, a more dovish Federal Reserve and lower interest rates as major U.S. banks kick off what analysts expect to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016. On Friday, April 12, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co will post results to begin the earnings season in earnest. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc will report the following Monday, followed by Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. In the wake of the Federal Reserve’s cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data. (For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs/2HOVt1D) “The Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they’re saying about the economy,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “Flat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It’s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.” The central bank’s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth. Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond’s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits. “That’s why the estimates are going down,” Carlson added. “(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there’s an underlying concern about loan growth.” In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks. Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings “recession” that ended in 2016. The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates. In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter. “Within financials, the industry that’s been hit hardest is capital markets,” said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. “Those downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines” in first-quarter earnings estimates. But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated. Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note “to be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.” But he called the impact from the Fed’s decision “a minor one,” and wrote that aside from these impacts, “bank fundamentals are remarkably stable.” Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500’s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data. (For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs/2Vmv2DP) In today’s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period. “Psychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,” Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. “Banks are up there.”"
-1.1228373143917039," Outsider CEO won't be a quick fix for Wells Fargo: analysts (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s plan to bring in an outsider as its next chief executive could give the scandal-plagued bank a much needed fresh start, but a turnaround will not be easy for whoever takes the helm, analysts said. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday that CEO Tim Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran, would resign immediately and a committee would meet on Friday to start looking for a replacement from outside the bank. More than two years after its wide-ranging sales practices scandal first came to light, Wells Fargo is still struggling to repair its reputation and relationship with U.S. regulators. “Reforming decades of past mistakes at an institution as large as Wells is a difficult and time-consuming endeavor,” said Morningstar analyst Eric Compton in a note on Friday. Wells Fargo shares were down 2.2 percent to $48.02 on Friday, after jumping more than 2.7 percent after the bank announced Sloan’s resignation on Thursday. Investors are pondering what the change in leadership will actually mean for the bank over the next year or two, Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks IBG, said in a note on Friday. “The intermediate transition period will not likely be as productive as we had been assuming, and the longer-term ramifications won’t be played out for years,” Mosby said. Admissions by the bank that it opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts and improperly charged customers for services have resulted in billions of dollars in fines and settlements since 2016. The Federal Reserve has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved. “It does seem that Wells Fargo management has lost the confidence of regulators,” Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told Reuters on Friday. “It will be important to put in a CEO that can regain that confidence.” It remained unclear what exactly triggered Sloan’s abrupt departure. Sloan, who had been CEO since after the scandal erupted in 2016, said he made the decision because the focus on him was hampering the bank’s recovery. Sloan twice disappointed investors by pushing back the date he expected to get the asset cap removed. When the consent order was announced in February 2018, he said reviews of its plan to meet the Fed’s request would be completed in October of that year. In May he said the cap would be lifted in early 2019, but in January he told analysts he expected the bank to operate under the cap through 2019. Analysts still say that timeline is too ambitious. “We do not expect the asset cap to get lifted until mid-2020,” said Citigroup Inc’ analyst Keith Horowitz in a note on Thursday. KBW’S Brian Kleinhanzl also wrote in a note that the bank seems to be far from convincing the Fed that it has made sufficient changes. Banks typically operate under consent orders from the Fed for many years. The Fed has yet to end a 2013 enforcement order against JPMorgan Chase & Co related to its London Whale scandal, according to an analysis of the U.S. central bank’s public notices. A 2011 consent order against 10 banks related to crisis-era mortgage practices ended last year. Wells Fargo executives did not provide new information about when they expected the Fed to lift the asset cap on Thursday. Outside of regulatory pressures, the new CEO will also be faced with investors who want management to shore up the bank’s core business. Wells Fargo was the only bank among the top four U.S. lenders to not grow loans or deposits over the past two years, according to Refinitiv data. While current executives have suspended the bank’s 2020 expense target to give a new CEO room for a novel strategy, analysts expect incoming management to maintain Wells Fargo’s approach of growing profits by getting leaner. “I think the new CEO is going to take the path of trimming costs and buying back stocks and you still won’t see a lot of balance sheet expansion in terms of loan growth because they are under that cap,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders. Wells Fargo Board Chair Betsy Duke did not give clear guidelines on what kinds of candidates the board is looking for. The next CEO will likely be a finance executive with experience with consumer banking and digital strategy, as well as the ability to smooth relationships with Washington, analysts said. Citi’s Horowitz said JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who has experience running the consumer bank at the largest U.S. bank by assets, would be his first call. A seasoned executive from a financial technology company already based in San Francisco could also be a good fit, said Edward Jones’ Sanders."
-1.1228373143917039," Factbox: Five challenges in store for Wells Fargo's next CEO (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s board started its official search for a new chief executive officer on Friday after announcing the abrupt departure of CEO Tim Sloan a day earlier. What are some of the challenges a new CEO will have to tackle? Asset Cap: Sloan’s successor will have to satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset cap, which prohibits the bank from increasing its balance sheet beyond 2017 levels. The bank has said it expects the asset cap to be lifted by the end of this year. Yet analysts believe mid-2020 is a more realistic time frame. Executive turnover: Wells Fargo veterans lead many of the bank’s main business segments, but fresh leadership at the top could spur additional senior departures, analysts said. “Anyone on that next level down who had hoped to be a CEO near term, that kind of squashes that possibility,” said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. The new CEO may also decide to remove senior executives to bring in outsiders to refresh the culture. Shoring up business fundamentals: Wells Fargo was the only large-cap U.S. bank to not increase the number of loans or deposits over the last two years, according to Refinitiv data. Investors will want to see a plan to expand the bank’s core business. For now new management will likely have to continue shrinking to enhance profit, analysts said. “The plan will be the same in terms of cutting costs an getting leaner,” Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said. Dealing with Washington: Wells Fargo has become a perpetual target of U.S. lawmakers Most notably, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has made the bank’s past misdeeds a constant talking point in her campaign. Fixing the bank’s relationship with her, and other politicians such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Representative Maxine Waters is sure to be an uphill climb, analysts said. “Even a pick with DC experience won’t immediately fix the bank’s troubles,” said Cowen Analyst Jaret Seiberg. The bank is also still faces lingering investigations by regulators. Winning new business: Wells Fargo’s consumer bank has begun seeing signs of customer growth after flat-lining in the wake of its unauthorized consumer accounts scandal, but its other lines of business have been slower to add new clients. Executives have told Reuters that its wholesale bank, which caters to corporate and institutional clients, has struggled to add new business."

Sloan, who had been CEO since predecessor John Stumpf left the bank soon after the scandal erupted in 2016, said he made the decision because the focus on him had become a distraction and a hurdle to helping the bank recover. Critics had accused Sloan, who was part of the management team while the wrongdoing was happening, of being too entrenched in Wells Fargo’s culture to change it. Wells Fargo Board Chair Betsy Duke did not give clear guidelines on what kinds of candidates the board is looking for. The next CEO will likely be a finance executive with experience with consumer banking and digital strategy, analysts said. But it will also be important to find someone who can soothe Wells Fargo’s strained relationships with U.S. regulators and politicians, they added. Admissions by the bank that it opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts and improperly charged customers for services have resulted in billions of dollars in fines and settlements since 2016. The Fed has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved. “It does seem that Wells Fargo management has lost the confidence of regulators,” Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told Reuters on Friday. “It will be important to put in a CEO that can regain that confidence.” Sloan had told analysts in January that he expected the bank to operate under the cap through 2019. Wells Fargo executives did not provide new information about when they expected the Fed to lift the asset cap on Thursday. Analysts, however, now expect that the bank will need longer than its latest estimate before the Fed removes the restriction. “We do not expect the asset cap to get lifted until mid-2020,” said Citigroup Inc’ analyst Keith Horowitz in a note on Thursday. KBW’S Brian Kleinhanzl also wrote in a note that the bank seems to be far from convincing the Fed that it has made sufficient changes. To help alleviate the impact of the asset cap, Wells Fargo has been offloading parts of its business. It has already sold 52 Midwestern branches and its Puerto Rico auto finance business, and it is in advanced talks to divest its retirement plan services business. (Reporting by Imani Moise.

-1.1228373143917039," Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan steps down (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Thursday Tim Sloan will resign immediately as chief executive, becoming the second CEO to leave the bank in the fallout of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. The board said in a statement it concluded it was best to seek an outside candidate to replace Sloan. The bank’s general counsel, C. Allen Parker, one of the few newcomers in the bank’s top ranks, will serve as interim chief executive. The move amounted to an admission that the board erred three years ago by appointing another insider after the previous CEO, John Stumpf, resigned following revelations that Wells Fargo had opened potentially millions of unauthorized consumer accounts. Prior to becoming CEO, Sloan served as chief operating officer and head of the wholesale bank. In a Thursday conference call, Sloan, 58, said he decided to leave because the focus on him had become a distraction inhibiting the bank from moving forward. “I want to assure all of our stakeholders that this was my decision and is not related to our first-quarter financial performance, the long-term outlook for the company or any newly discovered issues,” he said. On the call, analysts tried unsuccessfully to get a direct answer to whether regulators had given Sloan the final push, or even whether the bank had been surprised by the most recent criticism from the Comptroller of the Currency. Board Chair Betsy Duke declined to say what qualifications directors want in the next CEO, including whether they will insist on having an executive with banking industry experience. She said the person will be someone who really wants “the challenge and the opportunity...That is the person we want.” She added the bank has not yet spoken with anyone regarding the CEO position, and the search committee will meet for the first time on Friday. As recently as a week ago, the board had reiterated its unanimous support for Sloan. Critics had accused Sloan, who was part of the management team while the wrongdoing was happening, of being too entrenched in Wells Fargo’s culture to change it, even as the bank tried to do just that and move past its scandals. In March 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an unprecedented asset cap on Wells Fargo, barring it from growing its balance sheet until it improved risk management controls. Wells Fargo has said it expects to operate under the cap for the remainder of the year. It is not yet clear what was the final straw for Sloan. However, the banks primary regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, criticized the bank in recent weeks. “What happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns really in their risk management apparatus,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said. The Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both declined to comment on Sloan’s departure. As Wells Fargo tried to move on, it got rid of the lofty sales incentives that led to the fake accounts and repaid millions to customers who were improperly charged fees. But reputational issues continued to hang over the bank as it racked up billions in settlements and fines. Wells Fargo has long prided itself on its homegrown culture. But the bank’s insularity proved burdensome in recovering from the scandal. “The best thing he (Sloan) could do for the company was to retire. In the long run, it is the right move,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said. Sloan had become a perpetual target for politicians who repeatedly called for his removal. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown recently called for his resignation. Earlier this month, he was grilled by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. Parker, the interim head, joined Wells Fargo from an outside law firm as general counsel in March 2017 to help turn around the bank. At the time he was the only one of 11 top executives who had not been at the bank during the scandal. Parker will receive an annual base salary of $2 million, according to filings. Sloan’s departure came two weeks before the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets was due to report first-quarter results and a month before its annual shareholder meeting. In 2016, the bank agreed to pay $185 million to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, the largest fine of its kind, to settle a sales practice scandal in its consumer retail bank. Two weeks ago, the bank said Sloan received a 5 percent pay raise for 2018, with base salary of $2.4 million, $14 million in stock awards and a $2 million bonus based on the bank’s financial performance. The bank said in a filing that Sloan will not receive any additional compensation for his sudden exit, though he still stands to earn millions in stock awards as part of the company’s retirement plan."

-4.16755550277245," Wells Fargo's corporate bank struggles to regain footing NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s corporate bank has a revenue problem. As its consumer bank begins to see signs of recovery from a sales practices scandal that erupted more than two years ago, the San Francisco-based lender has struggled to expand its customer base in the unit catering to businesses and institutional clients. Revenue in the corporate bank dropped 4 percent last year. Before the scandal, it was rising 6 percent a year on average. Because it offers better margins, the health of the corporate bank is critical to Wells Fargo; it represents about a third of revenue but roughly half of $22 billion in annual profit. The bank first told investors in September that while it retained most customers throughout its scandals, it was having a harder time recruiting new clients. This trend has been even more dramatic with the corporate bank where customers tend to stay put. “It’s been a little bit more challenging for us to bring in new customers,” corporate bank head Perry Pelos told Reuters in a recent interview. Corporate clients are harder to win in part because commercial banking relations are more complex. Business customers seek cash management services, assistance with importing and exporting transactions, and various forms of credit such as asset-backed loans or revolving lines of credit. These services are usually locked in with multi-year contracts; some clients can only switch providers every five years. Wells Fargo executives say they are playing the long game, having their teams reach out to prospective clients to build relationships that they hope will pay off down the road. “I’ve lived through an entire generation of ownership before we won the business,” said Greg O’Brien, the division manager for commercial banking in New England. Last year, executives and analysts identified signs of life in Wells Fargo’s consumer unit for the first time since the 2016 scandal that rocked the bank. Primary checking accounts grew 1.2 percent in 2018, and auto loan originations jumped 9 percent in the most recent quarter. The corporate bank, however, continues to languish. When business clients consider switching banks, Wells Fargo’s lingering reputational problems make it a harder sell, analysts say. Consumers don’t have to justify their decision to open a new credit card to anyone but themselves, said Autonomos analyst Brian Foran. Decision-makers at companies, such as the treasurer, have to answer to the board and other executives. “At the margin some of them are going to say, Wells Fargo is very good but so is JPMorgan,” he said. “Right now, no one gets fired for hiring JPMorgan.” Wells Fargo officials acknowledge the scandals remain a concern with certain customers. “I’ve certainly been in meetings where it comes up,” said O’Brien. The scandal began with the disclosure the lender had opened unauthorized accounts for consumers. Later Wells Fargo disclosed that corporate bank employees had improperly altered customer information on certain documents. Wells Fargo has racked up billions in fines. Last year the Federal Reserve imposed a punitive asset cap on the bank, preventing it from growing its balance sheet until it improves risk management. Pelos, the corporate bank chief, has tried to compensate for the declining revenue by slashing costs. But the 3 percent reductions last year weren’t enough to offset the revenue slide. Though 2018 profit increased, the unit became less efficient. A key metric that measures the cost of one dollar of revenue, increased to 56 percent from 55 percent a year earlier. Wells Fargo has not provided 2019 revenue projections for its corporate bank. “There’s a lot of confidence that they are going to hit their expense targets, but there’s much less confidence that revenue is going to be able to grow as they do that,” Foran, the Autonomous analyst, said. Revenue declines are bad for any company, but for Wells Fargo it raises questions about whether the kind of growth it reported before its scandals is achievable with tighter oversight, analysts said. In the past, the corporate bank focused on growing its cross-selling metric, which measured how many products employees hawked to clients, according to filings. The bank still tracks referrals across different parts of the business today, but the company no longer reports them publicly. O’Brien, the northeast middle bank head, said the cross-selling system, which led to the creation of the fake accounts in the consumer bank, didn’t cause similar problems in the corporate bank. “We have never been in the business of creating false needs to sell,” he said. Corporate bank revenue has also been hurt by the Fed asset cap. The unit no longer carries deposits for central banks, and it has sold off some smaller businesses. In January, Wells Fargo pushed back the timeline for when it expects to get the asset cap lifted by six months. Executives told Reuters they are being “pleasantly persistent” with prospective corporate clients by pitching them ideas and connecting them with existing clients. So far their efforts have failed to bear much fruit, but executives say they have seen signs that customer acquisition trends are beginning to shift. As evidence that business was looking up, Wells Fargo pointed to recent transactions it helped advise like Berry Global’s $4.39 billion takeover bid for RPC Group Plc, . Earlier this month, Wells Fargo also advised its first ever USD global benchmark for the World Bank. “My expectation is that it’s going to be better,” Pelos said. “Is it going to be back to where it was before? It’s hard to call.” (The story fixes misspelling of Autonomous research firm on second reference)"
-5.047562968761208," Wells Fargo in talks with ex-Goldman exec Schwartz to be next CEO: NY Post (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s board is in talks with Harvey Schwartz, the former president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, to take over as the bank’s chief executive, the New York Post reported on Thursday, citing people briefed on the discussion. A Wells Fargo spokesperson told Reuters that there was “no validity” to rumors the bank was in talks with potential candidates for the CEO position. Since Tim Sloan took over as the scandal-plagued bank’s CEO in 2016, politicians and analysts have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn Wells Fargo around. The bank’s board has consistently defended Sloan, saying his deep knowledge of Wells Fargo was an asset. In September the bank’s chair, Betsy Duke, shot down a similar NY Post report that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former Goldman Sachs executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn. Wells Fargo on Thursday reiterated Duke’s statement from last year. “Rumors that Wells Fargo’s Board of Directors reached out to potential CEO candidates are completely false,” Duke said. “CEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered.” Shares of Wells Fargo pared some losses to trade down 1.5 percent at $49.62. The stock was earlier down 2.4 percent. Schwartz is up against another serious candidate for Sloan’s job, but that person’s identity could not immediately be learned, the newspaper reported, citing one source close to the situation."

Wells Fargo has been seeking to streamline its business as it grapples with the fallout of customer abuse scandals. The bank is prohibited from growing in size after the Federal Reserve slapped it with an unprecedented asset cap in February 2018, citing “widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.” The bank’s retirement plan services unit, which includes Wells’ 401(k) savings accounts business, would expand a similar business of Principal Financial. If the negotiations are concluded successfully, a deal could be announced later this month, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is confidential. Wells Fargo and Principal Financial declined to comment. Based in Des Moines, Iowa, Principal Financial is a life insurance and financial services group with a market capitalization of $14.5 billion. It is the latest in a series of divestments pursued by Wells Fargo. In 2018, Wells Fargo announced deals to sell 52 branches spread across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin to Flagstar Bancorp Inc, as well as a $1.7 billion deal to offload its Puerto Rico auto finance business to the local unit of Popular Inc. The disclosure three years ago that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines."

-8.67241780977022," Wells Fargo CEO avoids major stumble at heated congressional hearing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican lawmakers on Tuesday pressed Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan for proof the bank has put a string of consumer abuse scandals behind it at a tense congressional hearing that saw Sloan firmly on the defensive. While Sloan struggled to convince skeptical lawmakers that Wells Fargo has transformed its culture, he managed to navigate a hostile committee without a major stumble that would have compounded doubts about his leadership. One of the harshest blows was dealt after the hearing by a key regulator, which said in a statement it was “disappointed” Wells Fargo had not made more progress fixing its corporate governance and risk management. Sloan was the first bank executive to be grilled by the House Financial Services Committee since it was taken over by Democrats following the 2018 congressional election. A nervous Wall Street has been keen to see how the panel will treat the industry. The CEOs of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp are expected to appear before the panel next month. The committee, led by bank critic Maxine Waters, has several freshmen Democrats who took swipes at Sloan including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading voice of her party’s progressive wing, and Ayanna Pressley, who likewise bashed corporate America during her campaign. But those queries on Wells Fargo’s financing of private prisons and oil pipelines, businesses the bank has previously said it would pull back from, failed to land a major blow. Democrats and Republicans took a broadly tough line, quizzing Sloan on the bank’s remediation efforts, personnel changes, risk management, culture and whether it should be broken up. Opening the packed hearing, Waters recounted Wells Fargo’s missteps, saying the bank had failed to prove it had abandoned harmful policies. “Wells Fargo’s ongoing lawlessness and the failure to right the ship, suggests the bank … is simply too big to manage,” she added, saying later in the hearing that Sloan should step down. The committee’s ranking Republican Patrick McHenry made it clear that his party would not go soft on the country’s fourth-largest bank. “You will hear bipartisan criticism of the actions you have taken and the failures that you have overseen under your watch,” he said. Still, some Republicans later in the hearing acknowledged the bank’s efforts to change, with Representative Sean Duffy saying his colleagues had been too harsh on Sloan. The stakes had been high heading into the hearing for Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran who was appointed CEO when John Stumpf retired soon after the sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. The CEO has faced calls to step down from investors and politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender. Sloan’s prepared remarks emphasized changes the bank has made to culture, sales practices and risk management, as well as efforts to repay wronged customers. “Wells Fargo is a better bank than it was three years ago, and we are working every day to become even better,” Sloan, 58, read from his written testimony. At times Sloan expressed remorse over the bank’s scandals, noting he felt “terrible” that some servicemen and women had been harmed. Sloan remained calm under pressure and rebuffed Waters’ claims that Wells Fargo should be broken up. He also said the bank had paid back all customers hit by improper mortgage rate-lock fees and gave a similar answer about auto insurance remediation. But the CEO struggled to make the case that Wells Fargo is now a good corporate citizen amid repeated interruptions and aggressive, sometimes hectoring questioning from representatives including Democrats Brad Sherman and Stephen Lynch. Sloan also appeared to frustrate some lawmakers by declining to disclose confidential information on the progress of some remediation efforts, and by failing to say categorically that Wells Fargo would never suffer another scandal. If lawmakers are unhappy with what they heard, they could pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain restrictions imposed on the bank’s growth until governance and risk management improve. Waters in her testimony said the Fed’s punishment had not changed the bank, adding that “regulators seem unwilling to take forceful actions.” After the hearing, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which last year fined Wells Fargo $1 billion for faulty mortgage and insurance products, echoed comments made by its head in October that the bank still had much work to do to. “We continue to be disappointed with Wells Fargo Bank N.A.’s performance ... and its inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk management program,” said OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard.

-10.455859995909988," Wells Fargo officials enter $240 million settlement over bogus accounts (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co executives and directors have reached a $240 million settlement with U.S. shareholders over the creation by bank employees of millions of unauthorized customer accounts. The settlement was filed late Thursday with the federal court in San Francisco, and requires a judge’s approval. It resolves claims that the officials breached their fiduciary duties by knowing about or consciously disregarding the bogus accounts, and failing to stop their creation. Insurers for 20 current and former Wells Fargo executives and directors, including Chief Executive Tim Sloan and his predecessor John Stumpf, will pay the $240 million to the bank. The officials denied wrongdoing. Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist declined to comment on Friday. The San Francisco-based bank has been beset by scandals over its sales practices since agreeing in September 2016 to pay $190 million to settle government claims that it created the customer accounts without permission. Outrage over the settlement and the bank’s handling of the fallout led to Stumpf’s departure. Other sales abuses later surfaced, including Wells Fargo’s charging for unnecessary auto insurance and imposing excessive mortgage fees. The shareholders in Thursday’s settlement were led by pension plans in Alabama and Colorado. Their lawyers called the accord the largest insurer-funded cash settlement in a U.S. shareholder derivative lawsuit, surpassing News Corp’s $139 million accord in 2013 over its handling of a phone hacking scandal in Britain. Shareholders bring derivative lawsuits on behalf of companies, typically when the defendants are corporate officers or board members, with proceeds going to the companies. Last May, Wells Fargo reached a $480 million settlement of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders over the unauthorized accounts. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo said it might have to pay up to $2.7 billion more than it had set aside as of Dec. 31 to resolve legal matters, up from $2.2 billion three months earlier. In January, Wells Fargo issued a report saying it had improved risk oversight and accountability, including by eliminating sales goals and clawing back compensation from executives. Sloan nonetheless remains under pressure, and faces calls from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running in the 2020 presidential campaign, for his ouster.

Wells Fargo will be the first bank to face a grilling by House Democrats who took over the committee in the new Congress. The discussion will likely revolve around the widespread consumer abuses that took place at the bank, the report said. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley chiefs will meet with the committee in April, although formal invitations have yet to be sent to the banks, WSJ said. Wells Fargo declined to comment and the other banks did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. The House Financial Services Committee, run by long time Wall Street critic U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, has stressed industry accountability ever since Democrats took over the powerful government body that oversees the U.S. housing market, insurance and international finance sectors, among other areas. Waters has already called for Wells Fargo to be broken up or shut down, and has described JPMorgan and Citigroup as recidivist banks. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats that swept into office this year on a stronger liberal platform, and who was appointed to the Financial Services Committee earlier this year, has also campaigned on issues that put her at odds with the financial industry, including separating commercial and investment banking, breaking up large banks, and forgiving student debt."

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry, speaking at an investor conference in Florida, said that loan growth could be driven by retail branches bankers, who are increasingly comfortable referring clients to other businesses at the bank.

-3.461460254193627," Wells Fargo CEO defends his stewardship, in response to Sen. Warren: CNBC (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan, in a CNBC interview on Friday, said he is the right person to run the company, in response to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s repeated calls for him to be fired after a 2016 scandal. Sloan told Jim Cramer on “Mad Money” that Warren could have her opinion but he would not be in his present role if he thought he was not doing his job. “I think I’m the right person to run this company today,” he told Cramer. Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want. Warren, a progressive Democrat who announced in December that she had formed an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020, has called for Sloan’s removal in the past, but she could not compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step. In October, she wrote a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell urging him to not allow the bank to grow in size until it replaced Sloan. Sloan said in the Friday interview that he has “taken responsibility” and should not be criticized for doing so. “Judge me on what I said we would do and what we’ve done,” he said. Sloan said last week that Wells is planning to operate under the Fed-ordered asset cap through the end of 2019, as the fourth-largest U.S. lender’s loan book shrank and revenue fell across all its major businesses last quarter."

The lawsuit stemmed from letters Wells sent in 2017 to Florida homeowners after Hurricane Irma struck the state, including some individuals whose mortgage loans had been canceled.

-0.9985546062009838," As loans and revenue shrink, Wells Fargo leans on cost cuts (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s loan book shrank and revenue fell across all its major businesses last quarter, as the fourth-largest U.S. lender continued to work through the consequences of wayward sales practices at its consumer bank. Wells Fargo has struggled to regain its footing since sales abuses came to light in that business more than two years ago, when the bank said employees had opened millions of fake accounts in customers’ names without their permission. Management has since centralized risk controls, overhauled employee compensation and pushed a renewed focus on customer wellness to address underlying problems. Some of those changes are hurting revenue, executives acknowledged on Tuesday when discussing fourth-quarter results. For instance, the bank now sends customers real-time low balance alerts to protect them from overdraft fees. Wells Fargo is also experiencing cyclical pressure in mortgage lending, which was once its main money-maker, and has intentionally pulled back from some areas, like auto lending, where executives felt profit potential was limited. Combined with legal and regulatory penalties for its sales abuses, which also involved overcharging hundreds of thousands of customers on auto loans, mortgages and account features they did not request, the bank has struggled to get its profit engine humming again. In lieu of revenue growth, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has laid out an aggressive cost-cutting plan to buoy profits. The bank’s shares fell 1.5 percent to close at $47.67. Sloan said on Tuesday he expects the Federal Reserve to maintain an asset cap on the bank through the remainder of the year. The Fed imposed that penalty in February as punishment for the sales abuses, saying it would only be lifted once the bank proved it had fixed what was wrong. Wells Fargo executives initially said the cap would not hinder the bank’s business growth, and as recently as July predicted it would be lifted by mid-2019. But progress has been slower than expected, Sloan said on a call with analysts, who peppered him with questions about the profit impact of the asset cap. “It is hard not to feel like the regulatory penalty box is endless,” said Brian Foran, an analyst with Autonomous Research. The bank has already paid billions in combined fines and settlements with regulators and private litigants over its sales abuses, and remains on a tight leash with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as it continues remediation efforts. Wells Fargo also faces probes from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the fourth quarter, the bank’s loan book shrank 1 percent and deposits fell 3 percent. Consumer loans posted the biggest decline, hurt primarily by more people paying off their mortgages than taking out new ones. Mortgage banking revenue fell by half. Wells Fargo’s overall quarterly profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, was down 1 percent from the $5.74 billion, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier. Those results reflected special items including some $432 million in operating losses from legal costs, regulatory penalties and customer remediation, and a $614 million gain on the sale of troubled mortgage loans that predate the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell 5 percent to $20.98 billion, below Wall Street’s $21.73 billion estimate. Wells Fargo met Sloan’s expense target last year when excluding big one-time items like legal costs, regulatory penalties and customer remediation expenses. The bank is now aiming to slash expenses to a range of $52 billion to $53 billion this year, and $50 billion to $51 billion by 2020. Wells Fargo is on track to hit those goals through efficiency programs that will reduce overall headcount by 5 percent to 10 percent, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said. Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chase & Co reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and a slump in bond trading revenue."

-2.5320519315223167," Wells Fargo settles SEC lawsuit over Curt Schilling's 38 Studios (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N agreed to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fraud lawsuit related to a $75 million bond offering for 38 Studios Inc, a now-bankrupt video game company founded by former All-Star major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. The settlement in principle with the bank’s Wells Fargo Securities unit was disclosed in a Jan. 10 filing with the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island. Terms were not disclosed. Wells Fargo and the SEC said the partial federal government shutdown is delaying a final settlement, and asked a federal judge to put the case on hold. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. The SEC did not respond to similar requests. Wells Fargo was accused of concealing from investors that 38 Studios would face a $25 million shortfall even after the October 2010 bond offering from Rhode Island Commerce Corp, a state economic development agency. The SEC said 38 Studios received only $50 million from the offering, with most of the rest set aside for interest and other payments, after claiming to need $75 million to develop a video game code-named Copernicus. Wells Fargo was also accused of concealing its overall fees related to 38 Studios from investors. Peter Cannava, Wells Fargo’s lead banker on the bond offering, remains a defendant in the SEC case and did not object to the delay, according to Thursday’s filing. 38 Studios filed to liquidate in bankruptcy in June 2012 after defaulting on the loan. Schilling won 216 games in his 20-year career, and helped lead the Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox to World Series championships in 2001 and 2004, respectively. He has said 38 Studios’ demise cost him $50 million. The SEC did not charge him in the Wells Fargo case."
3.5329627357418882," Karen Peetz to retire from Wells Fargo board (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Monday board member Karen Peetz has decided not to stand for reelection after roughly two years on the board. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets also said it has elected Wayne Hewett to join the board. Peetz was named to the board in February of 2017 and chaired the risk committee, a key position as Wells Fargo works to prove that it has improved its risk management controls. The former president of Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N is stepping down to devote more time to other commitments, the statement said. She will retire as director during the company's annual shareholder meeting in April. Enhancing its risk controls is a priority for the bank after a series of scandals stemming from its sales practices landed the bank under public and regulatory scrutiny. Revelations that Wells Fargo opened up potentially millions of unauthorized accounts has resulted in billions of fines for the bank and a punitive cap on assets from the Federal Reserve. Hewett is currently chairman of industrial manufacturing company DiversiTech Corporation and has experience with medical devices, food and electronics, the statement said. “Wayne brings a unique and relevant background to Wells Fargo’s business and strategic direction, further enhancing the breadth of skills and experience of our board,” said President and Chief Executive Tim Sloan."

8.20231100550013," Wells Fargo to pay $575 million in settlement with U.S. states NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N will pay $575 million to settle claims made by U.S. states, the latest settlement as the bank works to resolve lingering investigations and legal battles stemming from its sales-practices scandal and to remove a punitive asset cap. Two years ago, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle federal government claims that the bank created phony customer accounts. Since then, the bank has racked up over $2 billion in penalties as other issues were discovered across most of its business lines. Friday’s settlement resolves claims by all 50 states and the District of Columbia related to the accounts, as well as claims that the bank improperly referred and charged customers for a number of financial products like auto and life insurance. “Instead of safeguarding its customers Wells Fargo exploited them,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “This is an incredible breach of trust that threatens not only the customer who depended on Wells Fargo, but confidence in our banking system.” The settlement, confirmed by Wells Fargo and the offices of various state attorneys general, was first reported earlier by Reuters. Wells Fargo has been seeking a fresh start after revelations that its employees opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts tangled the nation’s fourth-largest bank in fierce investor and regulatory scrutiny for the past two years. Over the summer, Wells Fargo launched a marketing campaign saying the bank had been “re-established” this year, but Wells Fargo continued to attract fresh headlines about the customer abuses of the past. The bank has been working to resolve ongoing investigations and legal battles as it tries to gain approval from the Federal Reserve to lift its cap on assets. This year, the bank has settled claims with the New York attorney general, a class of investors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, but the bank still has a number of probes looming over its bottom line. Wells Fargo still faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor, according to its most recent securities filing.

11.50709389042535," Wells Fargo moves jobs abroad after U.S. layoffs, government says (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co. WFC.N has been hiring overseas after pledging to eliminate thousands of jobs, according to a Department of Labor investigation. The department determined that American employees who have been laid off in Wells Fargo’s customer account management unit after Sept. 28 will be eligible for government aid under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. The program provides weekly income and training to help workers displaced by global trade find new jobs. The bank “has shifted to a foreign country the supply of a service like or directly competitive with the service supplied by the workers,” the TAA determination said. The document, available online, did not specify which countries jobs were being moved to or how many people were hired overseas. The department’s findings were earlier reported by The Charlotte Observer. Ninety percent of Wells Fargo’s workforce is U.S.-based, and the company currently has 17,000 open positions domestically, spokesman Kurt Schroeder said in a statement. However, he said, employees abroad are needed in order to meet the demands of customers who need round-the-clock support. “Wells Fargo has a long history and strong commitment to a work force that is predominantly U.S.-based,” he said. Wells Fargo, the largest bank employer in the United States with roughly 262,000 workers, said on Sept. 20 it would reduce its total headcount by up to 26,0000. Last month the bank handed out roughly 1,000 60-day notices to employees across the United States, and over the summer it laid off 600 employees in its mortgage division. The reductions are intended to help the bank reach its goal of cutting costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to increase profit and recover from a series of sales-practice scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve’s asset cap. Aside from headcount cuts, Wells Fargo has pledged to lower costs and become more efficient by reducing its branch count by about 800 by 2020 and by selling noncore businesses."
2.8915775605226886," Wells Fargo won't be allowed to grow unless problems fixed: Fed's Powell WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N must keep a lid on its growth until the bank has hardened its risk management policies to prevent any further abuse of its customers, said Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve. In February, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to freeze its balance sheet, keeping its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it put new checks on senior managers and gave the board new powers to sniff out abuses. “We do not intend to lift the asset cap until remedies to these issues have been adopted and implemented to our satisfaction,” Powell wrote in a letter to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren seen by Reuters. Wells Fargo has so far failed to satisfy the Fed and the bank is months behind schedule on submitting an acceptable reform plan, Reuters reported last week. A bank representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Powell’s letter. Wells Fargo executives have previously said that they expect the cap to be lifted during the first half of next year. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been a vocal critic of Wells Fargo and its Chief Executive Tim Sloan. In October, Warren wrote a letter asking the regulator not to remove the asset cap until Sloan is removed, charging that Sloan was “deeply implicated” in the misdeeds of the past. Wells Fargo has called Sloan’s 30-year tenure at the bank an asset and said he has the full support of its board. On Monday, Warren faulted the bank for being late with its reform plan and said Sloan must go. “Wells Fargo is already months behind,” Warren said in a statement. “If the Fed is serious about changing the practices at Wells Fargo that have cost customers their homes or cars or credit scores, it must insist on new leadership at the bank.” The Wells Fargo sanctions were rooted in a sales practices scandal that broke open in 2016 when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. In his letter to Warren, Powell wrote that what happened inside the bank was “outrageous,” but declined to say whether or not Sloan should continue to lead the bank. Since the phony accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has said it found abuses in auto insurance, small business loans, mortgage lending and other business lines. Once Wells Fargo has satisfied the terms of the February settlement, Powell wrote, the Fed board will decide whether or not the bank can grow. “The decision about terminating the asset growth restriction imposed on Wells Fargo will be made by a vote of the Board,” Powell wrote in the Nov. 28 letter."
-1.6018224102949192," Employee rights group says Wells Fargo declined planned meeting (Reuters) - A union-backed bank employee rights group is complaining after Wells Fargo & Co declined to meet with members last week, according to a letter sent to Chief Executive Tim Sloan viewed exclusively by Reuters. Members of the group, Committee for Better Banks (CBB), were scheduled to meet with Wells Fargo representatives on Wednesday, but the meeting was canceled after the two sides could not agree on terms. The company said CBB members who were not Wells Fargo employees would not be allowed to attend. Wells Fargo is not unionized. CBB-backed whistleblowers helped reveal the sales practice scandal in 2016 that resulted in hefty fines and penalties for the bank. Nick Wiener, a CBB organizer, said the group was clear about its intention to bring CBB organizers to the meeting from the outset, and that the group had received a verbal green light from a representative of Wells Fargo management. Wells Fargo said it only committed to an internal meeting with team members who happened to be a part of CBB. “We value opportunities to engage and meet with our team members,” said Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk. “We were disappointed that the meeting did not occur, and we remain available to meet with the team members in the future.” CBB said it is critical to have non-Wells Fargo CBB members present so that employees could voice their opinions without fear of retaliation. “Given Wells Fargo’s track record of firing and blackballing employees who spoke out against the unethical and fraudulent banking practices they were pressured to perform, it’s simply unacceptable that your team is placing restrictions on who should attend a meeting,” said the letter, which was sent on Wednesday and signed by Christopher Shelton, president of Communications Workers of America, which supports CBB. The bank has taken several steps aimed at rebuilding the trust of employees, customers and investors, including eliminating product sales goals for retail workers, raising wages, and hiring back nearly 2,000 employees who quit or were fired. Sloan has also been hosting town halls to hear employee concerns. The effort comes as the bank faces investor pressure to cut costs. Wells Fargo, the largest bank employer in the United States with roughly 265,000 employees as of October, recently announced plans to reduce its workforce by 5 percent to 10 percent."
-1.6018224102949192," Wells Fargo reform plans fail to satisfy Fed after scandals: sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has rejected Wells Fargo & Co’s plans to prevent further consumer abuses and told the scandal-plagued lender it needs stronger checks on management, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The concerns raised by the Fed, which have not been previously reported, are likely to increase the time it takes the central bank to lift an asset cap it imposed on Wells Fargo in February following a string of sales practices scandals. The bank must draw up a robust plan to improve its governance and risk management controls before the Fed will lift the cap and in February Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank was “on the fast track” to meeting those conditions. Both the Fed and Wells Fargo declined to comment on the specifics of the review. On Thursday, the bank said it was working to satisfy the Fed’s concerns and that the process was ongoing. “We work diligently to address feedback provided,” the bank said in a statement. “This is an ongoing, iterative process.” In April, Wells Fargo submitted its plan, expecting the Fed to sign off on it over the summer, but the central bank instead told the country’s fourth-largest lender to go back to the drawing board, the people said. The settlement requires Wells Fargo to toughen board oversight, repay customers hurt by past abuses, and make more than 20 other improvements to its governance, risk management and compliance controls. It also required the plan to be approved, implemented and an independent third-party review completed by Sept. 30, but the bank has missed this deadline, the people said. That alone could have triggered further sanctions under the terms of the settlement, but the Fed has granted Wells Fargo more time to satisfy the February order, the sources said. Wells Fargo executives and Fed officials have haggled for months over what controls are needed to make sure the bank can detect problems before they become full-blown scandals, the people said. On Tuesday, bank CEO Sloan told CNBC that the bank now expects the cap will be lifted in the first half of 2019, instead of this fall. He added that discussions with the Fed regarding the operational and risk compliance aspects of the plan were ongoing. “I’m optimistic that we’ll continue to make progress, but we need to demonstrate that we’re deserving of the asset cap being lifted,” Sloan said. The bank told investors in May that it expected the asset cap to hurt profits by only $100 million. Over the past nine months, Sloan has met several times with Fed Governor Lael Brainard to try and agree on the specifics of the new plan, said two sources. Betsy Duke, a former Fed governor who now sits on the Wells Fargo board, has joined Sloan in those meetings, they added. Reuters could not ascertain how close the two parties were to an agreement. However, even if the Fed blesses Wells Fargo’s plan before year-end, the settlement still requires the bank to hire outside firms to perform an independent review of the bank’s operations - work that is expected to take months. In May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said removal of the cap would also be put to a vote of the board of governors."

-4.617064474247103," Wells Fargo fights to leave customers out of auto payout plan WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is fighting to shut some customers out of a sweeping plan to compensate around 600,000 drivers it pushed into car insurance they did not need, according to court documents and a source familiar with the effort.    U.S. regulators fined Wells Fargo $1 billion in April over the insurance program and told the bank to compensate drivers who were harmed. Those drivers are also suing Wells Fargo in a federal court in California for more compensation that the bank is willing to pay. The faulty insurance program ran from 2002 to 2016 but the bank only intends to compensate drivers forced into policies from 2005 onwards, Wells Fargo has told the federal judge overseeing the case. Wells Fargo’s reluctance to compensate all drivers contradicts its pledge to help every customer who was hurt and that could intensify scrutiny of the scandal-plagued bank. Lawyers for the drivers have argued that the compensation plan should cover the entire life of the insurance program but the bank is not persuaded, according to court documents obtained by Reuters. “There’s no credible reason why you don’t go back to the inception of the program,” Roland Tellis, an attorney for the drivers, said at an August hearing. Tellis did not respond to requests for further comment. Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, told lawmakers last year that the bank was “working diligently to make things right for every customer who was harmed.” But a lawyer for the bank argued at the same court hearing that it has already “compromised” by allowing payouts from 2005 to 2016, according to the official court transcript. Wells Fargo has records from the first three years of the insurance program but those are held in a separate database to the 2005-2016 files, the lawyer said. He did not explain why the bank did not wish to access the earlier database and the bank declined to elaborate when contacted by Reuters. Any driver who believes that he or she was hurt in the insurance program can contact the bank directly and make a claim, a spokeswoman for the bank said. “We invite them to reach out to us with their insurance information,” Wells Fargo said in a statement to Reuters. Tellis and other lawyers want a payout exceeding three times what drivers were charged, which could add costs and uncertainty to a scandal that continues to worry investors. The final terms of the private litigation could affect the ongoing remediation plan the bank agreed with federal regulators. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) allowed the bank to limit its payout plan to the 2005-2016 time frame in its April settlement with the bank. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment on the scope of the payout plan. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which had a part in the April fine, declined to comment. The OCC’s settlement did not set a specific time frame for payouts. Over the summer, the OCC rejected the bank’s plan to repay customers with Joseph Otting, head of the OCC, telling lawmakers in October that he was “not comfortable” with the bank’s effort."

-5.970863793467309," Wells Fargo plans 1,000 U.S. job cuts (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Thursday it notified about 1,000 employees in its Consumer Lending and Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovations groups of plans to eliminate their positions. The layoffs are consistent with the bank’s previously announced plans to reduce headcount by up to 10 percent by 2020, spokesman Tom Goyda said. Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, had about 262,000 employees as of Sept. 30. Most of those affected received 60-day notices, but some received pre-notices, meaning they will get a 60-day notice sometime next year. About 900 of the layoffs are in the bank’s home lending unit, reflecting declines in application volume and the number of customers in default. The cuts will be spread across the United States but are concentrated in Des Moines, Iowa, which is expected to have about 400 reductions, and Fort Mill, South Carolina, which is expected to have 111 cuts. “We are committed to retaining as many team members as possible and will do everything we can to help them identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,” Goyda said. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to reduce its overall headcount by up to 26,000 over the next three years to reflect changing consumer preferences as more customers use self-service technology to do their banking. The cuts are intended to help the bank reach its goal of reducing costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to increase profit and recover from a series of scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve’s asset cap.

-5.970863793467309," UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo plans 1,000 U.S. job cuts (Adds company background, comment by Wells Fargo spokesman) Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Thursday it notified about 1,000 employees in its Consumer Lending and Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovations groups of plans to eliminate their positions. The layoffs are consistent with the bank’s previously announced plans to reduce headcount by up to 10 percent by 2020, spokesman Tom Goyda said. Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, had about 262,000 employees as of Sept. 30. Most of those affected received 60-day notices, but some received pre-notices, meaning they will get a 60-day notice sometime next year. About 900 of the layoffs are in the bank’s home lending unit, reflecting declines in application volume and the number of customers in default. The cuts will be spread across the United States but are concentrated in Des Moines, Iowa, which is expected to have about 400 reductions, and Fort Mill, South Carolina, which is expected to have 111 cuts. “We are committed to retaining as many team members as possible and will do everything we can to help them identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,” Goyda said. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to reduce its overall headcount by up to 26,000 over the next three years to reflect changing consumer preferences as more customers use self-service technology to do their banking. The cuts are intended to help the bank reach its goal of reducing costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to increase profit and recover from a series of scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve’s asset cap. Over the summer, the bank laid off 600 employees in its mortgage division which has faced challenges due to a slowdown in refinancing demand. Aside from headcount reductions, Wells Fargo has pledged to lower costs and become more efficient by reducing its branch count by about 800 by 2020 and by selling noncore businesses.

-5.454331170649568," Wells Fargo settles BlackRock, Pimco MBS trustee class action for $43 million (Reuters) - In what appears to be the first class action settlement in a wave of noteholder suits against banks that served as trustees for mortgage-backed securities trusts, Wells Fargo agreed Friday to a $43 million deal to resolve claims by BlackRock, Pimco and other noteholders in 271 trusts that lost nearly $35 billion in the financial crisis. If the proposed settlement is approved by Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos, shareholders will also receive $70 million from an indemnity fund Wells Fargo reserved to litigate noteholder suits. The question, of course, is what the settlement means in the larger context of MBS investor suits against the trustees they accuse of failing to protect noteholders when problems showed up in the home mortgage loans underlying the securities. As I’ve written, these trustee suits are the last big tranche of MBS litigation by noteholders who lost untold billions of dollars in the MBS market. Should investors read the Wells Fargo settlement as a sign the hard-fought MBS trustee litigation is about to pay off or as an acknowledgment that their claims aren’t very valuable? I’d say the latter is a better reading of the settlement than the former. The noteholders’ lawyer who led the class action against Wells Fargo, Timothy DeLange of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann didn’t immediately respond to my email requesting comment, but he is actually quoted in the Wells Fargo press release announcing the deal. He didn’t exactly crow about the result: “Following more than four years of litigation, including fact and expert discovery, we concluded that this agreement provides a fair and reasonable resolution of the claims,” DeLange said. “While we believe the claims are meritorious, the settlement provides an immediate and concrete benefit for class members, while bringing the litigation to a close.” In the memo asking Judge Ramos to approve the deal, noteholders acknowledged some of the litigation setbacks investors have experienced in their suits against trustees. Although noteholders have broadly survived defense dismissal motions, post-dismissal rulings have turned the litigation into an expensive quagmire for investors. Class certification has been one big problem, with Manhattan federal judges issuing a series of rulings denying class certification to MBS noteholders because, according to the decisions, individual issues of standing and timeliness predominate over classwide concerns. (A BlackRock investors’ class certification motion against Wells Fargo was pending before U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla of Manhattan when the two sides agreed to settle their parallel case in state court.) Courts have also foreclosed evidentiary shortcuts for noteholders, ruling that noteholders must prove trustees were aware of problems in underlying mortgage pools on a loan-by-loan, trust-by-trust basis. Judges have generally refused to allow investors to prove deficiencies by extrapolating from a sample of underlying mortgage loans. And at least one judge, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni of Manhattan, has ruled, on a summary judgment motion, that noteholders must show trustees had actual knowledge that individual underlying loans failed to live up to representations and warranties. (A New York state appeals court took an easier line on trustees’ knowledge, concluding that investors need not allege trustees’ actual knowledge on a loan-by-loan basis.) Black Rock and the other noteholders suing Wells Fargo acknowledged their tough road ahead in the memo requesting settlement approval. “To defeat summary judgment and prevail at trial, plaintiffs would have been required to prove, among other things, that Wells Fargo discovered breaches of representations and warranties and had actual knowledge of servicing violations with respect to individual loans in the trusts,” the memo said. “Wells Fargo would have had substantial arguments to make concerning each of these issues. For example, Wells Fargo would have argued that plaintiffs must prove, on a loan-by-loan basis, Wells Fargo’s discovery of breaches of representations and warranties and actual knowledge of servicing violations. … In addition, Wells Fargo would have argued that any damages to plaintiffs and the class were caused by factors unrelated to the purported breaches of representations and warranties or servicing violations. Had any of these arguments been accepted in whole or in part, it could have eliminated or, at a minimum, drastically limited any potential recovery.” And based on sheer math, the settlement looks more like a business decision by Wells Fargo than an admission of the merits of claims that the bank failed to live up to its MBS trustee responsibilities. As I mentioned, the Black Rock investors alleged losses of nearly $35 billion across the 271 trusts covered by the settlement. Their amended complaint sought to hold Wells Fargo liable for all of those losses. Instead, the settlement is for only $42 million. We can infer, moreover, that Wells Fargo expected the litigation to cost at least that much. Acting in its capacity as MBS trustee, the bank reserved about $90 million from MBS trusts to pay legal expenses stemming from its trustee duties. (BlackRock actually sued Wells Fargo over the reserve fund, asserting that the bank had looted trust assets, but Judge Ramos dismissed the suit in 2017.) By releasing $70 million of the reserve fund to investors as part of Friday’s settlement, Wells Fargo effectively said it would have cost more to defend the Black Rock class action than to settle it. It’s worth pointing out that Wells Fargo kept $20 million in the reserve fund, presumably to fend off MBS trustee claims by investors in another 58 trusts. Based on the bank’s per-trust payout in the BlackRock case, however, Wells Fargo’s exposure in those cases is less than $10 million. That calculation assumes Wells Fargo – as well as other MBS trustees such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bank and Deutsche Bank – will present the Black Rock class settlement as a ceiling for future settlements, not a floor. Individual noteholders may well balk at the idea that they’re on par with the BlackRock group, some of whose affiliated investment advisors were facing third-party claims by Wells Fargo that they, and not the trustee, were responsible for MBS losses. Wells Fargo hasn’t brought analogous third-party claims against the individual noteholders suing that bank as an MBS trustee. I checked in with a plaintiffs' lawyer who represents individual certificate-holders in MBS trustee cases, David Wollmuth of Wollmuth Maher & Deutsch. Wollmuth client Phoenix Life reached a confidential settlement last month of claims against Bank of America, which had limited trustee duties in an MBS offering of more than $600 million. The settlement amount was not disclosed and Wollmuth said he could not comment on the agreement. But overall, he said, Phoenix continues to believe in the strength of its claims and is “pleased at how the cases are progressing.” Wells Fargo is represented in the MBS trustee litigation by Jones Day. Partner Howard Sidman is lead counsel."

-6.502337606043709," Wells Fargo executives knew auto insurance program was flawed: lawsuit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co executives were warned that an auto insurance plan could be overcharging customers four years before the bank scrapped the program, according to a complaint released by a judge this week. Several executives, including then-General Counsel James Strother and chief auditor David Julian, were among the bank officials briefed in 2012 about possible flaws in the auto insurance program that was ended in 2016, according to parts of a class-action lawsuit that were unsealed on Monday. A Wells Fargo official declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit but said the bank intended to repay all customers who were hurt. “We have been reviewing customer accounts and developing a remediation plan – which we hope to finalize very soon,” said spokeswoman Natalie Brown. Strother, Julian and other executives named in the lawsuit could not immediately be reached for comment. Last month, regulators warned Julian and another bank official that they could face sanctions for their past work with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo ended its auto insurance program in September 2016 after an internal review found many customers were being wrongfully placed in a costly product they did not need. The bank had a right to force auto borrowers into the product called ‘collateral protection insurance’ (CPI) if they let their own policies lapse. But ultimately, the bank said some 600,000 customers were forced into CPI unnecessarily when it reached a $1 billion regulatory settlement in April. Wells Fargo initially estimated remediation efforts would cost $64 million, but that figure has since swelled as it determined more borrowers were owed greater amounts. In the third quarter, Wells Fargo set aside $241 million for those affected customers. Its auto insurance abuses are part of a broader scandal over Wells Fargo’s treatment of customers. The bank revealed over two years ago that it opened millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit sales targets. The San Francisco-based lender has since found sales abuses in businesses ranging from mortgage loans to wealth management. The lawsuit was originally filed in U.S. District Court, Central District of California, in August. Wells Fargo has fought to keep some details of the case under seal. The plaintiffs say they are customers seeking reimbursement for wrongful charges, and allege Wells Fargo pushed drivers with poor credit into policies more often than well-off customers. Wells Fargo was 10 times more likely to force borrowers with damaged credit into CPI insurance than those with high credit scores, according to the lawsuit, which cites an internal bank presentation. Drivers of Tesla vehicles and others who carried high loan balances were exempted from CPI, according to the lawsuit."

-6.502337606043709," Wells Fargo says internal error caused more home foreclosures than expected (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Tuesday an internal underwriting error had caused it to reject home loan modifications, resulting in the bank foreclosing more homes than expected. The bank said in a filing with regulators that an expanded review found that 870 customers were incorrectly denied mortgage changes, leading to 545 of them losing their homes. This comes after the bank in August had for the first time disclosed a calculation error in an internal underwriting software had caused 625 borrowers to be incorrectly denied mortgage loan modifications under a federal assistance program, 400 of whom had their homes foreclosed upon. “We’re very sorry that the errors occurred and have assigned a single, dedicated point of contact to ensure that each customer is engaged with and assisted individually,” Tom Goyda, a spokesman for the company, said in an email. The company said the expanded review is still under way and took into account customers who were in the foreclosure process between March 15, 2010, and April 30, 2018. Goyda said the bank had contacted a substantial majority of the affected customers to provide remediation as well as the option to pursue no-cost mediation with an independent mediator. The revelations are an additional headache for the San Francisco-based bank which is facing numerous regulatory penalties and private lawsuits, most of which stem from a sales practices scandal that touched on all of the bank’s major business units. The bank said the issue stems from a calculation error that overstated attorneys’ fees that were needed in determining whether a customer qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. In August, the bank said it rectified the calculation errors and had set aside $8 million to compensate borrowers. On Tuesday, the bank, however, did not update that figure. The bank updated disclosures on issues it discovered in auto lending, saying it had tacked on an additional $241 million for customer compensation on top of the $212 million announced earlier, related to a practice where it forced customers auto insurance that in some cases resulted in vehicle repossessions. The bank has since discontinued that practice. (This story corrects to say the bank added an additional $241 million for customer compensation, not increased it to $241 million in penultimate paragraph.)"

Chief Administration Officer Hope Hardison and Chief Auditor David Julian have begun leaves of absence and will no longer be members of the bank’s operating committee, the bank said. The bank declined to comment on the reason for the moves, which it announced in a press release. Hardison is a 24-year veteran of Wells Fargo and assumed the CAO role in 2015, according to the company website. Julian joined Wells through its merger with Wachovia Corp and has served as chief auditor since 2012, according to LinkedIn. Wells Fargo has been coping with the fallout of a sales practice scandal since late 2016, when it was revealed that millions of fake accounts may have been opened in customers’ names by bankers facing lofty sales targets. Since then the bank has been hit with penalties including a $1 billion fine and a cap on assets put in place by the Federal Reserve. Earlier this week, the bank settled for $65 million with the New York attorney general’s office which alleged that the bank misled investors about its sales practices. The fourth-largest U.S. lender is still facing inquiries into its customer sales abuses by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor, according to Wells Fargo’s most recent regulatory disclosure. The bank is also facing several class-action lawsuits from angry customers. “We remain steadfast in our focus on making things right for customers and building a better Wells Fargo,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said in a statement on Wednesday."

-5.057251240397602," Senator Warren urges Fed to require removal of Wells Fargo CEO WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday the Federal Reserve should not allow Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N to grow in size until the bank replaces Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan. In a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Warren said Sloan, a 30-year veteran of Wells, was “deeply implicated” in prior bank misconduct and it was untenable for him to remain at the bank as the Fed sought a drastic overhaul of its operations. “The Wells Fargo Board of Directors cannot plausibly claim that it is ‘ensuring senior management’s ongoing effectiveness in managing the firm’s activities’ while retaining a CEO that helped oversee this much misconduct,” she wrote. The Fed took the unprecedented step of ordering the bank to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion in February, saying Wells Fargo had prioritized growth at the expense of proper compliance and risk management. The bank now must convince the Fed it has sufficiently overhauled its policies before it is permitted to grow. Warren has called for Sloan’s removal in the past, but she cannot compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step. Still, her letter indicated she was ramping up her efforts to oust Sloan, and it marks the latest challenge for the bank in Washington, where Wells Fargo has been working to move past its scandals and rebuild its reputation. Wells Fargo is confident in the steps it has taken so far to satisfy the consent order and is engaged in constructive dialogue with the Fed, spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in response to questions about the letter. A Fed spokesman said the agency had received the letter and would respond. Sloan told analysts during a conference call on Friday that the bank continues to expect the asset cap to be lifted in the first half of next year. Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want. Since Sloan took over as CEO in 2016, analysts and investors have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn around the bank. Wells’s board has defended its pick, saying Sloan’s deep knowledge of the bank was an asset. Most recently, the bank's chair, Betsy Duke, shot down rumors that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former Goldman Sachs Group GS.N executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn. “CEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered,” she said in a statement at the time. Financial analysts do not expect Warren’s letter to carry much weight with the Fed or with Wells Fargo’s board, but the Fed has given in to Warren’s pressure once before. In May, the Fed said it would hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on Wells Fargo, after being urged to do so by the Democratic senator. “I don’t think that political pressure is going to sway the Fed either way,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, noting that President Donald Trump’s criticism of rising interest rates have not deterred the regulator from implementing more hikes."

The San Francisco-based bank, whose purchase of a high-profile location near the Bank of England two years ago was seen as a vote of confidence in the Brexit process, said it would continue to service UK and non-EU clients from London. The company said a new subsidiary based in Paris would provide capital markets and investment banking services for European and international customers who require access to the EU and the European Economic Area. The company gave no indication whether the move would lead to job cuts in London or how many it would employ in Paris. A spokesperson said the company employs about 1,000 people at its London office. “With Brexit on the horizon, Wells Fargo is committed to providing a transition, which is as seamless as possible, for its markets and investment banking customers,” said Alicia Reyes, head of Wells Fargo Securities for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The new Paris-based unit will be called Wells Fargo Securities Europe S.A. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in July that the country would ease financial regulations to EU minimums and introduce new tax incentives to make Paris a more attractive finance hub. (reut.rs/2PCDGek) Paris is competing with the likes of Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg to win over finance jobs in the wake of Britain’s departure from the EU next March. The Paris Europlace financial sector lobby said in July that Paris was set to win 3,500 financial sector jobs leaving Britain due to Brexit. HSBC HSBA.L would make up the bulk, with 1,000 jobs, while French banks moving posts back to their base in Paris would add another 1,000 jobs. The rest would come from a host of Wall Street banks and other financial firms, the lobby had said. Companies from across the EU use London for currency trading, derivatives and managing investment funds. Some EU policymakers want parts of these activities shifted to the continent after Brexit to avoid relying on what will then be a foreign financial centre. Wells Fargo said it will make more announcements on its Brexit strategy in the near future. Shares of the company, which reported a better-than-expected profit last week, were down marginally in late morning trading."

-9.73767331079866," Breakingviews - BofA punches above Wells Fargo’s weight NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bank of America is punching above Wells Fargo’s weight. The Charlotte-based bank earned $6.7 billion for its common shareholders in the third quarter, or an 11 percent annualized return on equity. In other words, it lagged its West Coast rival’s performance, as it typically does – this time by a percentage point. Yet the two now trade at the same multiple of 1.65 times tangible book value, an implicit valuation premium for BofA. Boss Brian Moynihan’s turnaround has taken shape over years. Tim Sloan at Wells may close the gap again before long. There are a few similarities between Sloan and the BofA chief executive. Both ended up running their respective banks after a predecessor left under a cloud. Neither was considered the best person for the job. And each of them struggled to quickly control the various issues plaguing their franchises. Moynihan, who took the reins at the $280 billion BofA in 2010, is now reaping the benefits of years spent overhauling the operation. He has been helped greatly by last year’s U.S. tax cuts and the Federal Reserve’s tightening of monetary policy – the bank was one of the best placed to benefit from rising interest rates. But he marshaled a solid set of businesses, pulled ahead of fellow laggard Citigroup, and now has the results to show for it. The three months to the end of September may mark a turning point for the $250 billion Wells and Sloan. Deposits and loans are still declining, and the bank is still forbidden from growing its balance sheet thanks to a consent order from the Fed reflecting past failures in governance and risk management. But Sloan is now getting expenses under control, setting the bank up for a return to growth. Still, it must smart a bit to be running a once-standout lender that investors now peg at the same price-to-tangible-book multiple as BofA, until two years ago regarded as one of the slowpokes of the industry. But if Moynihan managed to put BofA’s past behind it, despite all the doubters, then perhaps Sloan can, too."
-7.393419625185023," Wells Fargo profit rises, cost cuts paying off (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N posted a 32 percent jump in quarterly profit on Friday, as the bank made headway in its cost-cutting plan and worked to put past misdeeds behind it. Non-interest expenses in the third quarter fell 4.1 percent to $13.8 billion, in the first year-over-year decline this year. Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. lender by assets, has vowed to chop billions of costs over the next several years. But costs for repaying customers it had previously overcharged and marketing costs to re-brand the company after a string of scandals have kept costs stubbornly high. Wells has promised to reduce about $3 billion in expenses by 2020. It is closing roughly 800 branches and cutting up to 10 percent of its workforce over the next three years. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told reporters on a conference call that other opportunities to reduce costs include scaling back call center operations and non-customer-facing office space. But even as profits soared due to the cost cuts and a lower tax rate, analysts raised concerns about the company’s sluggish revenue and shrinking loan book. Total loans fell 1 percent to $942.3 billion, and revenue inched 0.4 percent higher during the quarter. By comparison JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N reported a 5.2 percent increase in revenue and a 6 percent jump in average loan balances on Friday. “Loan and revenue growth remains challenged,” said Kyle Sanders, an Edward Jones analyst, in a research note. “This trend could linger in the near term as Wells works to emerge from the Fed’s asset growth cap and repair its reputation with consumers.” The Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells to keep its assets below $1.95 million until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals. Chief Executive Tim Sloan said on a call with analysts he was hopeful that the bank would not have any new issues. Analysts said the quarter’s results show that Wells is making progress on cleaning up its previous scandals, though worries linger. “While these results were less noisy than previous quarters, more fallout from prior misdeeds cannot be ruled out,” Allen Tischler, senior vice president with Moody’s Investors Service, said. Wells Fargo ended the quarter with $1.88 trillion in assets. Its average total deposits declined 3 percent to $1.27 trillion, well under the Fed’s $1.95 trillion asset cap. The bank’s executives expect the cap to be lifted in the first half of next year.

-6.187233755541378," Wells Fargo touts good deeds to get back in lawmakers' good graces WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tired of being cast as the poster child for big banks behaving badly, Wells Fargo & Co has been expanding its presence in the nation’s capital to convince lawmakers it has changed and talking up its charitable work in their districts. In the past the bank’s lobbying efforts had been modest, but over the past 18 months, Wells Fargo has added more than 15 people to its Washington team, tripling its size, and is still hiring. The bank has also contracted big-name firms including Ogilvy and Federal Street Strategies, whose principals previously worked for powerful lawmakers, financial regulators or President Donald Trump, according to interviews and filings reviewed by Reuters. Wells Fargo has also been highlighting millions of dollars spent on programs dedicated to homelessness, housing for veterans and financial literacy in key lawmakers’ districts to win back their favor, bank representatives said. “We have a lot of projects in a lot of communities that we are proud of, and we do have those conversations with elected officials,” David Moskowitz, head of government relations and public policy at the fourth-largest U.S. lender, told Reuters. “Our plan is to engage with virtually everyone on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle.” Moskowitz said he expected his team to meet with important government officials or staff almost every day. Wells Fargo launched its charm offensive to limit the blowback from a sales scandal that erupted in September 2016, with revelations that employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want. In an unprecedented move in February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo. In April, two U.S. regulators jointly fined the bank $1 billion for mistreating auto borrowers. Authorities including the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are still conducting their own probes. Each negative headline about Wells Fargo extends how long the bank will remain in the regulatory doghouse, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading. “There’s a belief among some policymakers that Wells Fargo wants to right the ship and that it will take time to do so,” he said. “But in the meantime they will remain the rhetorical whipping boy for lingering populist anger.” The scandal-related fallout has started to hit Wells Fargo’s profits as it needs to work harder to win new customers and additional marketing costs keep expenses high. In the first half of the year, Wells Fargo earned $10.3 billion, 10 percent less than a year earlier. Its full-year profits before taxes are expected to be 5 percent lower, according to Refinitiv. The bank’s Washington team is trying to shift the conversation to what the bank is doing now for communities and away from the misdeeds of the past. Success could mean fewer negative headlines and a looser regulatory leash. In interviews, Wells Fargo representatives said they had been telling lawmakers what the bank is doing to remedy customer abuses and prevent them from happening again. They also offer up the bank’s expertise on lending and economic trends, tout the number of people Wells Fargo employs in lawmakers’ districts and outline philanthropic programs that appeal to them. For instance, Wells Fargo said it has provided $11.3 million in down payment help to homeowners in Los Angeles, which is represented in part by Democrat Maxine Waters. Waters is positioned to chair the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take control of that chamber in the Nov. 6 mid-term election and has been one of Wells Fargo’s harshest critics in Congress. She has said expanding access to affordable housing would be a top priority as committee chair. Wells also says it has donated over $10 million to various nonprofits in Waters’ district over the last two years. Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has asked Waters for a meeting, her representative said, and bank representatives met with her staff in July. “She looks forward to meeting with him once their schedules align,” said Charla Ouertatani, staff director for Waters on the House Financial Services Committee. The committee plans to revisit Wells Fargo’s treatment of customers and its compliance with consumer protection laws after the election, she said. Wells Fargo also donated $3.3 million last year to nonprofits and schools around Baltimore represented by Democrat Elijah Cummings tipped to chair the House Oversight Committee, if his party wins. “There are many exceptional organizations that are transforming lives in Baltimore and throughout Maryland with limited resources,” Cummings said in a statement. “Whenever Wells Fargo or any company chooses to assist their efforts, I applaud that decision.” If Democrats take control of the House, Waters and Cummings would enjoy broad authority to examine Wells’s business operations, as well as demand bank executives testify on past wrongdoing if they saw fit. Wells Fargo said the bank had also donated $4.5 million to nonprofits across Iowa in 2017, a fact it highlights to the state’s mostly Republican lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee. In total, Wells Fargo has pledged to give away $400 million to charitable causes in 2018, and 2 percent of after-tax profits in following years. That could position it as the top corporate cash donor in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks corporate giving. The bank was the top donor among financial firms in 2017 and the second-largest among corporations. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2QJzGJr) In 2015, prior to the sales scandal, the bank donated $281 million, though Wells credits tax cuts implemented at the start of this year for part of this year’s increase. Even with those good deeds in hand, Wells Fargo will probably remain in the political crosshairs for some time, according to analysts and congressional staff. On Oct. 4, Senate Banking Committee Democrats called for Sloan and Wells Fargo Chair Elizabeth Duke to testify about “widespread and persistent failures at the bank.” Wells Fargo’s plan to cut its workforce by up to 10 percent is also attracting ire from Democrats. The bank has to make up ground with regulators too. Last week, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting told lawmakers he was “not comfortable” with the bank’s efforts to make things right with 600,000 auto loan borrowers. During the hearing, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz characterized the bank as “beyond repair.” Wells’s efforts have been noticed, but the reception has been mixed, according to members of Congress and staff interviewed by Reuters. While some say the bank is taking the right steps on a long path to a repaired reputation, distrust of banks stills runs deep, particularly among Democrats. Some lawmakers, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, have said the bank is still not doing enough to right past wrongs. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wells Fargo has a lot more work to do before lawmakers will take its efforts seriously. “Trust is a tricky thing,” he told Reuters. “And it’s a lot easier to lose it than it is to gain it.”"

-10.832346447273721," Wells Fargo has not done enough to refund cheated drivers: regulator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has not convinced U.S. regulators it is doing enough to repay 600,000 drivers who were wrongly pushed into buying auto insurance, a leading bank regulator said on Tuesday. “We are not comfortable where we are with them,” Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency, said at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. In a statement, the bank declined to comment on Otting’s remarks specifically, but said it was working with regulators to repay drivers. “We regret how this issue has impacted our customers,” the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said in a statement. Otting’s office this summer rejected Wells Fargo’s plan to repay customers who were pushed into unnecessary auto insurance and told the bank it must do more to find and compensate every driver who was hurt, Reuters reported in September. The rejection was the latest setback for Wells Fargo which has been rocked by two years of scandals over its sales practices. In September 2016, the bank paid a $190 million fine after admitting employees had opened perhaps millions of phony customer accounts to hit sales goals. In April, the bank paid a $1 billion fine to U.S. regulators for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses and promised to make sure customers were repaid. Drivers who bought a car with a loan from Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for “forced-place” policies. The bank enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, officials have said. The OCC does not have a deadline for when it must approve the plan, but Wells Fargo cannot finish its work without that all-clear from regulators. Democratic Senator Brian Schatz asked Otting when Wells Fargo customers should expect a refund for the faulty charges. “I don’t have the particular date in front of me,” Otting said, but he said he trusts OCC employees to push the bank to get the job done correctly."

-17.284900205931386," Wells Fargo to cut headcount by 5-10 percent in next three years (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Thursday it would reduce its headcount by about 5 percent to 10 percent within the next three years as part of a turnaround plan. As of June 30th, the nation’s fourth largest bank had roughly 264,500 employees, making a 10 percent reduction representative of about 26,450 jobs. Wells Fargo said the latest reduction would reflect displacements as well as normal team-member attrition. The cuts will help Wells reach its goal of reducing costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to grow profits and recover from a series of scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve’s asset cap. Wells Fargo has also said it will reduce its branch count by about 800 by 2020 and sell non-core businesses to lower costs and become more efficient. Last month the bank laid off 600 employees in its mortgage division which has faced headwinds amid a slowdown in refinancing demand. The layoffs were not a surprise according to Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl and that sentiment was reflected in Wall Street’s muted reaction to the news. The stock rose 0.6 percent to $55.55 during Thursday trading. “Employee related costs are the largest expense so that was likely where the cuts were coming,” he said. Automation also lowers the need for staffing over time.” The bank did not specify which departments or regions would be impacted by the reductions, but it said the cuts will be made to reflect changing consumer preferences as more customers perform banking tasks using self-service technology. “Wells Fargo takes very seriously any change that involves its team members, and as always, we will be thoughtful and transparent, and treat team members with respect,” said Chief Executive Tim Sloan in a statement. Wells Fargo reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit in July as lending activity slowed and the bank said much of the decline had to do with moves to avoid riskier loans. Wells Fargo’s shares rose 0.6 percent to $55.55 in late afternoon trading on Thursday."

-16.09201710953545," Judge blocks U.S. fund's lawsuit against Wells Fargo over 'vol-mageddon' NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Chicago fund manager cannot pursue a lawsuit against a Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N unit over claims the bank cost the fund manager millions by forcing it to sell its holdings during a February market rout, a judge ruled on Tuesday. LJM Partners Ltd, run by Anthony Caine, returned investors’ money after its complex trades failed spectacularly in the Feb. 5 reversal of fortune in U.S. stocks and related markets that some investors called “vol-mageddon.” Funds run by LJM and an affiliate saw losses of 80 percent or more. The fund would not have suffered such extreme losses had Wells Fargo Securities LLC (WFS) not directed it to sell its holdings immediately after initial losses and at depressed prices, LJM said in response to a March lawsuit by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo disputed that it had forced the liquidation. Wells Fargo said it had been required to cover the company’s margin and losses with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. LJM denied those claims and countersued in May. But United States District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said contracts between Wells Fargo and LJM provided “broad authority” for the bank to tell the fund to trade when the market is stressed. “The agreement provides broad authority for WFS to terminate the agreement and direct LJM to liquidate its open positions - even through specific trades,” Forrest wrote.

-16.09201710953545," Exclusive: U.S. regulators reject Wells Fargo's plan to repay customers - sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have rejected Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N plan to repay customers who were pushed into unnecessary auto insurance, telling the bank it must do more to ensure it has found and compensated every affected driver, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Wells Fargo gave regulators the plan in June, as required by a $1 billion settlement the bank reached with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April. After reviewing the plan - which could involve contacting some 600,000 drivers - the OCC told Wells Fargo it needed more assurances that the bank would find and repay everyone who was overcharged, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the rejection. The rejection is the latest wrinkle in Wells Fargo’s long-running sales scandal, which began in September 2016 with revelations that the bank had opened perhaps millions of accounts in customers’ names without permission to hit aggressive sales targets. Since then, Wells has disclosed more customer abuses in businesses including mortgage lending, wealth management and the auto loans at issue here. Representatives for Wells Fargo, the OCC and the CFPB declined to comment. Drivers who bought a car through Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for “forced-place” policies. Wells enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, officials have said. Customers who were charged for unneeded insurance could face overdraft fees, damaged credit or vehicle repossession. As part of its settlement agreement, Wells Fargo had to review several years’ worth of bank and insurance paperwork for those customers. Although Wells Fargo gave regulators details on the number of customers harmed, what financial consequences they suffered and how the bank planned to compensate them, the OCC wants to see work behind the calculations before it will approve the plan, the sources said. The regulator also wants an explanation of how workers are performing day-to-day remediation tasks, they said. The OCC does not have a deadline for when it must approve the plan, but Wells Fargo cannot finish its work without that all-clear from regulators. It is not unusual for banks and regulators to haggle over the fine print of a settlement, and large banks tend to satisfy regulator demands quickly after a large penalty, said the sources and former officials. Last year, Wells Fargo estimated that it would need $64 million to pay back customers but lawyers representing drivers say that estimate is way too low."

The department has sought more information from the bank to see if management pressure prompted the employees to improperly alter or add the information prior to a regulatory deadline, the Journal reported, citing the same people. The Justice Department is interested in learning if there is a pattern of unethical and potentially fraudulent employee behavior tied to management pressure, the WSJ reported. The incident happened in 2017 and early 2018 as Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank’s anti-money-laundering controls, according to a WSJ report in May. The report also said the bank had reported the problem to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the agency was probing the problem. “This .. previously disclosed situation involved a new process and a new required document called Certification of Beneficial Owners that our team members have to complete to help ensure we know our customers.” said Wells Fargo spokesman Alan Elias in an emailed statement, adding that additional training and new procedures had now been applied. “Even though this matter has not negatively impacted our customers, we take all issues relative to documentation seriously. If we get something wrong, we fix it.” Elias said. Wells Fargo, smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, has been a subject of a number of regulatory probes.

The fourth-largest U.S. bank has given 60 days notice to 638 mortgage employees across the country, Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in an emailed statement, with cuts concentrated in Orlando, Florida; Ranch Cordova, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Charlotte, North Carolina. “After carefully evaluating market conditions and consumer needs, we are reducing to better align with current volumes,” Goyda said. Wells Fargo has been making sporadic cuts to its mortgage workforce as part of a bid to rein in costs. These layoffs are the largest so far this year. The home lending business has struggled as rising interest rates hurt refinancing demand. Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking income fell 33 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. The latest cuts were mainly to retail fulfillment and servicing jobs, Goyda said, reflecting a continued slump in application volumes. Analysts have said such moves address overcapacity and will improve the bank’s efficiency. Wells Fargo has vowed to cut $4 billion in costs by 2020 in order to grow profits as it operates under a punitive asset cap levied by the Federal Reserve. The Orlando Sentinel reported the layoffs on Thursday."

-8.206165075387691," Wells Fargo faces tax credit probes, new problems with mortgage borrowers NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is facing government probes into its use of low-income housing tax credits, and has also set aside $8 million to compensate borrowers who were incorrectly denied mortgage modifications under a federal assistance program, the bank said in a regulatory filing on Friday. The new disclosures add to Wells Fargo’s numerous regulatory penalties, private lawsuits and remediation efforts. Most stem from a sales practices scandal that has touched on all of the bank’s major business units. The tax inquiries are being conducted by multiple agencies, which Wells Fargo did not name in its 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They focus on how the bank purchased or negotiated the purchase of the credits in connection with financing of low-income housing developments. Representatives for the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The $8 million accrual is intended for roughly 625 borrowers who should have qualified for a loan modification under a program the Treasury Department set up in 2009 to help Americans who were struggling to make mortgage payments. An error in Wells Fargo’s underwriting tool improperly excluded those borrowers, 400 of whom eventually had their homes foreclosed upon, the bank said. The bank also updated disclosures on issues it has discovered in auto lending, wealth management, fiduciary and custody accounts, foreign exchange trading, mortgage rate-lock extensions, “add-on” products like identity theft protection, and frozen or closed bank accounts."

-6.414676857628149," Wells Fargo to pay $2.09 billion fine over decade-old mortgage loans (Reuters) - Wells Fargo WFC.N has agreed to pay $2.09 billion in penalty to settle claims related to mortgage loans originated in the run-up to the financial crisis. The civil fine is for alleged origination and sale of residential mortgage loans that the lender knew contained misstated income information and did not meet the quality that Wells Fargo represented, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement here on Wednesday. “Today’s agreement holds Wells Fargo responsible for originating and selling tens of thousands of loans that were packaged into securities and subsequently defaulted,” said Alex Tse, acting U.S. attorney in San Francisco. The loans in question included subprime and other relatively risky home loans. “We are pleased to put behind us these legacy issues regarding claims related to residential mortgage-backed securities activities that occurred more than a decade ago,” Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said. The settlement amount was fully accrued as of June 30, the bank said. This is the latest blow to the San Francisco-based bank as it tries to recover from a sales scandal that has hurt its results and tarnished its reputation. In April, the company paid $1 billion in fines to resolve probes into auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses. Since the sales scandal surfaced about two years ago, the bank has overhauled management and replaced John Stumpf as CEO.

-6.414676857628149," Wells Fargo finds efficiency target elusive as revenue slips (Reuters) - With Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N revenue slumping and no clear end in sight for sales scandal-related costs, analysts have pushed back predictions for when the bank's closely watched efficiency ratio will return to pre-scandal levels. The fourth-largest U.S. bank booked hundreds of millions of dollars in fresh customer remediation and rebate costs in the second quarter, fueling worries about lingering scandal-related fallout. Wall Street has been pressuring Wells Fargo to deliver more revenue to the bottom line for over two years. That ramped up once the bank landed in regulatory and reputational trouble over sales practices, and management responded with hard cost-cutting goals. But Wells Fargo has faced more challenges since, with businesses like mortgage lending shrinking and the Federal Reserve imposing an asset cap until the bank proves governance and controls have improved. It is also no longer receiving revenue from some products it missold as recently as last year, like add-on insurance. As a result, analysts say it may take until 2020 for Wells Fargo to get its efficiency ratio within the 55 percent to 59 percent range Chief Executive Tim Sloan has pledged to hit. It has not reported a ratio below 60 percent since September 2016. That metric, which measures the cost of one dollar of revenue, was 66.7 percent at Wells Fargo during the first half of the year. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N efficiency ratio was 57.6 percent. Two-thirds of the analysts who updated estimates since second-quarter results now see the ratio staying at or above 60 percent through 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data. Prior to earnings, the consensus for the ratio was 59.5 percent. “It’s dragging on longer that what people originally expected,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, referencing costs associated with the bank’s past wrongdoings. Sanders did not change estimates much after the second-quarter report but said his models were more conservative than other research houses. Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank in the world by market value, as investors rewarded the company for its perceived profitability and growth potential. But revelations about millions of customers getting locked into unnecessary products has forced investors to rethink how they value the stock, which has lagged rivals since September 2016. (tmsnrt.rs/2M6C0rP) The bank pledged to shut 800 branches by 2020, and has cut 4,600 employees from its payroll since 2016. The efforts are part of Sloan’s goal to slash $4 billion from annual expenses by next year. While executives reiterated that pledge in recent weeks, they have declined to provide a near-term efficiency ratio target. Management initially expected to approach 59 percent by the end of 2018, but said in April actions to comply with the Fed’s consent order would delay progress. Analysts say it could take more than a year to get there, given the business pressures and scandal costs. “It’s not an outrageous target,” said Sanders, of Edward Jones. “They do have lot of levers to pull on in terms of squeezing costs out of the business.”"

-5.1818637194078345," Wells Fargo's loan book shrinks, profit misses estimates (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Friday its loan book shrank and it raked in less fee revenue than a year ago, factors that contributed to lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sent its shares lower. The bank said much of the lending decline had to do with moves to avoid riskier loans, but the second-quarter results ignited fears about lingering reputational damage from Wells Fargo’s phony accounts scandal and other customer abuses. The total average loan balance for the bank shrank 1 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as its consumer loan book fell by 2 percent and commercial real estate lending slowed. Wells Fargo has been running down financial crisis-era mortgage portfolios and dialing back lending in other businesses like autos where it sees too much risk. Its most recent pullback is in commercial real estate lending, where Wells Fargo executives say competition among other lenders has caused a broad decline in underwriting standards. “As it relates to underwriting standards, it’s not all bank-to-bank competition ... the competition here is just broad as it’s ever been,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told analysts, pointing to real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds and other capital sources. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.9 percent in afternoon trading. Analyst pressed Wells Fargo executives on a call to discuss the results about when they could expect to see a turning point. The bank could soon ramp up auto lending again, the executives said, without giving a specific time frame. “I would say that we’re happy that it was sort of stabilized and we’re now viewing the origination path is growing,” Shrewsberry said. The bank’s mortgage business weighed on the income it makes from fees, which fell 8 percent in the quarter to $9 billion. Intensifying price competition for mortgages hurt margins and borrower prepayments cut into servicing fees. The bank also said a program that helps customers avoid overdraft charges dented fee income. Even with loan balances falling, the bank’s net interest income rose 1 percent, helped by higher interest rates. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said on Friday its average core loans rose 7 percent from a year ago. One consequence of Wells Fargo’s slow loan and deposit growth is that the bank does not have to worry about bumping up against a regulator-imposed cap on its balance sheet. The Federal Reserve has ordered Wells Fargo to keep assets below $1.95 trillion until the bank’s governance and controls improve. Total non-interest expenses rose 3 percent to $14 billion, with the bank noting that marketing costs from a rebranding effort to help repair damage to its reputation added to costs. The bank said it also took a $619 million operating loss hit in the quarter for compensating customer harmed by foreign exchange, mortgage, auto lending and wealth management issues. The lender’s expenses per dollar of revenue have remained stubbornly high after the phony accounts scandal erupted in 2016. Wells Fargo has vowed to cut costs by shrinking its branch network, overhauling internal departments, combining certain business areas and other measures. Net income applicable to common stock fell to $4.79 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $5.45 billion, or $1.08 per share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.08 per share, excluding a 10-cent hit from an income tax expense, missing analysts’ estimates of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

Wells Fargo emerged from the 2007-2009 financial crisis with its reputation relatively unscathed compared to some competitors. But since 2016 it has had to grapple with a phony accounts scandal and other customer abuse issues, including in its wealth management business. “The reputational issue is something that we have to work hard to help those team members work through,” Shrewsberry said. Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment management net income slid 37 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, reflecting a $214 million write-down on the sale of its stake in the RockCreek Group. It took a $114 million charge to account for refunds to customers in the unit who had been charged incorrectly for certain assets and accounts.

The SEC on Monday said the payout includes a $4 million civil fine, plus the return of ill-gotten gains and interest, over misconduct by the Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage in its sale of so-called market-linked investments. Wells Fargo was accused of reducing investor returns by encouraging customers to actively trade the investments though they were intended to be held to maturity, and despite an internal policy prohibiting “short-term trading” and “flipping.” The San Francisco-based bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but has taken steps to address sales practices that occurred from January 2009 to June 2013, the SEC said. Wells Fargo said in a statement it has made policy and management changes related to the SEC charges, and is committed to helping customers achieve their investment goals. Wells Fargo has been plagued for nearly two years by scandals over how it treated its customers, including by selling them products they did not need to meet internal sales goals. It has overhauled management and is trying to regain trust, including through an ad campaign saying that Wells Fargo was established in 1852 and “re-established” in 2018.

Wealth brokerage services, which employs brokers who work in bank branches, is in the same section of the bank as the private bank, which employs wealth managers who advise the ultra-rich. During the bank’s investor day conference in March, Jon Weiss, head of wealth and investment management, said Wells Fargo is exploring ways to increase efficiency among the bank’s wealth businesses. Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman Shea Leordeanu wrote in an emailed statement, “No final decisions have been made because that work continues. Whatever the outcome, we will continue to serve our clients across multiple channels – community bank branches, advisor-led branches, FiNet, online and by phone - because our clients expect that from us Wells Fargo.” Weiss is expected to address the plans on Thursday during a town hall-style meeting with brokers. The bank’s plans to restructure were reported earlier on Monday by the Wall Street Journal. The bank had said in March it was examining its wealth and investment management division for possible customer abuse, including overcharging and inappropriate referrals, after inquiries from government agencies."

The bank is planning to combine two large divisions within the business, known internally as wealth brokerage services and private client group, the report on.wsj.com/2MB5WwZ said. Wells Fargo is expected to share some information about the changes this week in an internal memo to some employees, the report said, adding the bank may share more details on Thursday, when Jon Weiss, the head of wealth and investment management unit, is scheduled to host an internal town hall.

0.2737350377432839," Wells Fargo receives final approval to settle $142 million lawsuit (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Friday it received final approval from a district court in California to settle a $142 million class-action lawsuit, which compensates customers affected by a sales scandal related to phony bank accounts. The settlement, in which Wells had received a preliminary approval in July last year, sets aside funds for compensating customers after the bank opened consumer or small business accounts, credit cards or lines of credit without their knowledge between 2002 and April 2017. The United States’ fourth-biggest bank is dealing with the fallout of two years of investigations, agreeing in April to pay $1 billion to settle with regulators who say it forced auto insurance on hundreds of thousands and routinely hit homebuyers with excessive fees. Last month, the bank also agreed to pay $480 million to resolve a securities fraud lawsuit filed with the District Court for the Northern District of California which alleged the bank made certain misstatements and omissions in disclosures related to its sales practices. Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said Friday’s announcement was “a significant step forward in making things right for our customers and restoring trust all of Wells Fargo’s stakeholders.” Customers have until July 7 to claim money. Announcing the settlement with regulators in August, the bank also said that the mortgage and auto programs together ensnared more than 600,000 customers and would require nearly $300 million in refunds. Analysts worry the scandal has hurt Wells Fargo both by distracting executives with investigations and lawsuits, and through its impact on the bank’s public image. In February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed a consent order on Wells that restricted it to grow assets beyond the $1.95 trillion it had at the end of last year “until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.” Sloan, since then, has reassured shareholders numerous times that the bank was stable and “open for business”. Employees have also sought to downplay the scandal’s impact on profitability or market share, and have said that few customers have left the bank. Wells Fargo’s shares were up 0.3 percent at $54.92 on Friday."

1.7503762126685412," Wells Fargo workers push for more board access, so far in vain (Reuters) - A labor-backed group is stepping up pressure on Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N to add an employee to a council that has the ear of the bank's board and management, arguing workers deserve a voice as Wells Fargo works to get past a damaging scandal over sales practices. This raises the sensitive issue of how much of a voice the fourth-largest U.S. bank is prepared to give to its roughly 265,000 workers, some of whom were excessively pressured by managers to sell products to customers, and whose support the bank may need to repair relations with U.S. regulators. Wells Fargo has not definitively answered the requests from the union-backed Committee for Better Banks for a worker representative to be added to Wells Fargo’s recently formed Stakeholder Advisory Council. The committee, which also includes consumer and community advocates, first made the request privately to management last June and repeated it in a May 29 letter seen by Reuters. The May letter, sent to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan, called for another meeting with management and the committee says it has so far gone unanswered. At Wells Fargo’s annual shareholder meeting in April, Sloan said the idea of adding a worker to the council was “a fair one” but also highlighted other efforts to connect with employees. The council’s current members include consumer and community groups such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which earlier this year persuaded Wells Fargo to undertake a review of its governance and risk management lapses. Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said the stakeholder council reviews employee feedback and noted other worker-outreach initiatives such as internal message boards. He declined to comment on whether the bank was working on adding an employee to the council. Cornelius Hurley, a Boston University law professor, said it makes sense for a stakeholder council to have a workers' representative but bank leaders might be shy of union ties at the CBB. The group is backed by community, consumer and labor groups including the Communications Workers of America and has called for changes at other banks including the U.S. operations of Spain's Banco Santander SAN.MC. “Bankers go apoplectic when you talk about organized labor,” he said. Erin Mahoney, an organizer for the CBB and the Communications Workers of America labor union, said the lack of a worker on the council stands out considering the other reforms put in place by bank leaders over the past year, under pressure from regulators. “I’d have to agree that so far it has been a missed opportunity,” she said. The bank named its stakeholder council in late 2017 to advise on a range of topics as it works to improve oversight and governance to show that it has rooted out any customer abuses. Its scandals erupted in 2016 after employee whistleblowers helped reveal customer abuses involving workers opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets. That led to hefty fines and a cap on assets until the bank proves to U.S. regulators its governance has improved. The stakeholder council meets with Wells Fargo’s management and board, which is chaired by Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor who once headed the U.S. central bank’s consumer and community affairs committee. The bank has already taken other steps aimed at rebuilding the trust of employees and, in turn, investors, including eliminating product sales goals for retail workers, granting stock and raising wages. Sloan said last fall the bank had hired back nearly 2,000 workers who quit or were fired. At the same time Wells Fargo is under investor pressure to improve expenses per dollar of revenue. One of the CBB’s requests is for all Wells Fargo employees to be paid at least $20 an hour, up from a base wage of $15 an hour. No Wells Fargo employees are labor union members. Just 46,000, or 1.1 percent, of U.S. finance workers were union members, Labor Department statistics for 2017 show, the lowest percentage of any U.S. industry workforce. Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo bankruptcy specialist in the Minneapolis area and a CBB member, said several dozen colleagues got in touch after he raised the group’s issues with Sloan at the April meeting. “I think for organized labor to survive, it needs to start looking to organize people in un-organized sectors,” Ross said. A seat at the council would let workers speak without fear of manager retaliation, he said. However, bank leaders could be wary of giving workers more influence as a digital banking push changes its workforce needs, said Ben Bystrom, instructor at the Shidler College of Business in Hawaii. Some members of the stakeholder council said they would be open to the idea of adding a worker. “Mr. Sloan seemed amenable. I hope it will happen soon,” said member Nora Nash, who is also director of Corporate Social Responsibility for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia."
8.956680878505285," Wells Fargo pulls back from U.S. Midwest, selling 52 branches to Flagstar (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is pulling back from retail banking in the U.S. Midwest, selling all of its branches in three states, as the bank embarks on a broader review of branch profitability across the country. Flagstar Bancorp Inc FBC.N said on Tuesday it would acquire 52 Wells Fargo branches in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin for an undisclosed amount. The branches have about $2.3 billion in deposits and $130 million in loans. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank by assets in the United States, will no longer have a retail presence in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio once the deal closes, spokeswoman Bridget Braxton said. It will continue to operate 48 branches in Wisconsin, as well as its commercial banking, wealth management, and retail brokerage business across the region. The transaction is part of a strategy management laid out at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo’s investor day last month, involving the sale or closure of 800 branches by 2020. The bank is working to make its operation more efficient and profitable in response to investor demands while also tackling legal and regulatory issues stemming from a sales scandal that erupted from its retail banking business in 2016. Wells Fargo is targeting branches with slower-than-expected loan or deposit growth, as well as regions where it does not have enough market share to be competitive. For instance, its portion of deposits in Indiana’s Allen County, which includes Fort Wayne, fell to 29 percent in 2017 from 35 percent in 2016. “We simply don’t have a major retail banking presence in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and parts of Wisconsin,” Braxton said. “The prospect for growth in markets where we don’t have retail banking density drove this decision.” Troy, Michigan-based Flagstar views the branches a little differently. Its news release on the deal highlighted that the branches it is acquiring have No. 1 market share position in Fort Wayne, as well as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and that the deal will double its customer base and provide an important source of liquidity. “This was an opportunity not to be missed, not only to change our balance sheet, but to fundamentally change who we are,” Flagstar Chief Executive Officer Alessandro DiNello said on a call with analysts. As Wells Fargo proceeds with the branch review, it may not be difficult to find other regional or community banks eager to buy branches for growth. The Flagstar deal comes just weeks after Fifth Third Bancorp FITB.O said it would buy MB Financial Inc MBFI.O for $4.7 billion to expand its presence in Chicago."
8.58899180662763," Wells Fargo CFO says sales practices review 'virtually complete' (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N finance chief said on Wednesday that the bank's review process to root out possible sales practices issues was ""virtually complete"" and the lender has shared everything material it knows with investors. “I don’t think at this point that there’s anything meaningful that we aren’t already talking about,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told an investor conference. Shareholders and analysts have been looking for signs the fourth-biggest U.S. lender by assets will be able to put a wide-ranging sales practices scandal that erupted in 2016 firmly behind it. Overall, while the bank has not seen a lot of attrition when it comes to established customers, “we haven’t sold or deepened relationships as rapidly as we thought we would in terms of a recovery,” Shrewsberry said. Shrewsberry also said commercial loan demand was not shaping up to where he would have expected for 2018, despite the broad business optimism that has followed last year’s U.S. tax code overhaul."

7.369574125622584," JPMorgan poaches Wells Fargo banker for entertainment group - sources (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has hired Reginald Lang, the head of media investment banking at Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, to work for its entertainment industries group, which provides financing to TV and film studios, people familiar with the matter said. The group, which is part of JPMorgan’s commercial banking arm, does not finance individual TV and movie projects. Instead, it provides corporate financing that producers can use to fund budgets, refinance debt or splash out on mergers and acquisitions. Lang, a managing director in Wells Fargo’s New York office, will relocate to Los Angeles and report to the head of JPMorgan’s entertainment industries group, David Shaheen, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of an official announcement. JPMorgan could announce the new hire as early as Monday in an internal memo, according to one of the sources. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Lang all declined to comment. The move marks a return to JPMorgan for Lang, who left the New York-based bank in 2006 to join Wachovia, a bank subsequently acquired by Wells Fargo, according to his LinkedIn page. JPMorgan has a market share of more than 90 percent in the provision of senior debt financing to entertainment production companies, according to its website. It started financing Hollywood movies in the silent film era of the 1920s. JPMorgan's corporate clients in the entertainment industry include Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGFa.N, Legendary Pictures, which is now owned by China's Dalian Wanda, Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners, Village Roadshow Ltd and Entertainment One Ltd ETO.L."
7.391744805403169," Fed to put Wells Fargo remediation plan to public board vote: letter WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve board will hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on scandal-hit Wells Fargo following pressure from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts lawmaker said on Friday. The Fed’s policy shift could make it tougher for Wells Fargo to shake off the unprecedented sanctions that the bank said on Thursday are expected to crimp earnings by around $100 million. In February, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practices scandals. The regulator previously said Fed staff would assess the adequacy of the bank’s remediation plan, which would also be reviewed by an independent third party. During a congressional hearing in March and in a follow-up letter, however, Senator Warren pressed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to submit the bank’s remediation plan to a board vote and to consider publishing the third-party review. On May 10th, Powell wrote to Warren that he accepted the request for a board vote. “After further consideration, the decision about terminating the asset growth restriction will be made by a vote of the Board of Governors,” Powell wrote in the letter published by Warren’s office on Friday. He added that when the third-party review is ready, “we will review that report to determine whether and to what extent the report can be publicly disclosed.” The Fed declined to comment on Friday beyond Powell’s letter. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment on the Fed’s decision. On Thursday, Wells Fargo told investors the cap would hurt earnings less than it thought this year. The bank previously expected the asset cap to hit after-tax net income by up to $400 million, but lower deposit and loan growth gave it room under the limit and caused it to cut that figure to less than $100 million, Treasurer Neal Blinde said. The bank said in financial filings that it had received detailed feedback from the Fed regarding its remediation plan. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback, Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank was planning to operate under the cap for the first part of 2019. “I’m glad the Fed’s Board of Governors changed course,” Warren said in a statement. “The Fed must strictly enforce its order to show Wells Fargo that it means business.”"
6.998734144901627," Wells Fargo trims expected hit from regulatory cap on assets BOSTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Thursday said a cap on the bank’s growth imposed by regulators after sales practices scandals would hurt earnings less than it thought this year, and forecast 2019 expenses below Wall Street expectations. Analysts were upbeat about the expense outlook, financial targets and lessened fallout from the regulatory restrictions, though Wells Fargo said that reflected slower loan and deposit growth. But some had hoped for more revenue details at the bank’s annual investor day. “While we expect the market to view this financial outlook favorably, (portfolio managers) keep on telling us they need to see the negative headlines abate ... and revenue growth to return,” Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note. Wells Fargo is under Federal Reserve orders to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until governance and controls improve. Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank, now the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, is making plans to operate under that limit for the first part of 2019. He acknowledged the bank previously had not executed so well on compliance and risk oversight, but pushed back on the idea that it has a lot more work to do and said some news headlines were getting “tiresome.” “I think we’re through most of the historical review,” Sloan said during a question-and-answer period at the daylong meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was webcast. The bank previously expected the asset cap to hit after-tax net income by up to $400 million, but lower deposit and loan growth gave it room under the limit and caused it to cut that figure to less than $100 million, Treasurer Neal Blinde said. Well Fargo said net interest income, or the difference in what it pays for deposits and what it earns on loans, will be relatively flat in 2018 as lower earning assets and higher deposit costs offset higher interest rates. The bank’s shares closed at $54.65 on Thursday, up 1.7 percent. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said the bank would not provide updated guidance on its efficiency ratio. Investors and analysts have watched for improvements in that key measure of costs per dollar of revenue since the sales scandal erupted in 2016. Shrewsberry said under one scenario for 2020 it is possible the bank would have expenses of $50 billion to $51 billion, and revenue consistent with 2017 results, but cautioned that was not a formal projection. Under questioning from analysts he declined to offer more specific revenue forecasts, citing the many variables at play. Noninterest expenses for 2019 would total $52 billion to $53 billion excluding litigation and remediation items, the bank said, compared to analyst expectations of $53.2 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Barclays analyst Goldberg noted that two profitability targets Wells Fargo gave on Thursday roughly met his expectations: a two-year return on equity of 12 percent to 15 percent and two-year return on average tangible common equity of 14 percent to 17 percent. Perry Pelos, who leads Wells Fargo’s wholesale business, said it remains the primary bank of about 11 percent of U.S. middle-market companies. While the bank’s issues have prompted client questions, Pelos said, “by and large they have hung with us.”"

14.144350354566212," Fund says Wells Fargo unit worsened 'vol-mageddon' losses -court filing (Reuters) - A Chicago fund manager that suffered catastrophic losses in a market plunge this year has blamed the actions of its broker, a Wells Fargo & Co unit, according to court documents filed on Wednesday. The allegations were spelled out in response to a March lawsuit by Wells Fargo Securities against fund manager LJM Partners Ltd. The response to the Wells Fargo Securities lawsuit is LJM’s first detailed public explanation of why it was one of the biggest casualties of February’s “vol-mageddon,” the volatility-linked collapse of investments that had profited in calmer markets. LJM funds posted losses after the Cboe Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of price swings expected in the S&P 500 stock index, logged its biggest-ever single-day jump on Feb. 5. But LJM’s losses only became permanent the next day, the fund’s lawyers said in a counter-claim filed in federal court in Manhattan. By the end of the two days LJM Partners and an affiliate had lost 80 percent or more of their value. Wells Fargo Securities forced LJM to unwind its portfolio in “a series of catastrophic trades that locked in the portfolio’s primarily unrealized losses and made them real,” LJM said in the filing. LJM lost $266 million across its funds, “at least $115 million more than if LJM had been allowed to apply its trading procedures,” the counter-claim said. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said in a statement: “We will defend ourselves and strongly disagree with LJM’s claims.” LJM founder Anthony Caine said in a letter to clients in February that working with its clearing broker, LJM “agreed that liquidation across all client accounts, regardless of clearing broker, was the most prudent action given market volatility and portfolio risks.” Wells Fargo Securities has asked the court to help it retrieve $16.4 million, saying the brokerage covered LJM’s margin and losses with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Wells Fargo previously declined to comment on Caine’s account. LJM, which along with the affiliate managed more than $1 billion earlier this year, has not answered questions since the company and the affiliate reported their funds’ losses. LJM later told clients it would return what was left of their money. In Wednesday’s filing, LJM’s lawyers denied an earlier claim by Wells Fargo that the fund company is now likely to be insolvent. Investors are suing Caine and Anish Parvataneni, a portfolio manager at LJM who previously worked for fund investor Ken Griffin’s Citadel, over what they said was inadequate disclosure about the risks of LJM’s investment approach."

11.958326114105652," Wells Fargo investors back leaders despite protests DES MOINES, Iowa/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N investors gave strong backing to the bank's directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating they are ready to give its revamped leadership time to rebuild from scandal despite a noisy annual shareholder meeting. Wells Fargo executives said each of the bank’s 12 director nominees received more than about 89 percent support from investors and about 92 percent of shares were cast in favor of the pay of Chief Executive Tim Sloan and other leaders. The figures amounted to a relatively strong outcome, especially when compared with last year. At the bank’s 2017 meeting in Florida, the first since the sales scandal drew sustained national attention, only three of the board’s 12 directors received more than 90 percent of shareholders’ support and then-Chairman Stephen Sanger received just 56 percent approval. On average, S&P 500 directors usually get around 92 percent, and pay is backed by around 89 percent of votes cast, according to pay consultant Semler Brossy. The results signal investors are giving the new board members and other changes a chance, said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor and corporate governance expert. “The company has made a lot of dramatic moves, and shareholders seem to be saying they appreciate it and are going to wait to see if they are successful,” Fisch said. Though occasionally confronted by protesters and skeptics, Sloan and bank Chair Elizabeth Duke mostly stayed on their message of atonement during the 2-1/2 hour meeting. They faced tough questioners on topics including environmental issues and their business with firearms makers at a time when other banks have reviewed or cut back on those relationships. But they received loud applause a number of times from the audience of several hundred in the Des Moines Marriott hotel ballroom. When California State Treasurer John Chiang rose to challenge Sloan’s pay, Duke responded that “I disagree with your analysis of it. Tim’s time with the company is an advantage,” a comment that received louder applause than Chiang received. Speaking before the meeting, individual investor Cherie Mortice of Des Moines said she voted for Sloan and other directors, saying it was worth giving the bank a chance to recover. “I think he’s kind of hoping to restore trust. I’m really hopeful,” she said. None of three shareholder measures on the bank’s proxy received a majority of support, bank executives said. The event came days after Wells Fargo said it would pay regulators $1 billion to settle matters related to mortgage and auto lending abuses. About 100 protesters marched into the lobby of the hotel before the meeting, holding signs for various causes. In 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp. The Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells Fargo to halt growth until governance and controls improve. Wells Fargo, though based in San Francisco, has held the meeting in other locations in recent years. Tuesday’s meeting at moments laid bare divisions in Iowa over one of the state’s largest private employers. State leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, a Republican, spoke to welcome executives. Others questioned whether Sloan and others were right for the task of reform. “If I ran my farm the way Wells Fargo ran their business, I’d be kicked out of Marshall County. I’d be a failure,” said one speaker, who identified himself as a retired Iowa farmer. Wells Fargo’s home mortgage and home equity businesses have about 14,500 workers in and around Des Moines.

11.958326114105652," Breakingviews - Wells Fargo shareholders give CEO welcome respite NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wells Fargo shareholders have given Chief Executive Tim Sloan a welcome respite. Owners overwhelmingly backed executive pay and directors at the $256 billion bank’s at times ill-tempered annual meeting on Tuesday. It’s Sloan’s first good news after a slew of regulatory hits, including last week’s $1 billion fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The San Francisco-based bank took the event on the road this year, to Des Moines, Iowa. A number of its critics tagged along, haranguing Sloan and Chair Betsy Duke on a whole host of issues. A grandmother who said she had been shot by a rubber bullet while protesting the Keystone pipeline attacked them for financing it. Sloan also had a testy exchange with a teacher protesting Wells’s role in financing companies that manufacture and sell assault rifles. And Californian State Treasurer John Chiang got in a couple of zingers to help his bid to become the Golden State’s governor this year. “Mr. Sloan is not draining the swamp,” he said. “He has become it.” It was enough to briefly raise the possibility that Sloan might lose a vote at the two-and-a-half-hour meeting. But the ballots went his way, as did several other moments. Chief among these was Duke’s rebuttal to Chiang’s broadside. It drew some of the loudest applause of the day. Duke deserves his thanks not just for that, but for her help since she was tapped to lead the board last summer. Since then, the former Federal Reserve governor has sounded out investors holding more than a third of the bank’s stock, helped revamp the board – including taking the blame on Tuesday for some of its shortcomings - and spearheading the creation of a stakeholder advisory council. Two of its members took the board to task at the meeting, albeit politely. They chided the bank for not being regarded as a leader on issues like guns and livable wages. Standing out on such concerns, under the guise of corporate citizenship, is one of several targets Sloan has set for fixing Wells’s culture. He has also pledged to improve customer service, employee engagement and risk management. Achieving these goals, as well as improving the top and bottom lines, will be no easy task."

11.958326114105652," In Des Moines, Wells Fargo looks to soothe critics IOWA CITY, Iowa, April 24 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co executives planned to convey a message of atonement to shareholders at the bank’s annual meeting in Des Moines, Iowa on Tuesday as it works to convince investors and regulators a sweeping sales scandal is a thing of the past. The event comes days after Wells Fargo said it would pay regulators $1 billion over mortgage and auto lending abuses, adding to issues prompting calls for more shakeups at the third-largest U.S. bank. “Our top priority remains rebuilding the trust of our shareholders, customers, team members, communities, and regulators,” Chief Executive Tim Sloan wrote in a letter introducing the bank’s proxy statement. The letter was also signed by Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor named chair of Wells Fargo’s board last year in a broader overhaul. The bank has already agreed to publish a business standards review, prompting shareholders led by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia to withdraw a shareholder resolution that demanded details on the cultural and ethical causes of recent scandals. In 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp. Regulatory issues have persisted, with the Fed in February capping its growth until governance and controls improve. There are some signs investors will show patience on Tuesday. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis recommended investors cast non-binding votes in favor of the pay of executives including Sloan, who received a package worth $17.6 million last year. Both advisers also backed Sloan and nearly all other candidates standing for 12 seats on the board, including eight new independent directors since 2015. The only exception was Glass Lewis’ recommended vote against John Baker, a director since 2009. ISS termed its recommendations for certain incumbent nominees “cautionary support.” Wells Fargo will hear from critics as well in Des Moines. California State Treasurer John Chiang on Monday reiterated his call for the departure of Sloan and said Baker should be replaced if he could not answer for the bank’s lapses. A spokesman for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees retirement funds, said the system voted against Sloan, Duke and four other directors, and against the pay of top executives. DiNapoli has also sponsored a shareholder resolution calling for a report on the risks pay incentives pose to the bank. The fund has about 14 million shares of the bank, less than a third of one percent of shares outstanding. Internally, Sloan’s pay has also drawn criticism from some company employees ahead of the shareholder meeting. The No. 3 U.S. lender by assets has announced plans to grant about 50 shares of stock to most of its roughly 265,000 employees over two years, in theory giving them more of a voice on bank decisions. A spokeswoman said the award level “was deemed meaningful as we hope our team members will feel a sense of ownership in the progress we need to make, together.” Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco but has staged annual meetings elsewhere in recent years, including in Florida, Arizona and St. Louis. Its home mortgage and home equity businesses are based in Des Moines and it has about 14,500 workers in and around the city.

11.075239242860665," Wells Fargo CEO's pay details spark pushback by some employees WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N disclosure of how its chief executive's pay compares to the rest of its workforce has drawn criticism from some company employees ahead of the scandal-plagued bank's annual shareholder meeting. More than a dozen employees made posts criticizing pay details the bank released in March, according to comments on an internal communications website seen by Reuters. Separately, a worker advocacy group said it plans to raise pay issues on Tuesday at the shareholder meeting in Des Moines, Iowa. Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan earned $17.6 million for 2017, according to its proxy filing, an estimated 291 times the median of the annual total compensation of all the bank’s workers. It is easy for Sloan to be optimistic about the future of the bank considering he is collecting a raise “on an already enormous salary,” wrote Vernes Rasidkadic, who left a job at Wells Fargo in Omaha, Nebraska, shortly after posting comments in mid-March. Rasidkadic told Reuters he stands by his posted comments. After several days, Wells Fargo closed the notice board to new posts, writing that some comments do not comply with company policies, according to the internal discussion. A company spokeswoman confirmed the discussion had been closed. When asked about the postings on Friday, a Wells Fargo official said the bank values constructive feedback. “We will continue to invite team member participation and encourage dialogue,” said spokeswoman Diana Rodriguez. The bank in 2016 admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts for customers in order to hit sales targets, which led to the departure of its previous CEO. Sloan did not collect a cash bonus in 2016 and in 2017, although his total compensation for 2017 was 35 percent higher than for 2016. Wells Fargo's CEO pay ratio was higher than Bank of America Corp's BAC.N but lower than JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, according to data U.S. public companies must report starting this year. Those lenders have different business mixes and Wells Fargo skews more than some toward lower-paid retail workers. Wells Fargo raised its minimum hourly wage to $15 an hour in March, an 11-percent hike for about 36,000 workers, it announced in December on the heels of the U.S. tax code overhaul. The Committee for Better Banks, a group that includes labor unions and consumer and community advocacy groups, is calling for the bank to raise that wage again to $20. A representative for the group said Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo employee and activist with Better Banks, plans to comment on pay at the shareholder meeting and say that a raise would in turn help the bank’s mission of rebuilding community trust following the scandal. On Friday, the bank said it agreed to pay U.S. regulators $1 billion to settle probes into customer abuses in auto lending and mortgages. A review of bank pay by executive compensation data firm Equilar shows Sloan earned roughly 20 percent less than Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group GS.N paid their leaders for 2017. Among top Wells Fargo shareholders, representatives for Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N did not respond to questions on how it planned to vote its roughly 9-percent stake in the bank. A representative for the second-largest investor, Vanguard Group Inc, with a roughly 7-percent stake, declined to comment on its votes at the bank. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommend investors cast non-binding advisory votes in favor of the compensation of Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives."
8.13300815309371," Wells Fargo agrees to pay $1 billion to settle customer abuses (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay $1 billion to settle with U.S. regulators who say the bank wrongly layered insurance on hundreds of thousands of drivers and routinely hit homebuyers with excessive fees, officials said on Friday. The penalty was a record from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and comes more than eighteen months after Wells Fargo admitted it opened sham accounts for customers - a practice that likely ensnared millions. Wells Fargo said the settlement lowers its first-quarter 2018 net income by 16 cents per share to 96 cents per share. It had flagged a possible settlement when it reported earnings last week and said then it may need to restate results. The penalty is the first by Mick Mulvaney, whom U.S. President Donald Trump tapped in November as interim head of the CFPB, and fulfills Trump’s vow to come down hard on the country’s third-largest lender. Mulvaney has worked to dial back the reach of the independent agency, and Reuters has reported the CFPB has dropped cases against at least two payday lenders. “We will enforce the law,” Mulvaney said in a statement about the Wells Fargo deal. “That is what we did here.” While the fine will sting Wells Fargo, regulators did offer the bank some relief in the settlement. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a sister regulator to the CFPB dropped Wells Fargo’s designation as “troubled” which will make it easier for departing employees to collect payouts. Wells Fargo workers have not been able to collect all their severance without a blessing from regulators ever since a 2016 consent order regarding the phony accounts. That check was meant to block bonuses for executives who played a part in scandal. But running those checks has taxed OCC staff and delayed payouts for some workers. Under the agreement, the OCC will still not be able to hire new executives without a sign-off from regulators. Wells Fargo agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing. “While we have more work to do, these orders affirm that we share the same priorities with our regulators and that we are committed to working with them,” Wells Fargo president and chief executive Timothy J. Sloan said in a statement. Taken together, the mortgage and auto programs ensnared more than 600,000 customers and will require nearly $300 million in refunds, the bank has said. The programs allowed Wells Fargo to earn fees from unneeded car insurance and penalties on mortgage paperwork that the bank had botched. For homebuyers, Wells Fargo promised to “rate lock” or freeze the interest rate for borrowers who got their mortgage paperwork finished within a few weeks. When that deadline slipped and it was the bank’s fault, Wells Fargo could blame the customer. The penalty for late mortgage paperwork often topped $1000, according to a borrower lawsuit. Drivers stung by insurance fees were wrongly pushed into policies that they did not need. Drivers must carry auto insurance but the bank has a right to “force place” a policy on borrowers who let coverage lapse. Insurers working for Wells Fargo pushed policies onto more than 500,000 customers who already had coverage, the bank has said. In July, Wells Fargo blamed a third-party vendor for wrongly layering insurance policies on its auto borrowers. Wells Fargo did not explain that it received payouts when those policies were written."

The settlement is the most aggressive move by regulators during the Trump administration to punish a major bank and follows revelations that the United States’ third-largest lender had opened millions of sham retail accounts that customers did not want.

12.687063030670165," Wells Fargo loses steam in commercial lending as rivals pounce NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s two biggest competitors have been nabbing market share in lending to commercial and industrial customers in the American heartland, a sign of how difficult it has become for the scandal-tarnished bank to defend its position against rivals. Earnings reports in recent days showed Wells Fargo’s book of C&I loans in the United States down 1 percent, on average, during the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s gained 5 percent and Bank of America Corp’s was 4 percent higher. Although the banks define C&I loans somewhat differently, their reports track government data showing Wells falling behind over the past five years from a near-tie with Bank of America and losing ground to JPMorgan. (GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2qDp7Na) Those two banks attributed gains to opening offices and adding bankers in smaller cities around the country, a strategy Wells Fargo has embraced for decades. But as Wells struggles to recover from a sales scandal that has touched customers in businesses ranges from deposits, credit cards, mortgages and auto lending to wealth management, it has become harder for the bank to maintain its competitive edge. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said as much on Friday when an analyst asked whether Wells Fargo is losing any customers because of negative headlines. “We have to compete a little bit harder,” he said, noting that rivals have been trying harder to steal business during Wells Fargo’s time of vulnerability. Asked by Reuters about the decline in C&I lending specifically, Shrewsberry said that while Wells Fargo competes aggressively on pricing, it has been stricter about loan structures than other banks. For example, Wells might give a borrower a lower interest rate but would not offer a bigger loan or extend the duration or relax loan terms. Since 2010, JPMorgan has opened 52 new commercial lending offices, including in San Francisco, where Wells is based, as well as in Silicon Valley’s Palo Alto, Omaha, Nebraska, and Memphis, Tennessee. It has also hired as many as 100 commercial bankers each year, many of whom cater to companies with annual revenue of just $20 million to $500 million. Using a similar strategy, Bank of America has hired some 400 commercial bankers in recent years. Banks tend to forge long-lasting bonds with C&I borrowers that can lead to additional work, such as managing cash, handling payments, issuing corporate credit cards, raising money in capital markets and even advising on acquisitions. That makes Wells Fargo’s market share decline particularly troubling, said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. “If you are winning the C&I piece, you are deepening the relationship, which is good for revenue growth,” he said. The market share shift represents a change in fortune for Wells, which came through the 2007-2009 financial crisis strong enough to acquire a failing rival and avoid many of the embarrassing scandals that plagued other big banks. That changed in September 2016, when Wells reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over opening what turned out to be as many as 3.5 million phony customer accounts to hit sales targets. Since then, the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets has discovered several other problems and now faces another regulatory penalty of $1 billion. Executives have downplayed the scandal’s impact on profitability or market share, saying Wells is “open for business,” and that few customers have left. But analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe the scandal is starting to hurt Wells Fargo’s competitive edge, either because customers are displeased or because executives are too distracted by lawsuits, regulatory probes and organizational changes to run the bank as well as they otherwise would. “Obviously, management has been focused on the issues around the sales practices,” said Allen Tischler, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service who has tracked the lost market share. Nonetheless, Wells’ CFO Shrewsberry was optimistic about the outlook for C&I lending, which he expects to grow this year as commercial borrowers take on more leverage for expansion plans. Speaking about Wells Fargo’s balance sheet more broadly, he said areas with sharp declines, like auto and home equity loans, are where the bank has purposefully pulled back because of credit concerns. “Our loan portfolio is getting safer and safer,” he said, “and it’s smaller.”"
