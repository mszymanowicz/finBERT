-4.362261055692395," Home Depot reaches $17.5 million settlement over 2014 data breach (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc, the largest U.S. home improvement retailer, on Tuesday reached a $17.5 million settlement to resolve a multistate probe into a 2014 data breach where hackers accessed payment card data belonging to 40 million customers. The settlement with 46 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., stemmed from a breach between April 10, 2014, and Sept. 13, 2014, affecting customers who used self-checkout terminals at its U.S. and Canadian stores. Hackers used a vendor’s user name and password to infiltrate Home Depot’s network, and deployed custom-built malware to access customers’ payment card information. The Atlanta-based retailer previously said at least 52 million people also had their email addresses exposed, partially overlapping those whose payment card data was compromised. Home Depot did not admit liability in agreeing to the settlement, which requires that it hire a chief information security officer, and upgrade its security procedures and training. The probe was led by Connecticut, Illinois and Texas. Companies that collect sensitive personal information from customers “have an obligation to protect that information from unlawful use or disclosure,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “Home Depot failed to take those precautions.” In a statement, Home Depot said security is a top priority, and that it has since 2014 “invested heavily to further secure our systems. We’re glad to put this matter behind us.” Home Depot had previously recorded $198 million of pretax expenses for the breach, and resolved litigation by customers, card issuers and banks that claimed they were harmed."

3.6634377232252184," Home Depot boosts staff pay by $1 billion after uninterrupted sales surge (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N said on Tuesday it will spend about $1 billion more on employees' wages annually as the home improvement chain benefits from a sustained surge in demand for tools and building materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Home Depot’s blue-chip stock, up 28% this year, fell 2.5% in early trading, despite the company beating quarterly sales and profit estimates. Demand for home improvement products have remained elevated since coronavirus lockdowns started in March, as Americans spending more time at home due to limited options for travel or leisure activities use their discretionary income on minor home remodeling and repair work. The heavy activity has, however, also led Home Depot to spend $1.7 billion in temporary pay and benefits for staff working through the health crisis. The company said on Tuesday it will change some of those benefits to permanent wage increases for frontline hourly employees. A strengthening U.S. housing market, owed in part to record low mortgage rates, also encouraged customers to invest more in their homes, Home Depot said, signaling strong sales in the holiday season. Business has been unaffected by spiking virus cases, the company said, a day after it agreed to buy HD Supply Holdings HDS.O in a deal valued at about $8 billion. The company posted a 24.1% rise in same-store sales for the third quarter ended Nov. 1, beating analysts’ average estimate of a 14.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Home Depot earned $3.18 per share on net sales of $33.54 billion, while analysts had expected a profit of $3.06 per share on net sales of $32.04 billion."

The top U.S. home improvement chain said it would offer $56 in cash for each share of HD Supply, a near 25% premium to the stock’s last close. HD Supply’s shares jumped 24.5% on the news. With the deal, Home depot is looking to expand its reach into building utility and maintenance products, betting that the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic will force swathes of Americans to look for affordable housing. “With a bolstered sales force and enhanced supply chain, we have no doubt Home Depot will be a more formidable player in the$55 billion maintenance, repair and operations market for years to come,” Jefferies analysts wrote. Home Depot, which sold HD Supply in 2007 for $8.5 billion to Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, said it will fund the buy back through a combination of cash and debt. HD Supply, one of the largest distributors of appliances, plumbing, and electrical equipment in North America with over 500,000 customers, is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2021, Home Depot said.

The company also posted a 34.2% rise in quarterly same-store sales, beating analysts’ estimates for a 13.2% increase, and said the sales momentum was carrying into August, although it would likely taper off in later months. With a large base of do-it-yourself customers, Lowe’s has been among the chief beneficiaries of people undertaking minor home repair, painting or gardening work during the crisis. That helped the company's same-store sales far outpace those of larger rival Home Depot Inc HD.N, which relies more on demand from handymen and professional contractors, whose businesses have only recently started to pick up. Wedbush Securities analysts estimate that nearly 75% of Lowe’s sales come from DIY customers, compared with about 55% for Home Depot.

-3.712531491373254," The pandemic bull market: S&P 500 closes at record high NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, rebounding from huge losses triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and crowning one of the most dramatic recoveries in the index’s history. Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis. The S&P record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Street’s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23. It has surged about 55% since then. That makes the bear market that started in late February the S&P 500’s shortest in its history. Since the March 23 closing low, the S&P posted the largest gain in a 103-day period in 87 years, according to Refinitiv data. Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday’s session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from Home Depot and Walmart limiting gains. The S&P 500 flirted with all-time highs for several sessions before finally hitting a new record, raising questions about whether this run of gains could last. “The S&P 500 has been impressive and has created a lot of wealth, but I am not sure that reflects the overall health of the economy,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. “The rally has more to do with asset inflation, which is fueled by all the liquidity and all the continued support in the economy as well as the weakening dollar,” he added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.84 points, or 0.24%, to 27,778.07, the S&P 500 gained 7.79 points, or 0.23%, to 3,389.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.12 points, or 0.73%, to 11,210.84. Amazon, which rose 4.1%, was the largest gainer in the S&P 500. Meanwhile Nasdaq clocked its 18th record closing high since early June, when it confirmed its recovery from the coronavirus sell-off. Tuesday’s record was its 34th record close so far this year compared with 31 record closing highs in 2019 and 29 in 2018. Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index. Home Depot Inc reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least two decades, however, its shares fell 1.1% to $285 after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak.

The company’s same-store sales jumped 23.4% in the second quarter, surging past analysts’ average estimate of a 10.5% rise, as the home improvement chain emerged as one of the corporate winners during the pandemic. Shares of Home Depot, however, fell about 1% in morning trading after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak. “These are record comparable sales - it’s really tough to sustain that,” Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said. “We will see a slowdown in the back half of the year - the question is the degree to which the slowdown occurs.” The company said it could not determine whether strong demand from earlier months would continue for the rest of the year, despite the U.S. housing market performing better than the broader economy. People spending more time on do-it-yourself home projects such as painting and gardening pushed Home Depot’s overall sales up 23.4% to a record $38.05 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 2. That resulted in the company’s highest ever profit sharing payout to its hourly employees. The company spent about $480 million in additional benefits, including weekly bonuses and overtime, to compensate workers required to work in stores and warehouses amid the health crisis.

-4.972628600868335," Lowe's seen gaining on Home Depot in lockdown DIY boom (Reuters) - Lowe's Co Inc LOW.N is expected to edge past rival Home Depot HD.N with what could be its biggest growth in quarterly same-store sales in at least a decade, benefiting from its exposure to customers ready to splurge on do-it-yourself home renovations. Sellers of paint, tools and gardening equipment have been among the winners since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as people take up more repair and remodeling projects themselves while hunkered down at home. But business for handymen, carpenters or professional contractors, who tend to shop more at Home Depot, has slowed. Lowe’s is expected to post same-store sales growth of 11.7% when its reports its May-July quarter results, while Home Depot, scheduled to report on Tuesday, is expected to post a 10.2% rise. “Lowe’s should outperform Home Depot handily,” Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said, estimating that about 75% of Lowe’s total sales come from DIY customers, compared with about 55% for Home Depot. Still, both have continued to invest in pulling in high-spending building contractors, as U.S. homebuilding jumps amid rising demand for housing in suburban and rural areas. The rush to the suburbs, as more companies allow work-from-home, has been a boost for Lowe’s, which has a majority of its stores located in those areas. Graphic: Interactive graphic on foot traffic here Graphic: Interactive graphic on same-stores sales here Analysts say Lowe’s has also better targeted young home owners through a millennial-focused marketing campaign, which features interior designer Bobby Berk from the hit Netflix show “Queer Eye”. To be sure, Lowe’s is a long way from overtaking its rival in total revenue or profit. “We’re expecting Lowe’s to beat estimates, but the one challenge they have against Home Depot is their margins. Their sales are coming through, but they need better margins to compete,” said Jim Boothe, chief investment officer of Brentview Investment Management, which holds a stake in Lowe’s."

The home improvement chain’s shares rose as much as 8% in premarket trading after it reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least 15 years, but comments on the retailer’s outlook from Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison quickly chilled investor optimism. “This is, without question, the most challenging environment that any of us have ever worked in. And when we look at what the customers are buying and we look at the sustainability of it, we don’t see what occurred in Q1 (to continue),” Ellison said in a call with analysts. Sales at Lowe's and rival Home Depot HD.N both surged in April as shelter-in-place orders gave people more time to spend on minor remodeling and repair work around their houses. Ellison said it was difficult to predict what would happen in the coming months, but anticipates those sales to start moderating at some point later this quarter and through the second half of the year. His comments come a day after data showed U.S. homebuilding dropped by the most on record in April, feeding fears that the crisis would lead to the deepest economic contraction since the Great Depression. Lowe’s net earnings rose 27.8% to $1.34 billion in the quarter ended May 1, mainly driven by sales in rural area stores and online. Excluding items, it earned $1.77 per share, beating estimates of $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Same-store sales jumped 11.2%, while analysts were expecting only a 3.4% increase. The surge was the highest since at least April 2005. The company shares were last up about 2%."

Shares of Home Depot, which have gained 12.4% this year, dropped nearly 3%, as the company also scrapped its full-year outlook, citing uncertainties stemming from the pandemic. While shelter-in-place restrictions and government stimulus checks boosted Home Depot’s sales in the first quarter, with people spending more on tools for do-it-yourself house projects, analysts say a looming recession will weigh on home improvement spending later in the year. U.S. homebuilding dropped by the most on record in April and permits for future construction tumbled, underlining fears that the crisis would lead to the deepest economic contraction since the Great Depression. “Home Depot is showing that it should weather the COVID-19 pandemic better than most retailers ... That said, we are concerned about the expected deterioration of the U.S. economy, rapidly rising unemployment, and declining consumer confidence,” Telsey Advisory Group analysts wrote in a post-earnings note. Total net sales rose 7.1% to $28.26 billion, beating the average estimate of $27.54 billion, despite the company cutting operating hours and limiting the number of customers allowed in stores to maintain social distancing. The risks posed to staff working through the crisis led the company to provide additional bonuses, double overtime pay and add more hours of paid time-off. The lockdowns also sent online traffic on Home Depot’s website above Black Friday levels, the company said, adding that its e-commerce sales soared by triple-digits at the end of April.

Home Depot also scrapped its full-year outlook. The company’s net earnings fell to $2.25 billion, or $2.08 per share, in the first quarter ended May 3, from $2.51 billion, or $2.27 per share, a year earlier, as it spent heavily to compensate its store employees working during the health crisis.

16.854207209220505," DIY guards Home Depot, Lowe's against pandemic troubles (Reuters) - With U.S. home improvement chains on course to buck the trend among brick and mortar retailers of falling sales, results this week will show Americans invested in their homes while under lockdown, but at a cost to retailers forced to adapt stores and sell in different ways. Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Cos Inc are both expected to report their best sales in at least a year of about a 3% to 4% increase for the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Data from analytics firm Placer.ai also shows that foot traffic at Home Depot stores only dropped 0.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, while Lowe’s actually increased by 9.1%. As a result, they are among the very few companies in corporate America yet to suspend dividends or pull their full year forecasts, with analysts predicting steady business growth even after the boost in March. “Home is becoming an area that customers are disproportionately investing into, and I would expect that to persist for a while,” online furniture retailer Wayfair’s Chief Executive Officer Niraj Shah said earlier this month, helping to send shares in his own company up 35%. Analysts do worry it may have cost Lowe’s and Home Depot relatively heavily to keep stores open, adapt layouts and service generally lower margin purchases as homebuilding comes to a standstill. Telsey Advisory analyst Joseph Feldman said he cut his estimates for the two home chains due to concerns over lower annual sales and higher expenses related to temporary wage hikes for frontline workers, cleaning and deliveries. He added, however, that both had proven “resilient”. The first quarter also saw both chains, like major grocers, gain from consumer stockpiling and from being able to keep their stores open during countrywide lockdowns. Pacer.ai data shows the trend is showing no signs of slowing, with certain days in May having more visits than during 2019’s Black Friday. Shares in Home Depot are now trading at about 23 times expected earnings and those of Lowe’s at about 19 times expected earnings and both stocks have risen nearly 9% so far this month, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which is down about 2%. “Ultimately, we expect trends to slow, just not sure by how much,” Credit Suisse’s Seth Sigman said. “We would be looking for a clearer sense on big ticket, regional and customer dispersion and anything on pull forward.”"

3.749707842488028," Lowe's sales fall short of estimates as Home Depot extends lead (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales on Wednesday as it failed to make the most of the strongest U.S. home building market since 2006 unlike larger rival Home Depot Inc HD.N. The company’s disappointing sales come as it focuses more on shoring up its profit margins by shutting underperforming stores. In contrast, Home Depot has been investing heavily in its online operations to boost market share in an expanding U.S. economy. U.S. homebuilding fell less than expected in January, following three straight monthly increases and was still at levels last seen in December 2006. Building permits soared to a near 13-year high pointing to sustained housing market strength. Lowe’s same-store sales rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, below expectations of a 3.6% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Same-store sales at Home Depot jumped 5.2% in the same period. Wedbush analyst Seth Basham said Home Depot’s sales figures raised expectations for Lowe’s, which was likely still facing issues in pulling traffic to its stores. Lowe’s net sales rose 2.4% to $16.03 billion in the quarter, but missed analysts’ estimates of $16.15 billion. Still, a more than 26% fall in total expenses helped Lowe’s beat profit expectations and temper a dour annual earnings outlook. Net earnings came in at $509 million, compared with a loss of $824 million a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of its Canadian operations. The company reported an adjusted profit of 94 cents per share, above estimates of 91 cents. Lowe’s said it expects adjusted fiscal 2020 earnings of $6.45 to $6.65 per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $6.67 per share. The company also forecast 2020 total sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, largely below estimates of a 2.9% increase. Shares of the Mooresville, North Carolina-based home improvement chain were largely flat in trading before the bell."

2.831872305910023," Housing market strength underpins Home Depot's holiday-quarter results (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N benefited from a solid U.S. housing market and higher job growth that led consumers to spend more at its stores in the holiday shopping quarter, helping the home improvement chain beat sales and profit estimates. Shares of the company, considered a barometer for the economic health of U.S. households, rose 3.1% to $247 in premarket trading. The U.S. housing market has gained from the lowest mortgage rates in more than three years after the Federal Reserve lowered borrowing costs thrice in 2019. Sales of existing homes, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 9.6% on a year-on-year basis in January, the National Association of Realtors said last week. “Our fourth quarter results reflect strength in our core business, solid execution around our holiday events and the overall health of the consumer,” said Home Depot Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear. Same-store sales at Home Depot rose 5.2% in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, above expectations of a 4.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The strong rise in sales also indicates that investments in the marriage of Home Depot’s online and brick-and-mortar businesses is staring to pay off, boding well for this fiscal year, Jefferies analysts wrote. Three months ago, the company said the initiative, called “One Home Depot”, has not generated the revenue it had expected, prompting the retailer to cut its sales forecast last year. Net sales fell 2.7% to $25.78 billion, but beat analysts’ average expectation of $25.76 billion. Net earnings rose to $2.48 billion, or $2.28 per share, from $2.34 billion, or $2.09 per share a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.10 per share.

-10.95575247940591," Mexican union suspends strike threat against Home Depot MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A top Mexican trade union said on Monday it has suspended its threat to launch a strike at Home Depot stores across Mexico over labor demands, adding it is in talks with the U.S. home improvement chain to improve pay and benefits for workers. The Revolutionary Confederation of Laborers and Farmworkers, or CROC, is pressing for a 20% pay raise, benefits such as 20 annual vacation days and more contributions toward transportation, school supplies, food and savings funds. Home Depot has about 6,200 workers under the union’s contracts, according to CROC, out of a total of 16,000 Home Depot employees across 125 stores in Mexico. The negotiation process is being overseen by local labor councils, said CROC spokesman Eduardo Miranda. “If there is no agreement between the parties, they establish a day and time to launch the strike,” he said. The demands for Home Depot, where CROC has 40 collective contracts in 18 Mexican states, in part grew out of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which includes strict labor protections. The trade pact was approved by the U.S. Senate last week, and will now go to President Donald Trump for him to sign into law. Home Depot did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It previously told Reuters it was committed to complying with the law."
-11.034371906229335," Mexico union threatens Home Depot strike, inspired by USMCA trade deal MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Spurred on by labor protections in the new North American trade deal, a top Mexican trade union has accused Home Depot HD.N of blocking union activity and threatened strikes next week if the U.S. home improvement chain does not improve pay and benefits for workers. The Revolutionary Confederation of Laborers and Farmworkers, or CROC, is pressing for a 20% raise, benefits such as 20 annual vacation days and more contributions toward transportation, school supplies, food and savings funds. The union also is urging the company to end discrimination, sexual harassment and unfair dismissals, which it says have been reported to the union and labor councils. “We called for a strike due to worker rights violations and to review the collective labor contract,” CROC Secretary General Isaias Gonzalez told Reuters. Home Depot has about 6,200 workers under the union’s contracts, according to CROC. Gonzalez said the demands were similar to those CROC put to retailer Walmart de Mexico last March before the government passed a reform designed to guarantee workers’ rights and end decades of cozy relationships between unions and companies that yielded so-called protection contracts. Walmart WMT.N and CROC reached a deal to avert strikes. The demands for Home Depot, where CROC has 40 collective contracts in 18 states, grew out of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Gonzalez said. The trade pact was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives only after Mexico stepped up commitments to enforce its labor laws. “Now is the time to act, because we now have the new labor law, we have USMCA, and we can’t be held to the terms of companies that resist,” Gonzalez said. “They’re used to protection contracts. But that ended with the new labor law.” The USMCA has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Senate. When asked about CROC’s demands, Home Depot said it was not the only company adapting to Mexico’s labor law. “This stems from the ongoing changes coming from the new labor reform standards, which are not specific to The Home Depot,” said Home Depot spokeswoman Sara Gorman. “We’re committed to doing the right thing, taking care of our associates and complying with the law, which we’ve done since our arrival in Mexico in 2001.” Home Depot has about 16,000 employees across 125 stores in Mexico. Some workers in recent days have displayed large banners emblazoned with CROC’s arguments at store entrances."
-9.514658414950867," Wall Street posts modest gain as Fed signals rates to hold for some time (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main stock indexes ended modestly higher on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and signaled that borrowing costs are likely to remain unchanged indefinitely. The U.S. central bank said moderate economic growth and low unemployment are expected to continue through next year’s presidential election. After cutting rates three times earlier this year, the Fed left its benchmark rate at the target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%, a decision that was widely expected. “You are looking at a cautiously optimistic Fed,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. “The tone that you see through the statement and projections suggest that they believe that they have taken out enough insurance to prevent a downturn.” The Fed’s move to ease monetary policy this year has supported the rise in stocks to record highs; the S&P 500 has gained 25% so far in 2019. With the Fed expected to stand pat on rates this time, investors have been more focused on U.S.-China trade relations, including new tariffs on Chinese goods. President Donald Trump has said the new tariffs will go into effect on Dec. 15, but uncertainty remains over whether they will be implemented. “There was really nothing to take away from the narrative which has taken the stock market higher, which is the Fed has lowered rates three times this year. So we are in a pretty good interest rate environment to hopefully help the growth rate,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. “The focus will be back on trade here after today.” Fed policymakers said they would continue monitoring “global developments” in deciding whether interest rates need to change. They also said they would keep an eye on “muted inflation pressures,” a reflection of concern that the pace of price increases has failed to hit the central bank’s target. Data on Wednesday did show U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 29.37 points, or 0.11%, to 27,911.09, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.1 points, or 0.29%, to 3,141.62, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 37.87 points, or 0.44%, to 8,654.05.

1.0916701991381037," Home Depot says peak investments to pressure 2020 margins (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N, the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain, on Wednesday forecast 2020 sales below Wall Street expectations and said major investments in its online overhaul program would pressure margins next year. Company executives at an investor and analyst conference said 2020 is expected to be a peak year of investments for its $11 billion “One Home Depot” program, which was first announced in 2017 to better integrate its online operations with stores. The company’s total investment in the growth initiative in 2020 will be $3.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018. “After 2020, this level of investment will decrease and benefits from our investment should increase,” Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said. The company also said inventory theft was expected to weigh on margins next year. Chief Executive Craig Menear told investors the uptick in theft may have something to do with the opioid crisis, according to a transcript of the meeting. To keep shoppers away from smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N and online options, Home Depot has been adding automated lockers in its stores for shoppers who want to pick up their orders rather than wait for them to be delivered. “Lowe’s is actually starting to get back on the top of their game and so, we think the days of Home Depot gaining market share is going to be more difficult,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at brokerage Edward Jones. Home Depot has worked to shorten delivery time and develop a more user-friendly website. Last month, it said the One Home Depot strategy was not yet generating as much revenue as it had expected, prompting it to cut its 2019 sales forecast for the second time. “There is more work to do to unlock the full value of One Home Depot experience,” Menear said. “We were perhaps a bit ambitious with regards to the speed with which the benefits would be seen in 2019.” The company forecast preliminary fiscal 2020 comparable sales and total sales growth of about 3.5% to 4%. Analysts on average had expected sales growth of 4.3%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Home Depot also said it expects operating margin of about 14% in fiscal 2020, below a target of about 14.4% to 15% it set in 2017. Shares of the company ended down nearly 2% at $212. They are up about 26% this year."

12.539569222367023," Lowe's calms nerves with profit forecast raise after Home Depot sales warning (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday, helping ease concerns over the health of the U.S. consumer after larger rival Home Depot Inc HD.N cut its full-year sales estimates ahead of the all-important holiday season. Shares of Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s rose 5.8% to $119.94 in premarket trading and were set to hit a record high after open. Fewer discounts lifted Lowe’s profit margins in the third quarter, while an increased assortment of industrial products like drills and power saws attracted more high-spending builders and handymen. Building contractors, plumbers and electricians are becoming increasingly more important to Lowe’s and Home Depot as they look beyond their core do-it-yourself customers to new sources of revenue. Lowe’s retained its full-year revenue and comparable sales forecasts, in contrast to Home Depot, and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said a solid macroeconomic backdrop was boosting U.S. home improvement stores. Home Depot on Tuesday also reported disappointing quarterly sales, saying the integration of its online and brick-and-mortar businesses was not yet generating as much revenue as expected. “It’s a relief that Lowe’s wasn’t as bad as some people may have expected given what happened with Home Depot yesterday,” Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics, told Reuters. Perkins added that investors were also upbeat about Ellison’s initiatives gaining traction. In line with Ellison’s plan to improve profitability, Lowe’s will close 34 underperforming stores and reorganize its corporate structure in Canada. The company has already shed its retail operations in Mexico and is cutting back on slow-moving inventory as part of Ellison’s restructuring program. Fewer discounts on its top-selling items helped boost Lowe’s operating margin to 8.96% in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, up from 5.50% a year earlier. But that also pushed more customers to look for deals at Home Depot during the quarter, according to a research by Jefferies analysts. In October, for instance, Home Depot had about 7% of its products on sale, compared to just 1% at Lowe’s, according to the brokerage. That hit Lowe’s same-store sales, which rose 2.2% but missed analysts’ estimate of a 3.1% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share, beating estimates of $1.35. Lowe’s raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $5.63 to $5.70 per share, from $5.45 to $5.65 earlier."

Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index’s 0.79% drop weighing the most. Expectations of a U.S.-China trade deal and a largely better-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings season have fueled a Wall Street rally over the past few weeks, with the S&P 500 setting new records almost every day. “Markets have probably risen a little too far ... so it is no surprise that we are seeing some pause here,” Frederick said. Market participants are, however, worried that an ongoing U.S. impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump would weigh on efforts to end the prolonged trade war. At 1:05 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 112.12 points, or 0.40%, at 27,924.10, while the S&P 500 was down 2.89 points, or 0.09%, at 3,119.14.

8.562057543924746," Home Depot cuts sales goal as online push not delivering as expected (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N said on Tuesday the marriage of its online and brick-and-mortar businesses was not yet generating as much revenue as it had expected, prompting the retailer to cut its 2019 sales forecast for the second time this year. Shares of the largest U.S. home improvement chain, which have risen nearly 40% this year, fell 4.5% to $228 in premarket trading. To keep customers away from smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N, Home Depot invested heavily in its online business, primarily by adding automated lockers in stores for shoppers who want to pick up their orders rather than wait for them to be delivered. The service, known as “click and collect”, aims to draw in consumers who are generally wary of ordering expensive building materials or appliances without in-store advice on their installation and use. Home Depot has also worked on its supply network to shorten delivery times and developed a more user-friendly website, under a program called “One Home Depot”, first announced in December 2017. At the time, Home Depot said the initiatives were aimed at increasing its sales by up to 6% to $120 billion by 2020, while still keeping its operating margins “flattish.” “We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said in a statement. Home Depot said it expected its fiscal 2019 sales to rise about 1.8%, compared to a prior forecast of a 2.3% increase. The new forecast implies revenue of $110.15 billion. “This report could suggest that Lowe’s is having a good time going after Home Depot’s dominance,” OANDA Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said. Lowe’s is due to report its third quarter results on Wednesday. The company had previously cut its full year sales forecast in August due to falling lumber prices as well as the anticipated impact new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would have on consumer demand. Same-store sales at Home Depot rose 3.6% in the third quarter ended Nov. 3, below expectations of a 4.7% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Home Depot’s weak results also pulled shares of Lowe’s down nearly 3% in premarket trading. Net income fell to $2.77 billion, or $2.53 per share in the third quarter from $2.87 billion, or $2.51 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.52 per share."

-0.2384105841182446," Lowe's shares jump as higher-spending customers drive profit beat (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N shares surged over 11% on Wednesday as the home improvement chain's efforts to focus on higher-spending customers helped it beat quarterly profit estimates and gain ground on larger rival Home Depot Inc HD.N. Like Home Depot, Lowe’s has been chasing plumbers, builders and carpenters who spend more than its core “do-it-yourself” shoppers, by stocking up on higher-end industrial products such as drills and power saws. Home Depot also beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday buoyed by sales of big-ticket items, but warned that the U.S.-China trade drama would impact consumer demand and cut its full-year sales forecast. Lowe’s said the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on some Chinese imports set to take effect from Sept. 1 was baked in its full-year earnings forecast of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, which the company reaffirmed on Wednesday. Lowe’s has also modified certain sections in stores dedicating them specifically to higher-spending customers with staff, billing and parking facilities. Changes in its supply-chain and a new merchandising team have helped keep in-demand products in stock for longer. Lowe’s total average bill amount rose 3.2% to $77.97 in the quarter. “Under Ellison, retail basics such as in-stocks, merchandising and customer service are all being improved,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail said. Marvin Ellison, who was the chief executive officer of J.C. Penney Co Inc JCP.N before taking the top job at Lowe's last year, has made these changes with his sights squarely set on closing the gap with Home Depot, the United States' largest home improvement chain. Lowe’s same-store sales growth outpaced Home Depot in the country for the second straight quarter, something that helped push the company’s shares higher, according to Stifel analyst John Baugh. For an interactive graphic on Lowe's U.S. same-store sales compared to Home Depot over the last three years, click here: (tmsnrt.rs/2Z7N02W) However, Lowe’s overall quarterly net sales of $20.99 billion, hurt by a drop in revenue from Canadian stores, was still about $10 billion shy of Home Depot’s figure. Lowe’s executives added rising home prices were leading consumers to spend on renovations and upgrades to their existing homes, rather than investing in new properties, benefiting home improvement chains. The company’s same-store sale rose 2.3% in the second quarter ended Aug. 2, above expectations of a 1.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned $2.15 per share, beating estimates of $2.01."
2.376407231809232," US STOCKS-Wall St slips after three days of gains; Home Depot rises (For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Home Depot rises after profit beat * Medtronic gains on FY forecast raise * Lower oil prices weigh on energy stocks * Benchmark U.S. Treasury yield slips, pressures banks * Indexes down: Dow 0.17%, S&P 0.25%, Nasdaq 0.11% (Updates to early afternoon) Aug 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes edged lower on Tuesday after three sessions of gains, as lower Treasury yields weighed on financial stocks, offsetting a boost from Home Depot’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings. After a stormy start to the month on worsening trade tensions, the three main indexes have rebounded sharply, erasing most of their losses from a steep selloff last week on rising hopes of global monetary stimulus. The benchmark S&P 500 is now about 3.8% below its all-time high hit in July. It had fallen as much as 7% from its record last week. “Markets have been extremely strong over the past few days, so there is a little bit of profit taking,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager with Hodges Funds in Dallas. Losses on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 indexes were tempered by a 4.4% rise in Home Depot Inc, which also drove a 0.32% gain in the consumer discretionary index . “Home Depot’s earnings show that people are continuing to invest in their homes, a positive for Wall Street and the U.S. consumer,” Bradshaw said. U.S. Treasury yields slipped on rising prospects of interest rate cuts as well as political woes in Italy and Britain’s tumultuous exit from the European Union. Bank stocks were under pressure as their profits are typically squeezed in a lower interest rate environment. The S&P 500 banks index slipped 1.05%, while the broader financial sector fell 0.76% All eyes this week will be on Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting and Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole central bankers’ conference. Powell’s remarks will be closely monitored for hints if more policy easing is in store, against the backdrop of an ongoing trade war and growing fears of recession, signaled by the inversion of the U.S. yield curve last week. At 12:34 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 45.11 points, or 0.17%, at 26,090.68 and the S&P 500 was down 7.30 points, or 0.25%, at 2,916.35. The Nasdaq Composite was down 9.08 points, or 0.11%, at 7,993.73. Shares of Netflix Inc were the biggest drag on the S&P 500, losing 3% after Walt Disney Co announced its streaming service would launch in Canada and the Netherlands on November. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were trading lower. The energy sector lost 0.59%, weighed by lower oil prices. Medtronic Plc gained 4.5%, and was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, after the medical device maker raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.28-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 29 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 40 new highs and 61 new lows.

2.376407231809232," Home Depot beats quarterly profit estimates, warns of tariff impact (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday as it sold more big-ticket items to high-spending builders and handymen, while flagging the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's ongoing trade tussle with China on consumers. The home improvement chain, which has distanced itself from co-founder Bernie Marcus’ support for Trump’s re-election campaign, blamed the impact of the trade dispute as well as a continued slump in lumber prices for a cut in its full-year sales forecast. Still, the company’s shares were up 4.4% at $217.11 by midday as investors shrugged off the warning, which analysts said was largely expected. The United States’ proposed tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of goods have sent jitters through Wall Street, with companies warning that prices for U.S. shoppers could rise, potentially hurting demand. Home Depot estimated the proposed 10% levies, currently scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, along with the 25% tariffs already in effect, could raise its cost of sales by $2 billion - about 2% of its annual sales. “We will work with each of our suppliers in negotiating that tariff cost, and my suspicion is, at the end of the day, it won’t be quite that much,” outgoing Chief Financial officer Carol Tome told Reuters. Wall Street analysts said the impact from the latest round of tariffs on earnings is more likely to come from a hit to consumer demand rather than an increase in expenses. “A tariff is a tax and not knowing how the consumer is going to react to that is probably prudent given the environment we’re in right now,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. “It’s more of the impact on Home Depot’s consumer spending than expenses.” Home Depot said it now expects 2019 sales to rise about 2.3%, down from a prior forecast of a 3.3% increase. However, the company recorded a bigger-than-expected profit in the second quarter, selling more products to professional customers such as electricians, plumbers and builders who typically make larger, more frequent purchases. The Atlanta-based chain, which is looking to broaden its business beyond its core “do-it-yourself” customers, said its average bill amount rose 1.7% to $67.3 in the reported quarter. Lumber prices, however, continue to weigh on the company’s sales as roughly 8% of its revenue comes from sales of the commodity. Lumber futures LBc1 have fallen about 16% since their 2019 highs in early February as land and labor shortages have constrained builders' ability to construct new houses, creating a supply glut for the key building material. That prompted Home Depot to cut its full-year same-store sales growth forecast as well to 4% from 5%. Home Depot’s net sales rose 1.2% to $30.84 billion in the second quarter ended Aug. 4, marginally missing analysts’ average estimate of $30.98 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It posted a profit of $3.17 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $3.08 per share."

15.928925001381455," Home Depot same-store sales disappoint, warns of tariff impact (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc on Tuesday blamed wet weather in February and a slump in lumber prices for its slowest growth in quarterly same-store sales in at least three years, while warning of a $1 billion impact from new tariffs on Chinese imports. Bad weather along with land and labor shortages have constrained builders’ ability to construct new houses especially in the low-price segment, creating a supply glut for lumber, a key building material. Home Depot said weak lumber prices hurt its first-quarter sales growth by $200 million and if prices do not improve for the rest of its fiscal year, it could dent overall sales by as much as another $600 million. Lumber futures have fallen 28.6% since their 2019 highs in early February. The commodity made up nearly 8% of Home Depot’s sales in the last fiscal year. The unfavorable weather also led contractors to delay housing projects and prevented the company’s do-it-yourself customers from working outdoors, further impacting demand for Home Depot’s products in February. Same-store sales at the home improvement chain rose 2.5% in the quarter ended May 5, but missed expectations of a 4.2% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Still, Home Depot marginally beat overall net sales estimates as it services like credit lines and equipment rentals to rope in more big and frequent spending clients such as electricians, plumbers and builders. In a conference call with analysts, Edward Decker, executive vice president of merchandising, said Washington’s latest round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would raise annual cost of goods sold by about $1 billion. The company said it has already seen a $1 billion impact from U.S. tariffs enacted in 2018. The impact, however, is manageable, Decker said, as it was less than 1% of total annual sales. In the last fiscal year, the company’s net sales was $108.2 billion. “We haven’t worked through what we will do if the cost increase comes to us,” outgoing Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé told Reuters, when asked if the company would raise its product prices. “Sometimes when we have cost increases, we pass it through in retail prices, sometimes we don’t.” The company’s net income rose to $2.51 billion, or $2.27 per share, and beat analyst average estimate of $2.18 per share. Net sales rose 5.7% to $26.38 billion, beating expectations of $26.36 billion."

5.066888177202547," Lowe's predicts more home renovations this year after strong profit (Reuters) - U.S. home improvement chain Lowe’s beat Wall Street earnings forecasts on Wednesday, and predicted that more Americans would renovate their houses this year rather than buy a home in a market where prices are rising. Lowe’s shares rose 1.1 percent after the results, which followed a weak earnings forecast from larger rival Home Depot on Tuesday. Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said the home improvement industry should continue to benefit from higher incomes, lower federal tax rates and rising house prices. “As home prices are increasing, consumers are staying in their homes longer and because of their improved financial position, they are investing in their homes,” Ellison said on a conference call with analysts. While Home Depot makes the bulk of its sales from contractors who bill more, Lowe’s sells a wide range of do-it-yourself projects mainly to individual home owners. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based company is now trying to serve more contractors, and on Wednesday it said results in that business have been positive. Since Ellison took over in July, Lowe’s has hired thousands of software workers and opened fulfillment centers to boost online sales, while also trying to improve the in-store experience. “We’re simply servicing an existing customer better, and we’re becoming a second, if not a first option, for customers that literally stopped shopping us because we didn’t have adequate inventory levels,” Ellison said. Lowe’s U.S. comparable-store sales rose 2.4 percent during the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, with growth of 5.8 percent in January. “We like the direction (Lowe’s is) headed,” said Eric Grasse, a vice president at Dillon & Associates which owns shares in both Lowe’s and Home Depot. Meanwhile, Lowe’s comparable-store sales declined in Canada, where the company now runs less than 300 outlets after closing dozens of unprofitable stores. “We anticipate weakness in the Canadian housing market, which is exerting pressure on our outlook for that business over the near term,” Ellison said, adding he was confident of Lowe’s long-term potential in Canada. Overall comparable-store sales rose 1.7 percent, but missed analysts’ average estimate of a 2.03 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company reported a loss in the fourth quarter due to the impact of restructuring expenses but excluding one-time items, Lowe’s earned 80 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates by 1 cent."
2.483476139831983," 'Cold, snowy, wet': Home Depot suffers as winter hits house makeovers (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly sales on Tuesday, as a snowy winter prevented many Americans from remodeling home exteriors in a housing market that is slowing on the back of high prices. Shares of the largest U.S. home improvement retailer fell 3 percent, with losses limited by the promise of $15 billion in share buybacks and a 32 percent boost to its dividend. Separately, official data on Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts hitting a two-year low in December on falling construction of both single and multi-family housing, a significant source of revenue for Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe’s. Home Depot said cold weather during December and January hit sales in the three months to Feb. 3. “It was cold, it was snowy, and perhaps worst of all, it was wet,” Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call with analysts. Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome added that the company had not expected such a wet winter. “Sometimes, weather-driven demand can help sales growth, sometimes hurt,” Tome said. Fourth-quarter sales at U.S. Home Depot outlets open at least for a year rose only 3.7 percent, lagging Wall Street analysts’ forecasts of a 4.5 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The Atlanta-headquartered retailer also projected full-year earnings below estimates, forecasting $10.03 per share, against expectations of $10.26. The projections come as Home Depot invests billions of dollars in bolstering its e-commerce operations and store infrastructure as it battles Lowe’s and online stores including Amazon.com Inc. Investors were “unimpressed” by the Home Depot’s outlook, said GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders. “There are definitely some concerns that Home Depot’s business will come under more pressure as the economy and housing market slow down,” he said. Still, Home Depot’s forecast of a 5 percent rise in full-year same-store sales beat expectations of a 4.45 percent increase. Overall fourth-quarter sales of $26.49 billion missed Wall Street estimates but showed an 11 percent growth from a year earlier. Shares in Lowe’s, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Wednesday, fell 0.4 percent in morning trade."

5.886582027898928," Home Depot signals U.S. housing demand slowing (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N, the biggest U.S. home improvement chain, suggested on Tuesday that the pace of U.S. home sales was slowing, and said impending trade tariffs could force it to raise prices on some products. The warning from the country’s top seller of power tools, flooring and lawnmowers overshadowed its stronger-than-expected third-quarter results and a higher annual sales forecast. The company’s shares fell nearly 4 percent on Tuesday morning, but recovered most of their losses to trade marginally down later in the session. After years of a steady recovery from the U.S. housing market meltdown in 2008, there are signs that housing demand is slowing as mortgage rates climb higher, hurting purchasing power. Many large homebuilders including D.R. Horton DHI.N and Lennar LEN.N have already warned of slowing home sales, as the companies also face supply constraints. “(The housing market) has recovered a lot from the financial crisis, but not all the way,” Home Depot Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé said in an interview, blaming the lack of supply of homes. “The steepness of the recovery is going to slow as we reach full recovery,” she said. On a conference call with analysts, Tomé said home starts and home price increases were “moderating” but other drivers of home improvement spending supported Home Depot’s higher sales and earnings outlook for fiscal year 2018. The Atlanta-based retailer now expects sales to rise 7.2 percent in the year ending January, compared with an earlier forecast of 7 percent growth. It raised its earnings forecast to $9.75 per share from $9.42. Sales at U.S. Home Depot stores open for more than a year surged 5.4 percent during the third quarter ended Oct. 28, above analysts’ expectations of a 4.38 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “The solid top-line proves a laser-focus on home sales doesn’t paint the entire picture of home improvement demand,” Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said in a note. Costs from tariffs on Chinese imports — expected to rise to 25 percent from next year — is also likely to lead to some product price hikes, Home Depot said. The company said potential higher tariffs could impact 3.5 percent of the goods it sources from outside the United States, up from 1 percent currently. Home Depot’s third-quarter net earnings rose 32.4 percent to $2.87 billion, or $2.51 per share. That beat analysts’ average estimate of $2.26 per share. Net sales overall climbed 5.1 percent to $26.30 billion and also exceeded analysts’ forecasts."

2.917247773052027," Lowe's shuts 51 stores in U.S. and Canada (Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe's Companies Inc LOW.N announced the closure of another 51 underperforming stores in the United States and Canada on Monday as it strives to compete with rival Home Depot Inc HD.N in a slowing housing market. Lowe’s gave no detail of job losses in the move, which closes stores in some upmarket areas including Broadway and Chelsea in Manhattan and follows the shutdown of 99 Orchard Supply stores in California. Buffetted in recent quarters by the impact of a long winter in North America, Lowe’s has been striving to find ways to catch up with the long-time sector leader Home Depot, whose stores on average generate almost twice as much in sales. There are also signs that Americans are spending less on housing as prices and demand peak after a seven-year homebuilding spree, although many of the factors underlying the industry’s health remain in place. “The decision was informed by the strategic reassessment work we have been doing over the last few months ... We plan to continue to evaluate all businesses and elements of our portfolio annually,” the company told Reuters. While Lowe’s is far smaller and less exposed to the presence of Amazon and other online sellers, the closures follow a wave of similar moves by traditional U.S. retailers in the face of greater online competition. New Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison began a restructuring after taking over in July and has said he was reviewing its real estate portfolio, promising to remove slow-selling products and end unsuccessful ventures. Under Ellison, the company has also eliminated four senior positions, while creating two new senior roles for stores and supply chain. “New blood in the upper ranks was clearly a catalyst for this decision, as we believe there is a greater willingness on behalf of the leadership team to examine the root causes of underperformance,” Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski, said in a note. The wind down of the Orchard Supply chain cost the company between $390 million and $475 million in write-downs. Lowe’s said Monday’s announcement would result in charges of 28 cents per share to 34 cents per share or $300 million to $365 million in pre-tax expenses. The company, which operates about 1,800 U.S. stores and 300 in Canada, said it expects the closures to be completed by February, with the exception of some U.S. stores that are closing immediately. The 20 U.S. closures are spread across states including New York, Texas and California, with 31 locations including two plants in a handful of Canadian provinces also shutting. The majority of the impacted U.S. stores are located within 10 miles of another store. Shares in the company were flat."
-6.358291329320517," Home Depot second-quarter sales bounce back, results top estimates (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc's HD.N profit and revenue topped estimates on Tuesday despite signs of a slowdown in the housing market, boosted by a rebound in demand for seasonal products and as shoppers spent more to remodel their homes. The No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain also raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year. Consumers are investing in their homes, even as higher mortgage rates and rising real estate prices have hurt home sales this summer. Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low in June and data for the prior month was revised sharply lower, the latest indication the housing market was slowing down. “The (company’s) sales strength is likely to garner the most attention as we sense there had been some fear recently that the overall macro picture had been slowing down,” Stifel analyst John Baugh said in a note. Home Depot Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear sought to allay those concerns, saying the U.S. economy and the factors that drive home-improvement spending remained strong. “We feel very positive about the strength of the home improvement sector and the customers’ willingness to spend.” Homeowners are spending more as prices appreciate and they view their homes as an investment and not an expense, Menear said. Home equity values have increased over 120 percent since 2011 in the United States, about $73,000 per owner in terms of equity, he said. He did not cite the source of the data. Second-quarter sales rebounded from the first quarter when cooler-than-usual weather in some parts of the United States hurt demand for spring season products. Menear said a majority of seasonal sales that were lost in the first quarter were recovered in the second. Lumber, indoor and outdoor garden products, lawn-mowers, patio furniture, ceiling fans, interior and exterior paint all posted strong growth. The retailer said it is witnessing inflationary pressures in the form of rising raw material and transportation costs. The tariffs on Canadian lumber and washing machines imported from China recently imposed by the Trump administration have been manageable, it said, increasing by the low single-digit percentages the cost of goods sold. Home Depot raised its full-year earnings forecast to $9.42 per share from $9.31. It also expects comparable sales growth of about 5.3 percent, up from a previous forecast of 5 percent, and total sales growth of about 7 percent, from 6.7 percent earlier. Customer transactions rose 3.1 percent in the second quarter ended July 29. Sales at stores open for more than a year climbed 8 percent, beating the average analyst estimate of a rise of 6.65 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Online sales grew approximately 26 percent from the second quarter of 2017. Net earnings increased to $3.5 billion, or $3.05 per share, in the quarter, from $2.7 billion, or $2.25, a year earlier. Analysts expected $2.84 per share. Net sales rose 8.4 percent to $30.5 billion, beating expectations of $30.03 billion. Home Depot shares, which have risen 25 percent in the past 12 months, added 0.4 percent to $194.94."

3.774944745508043," Home Depot posts rare sales miss as delayed spring hits demand (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N on Tuesday missed Wall Street forecasts for sales at established stores as an unusually long winter hit sales of springtime gardening products, but the retailer said it expects to recoup a majority of those lost sales. The sales outlook helped the company’s shares trim initial losses. The stock, which fell over 3 percent in early trade, was last down 1.8 percent at $187.63. The miss was the first in seven quarters for the top U.S. home improvement chain, which has in recent years largely bucked the trend of big-box stores losing shoppers to online retailers including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. “The miss in terms of garden was significant against what we planned,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said on a call with analysts. He was referring to sales of garden-related products such as fertilizers and mulch, which account for 15 percent to 20 percent of revenue, and took a beating in the first quarter. Still, Home Depot kept its full-year sales and earnings forecasts intact and said it was seeing double-digit sales growth in May. In terms of profitability for the year, the retailer expects to invest a significant portion of its operating margin back into improving its stores, enhancing customer experience and strengthening its supply chain, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said in an interview. Sales at Home Depot stores open for more than a year rose 4.2 percent in the first quarter ended April 29, falling short of analysts’ average expectation of a 5.4-percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A winter that prolonged into March and April in some parts of the United States caused a 1.3-percent decline in customer traffic and forced Home Depot to slap deep discounts on several seasonal products. Patio furniture, for instance, was marked down by up to 30 percent, Home Depot’s website showed. Recent data has suggested that U.S. homebuilding activity may be slowing, after construction of single-family homes — the biggest share of the housing market — fell 3.7 percent in March. The figures have also raised concerns that rising mortgage and interest rates — though historically low — were weighing on construction activity and consumer spending. Home Depot’s Menear allayed some of those fears, saying: “The U.S. economy is strong and housing fundamentals continue to be supportive of our business ... we do not expect interest rates to lead to a slowdown in customer desires or demand.” The company’s total net sales rose 4.4 percent to $24.95 billion in the first quarter but fell short of expectations, while earnings per share topped estimates."

1.622944012374742," Home Depot well placed to withstand 'Amazon effect,' investors say NEW YORK (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc HD.N shares have climbed with the approach of spring weather, as some investors believe the retailer is well positioned to fend off the competitive threat of online retailers as the peak season for home improvement begins. Home Depot shares are up 0.7 percent year to date after being weighed down earlier this year in part because of the impact of an unusually long and snowy winter on sales, investors and analysts said. For the first three months of 2018, its shares fell 6 percent, while the S&P 500 Retailing index .SPXRT rose 11.3 percent. Since April 13, Home Depot shares have climbed 10.6 percent, ahead of the S&P 500 Retailing index, which has risen 8 percent in the same period. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O stock saw a 12.1-percent advance. Home Depot, the largest U.S. home improvement chain by sales, will report its first-quarter results on Tuesday. Homeowners catching up on home-improvement projects are more likely to buy supplies in person over perusing products online, some investors believe. Home Depot also has a strong business among contractors, which has helped it to outperform rival Lowe's Companies Inc LOW.N, whose sales have lagged. It is scheduled to report its results on May 23. Shares of Lowe’s have gained just 0.5 percent in the past month. Several other big-box retailers' shares have not performed as well. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc BBBY.O stock has declined 1.1 percent over the same period, after having dived 20 percent on April 12 on the company's quarterly results. Target Corp TGT.N shares have risen 1.9 percent, while Walmart Inc WMT.N shares have fallen 1.7 percent. “It’s the season where contractors start getting busy,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist of Bruderman Asset Management in New York, which owns Home Depot shares. “That bodes well for Home Depot and similar companies.” Home-improvement retailers are also subject to concerns that rising U.S. interest rates could slow the growth of the housing market, said Greg Melich, an analyst at MoffettNathanson in New York. That anxiety has particularly hurt shares of homebuilders such as Lennar Corp LEN.N and D.R. Horton Inc DHI.N. But the limited supply of houses has pushed up home values and encouraged homeowners to spend money on renovation projects. Renovation activity is projected to increase at an above-average 7.2 percent in 2018 over the previous year, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. “Homeowners are feeling encouraged by market conditions,” said Abbe Will, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies. “They’re motivated to do bigger projects: the kitchen, the bathroom.” Home Depot has also made steps to improve its footing against online competitors such as Amazon. In December, it announced that it would double its total investment spending over three years. According to the company’s fiscal year guidance issued in February, its capital expenditures are expected to total $2.5 billion. “It has a strategy to compete and win in multi-channel (retail),” Melich said. “As spring comes, it should be a pretty good investment.”"
