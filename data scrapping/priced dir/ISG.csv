0.0," European shares dip; ASML, ING among early gainers (For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in a news window) Feb 12 (Reuters) - European stocks edged lower on Friday, on track to end the second straight week of gains, as investors awaited more signs of progress in U.S. stimulus measures, while a rise in shares of ASML and ING kept declines in check. The pan-European STOXX 600 index dipped 0.1%, after having gained nearly 4% so far this month. ING Groep NV jumped 5% after the largest Dutch bank reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings of 1.05 billion euros ($1.27 billion). ASML Holding NV rose 1.5% after the Dutch equipment maker said chip shortages slowing car production were a symptom of broader increased demand that is placing strains on suppliers across the semiconductor sector. European technology stocks were 0.4% higher, among the few sectors in positive territory in early trading. Market participants were hopeful that a proposed $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus bill would be passed soon by lawmakers, with data showing a stalling recovery in the U.S. labour market strengthening the case for it.

0.0," UPDATE 2-ING beats Q4 expectations as retail investment boom helps (Adds detail) AMSTERDAM, Feb 12 (Reuters) - ING Groep NV, the largest Dutch bank, on Friday beat fourth-quarter expectations with a 1.05 billion euro ($1.27 billion) pretax profit helped by lower loan loss provisions and a boom in retail investment. It topped the 649 million euros expected by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed, though remained well below the 1.34 billion euro profit it booked a year earlier. Provisions for bad loans fell 51% to 208 million from the same period a year earlier, when the company was forced to write off several large individual corporate loans. CEO Stephen van Rijswijk said the company is taking sufficient provisions, though they were lower than those of some competitors, and despite a generally negative tone from the European Central Bank. Van Rijswijk noted ING took large provisions in the previous two quarters and added that at some point economies will rebound from the crisis, helping some stressed customers recover. “On the other hand, we still are cautious because the outcome of the crisis that may come when all the (government support) measures stop, we haven’t seen as yet,” he told reporters. Fees and commission income rose by 4.9% to 771 million euros, but that was offset by net interest income down 7% to 3.34 billion euros. ING continued to win customers, adding 578,000 clients who consider it their main bank to 13.9 million, and 39.3 million in all. Net core lending fell by 900 million euros in the fourth quarter in the smallest decline since the start of the pandemic. Deposits grew by 7.8 billion euros in the fourth quarter and by 41.4 billion in 2020 as a whole. Van Rijswijk said that the combination of rising retail deposits and near zero rates on offer in saving accounts are likely pushing customers to have a fresh look at how they invest. “As an example, in Germany we had 326,000 clients that started to trade with our app, of which 20% were new-to-the-bank clients, so in this time when you might think people would stick to their existing bank, they make the jump to ING,” he said. Net interest margins fell to 1.41% in the fourth quarter, down from 1.57% at the end of 2019."

0.0," Dutch prosecutors to investigate UBS chief over ING money laundering case ZURICH/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered a criminal investigation into the role UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers played in ING Group’s failure to crack down on money laundering when he was head of the Dutch bank. The investigation comes only a month after Hamers became head of UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, at a time when it is trying to move on from a legacy of costly court cases over money laundering and tax evasion. The Swiss bank said Hamers would stay in his role while prosecutors conducted their investigation and that extensive due diligence, including an independent assessment of the Dutch anti-money laundering issues, had been conducted before he was hired. “I have full confidence in Ralph’s ability to lead our firm,” UBS Chairman Axel Weber said. “We were fully satisfied with the results of these independent evaluations and the assessment of the Dutch prosecutor at the time.” UBS has contingency plans for another executive to deputise for Hamers should he be called for an extended period of questioning, a source familiar with the matter said. It was not immediately clear how long the Dutch investigation would last though one source said they did not expect a resolution until 2022 at the earliest. The Swiss banking industry is trying to rebrand itself as a stable and trustworthy financial centre after global pressure effectively brought an end to a centuries-long policy of banking secrecy, but the investigation into Hamers, as well as the departure of Credit Suisse’s chief executive this year over a spying scandal, risk tarnishing its efforts. Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA said it also addressed the Dutch anti-money laundering issues in its review of Hamers’ nomination and confirmed that he was “fit and proper” to take on the role. UBS shares largely shrugged off the investigation news to trade 0.4% higher on Wednesday afternoon, slightly underperforming a 1.4% rise in Europe’s STOXX bank index. ING agreed with Dutch prosecutors in 2018 to pay 775 million euros ($940 million) to settle a case over failing to spot money laundering and other criminal activities by its clients. Hamers ran ING, the largest bank in the Netherlands, from 2013 until June this year, when he left to join UBS. Some investors were unhappy with the 2018 decision because it failed to hold any individuals responsible. That lead to the ruling on Wednesday in which the court of appeal in The Hague said that while the settlement still stood, prosecutors must investigate the role Hamers played. “The court considers it important that in public criminal proceedings the standard is confirmed that managers of a bank do not go unpunished if they have actually led prohibited conduct,” the ruling said. Hamers was considered a bold choice for UBS as he came from outside the Swiss establishment and did not have executive experience in the staid world of wealth management. However, his appointment was lauded by UBS and many observers as a chance for the bank to orient itself towards a more digital future, as Hamers had successfully implemented a digital turnaround at ING. ING, which is predominantly a retail bank, welcomed Wednesday’s court ruling upholding its 2018 settlement and said it continued to “enhance the management of compliance risks”. Prosecutors said at the time that shortfalls in oversight had largely resulted from ING’s lack of attention for compliance risk management and could not be blamed on any individual. The new investigation is now likely to examine to what extent Hamers knew about the money laundering offences and failed to stop them. Hamers has not been charged with any offences at this point. The prosecution of a current or former chief executive of a major Dutch company was very rare, prosecutors said. “We had earlier in the same case decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute this man, and to justify this prosecution,” a spokeswoman for the Dutch financial crimes prosecutor’s office said. “(But) the Appeals Court has decided that the former chief should be prosecuted. So we will follow out that order,” she said, adding that she could not yet give a timeline for the investigation. ($1 = 0.8245 euros)"

0.0," ING sells part of Payvision, cutting links with Pornhub AMSTERDAM, Nov 13 (Reuters) - ING Groep NV, the largest Dutch financial services company, said on Friday it had sold part of its Payvision payments business, including cutting ties with online pornography and gambling customers. The sale, which took place in September, was earlier reported by Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad. ING spokesman Daan Wentholt said the section of Payvision’s business was sold for 1 euro ($1.20) to one of the payment company’s founders, who left Payvision in April. Wentholt did not disclose the size of the business sold, but said it was the part that dealt with adult website Pornhub among other customers. “Although there is no legal objection to the adult and gambling segments, ING applies its own policy” the bank said in a statement on its website. Wentholt said ING wrote off 188 million euros in goodwill on Payvision in the second quarter of 2020, but added that was part of wider coronavirus impairment testing and not related to Payvision’s performance. “We see it as a valuable addition to our business,” he said, while adding Payvision was currently not as profitable as it was in 2018, due largely to the loss of the high-margin customers. ING bought Payvision for 360 million euros in March 2018 to compete with the likes of Adyen and the now-insolvent Wirecard of Germany."

Analysts had forecast pretax profit of 1.26 billion euros, according to a Refinitiv poll. In the third quarter of 2019, ING reported pretax profit of 1.34 billion euros. Although provisions for bad loans fell from second quarter 2020 levels, ING also took a 140 million euro impairment charge on a project to unify its technology platforms across several countries. “The pandemic continues to have a significant impact everywhere, with the second wave in Europe and the U.S. putting further pressure on consumers and businesses,” said Chief Executive Officer Steven van Rijswijk. He described ING’s performance as “resilient” and noted the bank had added more than 200,000 customers in the quarter. The job cuts will come in ING’s wholesale banking division as it closes offices in South America and some in Asia. Net interest income fell by 5.7% to 3.33 billion euros, while loan loss provisions were at 469 million euros, up strongly from 2019 levels but well below the 1.34 billion in losses it booked in the second quarter, reflecting the impact of the onset of COVID-19.

But ING said in a statement on Wednesday those reports were misleading: what actually happened, the company said, was that the name of a sanctioned entity had accidentally been added to one field of a transaction in 2014. The mention was erroneous, was correcly stripped, and the transaction proceeded. “This has been discussed with relevant U.S. authorities in 2014 and no further action has been taken,” ING said. A series of articles called the “FinCEN Files,” launched onSunday by Buzzfeed News and the International Consortium ofInvestigative Journalists (ICIJ), detailed how several globalbanks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds for decadesdespite red flags. The series sent bank stocks tumbling onMonday and prompted new calls for legislative reform. ING shares, down 44% year to date, fell more than 9% on Monday after the reports first surfaced."

The profit was lower than the 625 million euros expected by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. But new CEO Steven van Rijswijk said that loan provisions have likely peaked and the company in July saw customer payment traffic improve to pre-COVID-19 levels. “This year we’ve had the bulk of the risks, and the second-half risk costs should go down,” he said on a call with reporters. A year ago ING reported a quarterly pre-tax profit of 2 billion euros and 209 million euros in provisions. The higher provisions this year dominated the earnings, as interest income and fees and commissions were almost unchanged, though staff, regulatory and other expenses rose. There were some provisions at ING’s mortgage-heavy retail operations, but its wholesale banking arm registered the most at 833 million euros. The company said the provisions were focused among oil and gas customers but also included “a sizeable provision for a suspected external fraud case”. Van Rijswijk declined to identify the case, though analysts had said the lender would have to book a loss on its exposure to collapsed German payments company Wirecard. “This is a well-documented fraud case that you’ve seen in the press in the last number of weeks, as many banks also have an exposure to that company, for which we also took a provision,” Van Rijswijk said. The bank’s shares closed at 6.16 euros on Wednesday, down 42% year to date."

A company spokesman declined to name the business units involved, but said the impairment is related to “multiple acquisitions, some from a long time ago”. The Netherlands’ largest bank had already said net profit in the second quarter would be affected by the COVID-19 crisis, as the economic lockdown throughout Europe crippled business and led to an increase in bad loans.

Cleantech, which has Shell as one of its investors, will use the funding to help build over 500 megawatts of solar projects, according to the statement. Banks across the world have come under pressure from investors, regulators and climate activists to ease the transition towards a low-carbon economy. “This is the largest green loan in Asia Pacific to date in the commercial and industrial renewables sector,” the statement said. In a report published last week, the International Energy Agency outlined how the deployment of low-carbon electricity, such as solar and wind, could be accelerated. Last year, ING said it supports new clients in the utilities sector “only when their reliance on coal is 10% or less and they have a strategy to reduce their coal percentage to close to zero by 2025.” Some European lenders have now increased their funding of renewable energy projects and stepped up engagement with clients to encourage a faster shift away from coal production and consumption.

0.0," ING first-quarter pretax profit slumps 36%, less than feared, on coronavirus AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ING Groep NV INGA.AS reported a 36% fall in first-quarter pretax earnings that beat forecasts as the Netherlands' largest bank booked higher loan loss provisions but retail operations held up well. Earnings fell to 1.02 billion euros ($1.11 billion) from 1.58 billion but easily beat the 549 million forecast by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. ING cautioned that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic escalated through March. It took 661 million euros in loan loss provisions, up from 207 million a year earlier. They reflected a mix of existing and new problem loans for mid-sized and large customers, ING said. Some 206 million euros in provisions stemmed from generally worsening economic conditions while 41 million euros in provisions on its U.S. loan book were linked to falling oil prices. “The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting society and the economy throughout the world, and it will continue to do so for some time,” CEO Ralph Hamers said. ING shares were up 5.9% to 5.18 euros by 0725 GMT yet still down more than 50% year to date. The bank said gross results improved at its large retail banking businesses in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, while its wholesale banking business saw a sharp decline due to the provisions. Lending grew by 14.8 billion euros to 626 billion euros in the quarter, including 5.6 billion euros of loans generated under crisis programs underwritten in part by governments. Hamers said that loan growth also reflected businesses drawing on credit facilities which were then deposited at ING. Customer deposits rose by 9.2 billion euros. “Certainly part of the extra lending that we gave is on the back of the crisis and supporting our clients,” he said. The company’s net interest margin, a measure of profitability, fell to 1.51% from 1.57% a quarter earlier. Hamer said that was partly due to the bank’s growing balance sheet, and partly due to extremely low interest rates, which make it harder to lend deposits profitably."

The loan provisions included “several larger additions for files in wholesale banking and mid-corporates lending, on both existing and some new files,” ING said. The Dutch company also took more general provisions for increased risk - about 41 million euros in its U.S. loanbook resulting from falling oil prices and 206 million euros from worsening macroeconomic conditions as a result of the lockdown measures put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

-4.862178221202966," Switzerland's UBS starts new chapter with Dutch tech innovator as chief ZURICH/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - UBS UBSG.S, the world's largest bank to the rich, named the head of ING INGA.AS as chief executive on Thursday, seeking to tap his tech knowledge after he transformed the Dutch lender into one of Europe's most successful online banks. Ralph Hamers’ appointment heralds a shift in focus for the Swiss bank, which historically relied on its bankers’ personal attention to customers to build a group managing more than $2 trillion of investments. ING, by contrast, is better known for its brash orange logo, mobile apps and online loan applications. Rock-bottom borrowing rates following the financial crash a decade ago have turned the traditional model of banking on its head, upping pressure on lenders to adopt new technology to cut the cost of doing business. UBS Chairman Axel Weber hailed Hamers’ arrival as the beginning of the next chapter for the Swiss bank. “Under his leadership ING implemented a fundamental shift in its operating model and is now considered one of the best examples of digital innovation in the banking sector,” Weber told journalists. Hamers predicted that artificial intelligence, where computers are trained to make choices on, for instance, what investments to offer customers, would play an ever-greater role in the industry. Hamers succeeds Sergio Ermotti, who has been with UBS for close to a decade. Hamers becomes CEO at the world’s biggest wealth manager on Nov. 1 but will join earlier for a handover. Ermotti, who was named UBS chief in 2011, has earned plaudits for helping rebuild the bank after the financial crisis, with a focus on wealth management. However, UBS missed its profit and cost targets for 2019 amid ultra-low interest rates in Europe and increased competition from U.S. rivals, forcing Ermotti to dial back some of the bank’s financial goals. UBS shares have fallen over the past year, hit by a 4.5 billion euro ($4.9 billion) fine in a French tax fraud case. Weber said the hunt for Ermotti's successor began in earnest 15 months ago. Hamers' appointment derails speculation that star wealth manager Iqbal Khan, who joined last year from rival Credit Suisse CSGN.S, could be in line to replace Ermotti. UBS is overhauling its flagship wealth management business, including shrinking its senior staff numbers, in the first big strategic move under the division’s co-head Khan. During his stint as ING CEO, Hamers steered the lender to profitability while repaying the Dutch government money it received during the financial crisis. Under his watch, the bank has also invested heavily in its digital transformation, relying far more on its online offering and less on its branch network than most rivals, leading to ING having one of the lowest cost-to-revenue ratios in Europe. He was, however, criticized after the bank admitted criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts, paying a $900 million penalty. ING did not immediately disclose its plans on finding a new chief but said the succession process will be made “if and when appropriate”. Earlier this month, Credit Suisse named Thomas Gottstein as CEO to take over from Tidjane Thiam, who resigned following a spying scandal. ($1 = 0.9252 euros)"

Analysts polled by Refinitiv had forecast an average of 1.61 billion euros in underlying pre-tax profit for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 1.69 billion euros a year earlier. “Pricing discipline and growth helped counter the pressure of negative interest rates,” said CEO Ralph Hamers. ING shares have slightly underperformed European sector peers over the past year amid wider worries about the impact of low interest rates, and are down 1.2% over the past 12 months at 10.29 euros. The company’s net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, rose by three basis points to 1.57% from a quarter earlier, thanks to improved lending margins and better return on funds stored at the European Central Bank. However “we recorded a 4.5% rise in underlying expenses for 2019, which includes a marked increase in regulatory costs, as well as costs related to our KYC (know your customer) enhancement programme,” Hamers said on a media call, adding that most of those costs will be recurring. ING has spent heavily on staff and systems to detect money laundering among customers, after being fined $900 million in 2018 by prosecutors in 2018. The cost increase hurt ING cost-income ratio, which rose to 56.6% for the full year from 54.8% in 2018. Provisions for bad loans also increased in the quarter, due in part to what ING said was a single provision for a fraud case at a customer in Asia. ING did not disclose the identity of the customer. Loan provisions rose to 303 million euros from 266 million euros a year ago, which ING said was still lower than a through-the-cycle average.

0.26799386416562654," Dutch bank ING warns against further ECB money printing (Reuters) - The head of one of Europe’s largest banks, ING, has warned of the perils of central bank money printing, saying there is already enough cheap money available and that injecting more will do little to bolster weak confidence. Ralph Hamers made his plea as central banks redouble efforts to keep the cost of borrowing at historic lows to buoy the economy, a policy that weighs on bank profits and makes it costly to hold deposits. “I don’t think QE is a recipe to support an uncertain environment,” Hamers told journalists, referring to so-called quantitative easing to print fresh money. “There is no shortage of money in the market.” Although bankers have previously made similar complaints, Hamers’ blunt comments carry weight because his bank is one of Europe’s largest, with 38 million customers. ING INGA.AS, the largest Dutch bank, cautioned on Thursday that rock-bottom interest rates would pressure future earnings, as it announced a 1.4 billion euro ($1.55 billion) net profit in the second quarter of the year. “Looking ahead, we expect that persistently low interest rates will put pressure on net interest income,” Hamers said, referring to the bank’s chief earnings pillar from activities such as lending. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has all but pledged to loosen monetary policy further amid a continued economic deterioration of Europe’s euro currency bloc, still grappling with the aftermath of a debt crisis. Officials recently told Reuters that an interest rate cut in September appeared certain, while government bond buys were also likely. Draghi recently said the outlook looked bleak as a global trade war hit Europe’s manufacturers. Earlier this week, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cited signs of a global slowdown and U.S. trade tensions in explaining the central bank’s decision to lower borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. ING also announced that it was bolstering its staff and systems to tackle money laundering, a factor that increased costs. Hamers said these measures had led to the closure of some customer accounts and that the bank was using machine learning and artificial intelligence to prevent money laundering. Last year, ING admitted criminals had laundered money through its accounts and the bank agreed to pay a 775 million euro penalty. Dutch prosecutors had highlighted a series of lapses that they said followed years in which ING put profit ahead of controls, leaving the compliance department understaffed and able only to investigate the “tip of the iceberg”."

ING’s management opted not to pursue the merger a month and a half ago, Handelsblatt reported, after Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke and ING boss Ralph Hamers met twice to discuss a potential deal. ING and Commerzbank both declined to comment on the report. ING chief executive Hamers said earlier this month there was “limited” logic for cross-border bank mergers within the European Union as long as the bloc’s banking union plan was incomplete. Commerzbank’s Zielke said last month the German lender was still open to merger opportunities following the collapse of talks with its larger rival Deutsche Bank earlier this year. ING is the largest retail bank in the Benelux countries and the third biggest in Germany behind Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. On Thursday shares in Commerzbank jumped after Bloomberg reported that Germany was in discussions with the Netherlands over a possible tie-up between the bank and ING."
1.4374553224553304," ING's CEO sees 'limited' logic for European cross-border mergers AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - There is “limited” logic for cross-border EU bank mergers as long as the bloc’s banking union plan is incomplete, the chief executive of Dutch lender ING Groep, which has been reported to be interested in Germany’s Commerzbank, said on Monday. ING is the largest retail bank in the Benelux countries and the third largest behind Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank in Germany. “The national competent authorities, in the absence of a banking union, will be very protective of capital in that country and liquidity in that country,” ING’s CEO Ralph Hamers told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. Hamers declined to comment on any ING interest in Commerzbank, which last month ended merger talks With Deutsche Bank. In Germany, ING operates as a direct bank, ING-DiBa, with no physical offices. Banking bosses have recently aired differing views on whether cross-border mergers are either desirable or achievable. Last month UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said that consolidation in the European banking industry remains inevitable. UBS has been reported to be interested in a tie-up with Deutsche Bank following the failed Commerzbank deal. Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam told a newspaper on Sunday that mergers are not the best way to help deal with the problems presented by negative interest rates. Hamers said mergers between banks in the same country or generating economies of scale could achieve cost savings as “cross-border consolidation doesn’t help you to create capital efficiency nor liquidity efficiency” within Europe’s existing regulatory regime. ING has lowered operating costs in its home Benelux market at 4.4% annually over the past five years and has invested heavily in developing a mobile application and technology infrastructure that can be scaled easily across borders. Hamers said ING had launched this year in the Philippines, after just 10 months of preparation. Asked whether European banks were ready for any economic downturn, Hamers said that most, while relatively unprofitable, have improved their balance sheets since the financial crisis. “If you look at how ready we are in terms of managing through a potential problem in terms of the available capital, most banks are,” he said. ING has moved from 26 billion euros of equity on a balance sheet of 1.3 trillion euros in 2008, to roughly 50 billion euros on a balance sheet of 900 billion euros, Hamers said. It also has around 90 billion of capital that could be “bailed-in” in the event of a crisis. “If you’re not ready now, when will you be?” he said."
1.5879163439194428," Dutch shareholder group VEB calls on ING to say if interested in Commerzbank AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The organization that defends shareholder interests in the Netherlands on Wednesday called on ING Groep to clarify whether it is interested in acquiring German rival Commerzbank. Reuters reported on May 14 that Italy’s UniCredit had hired advisers to examine the possibility of a takeover of Commerzbank, while ING had held informal talks with the German lender. ING declined comment. The VEB said in a letter to the Dutch banking group that “ING cannot delay” disclosure of its intent. “While ING should not respond to every rumor in the market, in the eyes of the VEB it is in the interest of a honest determination of the market price for ING shares that it give clarity,” the association wrote. It said that ING’s share price had declined in recent days, likely because of the reports, and noted that UniCredit had made a statement on Tuesday at the request of Italian regulators. UniCredit said it had not signed any banking mandate related to any potential rumored market operation. ING spokesman Raymond Vermeulen said on Wednesday evening that similar questions were raised at its annual meeting earlier this month. “We have nothing to add to the response our board gave there,” he said. ING’s share price has fallen around 16 percent since late April. The bank’s chief executive, Ralph Hamers, told shareholders on April 24 that it would consider a cross-border acquisition in select circumstances, including if consolidation were occurring in one of the markets it operates in. Germany is ING’s second largest market after the Netherlands. ING is obliged to inform shareholders under Dutch disclosure laws of any concrete step in a takeover process, the association said."
2.1409068843555112," ING says German arm growing well on its own amid Commerzbank talk AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ING Groep NV’s German business is growing very well independently, the Dutch bank’s chief executive said on Thursday, declining to comment on media reports it might be interested in buying Germany’s Commerzbank. Sources familiar with the matter have said both ING and Italy’s UniCredit expressed an interest in Commerzbank before merger talks between Germany’s second-biggest bank and its larger rival Deutsche Bank collapsed last month. In a conference call to discuss ING’s first-quarter earnings, which fell slightly more than expected, CEO Ralph Hamers declined to comment directly on the matter. “In markets where we are already a player, if consolidation starts to happen, we’ll have to take a look at our position and what consequences that would have,” he said. “Our strategy is an organic growth strategy and we’re doing that very well, also in Germany.” Underlying net profit at the largest Netherlands-based bank fell 6.1 percent to 1.12 billion euros ($1.26 billion) in the three months ended March 31, hit by higher provisions and low interest rates in its core markets. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 1.15 billion euros. ING’s shares were little changed at 11.38 euros at 0915 GMT. “Income grew both year-on-year and sequentially,” Hamers said. “However, this was offset by higher but still relatively low risk costs (that is, bad loan provisions), and pressure from low interest rates in our main euro zone markets.” Provisions rose to 207 million euros from 85 million in the first quarter of 2018. ING’s underling income in Germany rose to 498 million euros from 479 million euros a year earlier, and the company added 60,000 “primary” German retail customers, meaning clients that use at least two ING products. Among key group metrics, ING’s net core lending grew by 8.7 billion euros in the quarter, while net customer deposits rose by 4.8 billion euros. ING’s core tier-one capital ratio, its key measure of solvency, improved to 14.7 percent at the end of March from 14.5 percent at the end of 2018."

1.9813972266650128," ING Italy investigated over alleged money laundering: source MILAN (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Milan have begun a formal investigation into alleged money laundering involving Dutch bank ING Groep NV’s Italian business, a source close to the matter said. ING had no immediate comment on Tuesday on the investigation, which was launched after prosecutors received requests for assistance from other European countries, where dozens of people had reported online scams, the source added. Those being investigated by Milan prosecutors were carried out using various online accounts and the stolen money ended up in accounts opened at ING in Milan, the source said. Last year ING, the Netherlands’ largest financial services provider, admitted criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts and agreed to pay 775 million euros ($900 million) to settle the case. Milan prosecutors had already notified the Bank of Italy, which had carried out its own inspections in addition to the prosecutors’ initial investigations, the source said. The Italian central bank, which made checks from October until the start of 2019, has told ING that it is not allowed to take on new customers in Italy after failing to prevent money laundering transactions through its accounts. In the settlement last year, Dutch financial crime prosecutors said ING had violated laws on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism “structurally and for years” by not properly vetting the beneficial owners of client accounts and by not noticing unusual transactions through them."

ING said it had won new customers despite the scandal and seen net loan growth of 3.2 billion euros. Among key banking metrics, its net interest margin was 1.56 percent, slightly worse than 1.58 percent a year ago, but its cost/income ratio improved to 57.1 percent from 59.9 percent. “We see the need for better cost discipline as we expect lower lending in the wholesale banking division (in 2019),” CEO Ralph Hamers said in a statement. The company said that the macroeconomic outlook globally had deteriorated but “remained robust in both Europe and the U.S.” Provisions for bad loans increased to 242 million euros, up from 190 million euros, but the bank considers both figures below average for over the economic cycle."

The pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX hit a two-week high but then lost steam over the session, ending with a 0.2 percent gain. Germany's DAX .GDAXI declined 0.1 percent. European shares built on Wednesday’s rally when fresh optimism over earnings helped ease worries over economic growth and political risk which sent the pan-European index close to two-year lows in October. Miners, banks and retail - sectors highly sensitive to the economic cycle - led the gains, in a reversal of the pattern during the sell-off, which saw cyclicals underperform. Britain's FTSE .FTSE lagged, down 0.5 percent, as the pound strengthened after a British official said London was close to sealing a deal that would give UK-based financial services firms basic access to EU markets. ING INGA.AS shares rose 5.9 percent after the largest Dutch bank reported a better-than-expected profit of 776 million euros, as it continued to grow on an underlying basis despite being fined for failures to prevent money laundering. “ING’s earnings are mainly boosted by the lower cost/income ratio as its cost cuts seem to start reaping benefits,” said Jauke de Jong, a research analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam. BT BT.L rallied 8.7 percent after it reported a better-than-expected 2 percent rise in first-half earnings and nudged its guidance for the full year higher. The stock was on track for its best day since May 2013. Results from ING and BT lifted the banks and telecoms indexes up 0.9 and 2 percent respectively, bringing relief to sectors which have been among the worst perfomers so far this year in Europe and have suffered due to their poor earnings outlook. ASM International ASMI.AS rallied 10.9 percent, its biggest one-day gain since 2009, after issuing a bullish outlook that countered fears of a downturn in the semiconductor market. Leading the STOXX were two biotech firms, Morphosys and Argenx, which both surged. Morphosys MORG.DE jumped 16.3 percent after it released encouraging results for its leukemia drug MOR 208. Argenx ARGX.BR gained 13.4 percent after new data for its Cusatuzumab drug, also to treat leukemia. Credit Suisse CSGN.S was a weak spot. Its shares fell 2.1 percent after its third-quarter net profit fell short of expectations, even after the bank said it would return to the black in the full year for the first time since Tidjane Thiam became chief executive in 2015. Oil stocks fell after Shell RDSa.AS slightly missed expectations, sending its shares down 3.3 percent. Weaker crude prices also weighed on the sector, down 2.6 percent. The fall in fuel prices helped airlines outperform, however, with Lufthansa LHAG.DE leading the DAX with a 7.1 percent rise and Air France AIRF.PA also up strongly. The travel and leisure sector .SXTP - a laggard this year - had its best day since June 2016, up 2.6 percent.

ING said it grew its loan book by 6.8 billion euros with “resilient margins”. Net interest margin increased fractionally to 1.52 percent from 1.51 percent in the second quarter of 2018, which ING said was due to slightly better margins on mortgage and savings accounts. Fee and commission income grew by 12 percent to 720 million euros.

A letter ING sent to unions in Italy said the group expected to sign the deal by early December and close it in the first quarter of next year. The portfolio comprises both performing and non-performing real estate leasing contracts, ING said, adding that the disposal would make 31 people in Italy redundant and inviting unions to discuss possible measures to reduce staff. ING said it had picked Goldman, which is partnering with Italy’s Finanziaria Internazionale (FinInt), after evaluating a number of offers by various credit management specialists. Also in tandem with FinInt, Goldman in November last year bought an Italian performing lease portfolio worth 483 million euros ($548.83 million), the first such deal in Italy following changes to the law that have made it possible to transfer lease contracts as part of securitization deals. ING, Goldman and FinInt all declined to comment. “The long maturity of real estate leasing contracts ... means their financial risk is particularly high and makes it difficult to take actions to lower it, creating uncertainty over future results at ING Bank NV,” the letter said. In 2006, ING said its Italian leasing operations had a portfolio of 2.5 billion euros and were the best-performing among ING’s lease subsidiaries, with high margins and low risk. By 2013 the bank had sold several lease portfolios and put the remainder, including the Italian business, in run-off so they could be “wound down in a controlled manner.” ING said in its 2017 financial report that rising risk costs related to the Italian lease run-off portfolio had contributed to a sharp drop in its underlying pre-tax result at its “bank treasury and other” division.

Greve had not been active in his role or working at his desk in London since taking paternity leave in the summer, according to market sources. Greve joined the Netherlands-headquartered bank nearly five years ago but had not been running the GCM group for several weeks, leading to speculation over his whereabouts both within the bank and externally. “He’s been on extended leave all summer and during September,” said one insider, who was not permitted to speak on record. Although still employed by the bank, calls to Greve’s work landline had remained unanswered, as were calls to his assistant. Emails also went unanswered, while he was shown as inactive on his Bloomberg. There had been no official communication until today, when the bank sent a memo to GCM stating Greve has now left the bank. The situation had been noted by senior officials at major European banks. “It’s our policy not to share the details of our employees,” a spokesperson for ING said.

-1.2137861701728192," ING CFO steps down as backlash grows after $900 million money laundering fine AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ING Groep's INGA.AS Chief Financial Officer is to step down amid a public backlash after the Dutch bank admitted last week it had failed for years to prevent money laundering and agreed to a 775 million euro ($900 million) settlement with prosecutors. The decision to remove CFO Koos Timmermans, 58, comes after criticism of the bank by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and after shareholder interest group VEB called for a more thorough vetting of CEO Ralph Hamers’ role in the affair. ING's fine comes as European regulators consider whether to tighten controls on financial crime. Denmark's Danske Bank DANSKE.CO has also admitted to flaws in anti-money laundering controls in Estonia, while Latvia closed one of its banks after it was accused by the United States of money laundering. In the settlement reached on Sept. 4, prosecutors concluded that responsibility for ING’s failings was diffuse and agreed not to prosecute, saying chances of a conviction were slim. ING said at the time it had taken disciplinary measures against 10 employees and its management board would forgo any bonuses for 2018, but on Tuesday it said external pressure had forced it to go further. “Given the seriousness of the matter and the many reactions among stakeholders...we came to the conclusion it is appropriate that responsibility is taken at executive board level,” said supervisory board chairman Hans Wijers, a former politician, in a statement. Announcing Timmermans’ departure, ING praised his contributions to the bank, and said he could remain in his job until a replacement takes over, which would likely be next April. Timmermans was appointed CFO in 2017 having previously held key managerial positions between 2010 and 2016, the period investigated by prosecutors, notably at the company’s banking operations in the Netherlands. His dismissal may reduce pressure on Hamers, who has led the bank since 2013 and is feted for its successful digital strategy. Public criticism over the bank’s failings has swelled in the days since news of the settlement emerged. PM Rutte voiced his displeasure, while Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra summoned Wijers to The Hague, saying the matter had “shaken public faith in the banking sector yet again”. Hoekstra called Timmermans’ departure a “fitting” response by the bank. Opposition political parties have called for ING be stripped of its position as official banker to the government and VEB President Paul Koster said it was difficult not to think that Timmermans was a “sacrificial victim”. “For outsiders...this has the appearance of being about protecting Hamers,” he said. ING was not immediately available to comment on Hamers’ position but Wijers told local press agency ANP that Hamers has the “full support” of the board. ING said on Tuesday that it would continue to strengthen its compliance procedures, despite earlier saying that it had already reformed its customer vetting and monitoring processes. ING’s delayed reaction mirrors a series of events in March when it announced a 50 percent pay rise for Hamers, retracting it 5 days later amid withering criticism."

-1.9523622822193565," ING penalty puts Europe's money laundering controls on the spot AMSTERDAM/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - When Dutch prosecutors trawled through ING’s books they found a “women’s underwear trader” had been able to launder 150 million euros through the bank’s accounts without ringing alarm bells. “It should have been clear to the bank that the monetary flows had little to do with the lingerie trade,” the prosecutors said on Tuesday after imposing a 775 million euro ($897 million) penalty on the Dutch bank for its failings. In fact, ING INGA.AS was warned as early as a decade ago that its money laundering controls were lax, the Dutch prosecutor said, in the latest case highlighting failures in European Union money laundering controls from Latvia to Denmark. “I fear that countries in Europe are oblivious to fighting financial crime,” Ana Gomes, a Portuguese member of the European Parliament, said following news of the settlement by the largest financial services provider in the Netherlands. ING’s penalty coincides with European regulators considering whether to tighten regional controls of financial crime and one official with knowledge of the matter said money laundering may be raised at a meeting of EU finance ministers this week. Latvia, which had styled its banking center as a financial bridge between Russia and the west, had to close one of its banks after it was accused by the United States of money laundering and breaking sanctions. Meanwhile, Denmark's Danske Bank DANSKE.CO has also been in the spotlight. It has admitted to flaws in its anti-money laundering controls in Estonia and a year ago launched its own inquiry, the results of which are expected this month. “The system is now designed to allow money laundering. It is full of holes. We need serious European rules with pan-European powers of enforcement,” Gomes added. Europe has made some reforms, requiring countries to set up centralized bank account registers, but cooperation across borders remains poor and the European Parliament has asked the European Central Bank (ECB), which monitors the bloc’s big banks, to step up its anti-money laundering checks. The ECB, which declined to comment, has long said its powers are limited, but fresh legislation is unlikely until a new European Parliament takes office after elections next year. In the case of ING, Dutch prosecutors highlighted a series of lapses that they said followed years when it put profit ahead of controls, leaving the compliance department understaffed and able only to investigate the “tip of the iceberg”. ING admitted to shortcomings which had allowed clients “to use their bank accounts for money laundering practices for years” and its chief executive Ralph Hamers said it had taken “drastic measures” to prevent a repetition. The prosecutors also said that $55 million had been paid by telecoms group VEON, formerly VimpelCom, out of an account at ING via a Gibraltar-based company to Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of the former president of Uzbekistan. Despite being alerted, ING took years to pass the information to the authorities, they added in their report. The Uzbek Prosecutor General’s office said last year that Karimova was in custody following a conviction for embezzlement. Her Swiss lawyer Gregoire Mangeat said she had been “detained arbitrarily”, adding it was not possible to talk to her. In another of the cases highlighted by Dutch prosecutors, two companies importing fruit and vegetables from South America ran up cash deposits of more than a half a million euros, before ING was alerted by police. It then closed the accounts. Prosecutors said that the Netherlands’ central bank (DNB) had warned ING as early as 2008 that its procedures were insufficient, but lead prosecutor Margreet Frohberg told Reuters that it had failed to act in earnest until 2016. A DNB spokesman said that Dutch banks had begun improving their controls as early as 2008, but moved too slowly: “A minimalist interpretation and a mechanical implementation of the laws is insufficient. More really has to happen.” “The financial sector knows this ... but we’re still far from where we need to be,” he said, adding that the Netherlands was increasing penalties and demanding tighter controls."
-1.9523622822193565," Dutch bank ING fined $900 million for failing to spot money laundering AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch bank ING Groep NV admitted criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts on Tuesday and agreed to pay 775 million euros ($900 million) to settle the case. “The shortcomings identified resulted in clients having been able to use their bank accounts for money laundering practices for years”, ING said in a statement, after signing one the largest ever such settlements in the Netherlands. Dutch financial crime prosecutors said ING had violated laws on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism “structurally and for years” by not properly vetting the beneficial owners of client accounts and by not noticing unusual transactions through them. ING, the Netherlands’ largest financial services provider, said it was impossible to estimate how much money was laundered through its accounts, but lead prosecutor Margreet Frohberg told Reuters “hundreds of millions of euros” were involved. The fine is not ING’s first for failing to prevent illegal transactions. In 2012 it paid a penalty of $619 million for facilitating billions of dollars worth of payments through the U.S. banking system on behalf of Cuban and Iranian clients. In the latest case, which had led to questions from regulators in the United States, Dutch prosecutors said they had begun their investigation in 2016 after realizing that a pattern of violations was a signal of deeper underlying problems at ING. They cited four examples where ING accounts were used for crime, most notably for bribes paid by telecommunications company VEON, formerly VimpelCom, in Uzbekistan. VEON settled U.S. and Dutch charges for $835 million in 2016. “We had various ongoing criminal investigations and ING bank accounts cropped up repeatedly”, Frohberg said in a telephone interview. “Since 2008, ING was repeatedly warned, but it failed to take sufficient measures to stop the practice.” While ING’s Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said no individual at the bank was found to be responsible for the failures, or had personally benefited, it had taken measures against around 10 employees, varying from dismissals to clawing back bonuses. “We have made unacceptable mistakes” Hamers told reporters. “This calls for drastic measures, which we have taken.” Hamers denied any relation between the latest case and the earlier U.S. penalty. “You can’t simply draw a line from that to this”, he said. “Which is not to say that we have done things right here.” ING has since improved its procedures for admitting and vetting clients, Hamers said, while the executive board has agreed to forgo a bonus for 2018. Of the settlement, 675 million euros was as a fine and 100 million as the return of illicit gains, prosecutors said. ING, which expects no further penalties in the case, said it had not taken a provision ahead of the settlement, adding it will book the fine in the third quarter. “The substantial fine was something that was expected”, KBC Securities analyst Jason Kalamboussis wrote in a note. “With the fine issue behind, ING can look forward.” Shares in the bank were down 2.2 percent at 11.43 euros at 1310 GMT.

Analysts polled for Reuters had seen the figure falling to 1.48 billion euros, compared to 1.65 billion euros in the same quarter a year ago.
