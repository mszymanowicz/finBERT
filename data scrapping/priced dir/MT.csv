Africa’s biggest steel producer, majority owned by Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal SA, said a portion of the stack fell on to a control room where the three were working. “The company has launched an investigation into the cause of the incident. All relevant authorities have been notified and have been on site,” ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a statement. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) said in a statement it would ask the labour department to investigate the incident and whether ArcelorMittal acted fast enough to find the workers. “We are convinced that had it not been for the intense efforts of workers themselves, who risked their own lives and took the initiative searching through the massive pile of rubble to locate workers who were trapped under the building, we would not have been able to recover these bodies,” the union said. ArcelorMittal South Africa said it would cooperate fully with all investigations."

The group also announced that finance chief Aditya Mittal will take over as chief executive from his father Lakshmi, who founded the company in 1976 and will become executive chairman. “We have worked closely together since he joined the company in 1997, indeed in recent years we have effectively been managing the company together,” Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement. The Mittal family owns more than 35% of the company. ArcelorMittal, which employs about 190,000, said it would run a $1 billion cost-cutting programme over the next two years which will include boosting productivity, cutting contractor numbers and reducing office staff by a fifth. Chairman Lakshmi Mittal said market conditions had improved in the fourth quarter, and the company now forecasts 4.5-5.5% growth in steel demand this year. For the year ahead, new CEO Aditya Mittal told a conference call that customers were rebuilding steel inventories and end-user demand was recovering following summer lockdowns. Germany’s Thyssenkrupp on Wednesday raised its full-year outlook for the first time in nearly four years, boosted by a recovery at its steel unit. ArcelorMittal said it would resume dividend payments, of $0.30 per share, and would return a further $570 million to shareholders through a new share buyback programme in addition to a $650 million buyback announced on Tuesday. The Luxembourg-based group’s shares were down 0.5% at 19.12 euros by 0855 GMT, but have recovered strongly from mid-2020 when they were below 10 euros. ArcelorMittal also said the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 had so far been limited on its customers in the manufacturing, construction and automotive industries. Analysts at Jefferies said solid earnings and the new shareholder returns policy should be welcomed by the market. Fourth-quarter core profit almost doubled to $1.73 billion, beating an average forecast of $1.47 billion in a company poll of analysts."

The new furnace, to be constructed at their 50-50 joint venture AM/NS Calvert, will have an annual capacity of 1.5 million metric tonnes and will produce hot-rolled, cold-rolled and coated steel sheets. Calvert currently produces steel sheet products by processing semi-finished products, or slabs, procured from local and overseas suppliers. With the new furnace, Calvert will be able to manufacture some of the slabs needed to produce its steel sheet products on its own, which would shorten lead time and improve productivity, Japan’s biggest steelmaker said in a statement. The new furnace will also produce slabs for automotive flat products, including advanced high-tensile steel sheets, it said. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, said in September it would sell most of its U.S. assets to Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, the largest U.S. producer of iron ore pellets, but it kept AM/NS Calvert."

The company, which makes around 5% of the world’s steel, said core profit (EBITDA) fell 15% from a year earlier to $901 million, compared with an average expectation of $838 million in a company-compiled poll. CEO Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement that steel markets had recovered from a very challenging second quarter, with particular improvement in profits in Brazil and its unit grouping South Africa, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The company said its mining business also fared better, with higher iron ore prices and increased production. It now expects iron ore shipments sold at market prices to be about the same as in 2019. It had previously forecast a 5% decline. ArcelorMittal said it had begun to restart some of its idled capacity, although demand remained below normal, with a second COVID-19 wave adding to uncertainty. The company added that the experience of the past six to seven months had it operating with a leaner cost structure and it aimed to detail more permanent cost savings when it reports full year results in February. It has already decided to close for good its blast furnace in Krakow, Poland. ArcelorMittal also hit its $7 billion net debt target at the end of the quarter, the lowest level since ArcelorMittal’s creation in 2006 and a point at which the company can start returning cash to shareholders. The company is poised to sell its U.S. assets in a cash and shares deal with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc for $1.4 billion in a deal that has allowed it to launch a $500 million share buyback."

76.90566792452829," ArcelorMittal commits to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.LU, the world's largest steelmaker, committed on Wednesday to being carbon neutral by 2050, although it said a level playing field with green border adjustments and abundant, affordable clean energy would be required to get there. The company, which makes around 5% of the world’s steel, said last year it aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30% by 2030. President and chief financial officer Aditya Mittal made the new commitment before speaking about the challenge of decarbonising steel at a conference. He said in a statement all regions of the world would have to contribute to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “As the world’s leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint,” he said. ArcelorMittal has pilot projects looking into two areas - use of hydrogen to convert iron ore to iron and ways of becoming carbon neutral by using sustainable biomass or carbon capture and storage. The company also set out certain policies required to hit the carbon neutral target. Mechanisms such as green border adjustments were needed so that producers could not import cheaper steel made under less stringent environmental criteria elsewhere. Clean energy must be abundant and affordable, necessary infrastructure and finance must be in place and policymakers should accelerate the transition to a circular economy, the steelmaker said. ArcelorMittal said it would give more details of its plans before the end of this year."

Africa's biggest steel producer, which is majority-owned by Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal SA MT.LU, said steel demand had increased quicker than expected due to lockdown-affected construction projects now being completed, increased sales at retail outlets and running at lower stock levels prior to the nationwide lockdown. The company decided to idle the Blast Furnace C at Vanderbijlpark and the Vereeniging Electric Arc Furnace in July until demand recovered. ArcelorMittal South Africa said the restart of the furnace would add around 600,000 tonnes of additional annual flat steel production volumes but exports would still be required at the current demand expectations for 2021. South Africa imposed a nationwide lockdown in March which required furnaces and underground mines to temporally halt operations.

The deal, announced by the two companies on Monday, will make Cleveland-Cliffs the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America and, for ArcelorMittal, give it up to a quarter share of Cleveland-Cliffs’ business and allow it to reward shareholders with a share buy-back. ArcelorMittal shares were up 8.3% in early trading, although had still not made up for losses last week, when markets tumbled over concerns that rising coronavirus cases would hinder the economic recovery. Reuters reported on Sunday, citing sources, that ArcelorMittal was in talks to merge its U.S. operations with Cleveland-Cliffs, which bought U.S. steel producer AK Steel for $3 billion in March. ArcelorMittal will receive $505 million upfront in cash and the remaining roughly two-thirds in the form of equity. The equity arrangement will give ArcelorMittal an initial stake of 16% in Cleveland-Cliffs, which could rise to 25.5%. The deal will include $2 billion of liabilities, including linked to pensions, putting the overall deal value at $3.4 billion. ArcelorMittal said it had now passed its target of offloading $2 billion of assets to reduce its debt, allowing it to carry out a $500 million share buy-back. It has previously agreed to sell stakes in its shipping business and in Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau. ArcelorMittal said it would continue to serve the North American market through operations in Canada and Mexico, which together made 9 million tonnes of steel last year, and its steel processing facility in Calvert, Alabama, a joint venture with Nippon Steel 5401.T.

The combination would signal a new push among steelmakers to consolidate and diversify their business, making it less vulnerable to swings in demand. It would come after Cleveland-Cliffs acquired AK Steel, a U.S. maker of flat-rolled carbon steels, including stainless steel, for $3 billion, including debt, last March. The latest deal could result in the merger of U.S. assets of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal that are worth between $2 billion and $3 billion with Cleveland-Cliffs, one of the sources said. It would be transformative for Cleveland-Cliffs, which has a market value of $2.3 billion and had total long-term debt as of the end of June of $4.5 billion. There is no certainty the negotiations will lead to a deal, the sources said. If, however, the talks prove successful, a deal could be announced in the coming days, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. ArcelorMittal and Cleveland-Cliffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ArcelorMittal’s U.S. business has more than 18,000 employees and 25 facilities, including mines, steelmaking facilities and finishing operations, according to the company’s website. Headquartered in Cleveland, Cleveland-Cliffs employs about 11,000 people across mining and steel manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada. ArcelorMittal said last year it was aiming to offload $2 billion of assets by the middle of 2021 to reduce its debt. In December, it agreed to sell a 50% stake in its shipping business, and has also sold its stake in Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau. After it acquired AK Steel, which derived 66% of its revenue in 2019 from the automotive market, Cleveland-Cliffs experienced a drop in demand from its car manufacturing clients, which were forced to temporarily halt production earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic."

ArcelorMittal, which withdrew its guidance for global steel consumption in May, said the speed and course of the demand recovery following the pandemic remained uncertain. However, steel shipments should improve in the third quarter from the second, when they declined by 23.7% compared with the first three months of the year. “Our base case remains that the demand level in medium term normalises,” Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal told a conference call on Thursday, saying he considered normal to be pre-coronavirus crisis levels. The Luxembourg-based group’s shares were up 1.9% at 9.82 euros ($11.54) at 0800 GMT, putting them among the Europe’s best performing stocks on Thursday, although they are still down 37% this year. The Luxembourg-based company said the automotive sector, a key customer, had restarted and was recovering quite strongly in the United States, with a bounce-back of demand for machinery and metal products in Europe. Net debt fell to $7.8 billion at the end of June from $9.5 billion at the end of March, the lowest since ArcelorMittal’s creation in 2006 and closing in on its target of $7 billion. ArcelorMittal will not resume dividend payments before reaching that target. Analysts at Jefferies said the release of working capital in the second half of the year and expected $1.5 billion of asset sales by mid-2021 would help ArcelorMittal reach its debt target. Second-quarter core profit this year came in at $707 million, beating an average forecast in a company poll of $482 million. The steelmaker said it had taken a series of actions to reduce costs and was looking into potential structural changes. It would announce these with full-year results, which are expected to be published in February 2021."

The dead include employees, contractors and suppliers to the plant, said Carlos Solorio, secretary general of the local branch of the national mining and metallurgical workers’ union. “Everyone was working for the company,” Solorio told Reuters. Nine of the deceased were union members, he added. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer, was not immediately available for comment on the report of the deaths, which were initially made public in a video posted on social media by the union’s president, Senator Napoleon Gomez. Solorio said the 21 deaths had occurred since April, and that the workers likely contracted the virus outside the plant, given the strict sanitary protocols adopted by the firm. The plant employs more than 7,000 people, according to the union. ArcelorMittal has said it has made substantial donations to help tackle the virus in Lazaro Cardenas, a major port on the Pacific coast. With over 385,000 confirmed cases and nearly 43,500 deaths as of Saturday, Mexico has the world’s fourth-highest death toll from coronavirus.

13.734713076199426," ArcelorMittal seeks EU support to make steel greener FRANKFURT (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal on Thursday outlined plans and costs for steelmaking processes that produce less carbon, but also called for investment support from European Union states as well as carbon border taxes. Europe’s steelmakers like ArcelorMittal, are under pressure to cut carbon emissions while maintaining profitability in a market where there is fierce competition, mainly from China. “The support the EU and member states can give to ensure we have a well-designed policy to make large-scale, competitive, carbon-neutral steelmaking a reality, is critical,” Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal said on a call. The company’s green steelmaking plans were outlined in a climate action report on Thursday, which mapped out two processes to meet CO2 goals committed to last year. The aims were to cut its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and to become carbon-neutral by 2050.[nFWN2E115G] Mittal said the two processes were “smart carbon” and direct reduction of iron ore (DRI), both of which are being tested. ArcelorMittal estimated the cost of deploying smart carbon at 15-25 billion euros ($16.86-28.09 billion) and 30-40 billion euros for DRI by 2050, not including infrastructure finance needs. Mittal also called for an EU carbon border tax to fend off carbon-heavy steel imports. “We need a level playing field,” he said. ArcelorMittal’s smart carbon process would use carbon recycled from bioenergy, green electricity, and carbon capture and storage within steelmaking. This method could also use more scrap and would also benefit cement and plastics manufacturers, Mittal said. The use of the DRI process to cut emissions involves a switch from natural gas to hydrogen as the fuel for steelmaking. But this hydrogen must come from purely green sources such as wind, sunshine or biomass, and it needs to become much cheaper. Europe does not currently have enough green power capacity to devote to industries other than energy and needs to build up a hydrogen import infrastructure, stakeholders in the emerging hydrogen economy have said.

The world’s biggest steel producer took over the plant in the southern city of Taranto in 2018 but its rescue plans have triggered months of wrangling. Ministers and labour officials met by video linkup on Tuesday to discuss the latest proposals, which had already prompted unions to call a 24-hour strike. “Mittal on Friday sent us a new plan which in our opinion is unacceptable for two reasons: it questions job levels and challenges planned investment,” Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said during a meeting, according to a source who attended the meeting. After withdrawing its bid to walk away from the deal in exchange for an injection of state funding, ArcelorMittal has presented a plan with new proposals to cut jobs, provoking the ire of the government and the unions. The company has confirmed sending the plan but has not provided any details. Italian media reported at the weekend that the plan included 5,000 job cuts. Ilva employs more than 8,000 people and provides work for thousands more as suppliers or contractors. Patuanelli said the government would try “to reverse” the plan’s terms and safeguard all jobs at the plant, one of the few major industrial employers in Italy’s economically struggling south."

5.850585058505854," ArcelorMittal flags lower profits, hopes lockdown easings herald turnaround for steel BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, forecast its steel shipments would fall by up to a third in the second quarter, leading to sharply lower profits as coronavirus restrictions hit demand. The company said it had suspended dividend payments until further notice and was cutting planned investment this year by a quarter, but Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal said that while there was much uncertainty, the second quarter could be the trough. Lockdowns were easing in Europe, India and some U.S. states, with automakers restarting production, while in China demand had increased significantly, he said. “We would expect that Q2 would be the low point in terms of activity levels but clearly it’s difficult to predict at this time but there are certain signs which would suggest that,” Aditya Mittal told a conference call. The Luxembourg-based group’s shares rose 2.4% to 9.79 euros by 0840 GMT, although they are still down 27% since the start of this year. ArcelorMittal said that as the full impact of the pandemic was “highly uncertain” and varies from country to country, the group was withdrawing its guidance for global steel consumption. It now simply says steel demand will be lower than in 2019. The company said its core profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) in the second quarter would be $400 million-$600 million. In the second quarter of last year it was $1.56 billion. First-quarter core profit this year came in at $967 million, beating an average forecast in a company poll of $867 million. ArcelorMittal’s steel shipments would be within a range of 13.5 million-14.5 million tonnes in April-June. That would be down by between a quarter and a third from the first-quarter level of 19.5 million tonnes, which was a fall of 10.7% from a year earlier. Mittal said demand for steel for packaging, often used for food, had held up; manufacturing and construction were down, but not as much as expected in many countries; while automakers had shut down their facilities early on. ArcelorMittal had proposed a dividend for 2019 of $0.30 per share, now suspended. It said it was also reducing its cash needs for this year. “Certain cash needs of the business are now expected to be approximately $3.5 bln in 2020 (versus $4.5 bln previous guidance), due to lower planned capex (reduced to $2.4 bln from $3.2 bln previous guidance) and lower taxes,” it said. Jefferies analysts said in a research note that the suspended dividend and low cash needs highlighted the company’s focus on preserving cash as COVID-19 disruption peaked in the second and third quarters. ArcelorMittal said its net debt rose to $9.5 billion in the first quarter, from $9.3 billion at the end of 2019. It reiterated that it wants to get this down to $7 billion in the near term."

-23.155044008124577," ArcelorMittal signs deal to suspend plans to exit Ilva steelworks MILAN (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS said on Wednesday it had signed a deal that would see a significant injection of Italian state funding into the Ilva steelworks and would suspend a bid to walk away from the troubled plant, which it took over in 2018. The accord provides a respite in the four-month dispute that has seen ArcelorMittal threatening to hand back Ilva to the government after disagreements over plans to rescue the plant that was losing 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a day last year. The deal will see Rome taking an equity stake at least equal to Arcelor Mittal’s remaining liabilities against the original purchase price for Ilva. If the agreement is completed, the original lease and purchase agreement under which ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, took over Ilva will close by May 2022. However final settlement will depend on a new investment plan being executed by November 30. Otherwise ArcelorMittal said it could withdraw from the deal subject to an agreed payment. The future of the plant has been a headache to successive Italian governments, which have struggled to balance the need to clean up the polluted site in the southern city of Taranto and that to safeguard thousands of jobs in the underdeveloped south. Last year, ArcelorMittal announced it was pulling out of the 2018 takeover agreement after parliament scrapped a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks during a clean-up of the heavily polluting factory. In response, the Ilva commissioners requested an injunction to block the move in a case that was scheduled to be heard in a Milan court on Friday but which will now be dropped.. Under the investment plan, Ilva will invest in lower-carbon steelmaking technologies, with a DRI (Direct reduced Iron) facility to be built, funded and operated by outside investors, and an EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) to be built by ArcelorMittal. Italian trade unions criticized the accord which it said left key questions open on the future of a plant that employs more than 8,000 workers with thousands more dependent as suppliers or contractors. “There is a total unknown on ArcelorMittal’s financial commitment in the new company,” the Cgil, Cisl and Uil unions said in a joint statement. “This agreement only resolves legal disputes but does not provide answers on the main nodes of the group’s plants”, Rocco Palombella, head of metalworkers’ union Uilm."

ArcelorMittal’s decision to withdraw was a blow to the coalition government, with Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli saying the steel giant had used the legal issue to escape a potentially loss-making deal. Originally, Rome and ArcelorMittal had agreed to develop a new industrial plan for a site that employs about 8,000 workers in the city of Taranto and in November was losing around 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a day. The dispute ended up in court, with ArcelorMittal making a request to pull out of Ilva and the government filing against the steelmaker’s decision to leave. ArcelorMittal lawyer Ferdinando Emanuele and Ilva commissioners lawyer Enrico Castellani told Reuters the agreement would be signed on Wednesday and that both sides would ask the Milan court to drop both the lawsuits. Castellani told Reuters the two sides would file their requests electronically, asking the court to cancel the upcoming hearing of March 6. The lawyers said details of the deal were confidential.

The world’s biggest steelmaker had tried to walk away from a 2018 deal after parliament scrapped a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks during a clean-up of the heavily polluting factory. But the steelmaker has since returned to discussions. “Negotiations between the two parties have made a significant step forward and set a new deadline to Feb. 28,” ArcelorMittal lawyer Ferdinando Emanuele told reporters. The future of the plant has been a headache to successive Italian governments, which have faced the challenge of balancing the need to clean up years of environmental damage with protecting thousands of jobs in the economically struggling south. A Milan court was scheduled to discuss on Friday a government bid to stop ArcelorMittal’s withdrawal from the plant, but the hearing has been postponed to March 6 in order to let the two parties reach a final deal, the lawyer added. Asked if ArcelorMittal could still walk away from Europe’s biggest steel plant, the lawyer said: “I’m not aware. We’re here to negotiate”. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government and ArcelorMittal agreed last year to develop a new industrial plan for the site that employs about 8.200 workers in the city of Taranto."
-39.839721799640635," ArcelorMittal forecast of steel pick-up, debt drop lifts shares BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS, the world's largest steelmaker, forecast increased demand and a drop in its debt levels this year after earnings beat forecasts at the end of 2019, lifting its shares. Market conditions remained challenging, Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal told a conference call, although there were early signs of improvement, particularly in ArcelorMittal’s core markets of the United States, Europe and Brazil. The Luxembourg-based group's stock rose as much as 11% in early trading and was the strongest performer in the FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading European shares. Mittal said destocking accounted for at least half of the demand declines from its three main markets last year. Now, with inventories at very low levels, customers were returning to the market, supporting prices. For now at least, the company forecast the coronavirus health crisis would lead to a weak first quarter in China but a rebound in the second half of the year, leading to a muted overall impact, he added. ArcelorMittal ships almost half its steel to European customers, around a quarter to the United States and has just one joint venture automotive steel plant in China, which is the world’s largest steel producer and consumer. Even in China and despite the coronavirus outbreak, ArcelorMittal saw overall steel demand growing by up to 1%. After a very tough 2019, when the company made a net loss of $2.45 billion, the steelmaker had made strides toward its goal of bringing net debt below $7 billion. “We’re now focused on achieving that by the end of 2020,” Mittal said. Net debt fell to $9.3 billion at the end of 2019, the lowest level since the company was formed in 2006 through the merger of Arcelor and Mittal Steel. The company said fourth-quarter core profit (EBITDA), the figure most watched by the market, was $925 million, compared with the average forecast of $858 million in a company poll. “The profit figure was slightly positive but the narrative here is that of the first signs of improvement of steel consumption and also the low impact of the coronavirus,” Ingo Martin Schachel, an analyst at Commerzbank told Reuters. ArcelorMittal said global steel consumption, including the impact of inventory changes, would grow in 2020 by 1-2% after an expansion of 1.1% in 2019. In the United States, steel consumption would be up to 1% higher than in 2019, when it dropped 1.7%, while in Europe, consumption would grow by between 1% and 2% after a 4.3% slump last year, although the automotive sector would remain weak. Steel demand in Brazil would also return to growth this year, ArcelorMittal said."
-40.189689378204534," Italian court eases the way for Ilva talks between government and Arcelor TARANTO, Italy (Reuters) - An Italian court ruled on Tuesday that one of three blast furnaces at ArcelorMittal's MT.AS Ilva steel plant need not be shut down despite concerns it was in breach of safety rules, throwing a lifeline to the loss-making plant in southern Italy. The decision overturns a previous order from a local magistrate that the furnace should be closed after the death of a worker at Europe’s biggest steel plant in the city of Taranto. The ruling removes a potential hurdle in talks between state-appointed commissioners managing the Ilva plant and ArcelorMittal to revive a 2018 deal for the world’s biggest steelmaker to buy the loss-making steelworks. ArcelorMittal announced in November it was pulling out of the 2018 deal, giving the closure order as one reason behind its move. It argued it could not produce sufficient steel from the remaining furnaces to return the firm to profit. Tuesday’s ruling gave the commissioners up to 12 months to fulfil a set of requirements to make the furnace compliant with environmental and safety rules, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters. The Indian-based steelmaker had also blamed its threatened exit on the Italian government’s move to scrap a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks while it carried out the clean-up at Ilva’s heavily polluted site. Last December the commissioners and Arcelor agreed to extend their talks until Jan. 31 in a bid to find an accord. A Milan court postponed a hearing, previously scheduled in December, to Feb. 7 to discuss a government bid to stop ArcelorMittal’s withdrawal from Ilva, to leave room for the negotiations. The government is also considering becoming an investor in Ilva, which directly employs around 8,200 workers in Taranto, through the state-owned agency Invitalia, Italy’s Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said in November. As part of its intervention, the Italian government could sound out the willingness of some Italian creditor banks to become shareholders of Ilva, converting part of their loans into equity, Italian daily Il Messaggero reported on Tuesday."

The world’s biggest steelmaker had tried to walk away from a 2018 deal to buy the site after parliament scrapped a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks during a clean-up of the heavily polluting factory. “There is an agreement that lays out the groundwork for negotiations that will continue until a deadline of Jan. 31 in order to reach a binding accord,” ArcelorMittal lawyer Ferdinando Emanuele told reporters.

Talks between the government and ArcelorMittal resumed in November after a meeting between Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the company’s management. On that occasion, Rome and ArcelorMittal agreed to develop a new industrial plan for the site that employs around 8.200 workers in Taranto, a city in Italy’s underdeveloped south. In a separate legal case focusing on the death of a worker at the Taranto site in 2015, a court has ordered that one of the plant’s main blasting furnaces be shut down on the grounds that it does not comply with safety regulations. The closure would reduce the site’s productive capacity and profitability, complicating efforts by the government to strike a new deal with Arcelor. The commissioners have appealed the ruling and a final decision is expected on Dec. 30."

-47.08149779735683," ArcelorMittal aims for 30% cut in emissions in Europe by 2030 LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal MT.AS announced plans on Friday to cut emissions by 30% at its European operations by 2030, two days after the European Union laid out its program to be carbon neutral by 2050. ArcelorMittal also said it aimed to publish a target for the whole group in the middle of next year. The steel industry is responsible for about 7% of global emissions. Pressure is mounting on the sector, especially in Europe, to reduce its climate impact as the new European Commission, in office since the start of December, has made carbon neutrality the top priority. “Our roadmap and the emissions reduction target of 30% by 2030 for Europe is a big step in the right direction,” Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, said in a statement. The target for a 30% cut from 2018 levels covers flat steel products, which form the bulk of ArcelorMittal’s European output and are used in industries such as carmaking and construction. Van Poelvoorde said ArcelorMittal supported the European Commission’s so-called green deal on achieving carbon neutrality, and reiterated the company’s demands for a carbon border tax to prevent industry leaving Europe in favour of cheaper but dirtier production elsewhere. The Commission has said it will start work immediately on a levy on imports with higher carbon footprints than EU-made products. ArcelorMittal said its emissions roadmap included steelmaking using clean energy, such as hydrogen, rather than fossil fuel, as well as carbon capture and storage, which involves capturing the emissions from traditional steelmaking and storing them or re-using them in industrial processes. Efforts to implement carbon capture and storage have failed for years to reach commercial scale, but ArcelorMittal says a project in Ghent, Belgium, to capture waste gases from a steelmaking blast furnace and convert them into bio-ethanol will be completed in 2020. It says technology to replace coal in steelmaking with hydrogen is further away from commercial operation. Swedish partners LKAB, SSAB SSABa.ST and Vattenfall say they have one of the most advanced hydrogen projects - HYBRIT. They aim to produce fossil-free steel by 2026 and to use the technology widely by 2035. Across Europe, steelmakers are testing ways to reduce carbon emissions as financial analysts say it is becoming essential to eliminate fossil fuel and clean up supply chains to attract investors. Climate talks meant to conclude this week in Madrid, have highlighted the discrepancy between the urgent change scientists and campaigners say is necessary and the reluctance of some nations and businesses to tackle economic and business reform."

-12.339930151338761," Italy to restart talks with ArcelorMittal over ailing Ilva steel plant ROME (Reuters) - Steelmaker ArcelorMittal MT.AS has agreed to immediately restart talks with the Italian government over the future of the Ilva plant, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said after a four-hour meeting with the company. Rome and ArcelorMittal are on the brink of a legal battle as the latter tries to walk away from a 2018 deal to buy the steel plant in the southern city of Taranto, which directly employs around 8,200 workers in one of Italy’s least prosperous areas. India-based ArcelorMittal has blamed its threatened exit on the Italian government’s move to scrap a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks while it carried out the clean-up at Ilva’s heavily polluted site. Conte said ArcelorMittal executives were available to start talks to decide on a new shared future for Ilva, Europe’s biggest steel plant. “The aim ... is to get to a new industrial plan, with new production solutions and new ecological technologies allowing the highest effort in cleaning up the environment,” Conte said late on Friday. His comments came after a meeting in Rome with ArcelorMittal Chairman and Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal, and his son Aditya Mittal, the group’s chief financial officer and CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe. ArcelorMittal said on Saturday the meeting was constructive. “Talks will continue with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as possible for sustainable steel production in Taranto,” it said in a statement. Italy’s Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the meeting had created the right conditions for a positive outcome at Ilva and for an investment plan which combines industrial development and environmental safeguards. “The situation is back on positive tracks,” Gualtieri said, adding he did not want to sound over-optimistic but thought it was possible not to end up in court and settle the Ilva crisis with the company’s relaunch and ArcelorMittal still involved. To facilitate the talks, the government will ask for the postponement of a court hearing scheduled for Nov. 27 over an appeal filed by Rome to try to stop ArcelorMittal’s planned decision to shut Ilva. “We’re ready to allow this postponement under the condition that ArcelorMittal agrees to keep the plant working and production flowing during talks,” Conte said. According to trade unions, ArcelorMittal was ready to hand over the plant to state-appointed administrators on Dec. 4 and had begun winding down operations ahead of turning off blast furnaces and production lines. However, earlier this week ArcelorMittal said it would halt the planned shutdown pending the court ruling. Conte said legal immunity was not discussed at the meeting but opened up the possibility that the state could play a direct role in Ilva, given its importance for the wider Italian economy. Rome is also ready to adopt measures to support Ilva’s workers, Conte said, adding that the highest levels of employment must be preserved."

The company said it was providing the “information requested”. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Italian government filed an urgent court appeal on Friday to try to stop ArcelorMittal walking away from a 2018 deal to buy the heavily polluting Ilva plant, which employs some 8,200 workers in an area of high unemployment. ArcelorMittal announced its decision to withdraw from the deal after the government scrapped a guarantee of legal immunity for its managers during the clean-up of the Taranto steel plant. The government said the group had no legal grounds to pull out of the contract and has accused it of using the immunity issue as a pretext to walk away from Ilva due to heavy losses. Magistrates in Milan are investigating suspected market manipulation and other offences connected with company property, a source close to the matter said. On Monday, ArcelorMittal said it would stop a planned shutdown of the plant pending the legal ruling. A court hearing will take place in Milan on November 27 and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has scheduled a meeting with the company this Friday."

3.708140173931819," Italy files appeal to stop ArcelorMittal walking away from Ilva MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's government filed an urgent court appeal on Friday to try to stop ArcelorMittal MT.AS walking away from a 2018 deal to buy the troubled Ilva steel plant, as a union said the group was preparing to leave on Dec 4. ArcelorMittal has blamed a government move to scrap previous guarantees of legal immunity during a massive clean-up operation at Ilva’s heavily polluted plant in the southern city of Taranto. But the government has said the group has no legal grounds to pull out of the contract and has accused it of using the immunity issue as a pretext to walk away from Ilva because it is running up heavy losses there. The FIM-CISL union said the company had confirmed it would hand over Europe’s biggest steel plant to state-appointed administrators on Dec. 4 and had begun winding down operations ahead of turning off blast furnaces and production lines. No comment was immediately available from the company. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he would not allow ArcelorMittal to shut down operations, saying any such move would represent a “clear violation” of its obligations. “The government will not let them deliberately pursue the closure of blast furnaces, which would mean the end of any prospect of relaunching this productive investment and safeguarding employment levels,” he wrote on Facebook. Conte’s coalition has come under heavy pressure as it battles to save thousands of jobs in an area with some of the highest levels of unemployment in Italy and at the same time ensure a clean-up of decades of environmental damage from the sprawling Ilva plant. The government’s appeal in Milan could be the first step in a protracted legal tussle over the future of Ilva after Conte last week promised “the battle of the century” if the case came to the courts. Separately, Milan prosecutors said they had opened a dossier to decide whether there were grounds to start a criminal investigation into possible job losses and environmental damage at the plant, which employs around 8,200 workers, with thousands more jobs depending indirectly on the site. Under Italian law, the procedure followed by the prosecutors is intended only to establish whether any criminal offences may have been committed and does not target any suspects or include any specific allegations. The Milan prosecutors’ office said there was a “strong public interest around the protection of employment levels, the economic and productive needs of the country and the obligations concerning a process of environmental rehabilitation”."

No comment was immediately available from ArcelorMittal."
3.708140173931819," India's top court clears path for ArcelorMittal to acquire Essar Steel NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court cleared the path on Friday for steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA MT.AS to take over bankrupt Essar Steel, following a legal tussle that has dragged through multiple courts for over two years. “We are very pleased with the judgment that our resolution plan has been approved. We look forward to the closing of the acquisition soon,” said an ArcelorMittal’s spokesperson. The highest court said operational creditors could not be treated on a par with financial creditors of a bankrupt company, in a ruling that provides relief to lenders and sets a precedent that could speed-up the resolution of other insolvency cases. Banks had moved to the Supreme Court earlier this year after an appellate court judgment put the claims of Essar’s operational creditors on a par with those of its lenders. Before that, the core committee of bankers in charge of coming up with a resolution plan had decided financial creditors would get paid 90% of their claims, compared with a 20.5% payout for operational creditors with dues of over 10 million rupees. However, this was overturned by an appellate tribunal that decided banks would be paid 60.7% of their dues and operational creditors with dues above 10 million could claim 59.6%. The Supreme Court ruled, however, that the appellate court could not interfere with decisions of the core committee of creditors involved in such resolution processes. Essar Steel, with debts from banks worth nearly 500 billion rupees ($7 billion), was among the so-called dirty dozen - twelve large steel and other infrastructure companies that defaulted and were referred to India’s bankruptcy court in 2017. The judgment comes as a big reprieve for Indian banks which are struggling with bad loans worth $140 billion. “The resolution plans of many companies will get crystallized in a very effective manner over the next few months which will free up the banking system for fresh lending,” said Vasanth Rajasekaran, partner at Delhi-based Phoenix Legal, which represents some of the lenders to Essar Steel."

4.93827160493827," ArcelorMittal to halt Polish plant on Nov. 23 WARSAW (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal Poland will temporarily halt its blast furnace and steel plant in Krakow, southern Poland, on Nov. 23, due to a weakening outlook for the market, the company said on Tuesday. ArcelorMittal, which is Poland’s biggest steel producer, announced in May that it would close operations at its Polish plant in September due to rising carbon emission costs, surging power prices and decreasing demand. It then decided to postpone the stoppage and took extra measures at its three blast furnaces in Poland to adjust to lower demand. “Our three blast furnaces are now working at their technological minimum so we cannot reduce production volumes any further. As the situation on the steel market continues to deteriorate and the outlook remains gloomy, we regrettably have no choice but to temporarily idle the blast furnace in Krakow,” ArcelorMittal Chief Executive Geert Verbeeck said in a statement. The company, which employs more than 11,000 people in Poland, said, citing EUROFER data, that steel demand in Europe is expected to fall by 3.1% this year. It reiterated that it intends to restart the operations in Krakow when “market conditions improve adequately to justify a restart leading to economically viable operations”. The steel maker said that a majority of its employees will be offered jobs at ArcelorMittal other plants in Poland."
3.319743739079771," Italy ready for 'legal battle of century' with ArcelorMittal: Conte ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government will fight ArcelorMittal MT.AS in the courts if it goes back on a pledge to buy steelmaker Ilva, but Rome still hopes to avoid a bruising legal showdown, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday. “We would all lose if there were a legal battle, but should it happen, it will be the legal battle of the century,” Conte, himself a lawyer, told state television RAI in an interview. ArcelorMittal said this week it was withdrawing from a deal to buy Ilva, blaming its decision on a government move to scrap previous guarantees of legal immunity during a massive clean-up operation at Ilva’s huge Taranto plant. Conte and his infrastructure minister both declined to rule out the option of nationalising the company if talks with ArcelorMittal prove fruitless. Conte said the government was ready to restore the legal shield if that was the sticking point, but added that ArcelorMittal’s real problem was that it no longer thought its industrial plan for the company was workable. Conte said ArcelorMittal’s managers told him on Wednesday they could not meet their production targets for Taranto and that to be financially viable they had to shed some 5,000 employees -- roughly half their Italian workforce. The prime minister said this was unacceptable, adding that he wanted to meet ArcelorMittal’s CEO in the coming hours. “This is not a legal problem. The problem is that their industrial plan is not sustainable,” Conte said. “We are working 24 hours a day looking at all the possible options.” Asked whether the government may take permanent ownership of Ilva, Conte said it was evaluating all possibilities, a message reiterated later on Thursday by Infrastructure Minister Paola De Micheli. Asked on the sidelines of a conference near Milan whether the government was ready to nationalise the steelmaker, De Micheli replied: “we are ready for everything.” She added that the ruling coalition would remain united over the issue whatever it decides, and will “tackle negotiations with ArcelorMittal head on.” Unions have called a 24-hour strike for Friday at ArcelorMittal’s various Italian operations to protest at its reported plans to cut jobs and possibly quit the country."
3.319743739079771," ArcelorMittal beats expectations despite weak U.S., Europe BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, cut its forecasts for demand in its main U.S. and European markets but reported a higher-than-expected core profit. The Luxembourg-based company said on Thursday its third-quarter core profit (EBITDA), the figure most watched by the market, was $1.06 billion, compared with the average forecast in a company poll of $930 million. ArcelorMittal shares were up 8.2% at 15.70 euros at 0720 GMT, making them among the strongest performers in the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares. The seesaw stock is 29% higher than a month earlier, but 31% lower year-on-year. “There is a lot of pressure on European steel spreads. There’s nothing positive on selling prices. Clearly they have done a good job managing their cost base,” Commerzbank analyst Ingo Schachel said. ArcelorMittal said global steel consumption, including the impact of inventory changes, would grow in 2019 by 0.5-1.0%, towards the lower end of its previous guidance of 0.5-1.5%. Reporting a net loss of $539 million for the third quarter - a second straight quarter in the red - it said it now expected a reduction in U.S. steel demand due to a weak auto sector and a slowdown in demand for machinery. Non-residential construction was healthy, however. It also said the contraction in steel demand in Europe would be worse than expected due to a sluggish auto sector and slowing construction. ArcelorMittal has already idled a series of steel plants in Europe. The company did upgrade its forecasts for the former Soviet Union and China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel. But ArcelorMittal ships almost half its steel to European customers, around a quarter to the United States and has negligible business in China. The company, which produces around 5% of global steel, said it now expected its own shipments to be stable this year, having previously forecast a year-on-year increase. Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement that ArcelorMittal had anticipated a tough market as low prices and high raw materials costs squeezed margins. The company’s net debt, a key metric for markets, increased by $0.5 billion to $10.7 billion. It has a target to pull it below $7 billion. The company said it would release at least $1.4 billion of working capital in the fourth quarter to enable it to reduce net debt further. Cash needs and capital expenditure would be lower than previously expected."

10.42982932996208," Italian PM says ArcelorMittal wants mass layoffs, govt rejects demand ROME (Reuters) - Steel giant ArcelorMittal MT.AS wants to cut 5,000 jobs in Italy because of low production levels at its Taranto plant, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday, denouncing the plan as ""unacceptable"". The mooted layoffs at the Ilva steelworks in Taranto came just two days after ArcelorMittal announced that it planned to pull out of a year-old deal to buy the Italian company. ArcelorMittal blamed its decision at time on the government’s failure to renew a legal shield it had previously provided which gave the firm immunity from prosecution while it cleaned up the heavily polluting plant. Conte met ArcelorMittal managers earlier in the day and said it was clear the legal shield had nothing to do with the threat to quit Italy. The real problem was that the firm had not hit its production targets, he told reporters. “The legal shield is not the issue. The company believes that the current production level of 4 million tonnes a year does not cover its investments and cannot justify current job numbers,” Conte said. There was no immediate comment from ArcelorMittal. ArcelorMittal took control of Ilva in November 2018 and has some 10,700 employees in Italy, including 8,200 in Taranto -- the largest such steel plant in Europe. Conte said it had aimed to produce 6 million tonnes of steel a year in Taranto. He added that ArcelorMittal could not turn around one year into its contract and announce that its plan was no longer viable. The prime minister said he had given ArcelorMittal two days to rethink its position, but acknowledged that he had received no commitment from the company to review its stance. “It is premature to say how this will end. The layoff plan they have presented is clearly unacceptable. Any layoff plan is unacceptable,” Conte said, adding: “This first meeting does not give us much hope.”"
-2.5672431193616734," Italy's center-left PD proposes immunity for past damage at Ilva MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's center-left Democratic Party (PD), part of the ruling coalition, will propose restoring legal immunity to ArcelorMittal MT.AS for past environmental damage caused by troubled steel group Ilva, the party's leader said on Tuesday. “Anyone who pollutes should pay but a group implementing an environmental plan should not have penal liability for previous actions for which it had no responsibility. We will propose parliamentary measures in this sense,” PD party leader Nicola Zingaretti said on a statement. ArcelorMittal said on Monday it was abandoning a deal to buy Ilva’s huge steel works in the southern city of Taranto after Rome reneged on a pledge to give it immunity from prosecution over environmental damage at the heavily polluting plant."
-5.471130366496632," ArcelorMittal to hand Ilva plant back to Italian state over legal row ROME (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS said on Monday it was withdrawing from a deal to buy struggling Italian steelmaker Ilva after Rome reneged on a promise to give it immunity from prosecution over its heavily polluting plant. The decision represents a blow to Italy’s ruling coalition, which had hoped to dissuade the steel giant from pulling out of the contract, and will raise questions about the country’s reliability as a partner for foreign investors. ArcelorMittal reached a deal last year to buy Ilva, which is based in the southern city of Taranto and employs 8,000 workers in a region with one of the highest unemployment rates in Italy. Thousands more jobs are indirectly tied to the site. The government’s promised legal shield would have given ArcelorMittal immunity from possible costly prosecution related to a planned clean-up at the plant, which has been blamed for hundreds of cancer-related deaths in recent years. However, Italy’s ruling 5-Star Movement has opposed handing the firm legal carte blanche, saying it was unfair to Taranto locals whose health might have suffered because of the steelmaker. Parliament ditched the shield effective Nov. 3. “It is not possible to manage the plant without this protection, and it is not possible to expose employees and contractors to potential criminal charges,” Lucia Morselli, the CEO of ArcelorMittal’s Italian unit, wrote in a letter to staff. She said the company would start shutting down the plant’s furnaces and hand back the firm within 30 days. Government officials met Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to discuss the situation, which could generate major friction within the coalition between 5-Star and its centre-left partners, the Democratic Party and Italia Viva. Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli accused ArcelorMittal of hiding behind a fig leaf and said the government would not allow the Taranto plant to close and would guarantee production. “The legal shield is clearly an alibi because it has nothing to do with the production process,” he told reporters, calling on the steelmaking giant to respect last year’s deal. A government source said Rome believed the shield was an alibi because the Ilva plant loses 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a day. But the source said the ruling coalition parties were considering ways to revive some form of legal guarantee. In a tweet, Conte said he would meet ArcelorMittal management on Tuesday afternoon to try to safeguard investment and jobs and press ahead with the clean-up plans. The opposition far-right League said the prime minister would have to resign if the firm did indeed pull out of Ilva, which is one of Italy’s largest industrial concerns. “If the government ... forces the owners of Ilva to flee, putting at risk tens of thousands of jobs and the industrial future of the country, it will be a disaster,” League leader Matteo Salvini said in a statement. At its peak, Ilva produced more than 10 million tonnes of steel a year but output halved after magistrates intervened in 2012 and said it had to be cleaned up or shut down. Ilva was placed under state-supervised special administration in 2015. When it agreed to buy the plant, ArcelorMittal said that with its know-how, it could turn around the loss-making business and promised to sink billions of euros into the company."

4.521276595744691," Italy to scrap ArcelorMittal legal shield for Ilva plant: lawmaker ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling coalition has decided to scrap a legal guarantee it had previously granted to steelmaker ArcelorMittal MT.AS over its Ilva plant, a senior Democratic Party (PD) lawmaker said on Monday. The move could worsen relations between the Italian government and the global steel group, which bought the plant in southern Italy last year and has threatened to shut it down if the legal guarantee was revoked. Dario Stefano, the centre-left PD’s deputy Senate leader, told Reuters the PD and its coalition partner the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement had jointly agreed to drop the legislation granting the immunity. The guarantee gives the Ilva plant immunity from prosecution related to a clean-up plan for the plant. Italian Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli will meet ArcelorMittal’s managers in the next few days, a government source said. ArcelorMittal was not immediately available for comment. In June, the previous coalition of 5-Star and the right-wing League scrapped the legal immunity ArcelorMittal received as part of its purchase of the heavily polluting steel plant, which it promised to bring up to required environmental standards. The new government of 5-Star and the PD, which took office in September, reinstated temporary and limited protection in an emergency decree which the upper house Senate was due to approve this week. That protection scheme will now be removed, Stefano said, adding that the decision will be formalised at a vote in the Senate industry committee later on Monday. The 5-Star Movement, which has a strong environmentalist platform, used to advocate the closure of Ilva prior to a March 2018 national election. Stefano said the PD will ask the government to ensure job levels are safeguarded at the plant, which is located in the city of Taranto in Italy’s under-developed south, where it employs more than 8,000 workers. In June, senior steel industry executives urged the European Commission to strengthen measures to protect against a surge in imports triggered by U.S. tariffs, saying the future of the European industry was under threat."
23.997233748271082," ArcelorMittal South Africa may close some sites as it battles weak economy JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal’s South Africa unit said on Wednesday it may close some operations pending a review as it looks to strengthen its long-term sustainability and battle cheap imports, rising costs and a flagging local economy. The company, majority-owned by ArcelorMittal, said its review would exclude its coke operations and the Highveld Structural Mill but would include some of its major operating sites, individual plants and production areas. ArcelorMittal South Africa, which has for some time complained about cheap imports eating into its business, has also been hit by subdued investment and infrastructure spending in the country, as well as a weak South African economy. “By actively addressing those operating sites, individual plants and production areas which historically have had a negative impact on the company’s financial results, the board aims to strengthen the financial fundamentals of those business areas,” the firm said in a statement. The company said it had begun consultations with its employees and trade unions on jobs but did not provide further details. In July the firm said it planned to cut more than 2,000 jobs."
14.999999999999991," Ukrainian tax authority refutes comments by official on ArcelorMittal probe KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's state tax service on Wednesday said no decisions had been made about a probe into ArcelorMittal MT.AS taxes, dismissing comments by one of its own officials who had said the steelmaker owed the state 9 billion hryvnias ($355 million). Evgen Bambizov, who is listed on the department’s website as head of the large taxpayers’ office, had spoken to media about an investigation into ArcelorMittal. He was quoted as saying the company had paid too little tax. But the state tax service said Bambizov did not have the authority to speak about the probe because he was not the head of the large taxpayers’ office but the head of a commission on reorganizing that office. “Regarding Evgen Bambizov’s statements to journalists about alleged tax assessments and penalties for a number of enterprises, the state tax service states that these issues are outside the scope of E. Bambizov’s authority,” it said. “Currently, tax audits of these enterprises have not been completed; no decisions have been made.” Bambizov’s press office issued a statement saying that he was still in charge of the large taxpayers’ office, however, and that he stood by his earlier comments on the probe. ArcelorMittal, Ukraine’s biggest private foreign investor, has been in the spotlight after an environmental investigation at its plant in the city of Kryvyi Rih was launched this year. That investigation caused some concern among investors at a time when new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is from Kryvyi Rih and criticized ArcelorMittal in July, is pitching to make the country more business friendly. In its own statement on Wednesday, ArcelorMittal said there had been a probe by the large taxpayers’ office between May and August but that it had not been notified of the results or been given time to give its own statements about the audit. “In this regard, we were extremely surprised by today’s public statements by the head of the office of large taxpayers,” it said. “We believe that it is premature and incorrect to make public statements before submitting a tax audit report to an enterprise. We cannot consider such statements as anything other than biased and aimed at unreasonably discrediting the business reputation of the enterprise.”"

The world’s largest steelmaker, whose plant in the central town of Zenica processes iron ore from its Omarska mines in Prijedor, said in May it planned to cut output by a third to 1 million tonnes and cut jobs from Sept. 1 to prolong the life of the mines. In January, its application to bid for the Serb Republic government’s stake in the nearby Ljubija iron ore mine was rejected, prompting the steelmaker to warn of risks to the future of mining in the area. Ljubija would have provided it with more sustainable ore supplies over a longer period. The company is still pressing for involvement in the project, according to sources. The firm said in a statement it was in talks with the government of Bosnia’s autonomous Serb Republic, where the mines are located, about “serious issues that currently stand in the way of a long-term sustainable future” of its mining business. It said it had “made it clear that without a satisfactory resolution of these matters, it will have no choice but to reduce current operational capacity and regrettably, ArcelorMittal Prijedor’s workforce”. ArcelorMittal has idled a series of plants across Europe, cut production in others and slowed a planned ramp-up of production at Ilva, Europe’s largest steel plant that was acquired by ArcelorMittal last year. It said it was looking at further cost-saving initiatives, such as reducing the working week, cutting contractor costs and using less expensive raw materials."

No one was hurt in the fire, the company added. “The conveyor transporting coke to the blast furnace caught fire,” ArcelorMittal spokeswoman Sylwia Winiarek said earlier on Thursday after the fire broke out. “We are preparing the blast furnace for an outage for security reasons that would last for two-three days. It will be necessary to inspect the installation and check if it is safe.” She added it was too early to estimate the damage or the impact on production. The plant produces around 1.5 million tonnes of steel a year. ArcelorMittal had said in May that it would shut the Krakow plant in September for some time, affecting 1,200 workers, due to rising carbon emission costs and surging power prices. In July the company had decided to postpone the temporary shutdown after protests by workers."

The decision to invest in the plant’s modernization followed a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, it said in a statement. The company said last month it would lose $1 million after a key piece of steelmaking equipment was seized following a security service investigation. The plant’s acting head Oleksandr Ivanov said the investigation had started after Zelenskiy publicly criticized pollution levels in mid-July when speaking to officials in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, where the mill is based. Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said earlier it had discovered a source of radiation exceeding safe levels in a new piece of equipment at the plant and had banned the company from using it. SBU has said the investigation was not aimed at putting pressure on the company, which has invested more than $9 billion in the country’s biggest steel plant. The company said on Thursday it “was given the opportunity to continue the implementation of the investment project.” “In particular, the commissioning work was resumed, which was stopped after the search by SBU,” it said in a statement. It also said the company would cooperate with the state on construction of new roads and various social projects. ArcelorMittal’s Ukrainian plant sold 4.5 million tonnes of metal products last year, according to the company’s website."

The Italian parliament in late June revoked the legal immunity that ArcelorMittal received when it bought the operations, granting a grace period until 2023 to bring the plant up to environmental standards, the company said. Under the new law, the legal protection at Ilva - Europe’s largest steel plant - ends at midnight on Sept. 6. “At that point in time it is very difficult for us to operate the facility further,” Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal told a results conference call. “We are working with the Italian government to institute legal safeguard measures and our expectation is that those measures would be in place before the 6th of September.” When asked by an analyst if the company would walk away from the plant if the legal immunity was not renewed, Mittal said the company had “certain protections” under its contract, but declined to give details. In January, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Italy for failing to protect citizens from the polluting Ilva plant in the southern city of Taranto, which has been blamed for hundreds of cancer-related deaths. Besides the 1.8 billion euro cost of acquisition, ArcelorMittal had said it would invest 1.2 billion euros to boost productivity and 1.1 billion euros to curb pollution. However, the Court described the clean-up plan agreed, which is not due to be completed until 2023, as “extremely slow”.

The Luxembourg-based company did cut its net debt in the second quarter in results that were broadly in line with expectations and said it had identified up to $2 billion of assets for potential sale in the next two years. ArcelorMittal shares, which had fallen 20% in the year to date before Thursday, were up 1.5% in early trading. Analysts said the company’s positive cash flow in difficult circumstances and asset sale plans explained the rise. The steelmaker, which accounts for about 6% of world steel production, said it now expected global apparent steel consumption, which includes inventory changes, to rise between 0.5% and 1.5% in 2019, from a previous forecast of 1%-1.5%. It said Europe would see a decline of between 1% and 2%, having previously forecast a contraction of up to 1%, and also trimmed its expansion hopes for the United States and Brazil. However, ArcelorMittal’s outlook for China demand remained bright. The company produced almost half its steel last year in Europe, with just under 40% from plants in the Americas. Its business in China is negligible. Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal told a conference call the industry had seen a downturn since October, after an otherwise strong 2018, the speed and extent of which had surprised the company. Steel profitability had been squeezed due to lower steel prices and higher raw material costs, this only partially offset by the company’s mining operations. There were signs of improving prices in the United States, Mittal said, but not in Europe, where the spread between steel prices and raw material costs was at its lowest level since the start of 2009. The company reported a second-quarter core profit (EBITDA) of $1.56 billion, slightly above its compiled consensus of $1.53 billion, but down from $1.65 billion in the first quarter and only about half its earnings of a year earlier. Net debt declined by $1 billion in the April-June period to $10.2 billion toward a target of $7 billion. European steelmakers are suffering from a weak manufacturing sector, including a 3% decline in new car purchases in Europe. For ArcelorMittal, and many other steelmakers, the automotive industry is second only to the construction sector in terms of steel sales. ArcelorMittal has idled a series of plants across Europe, cut production in others and slowed a planned ramp-up of production at Ilva, Europe’s largest steel plant that was acquired by ArcelorMittal last year. Mittal said it was looking at further cost savings initiatives, such as reducing the working week and contractor costs and less expensive raw materials. The company’s South African arm has also cut more than 2,000 jobs. ArcelorMittal said the European Commission needed to take more effective measures to offset the impact of import tariffs imposed by Washington on incoming steel, which has effectively closed the U.S. market. The Commission is currently reviewing its “safeguard” measures designed to limit incoming steel and prevent a surge of imports as a result of Washington’s 25% import tariffs, which have effectively closed the U.S. market. ArcelorMittal says the safeguard quotas, which have been increased by 5% twice this year, have not been effective."

The probe into Ukraine’s largest private foreign investor is seen as an early test for the presidency of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has promised to make the country more business friendly. The Ukrainian security service said earlier it had discovered a source of radiation exceeding safe levels in a new piece of equipment at the plant during a search last week, and had banned the company from using it. Ivanov said radiation at the facility was within permitted levels but that the equipment had been seized by the authorities. The company said it may sue officials over the investigation. “In July, we expect losses of about $1 million,” Ivanov told reporters at a news conference. He said the investigation had started after Zelenskiy publicly criticized pollution levels in mid-July when speaking to officials in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, where the mill is based. He singled out ArcelorMittal for criticism, accusing the company of not meeting an earlier commitment to modernize its plant. “It may be a misunderstanding, someone from local administration may... have overreacted,” Ivanov said. He said the company felt pressurized by the investigation and was struggling to formulate a response. A security service official said on Monday the investigation was not aimed at putting pressure on the company. Zelenskiy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investigation into ArcelorMittal has caused some concern among investors. “Discouraging news from Ukraine’s top investor that has invested over $9 billion in Ukraine. Investors will be concerned about selective justice,” said Andy Hunder, the President of the American Chamber of Commerce (ACC) in Ukraine, on Sunday. “Ukraine (is) sending the wrong message to the investment community at a time when business is watching closely the changes taking place.” The Ukrainian ArcelorMittal plant sold 4.5 million tonnes of metal products last year, according to the company’s website."

-14.790018259281801," ArcelorMittal South Africa to cut more than 2,000 jobs, shares drop JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African arm of steelmaker ArcelorMittal ACLJ.J expects to plunge to a first-half loss and cut more than 2,000 jobs as it struggles with cheap imports, rising costs and a flagging local economy, it warned on Wednesday. Shares in the company, majority-owned by ArcelorMittal MT.AS, dropped more than 10% after it said previous initiatives to reduce costs had proved insufficient and so it was contemplating a ""large-scale"" restructuring. “More significant measures have become necessary, including the review of staffing levels, together with other interventions,” it said in a statement. “It is anticipated that in excess of 2,000 positions (full time equivalents) may be affected,” it continued, adding the final number was subject to formal consultation. The company employed around 8,850 people in 2018, according to its annual report for that year. ArcelorMittal South Africa, which has for some time complained about cheap imports eating into its business, said ongoing challenges in the steel industry as well as a weak South African economy had hit its performance. These factors had been exacerbated by high costs for power, rail and port use, as well as raw materials, it said. The company said it expected headline results to fall by at least 650 million rand ($45.78 million) in the first half of its financial year, plunging it deep into a loss compared with earnings of 54 million rand in the same period last year. It said it would release a further trading statement once it has more certainty on headline earnings per share, the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items, and loss per share. At 0845 GMT, the company’s shares were down 9.3% at 31.4 rand, off an earlier low of 28.7 rand. It also said, however, that its overall first-half loss for the period was expected to improve by at least 700 million rand, resulting in an improvement in loss per share."

The company said on Thursday that there was no change in the status of the tailings dam that was idled in 2012, but decided to transfer the families after updating its evaluation of potential risk areas in the case of an accident with the structure. “After the update in the theoretical analysis of a dam burst, and adopting more conservative premises, the potentially impacted area was increased for a larger security margin,” ArcelorMittal said. Several mining companies in Brazil have updated their risk analysis of structures after the deadly Vale disaster in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais state, early this year when a tailings dam burst killing 246 people. There are still 24 missing. The dam at the Serra Azul complex is the same type used by Vale in Brumadinho, the so-called upstream structure. Companies that decide to remove families from risk areas usually place them in hotels until a solution is found. Some of the families removed from impacted areas in an earlier disaster in Mariana, in 2015, are still living in rented houses."

0.7912294583079826," ArcelorMittal boss says EU must respond further to Trump's steel tariffs BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe urgently needs to take further measures to offset the impact of import tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, the chief executive of steelmaker ArcelorMittal told a German newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday. The European Commission is currently reviewing its “safeguard” measures designed to limit incoming steel and prevent a surge of imports as a result of Washington’s 25% import tariffs, which have effectively closed the U.S. market. “The EU has announced safeguard measures but they weren’t effective,” Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. “Further measures are urgently necessary given the import tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed on steel imports to the United States.” Across Europe, the steel industry is struggling with cooling demand and growing supply, in part as steel tariffs deflect supplies from the United States, steelmakers say. “The EU’s safeguard clauses have gaps - it’s too easy for exporters to evade them and the impact is massive: we have a steel glut.” Mittal said imports into the European Union had increased by 30% to 40% since 2017. He said it would be negative if the European Commission were to relax tariff protections for the steel industry in July, adding that the review of the safeguard measures should be completed before permitted import levels are reduced. “From 1 July, imports to the EU can increase by 5% but we’d actually need a 20% reduction to return to 2017 levels,” Mittal said. He added that quotas were also needed for individual export countries for hot-rolled coil - steel that is heat processed into metal sheets used for car bodies and household appliances. Mittal said he was concerned about the European steel situation, saying the trade conflict between the United States and China is also hurting Europe. He also pointed to growing tensions in trade relations between the United States and Europe, a weakening economy in China and Brexit uncertainty. Mittal said there was around 500 to 550 million tonnes of overcapacity in the steel industry, amounting to a quarter of global steel production. To tackle that overcapacity, state subsidies need to be dismantled in China and unproductive manufacturers taken off the market, Mittal said. Asked if his son Aditya would one day succeed him as chief executive of ArcelorMittal, Mittal said: “Aditya has done great work for our company in the last 22 years.” “He has demonstrated his abilities and leadership qualities. I think he’d be a strong CEO.”"

-7.752442996742668," ArcelorMittal takes the knife to European steel output again BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal underlined the problems facing the European steel industry when it cut production for the second time this month, blaming weak demand and high imports. Shares in the company, the world’s largest steelmaker, fell 6% to touch their lowest point since July 2016 and were down 3.7% by 0930 GMT on Wednesday. They have lost around a quarter of their value in the year to date. The cuts come after British Steel collapsed into liquidation last week, putting 25,000 jobs at risk unless it finds a buyer. The European Commission is currently reviewing its “safeguard” measures to limit incoming steel and prevent a surge of imports as a result of increased tariffs effectively closing the U.S. market. ArcelorMittal said its latest cuts amounted to annualized output of 1-1.5 million tonnes. It follows cuts equivalent to annualized production of 3 million tonnes announced on May 6. Broker Jefferies said ArcelorMittal was taking the lead, as the largest steelmaker in Europe, which was necessary in the medium-term. It added that the large market for hot-rolled coil steel appeared to have bottomed out, with other European mills cutting output to allow price rises. Such steel, heat processed into metal sheets, is used for car bodies and household appliances. The company led by Lakshmi Mittal said it would reduce primary steel production at its facilities in Dunkirk, France and Eisenhuettenstadt, Germany. It would also cut steel output at its plant in Bremen, Germany, in the fourth quarter of the year, extending a planned blast furnace stoppage for repairs, and extend a similar scheduled stoppage in the final quarter in Asturias, Spain. ArcelorMittal temporarily idled production at its facility in Krakow, Poland at the start of May when it also reduced output in Asturias, and slowed down a planned increase of shipments from Italy. Geert van Poelvoorde, the head of the flat products division of ArcelorMittal in Europe, said the production cuts would be reversed when market conditions improve. The company cut its forecast for demand in Europe in May, predicting a contraction due to weak manufacturing and declining automotive production, for which steel is a major input.

-15.646687697160885," Steelmaker ArcelorMittal frets over future of Mexican tax benefits MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Tax incentives in Mexico designed to lure investment to poorer areas should be maintained, the head of ArcelorMittal’s Mexican unit said in an interview, despite the new president’s suggestion that the policy should not be renewed. ArcelorMittal’s chief executive in Mexico Victor Cairo said late on Thursday that the firm’s pledge to invest $1 billion over three years in its operations in the Pacific coast port of Lazaro Cardenas would be maintained for now. He declined to speculate on what might happen to the project, which is nearly 70% completed, if the Special Economic Zone tax breaks were eliminated. ArcelorMittal’s project includes the construction of a hot roll mill, a blast furnace modernization and mining investment adjustments to better supply the automotive and construction industries among others, said Cairo. The Luxembourg-based company, the world’s largest steelmaker, is responsible for about 6% of global steel output. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has threatened to stop a 10-year extension of the tax breaks, arguing last month that they have not worked. “The fear is that we made the commitment based on the law and we believe that it is a very good thing for the south,” said Cairo, referring to Mexico’s historically poorer southern states. Cairo said he believes projects like ArcelorMittal’s that were undertaken with the tax breaks in mind should continue to get tax relief. The executive said the steelmaker expects to produce about 4 million tonnes of liquid steel in Mexico this year and another 5.3 million tonnes in 2020."
-27.54486859040043," Steelmaker ArcelorMittal downbeat on main Europe market BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, cut its forecast for demand in its main market Europe on Thursday after lower steel prices depressed earnings at the start of the year. The Luxembourg-based company, which makes about 6 percent of the world’s steel, announced on Monday it was temporarily reducing European steel output by 3 million tonnes on an annualized basis due to weak demand and increased imports. “Our first quarter results reflect the challenging operating environment the industry has faced in recent months,” Chief Executive Officer Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement. The company reported a first-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.65 billion, a 34 percent decline from a year earlier and below the company-compiled consensus of $1.68 billion. Mittal said profitability had been hit by lower steel pricing due to weaker economic activity and global overcapacity, as well as by rising costs of raw materials. ArcelorMittal shares were down 4.4 percent at 16.99 euros at 0815 GMT, making them one of Thursday’s weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European stocks and bringing their decline in the past three weeks to 20 percent. Commerzbank analyst Ingo Schachel said the weakness of Europe was visible in ArcelorMittal’s numbers and would likely show up in results of other European peers. “This is more macro-economic related and not overly company-specific,” Schachel said, adding that weaker than expected earnings figures had added to already negative sentiment triggered by ArcelorMittal’s Monday announcement on output cuts. ArcelorMittal increased its growth forecast for 2019 global apparent steel consumption, which also reflects changes in inventory levels, to 1.0-1.5 percent from its February guidance of 0.5-1.0 percent. The major change was its more bullish view of China, the world’s largest steel consumer and producer. However, ArcelorMittal has almost no business there. Nearly half of ArcelorMittal’s steel is produced in Europe, with just under 40 percent in the Americas. Excluding China, growth this year would be 1.0-2.0 percent, down a percentage point from ArcelorMittal’s earlier view. It now sees contraction of demand in Europe and has a more moderate view of expansion in Brazil. It left its growth forecasts for the United States and the former countries of the Soviet Union unchanged. The company said its dimmer view on Europe was due to weak manufacturing and declining automotive production, for which steel is a major input. Industrial production in the European Union fell in November, December and January year on year and was up a modest 0.3 percent in February. March figures are due out next Tuesday."

Output will be reduced by a third to 1 million tonnes and the job cuts will be carried out from September, it said in a statement. ArcelorMittal operates a steel plant in the central Bosnian town of Zenica which processes iron ore from its Omarska mines in Prijedor. It said the move was aimed at prolonging the effective life of the Omarska mine by up to 10 years. “Without taking these measures, the mine would have to close in 2025,” the company said. ArcelorMittal Zenica will reduce its consumption of iron ore from Omarska and instead import additional iron ore from outside Bosnia, it added. In January, ArcelorMittal’s application to bid for the Bosnian government’s stake in the nearby Ljubija iron ore mine was rejected, prompting the company to warn of risks to the future of mining in the area. ArcelorMittal announced plans on Monday to temporarily cut its annual European Union steel output by 3 million tonnes due to weakening demand, rising imports coupled with insufficient EU trade protection, high energy costs and rising carbon costs."

ArcelorMittal Poland said on Monday it plans to temporarily stop production its furnace and steel plant in southern Poland in September, citing rising carbon emission costs and surging power prices. “We do not expect quantity cuts in coal orders from ArcelorMittal,” JSW Chief Executive Daniel Ozon told Reuters. “The coke from ArcelorMittal’s coking plant in Poland will be delivered to other steel plants in Europe. I do not see significant risks in relation to ArcelorMittal’s statement yesterday.” Ozon added that he saw some signs of slowdown in the automotive sector but, based on talks with JSW’s clients, assumed that sales volumes should rebound next year.

-30.34321211621614," ArcelorMittal to shut Polish plant temporarily due to rising costs WARSAW (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal Poland said on Monday it planned to halt its blast furnace and steel plant in Krakow in September, due to rising carbon emission costs and surging power prices. ArcelorMittal did not say how long the shutdown would last at the Krakow furnace, which is in southern Poland. The company said this would partly depend on the situation in the steel market. ArcelorMittal Poland is the country’s biggest steel producer and owns five steel plants and a coke plant, the biggest of its kind in Europe. “We have reluctantly made an uneasy decision to temporarily idle the operations of the primary part of our Krakow unit, because our competitive position is undermined by the costs of CO2 emission rights (...) at a time of low demand due to weakening market conditions,” ArcelorMittal said in a statement. “In addition, energy costs in Poland are among the highest in the EU.” The company, which employs over 11,000 people in Poland, said that the decision to shut the Krakow blast furnace and steel plant would affect 1,200 people, who will be transferred to other jobs or granted an idle time pay. Poland generates most of its electricity from burning highly-polluting coal and rising carbon emission prices in the European Union resulted in surging power prices in Poland last year. Warsaw approved legislation in December to cap household power prices but has yet to amend its plans for an industry price cap to ensure they do not violate European Union rules on state aid.

-24.86592984172398," India's top court halts ArcelorMittal payment to buy Essar Steel: lawyer NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Supreme Court on Friday ordered ArcelorMittal SA to stop a payment to lenders to buy Essar Steel, a lawyer involved in the case said, delaying billionaire Lakshmi Mittal’s entry into the country’s fast-growing steel market. India’s bankruptcy court had approved ArcelorMittal’s $6 billion bid for debt-ridden Essar on March 8, potentially ending months of court battles and opening the sector to outsiders. On Friday, the Supreme Court halted ArcelorMittal’s payment while a bankruptcy appeals court - the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal - rules on various appeals in the case. “(The court) asked the parties to maintain status quo with respect to the March 8 order,” said a lawyer working on the case, referring to an order by India’s bankruptcy court, the National Company Law Tribunal. The lawyer, who was at the court when the ruling was made, did not wish to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. ArcelorMittal did not have any immediate comment. Essar Steel declined to comment. The rupee weakened by 0.3 percent to 69.32 to the dollar following Friday’s ruling, on concerns of subdued dollar inflows. Essar Steel, with debts of 50.78 billion rupees ($725.38 million), was among the so called dirty dozen - twelve large steel and other infrastructure companies which defaulted and were referred to India’s bankruptcy court in 2017. The company became synonymous with the tardy pace of debt resolution by Indian banks saddled with billions of dollars of bad loans. When a new bankruptcy law was introduced in 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was seen by investors as a bold move which would ease lending pressure on banks and boost private investment. Local steel company JSW Steel Ltd, metals conglomerate Vedanta Ltd, Russian bank VTB and the erstwhile owners of Essar Steel had all tried to win the 10-million-tonne steel asset over the last two years."

ArcelorMittal confirmed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved the takeover of the 10 million tonne steel plant of Essar Steel by itself and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp, paving the way for the first major foreign participation in India’s steel sector. ArcelorMittal has been trying to enter India’s fast-growing steel market, which is dominated by local companies, for over a decade but bureaucratic hassles and land acquisition woes stifled its bids. “We welcome today’s pronouncement by the NCLT Ahmedabad,” ArcelorMittal said in a statement. “We hope to complete the transaction as soon as possible.” Essar Steel, with debts of 50.78 billion rupees ($725.38 million), was among the so called dirty dozen - twelve large steel and other infrastructure companies which defaulted and were referred to India’s bankruptcy court in 2017.

When a new bankruptcy law was introduced in 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was seen by investors as a bold move which would ease lending pressure on banks and boost private investment. However, three years later, most large cases are still languishing in the courts or yet to be resolved - bad news for Modi who is seeking re-election in a month’s time amid border tensions and growing discontent due to high unemployment. The NCLT approved ArcelorMittal’s bid in October, even as Essar’s founders - the billionaire Ruia family - tried to hold onto the company, offering 543.89 billion rupees to clear its debts. “We continue to believe that our settlement proposal...is the most compelling one available to Essar Steel creditors,” Essar said in a statement on Friday. “We are awaiting a copy of the NCLT order, and will take a call on next steps after examining the same,” the statement added. The case between ArcelorMittal and the Ruia family reached the Supreme Court in January, with Essor’s debt resolution process lasting around 600 days in total. Local steel giant JSW Steel Ltd and mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd also bid for the western Indian steel plant. ArcelorMittal said in October the company would pay a total of 420 billion rupees ($5.73 billion) toward Essar Steel’s debt and put another 80 billion rupees into operations and profitability."

Production at the mine was halted after talks on the deal with the Zeljeznice RS railway company collapsed last week. Transportation of iron ore was also halted. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, operates a steel plant in the central Bosnian town of Zenica which processes iron ore from its Omarska mines in the town of Prijedor. The new agreement over transportation costs and quantities of iron ore shipped will enable the production to resume, the company said in a statement without giving more details. In January, ArcelorMittal’s application to bid for the Bosnian government’s stake in the nearby Ljubija iron ore mine was rejected over procedural issues, prompting the company to warn of risks to the future of mining in the area. The company’s steel-making operation in Zenica, ArcelorMittal Zenica, is Bosnia’s largest steel exporter and accounts for 2.5 percent of the country’s GDP.

-26.69936764104453," ArcelorMittal looks to snag another piece of Essar empire MUMBAI (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has bid 48 billion rupees ($673 million) to acquire Essar’s 1200 megawatt power plant in central India, one of the most prized assets in the debt-ridden group’s power portfolio. The bid for the power plant once again pits ArcelorMittal chief Lakshmi Mittal against the Ruia family, who are already fighting to prevent their flagship steel asset from falling into the hands of the global steel giant. Essar’s creditors are selling many of the group’s assets to recover billions of dollars of loans, leaving Essar Group with little say over who buys the assets. Government-owned Power Finance Corp Ltd (PFC) is the lead creditor of the power plant and PFC’s Chairman Rajeev Sharma disclosed ArcelorMittal’s bid on Monday. He said that the Essar family had also made a 35 billion rupee bid for the power plant, but ArcelorMittal’s bid was 37 percent higher. “Now we have received an offer from ArcelorMittal at 4 crore per megawatt, so 4,800 crore rupees (48 billion rupees),” Sharma told a press conference. Sharma said PFC has yet to decide on either offer for the asset, known as the Mahan power plant, which has debt worth 74 billion rupees. ArcelorMittal declined to comment on the matter and Essar was not immediately available for comment. If the steel giant manages to clinch the deal for the Mahan plant, it would be yet another blow to the Ruia family’s attempt to renegotiate debt settlements and retain control of their assets. ArcelorMittal has already been picked as the preferred bidder for Essar Group’s flagship 10 million ton steel plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat and is also the sole bidder for Essar’s infrastructure arm EPC Constructions, formerly called Essar Projects. The Ruias and ArcelorMittal are still locked in a legal wrangle over the fate of the steel asset. A final court decision in that matter is expected soon. Essar Power, a subsidiary of the Essar Group, spent 80 billion rupees to build the plant, which began operation early last year and currently accounts for 50 percent of Essar Group’s power generation."

-12.80035503596772," ArcelorMittal sees small steel demand rise, shares slip on margin concerns BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, forecast on Thursday a moderate expansion in global steel demand in 2019 after a healthy market drove its 2018 earnings to their highest in a decade. But its shares slid 3 percent, as analysts said a fall in steel prices and tighter margins had yet to feed into figures for the company that is battling global overcapacity and is facing the risk of an economic slowdown The company said it expected demand to grow by 0.5 to 1 percent this year after rising 2.8 percent in 2018. “Although this is a more moderate level than 2018, market fundamentals do remain positive,” Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal told a news conference. Excluding China - where ArcelorMittal has a minimal presence - global growth would be 2-3 percent, compared with 2.1 percent in 2018, he said. China though has a major impact on the industry as the world’s biggest producer and consumer of steel, as well as being a large exporter. U.S. steel tariffs have had done little to change that. ArcelorMittal shares fell after an initial rise and were trading down 3.2 percent at 20.59 euros at 1030 GMT. But they were still up about 14 percent in the year to date. Carsten Riek, analyst at UBS, said ArcelorMittal’s forecast was limited to steel volumes and said a large steel price drop and margin squeeze had yet to be reflected in its accounts. “The headlines were a buyback and a dividend increase,” he said. “But it’s probably not enough to offset the risk in the first and second quarter.” The company, which skipped shareholder payouts in 2015 and 2016, doubled its proposed dividend to $0.20 per share, more than the average $0.12 forecast in a Reuters poll. It also announced a share buyback of up to $113.4 million. ArcelorMittal said the most rapidly expanding market would be Brazil, with 3.5-4.5 percent growth this year from 7.3 percent in 2018. Steel demand growth in ArcelorMittal’s main markets - 0.5-1.0 percent in Europe and 0.5-1.5 percent in the United States - would also be lower this year than last. The company said it expected steel shipments to increase, boosted by operational improvements after plant disruptions in Asia and Mexico last year. Capital expenditure would rise to $4.3 billion from $3.3 billion in 2018. ArcelorMittal is investing in projects in Mexico and Brazil, and has bought Votorantim in Brazil and Italy’s Ilva, Europe’s largest capacity steel plant. The company is also close to completing the acquisition of Essar Steel, a deal that would see it entering the high-growth Indian market. Net debt at the end of 2018 was at $10.2 billion, slightly up from the $10.1 billion at the end of 2017. ArcelorMittal, which returned to an investment grade rating last year, is seeking to reduce debt to below $6 billion. The company reported fourth-quarter core profit (EBITDA) of $1.95 billion, a 9 percent decline from a year earlier as prices declined. That was broadly in line with the company-compiled consensus of $1.96 billion from a group of about 20 brokers. For the full year the figure was $10.27 billion."

The settlement proposal presented to the consortium of lenders by the billionaire Ruia family was not “maintainable”, and it would not be illegal for the banks to reject the offer, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) said, according to television news channels. An appellate court had asked the NCLT to rule on Essar Steel - one of the biggest defaulters in India’s $150 billion mountain of bad loans - by Jan. 31. Lawyers said, however, that the actual intent of the ruling could only be understood in its entirety after a copy of the order has been seen, and that based on procedures the Ruia family could potentially appeal the decision. While any appeal could further draw out the protracted case, the ruling gives a shot in the arm to foreign investors, who had been getting impatient with India’s lengthy bad loan resolution process. “We hope now for a swift resolution to this case,” ArcelorMittal said in a statement, adding the tribunal ruling was a positive development for India’s bankruptcy process. The resolution process for Essar Steel has taken more than 500 days so far, well beyond the 270-day limit stipulated under India’s two-and-a-half year-old bankruptcy law. The bid for Essar Steel’s assets has seen several back and forths in the tribunal courts since it was admitted into bankruptcy, with global and Indian steel majors and financial investors vying for the company. In October, creditors of Essar Steel, which has a 10 million tonnes steel plant in western India, approved a 420 billion rupees ($5.9 billion) joint bid from ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon & Sumitomo Metal Corp as the final offer for the debt-laden company. However, Essar Steel made a higher offer of 543.89 billion rupees to creditors to settle their claims.

4.728237515600075," ArcelorMittal to build its first ever desalination plant in Brazil: executives SAO PAULO (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA MT.AS, the world's largest steelmaker, is set to build its first-ever desalination unit in Brazil to handle unforeseen water needs at its plant in the eastern state of Espírito Santo, senior company executives said in an interview on Friday. The unit is aimed at lessening the company’s dependence on state water utility company Cesan and avoiding production cuts at times of water crises as the state suffered in 2015 and 2016, said Jorge Ribeiro, president of operations at ArcelorMittal’s Brazilian flat steel division. While the plant is ArcelorMittal’s first, desalination facilities have already become fixtures at some rival steelmakers and multiple mining operations, which tend to be water-intensive. The company is in the final stages of picking a firm to build the plant, Ribeiro said, adding that the decision will likely be taken next month, with companies from India, the United States and Spain among those interested. The planned investment is about 50 million reais ($13.32 million) and the project should start operating in two years, he said. In an initial module, the plant will be capable of desalinating 500 cubic meters (132,100 gallons)of sea water per hour. “It’s a modular process, more modules can be added in the future,” said Ribeiro. ArcelorMittal Brazil’s chief executive, Benjamin Baptista Filho, noted that during the 2015 water crisis in Espírito Santo, the company was told by the state government to reduce its consumption from Cesan by 30 percent. “What we are doing is insurance, because if there is another rationing event, we can respond ... If there is another rationing, without the desalination, we would have to stop some of the production,” said Filho. According to Filho, the desalination plant will be the first in Brazil to operate exclusively with seawater. The plant will use reverse osmosis technology and consume electricity produced by the steel mill itself."

-0.7881387276892299," ArcelorMittal urges extended, reformed EU caps on steel imports PARIS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, said on Tuesday it was “absolutely critical” that Europe protect itself with measures to restrict imports of steel and remedy weaknesses in its existing system. The European Union imposed provisional safeguards in July combining quotas and tariffs to counter steel flooding into the market after U.S. President Donald Trump hit U.S. steel imports with 25 percent tariffs. The provisional measures are in place for 200 days, meaning they would expire in early February, unless they are replaced by a longer-term system. “We think these provisional safeguard measures have a lot of weaknesses. It is absolutely critical that the provisional safeguard measures are made into final measures (and) that these weaknesses are rectified,” ArcelorMittal chief financial officer Aditya Mittal told a company presentation in Paris. Mittal said those weaknesses included exemptions for developing countries, which for example has allowed Turkey to export more steel to Europe. Mittal urged the European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the EU’s 28 members, to set quotas per quarter, not for the full-year, which could allow a year’s worth of imports in just a few months. “That would create tremendous volatility and cause a lot of disruption to our European business,” he said. The other weakness, Mittal said, was the exemption for tonnage of steel already on ships. “The amount of tonnes on ships was significantly larger than the quotas so in actual fact we did not really have provisional safeguard measures in place,” he said, adding the company was working with European governments to ensure that the final measures were effective. In ArcelorMittal’s other main market, North America, the company has benefited from U.S. import tariffs on steel, which have boosted prices, leading to increased investment in the industry there. Asked about whether such measures amounted to protectionism, Mittal said the ultimate problem was overcapacity in China. “It begins with China and ends with China. China created tremendous global overcapacity and subsidized its steel business and sought to solve that problem by exporting around the world,” he said. Mittal recognized that China had cut steelmaking capacity, of some 140 million tonnes to date, but even with more planned by 2023, they would still fall short of the 250 million tonne reduction that ArcelorMittal advocated."
-9.905855854326063," India's steel giants to focus on product mix, quality to take on ArcelorMittal MUMBAI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - India’s two biggest private sector steel companies JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on steel giant ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter the country. In October, creditors of bankrupt Essar Steel India approved a 500 billion rupee ($6.9 billion) joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for Essar’s assets, paving the way for the first major foreign bets on steel manufacturing in India. Both JSW Steel and Tata Steel, during separate meetings with media on Tuesday, said the entry of the global giant in India’s fast growing steel market would be good for competition. However, the companies said their customer relationships, array of value-added products and customisation would help them retain and grow market share and take on competition. “Obviously from Tata Steel point of view, we will continue to up the ante,” T.V. Narendran, chief executive and managing director of Tata Steel said on Tuesday. “We have the technology and the product lines that are required.” ArcelorMittal’s entry into India comes at a time when Indian steel demand is growing at the fastest pace in the world. India is expected to overtake the United States in steel consumption in 2019 to become the second biggest market behind China, global steel body World Steel Association said in a report last month. ArcelorMittal plans to increase capacity of Essar’s plant to 15 million tonnes from 10 million tonnes now, and produce higher grades of products. Owned by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal is the world’s biggest steel company with a total tonnage of 97.03 million tonnes in 2017. Analysts feel ArcelorMittal’s foray will force major Indian steelmakers to innovate, despite them downplaying the impact. “ArcelorMittal’s entry would spur a shift from steel capacity expansion to product/technology evolution by incumbents,” said domestic broking firm Edelweiss in a report. Indian steelmakers say this is already in the works. “Each one of us in my view has enough space,” Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, said on Tuesday, referring to India’s growing steel market. Rao said in-line with global trends JSW had already started to move from “volumes to value” to secure its profitability and market share in the future. JSW Steel is spending up to 60 billion rupees to expand its value-added offerings like automotive steel, electrical steel, and galvanised products by over 60 percent over the next three years, out of a total spend of 450 billion rupees on expansions. “We will completely transform JSW Steel ... and also align the company in-line with what the market demands,” he said.

-5.504954010211764," ArcelorMittal remains upbeat as U.S. steel tariffs drive up prices AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS, the world's largest steelmaker, expects its financial results to improve in the coming months as global economic growth drives demand and U.S. tariffs lead to higher prices for the metal. Arcelor reported a 42 percent year-on-year increase in third-quarter core profit (EBITDA) to $2.73 billion, roughly in-line with analyst expectations, while sales rose 5 percent to $18.5 billion. The steel market has been impacted this year by the 25 percent import tariffs put in place by U.S. President Donald Trump to try to reduce imports from China and Europe. ArcelorMittal makes steel in the United States and has said that it benefited on balance from these protectionist measures, as they raise prices. “Market conditions in the third quarter remained favorable,” Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement on Thursday. “We continue to see robust real demand and healthy utilization rates across all steel segments.” The group stuck to its earlier prediction that global apparent steel consumption -- a measure of production and trade flows -- would increase by 2 to 3 percent in 2018, leading to a continued improvement in results. It did not give any more detail on its outlook. Steel tariffs worked to Arcelor’s advantage in the third quarter, as 5 percent higher prices offset an equally large decline in steel shipments in the North American region, as the U.S. market weakened. Total shipments of steel also fell 5 percent in the July-September period, due to supply problems stemming from a disruptive power outage in France and a furnace blast in Poland. But as crude steel production edged up 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, Arcelor said it expected shipments to grow again in the last three months of 2018. Arcelor’s results came in roughly as expected, while “forward commentary was positive”, Jefferies analysts said in a note, as they maintained their buy rating on the company’s shares.

-5.896806069868513," ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel chosen as final bidders for India's Essar Steel MUMBAI/TOKYO (Reuters) - Creditors of Essar Steel India Ltd ESRG.UL have approved a joint offer by ArcelorMittal SA MT.AS and Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp 5401.T as the final bid for the debt-laden asset, ArcelorMittal said in a statement on Friday. This paves the way for the two companies to take control of the 10 million tonne-per-year Essar Steel plant, marking the first participation of global steel majors in the fast-growing Indian steel market without a local partner. ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel said they have already drawn up plans to double output of the unit in the coming years. “A long-term aspiration (is) to increase finished steel shipments to 12-15 million tonnes through the addition of new iron and steelmaking assets,” ArcelorMittal said. Essar Steel’s mill in the western state of Gujarat is currently operating at 6.5 million tonnes a year due to constraints from iron ore supply and shortages of natural gas used to run its furnace. The approval potentially brings to a close a year-long tussle for one of the most attractive assets under the new insolvency process in India. Essar Steel's assets had drawn interest from Indian steelmakers such as JSW Steel JSTL.NS and Vedanta Ltd VDAN.NS, and banks such as Russia's VTB Bank. ArcelorMittal and South Korean steel giant Posco 005490.KS have also been trying to set up a steel mill in India for more than a decade, but problems with land acquisition have kept their plans from going forward. Posco dropped its plans to build a steel unit in the eastern state of Odisha last year. In its statement on Friday, ArcelorMittal said the company would pay a total of 420 billion rupees ($5.73 billion) towards Essar Steel’s debt and put another 80 billion rupees into operations and profitability. “ArcelorMittal will own the majority stake, and Nippon Steel will own a nearly equal stake,” a Nippon Steel spokesman said. The companies would increase the output of Essar Steel to 8.5 million tonnes a year, from 6.5 million tonnes, and later take it up to 15 million tonnes a year, the statement said, without giving a timeline. The news comes a day after founders of Essar Steel came in with a surprise offer to pay 543.89 billion rupees ($7.4 billion) to creditors to settle claims, and allow the company to exit the bankruptcy process. [nL3N1X54WR] Essar’s founders - the Ruia family - have tried to hold on to the steel asset, first through a minority stake in VTB-led consortium Numetal, which bid for Essar Steel, and later via a last-ditch effort on Thursday through an independent offer. The tussle between Numetal and ArcelorMittal went all the way to India’s Supreme Court, which this month ruled that any bidders would have to settle all pending dues tied to any distressed assets they were associated with before they could bid for the steel plant. ArcelorMittal announced last week that it had cleared the dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, two other smaller defaulters that it was previously associated with.

The announcement by ArcelorMittal on Friday did not disclose the value of the disposals, though investment bank Jefferies said they are unlikely to achieve a book value it estimates at $1 billion. The sales satisfy part of an agreement with the European Commission, which approved the acquisition of Ilva - Italy’s largest steel plant by capacity - after ArcelorMittal pledged to sell a string of businesses across Europe to address competition concerns. ArcelorMittal said talks were ongoing for the sale of ArcelorMittal Dudelange in Luxembourg and several finishing lines in Liege, Belgium, which were the other assets included in the agreement with the European Commission. “Given a poor recent earnings track record, all disposal assets (including Dudelange and Liege) would be worth circa $750 million to $950 million on a peer-based EV/EBITDA basis,” said Jefferies in a note that reiterated its ‘buy’ rating on the stock. “While there remains a wide range of expectations for disposal proceeds, this is sure to surpass the 180 million euros per annum that ArcelorMittal is paying the Italian state to acquire Ilva.” ArcelorMittal signed a preliminary agreement to pay 1.8 billion euros over 10 years for Ilva. It also promised to invest 1.2 billion euros to boost productivity and 1.1 billion euros to reduce pollution. German steelmaker Salzgitter said it has submitted an offer for ArcelorMittal assets, while there is talk in the market that Russian steelmaker NLMK is also in the running. ArcelorMittal said the closing of the deal with Liberty House, one of the world’s largest privately owned industrial groups with operations covering more than 30 countries, is subject to completion of the Ilva acquisition. Liberty House, which has been snapping up distressed steel and aluminum assets, said the deal more than doubles its worldwide steel-rolling capacity to 15 million tonnes. Jefferies said the sale to Liberty reduces market concerns that the ArcelorMittal furnaces would fall piecemeal into the hands of several smaller players, which could weigh on steel prices by increasing the number of competitors in the market. “The sale to Liberty assuages fears that these assets could be acquired by potentially more disruptive Ukrainian/Russian peers, as previously rumored,” it said. ArcelorMittal had been due to take control of Ilva on July 1, but the deal met with resistance from Italy’s new government, which questioned its validity. In September, however, the company reached agreement with trade unions, prompting Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio to say he would no longer oppose the takeover."

-23.6678198729523," ArcelorMittal reaches Ilva deal with unions, opening way for takeover ROME (Reuters) - Steel giant ArcelorMittal reached a deal on Thursday with trades’ unions over its planned purchase of Ilva, opening the way for the contested takeover just days before the Italian steelmaker runs out of cash. ArcelorMittal signed a preliminary agreement last year to buy Ilva, which has the largest steel-producing capacity in Europe, but Italy’s new government questioned the validity of the contract after it took office in June. However, with funds set to run dry later this month and thousands of jobs on the line, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Thursday he would no longer oppose the takeover following the union accord. “The deal means that public interest will not be served by annulling the tender,” said Di Maio, whose party, the 5-Star Movement, had previously called for the closure of Ilva’s main polluting plant in the southern Italian city of Taranto. “There is now a clear path towards closing the transaction and starting the important work of rehabilitating Ilva,” Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal Group president and CFO, said in a statement. Under the deal, ArcelorMittal agreed to take on 10,700 of the current 13,500 workforce at Ilva, some 500 more than it had originally proposed. The firm also promised a 250-million-euro ($290-million) fund to offer layoff incentives to workers. Employees will vote on the agreement before it is formally ratified. ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has also pledged to improve its plan to curb pollution at Taranto, which has been blamed for hundreds of cancer-related deaths. The 5-Star’s coalition partner, the League, hailed Thursday’s deal, saying Di Maio’s intervention had prodded ArcelorMittal to improve its terms. “(Di Maio) did better than those who came before him. From words to action,” League leader Matteo Salvini said. Ilva took root in the heel of Italy’s boot in the 1960s as part of a drive to industrialize the impoverished south. At its peak, the plant produced more than 10 million tonnes of steel a year, but magistrates intervened in 2012 and said it had to be cleaned up or shut down. Ilva was placed under state-supervised special administration in 2015. With a cap imposed to limit harmful emissions, output has fallen to under five million tonnes a year and the company is losing some 30 million euros a month. ArcelorMittal says that with its know-how, it can turn the business around. Besides the 1.8 billion euro cost of acquisition, it says it will invest 1.2 billion to boost productivity and 1.1 billion to curb pollution. Ilva’s state-appointed commissioners told parliament in August they only had enough money to keep on running the business until September, after which it would either need fresh government funds or to be shuttered."

Citing an opinion by the state lawyers, Di Maio said Arcelor had been awarded the tender for Europe’s largest steel plant without rival companies being allowed to improve the terms of their initial bids. “As fare as we are concerned the tender was illegitimate,” said Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement that governs with the right-wing League. Di Maio said if other companies were to make fresh offers for Ilva there could be the grounds to annul the tender, but the contract with the Franco-Indian multinational remained valid.

-22.593494520246693," ArcelorMittal South Africa swings to first-half profit JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal's South Africa unit ACLJ.J swung back to a modest profit in the first half of the financial year, boosted by higher steel prices and upbeat sale volumes, the firm said on Wednesday. Diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ended 30 June, 2018, is 5 cents per share compared with a loss of 148 cents per share a year ago. This was in line with the company’s expectations for the first half of 2018. HEPS is the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain once-off items. The company, majority-owned by ArcelorMittal MT.AS, said profits improved despite a constrained South African economy and a relatively strong average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate in the first half of the year. “The turnaround is on the back of a favorable international steel pricing environment together with higher steel sales volumes,” the company said in a statement. ArcelorMittal’s South African unit said it was investigating further initiatives to address the group’s sustainability including the sale of its 50 percent stake in trading and shipping company MIHBV. ArcelorMittal’s unit said in May said it would sell its stake in MIHBV for $220 million, which would be used to strengthen its balance sheet, fund working capital and for investments in the operating businesses. The steelmaker, which has long complained about cheap imports eating into its business, said it had seen steel imports decrease during the period despite 392,000 tonnes of primary carbon steel imports into South Africa in the first half of the year. South Africa said last year it would impose emergency “safeguard” tariffs on imports of certain flat hot-rolled steel products. The tariff is to stay in place for three years and fall from 12 percent in the first year to 10 percent in the second year and 8 percent in the third."
-22.593494520246693," ArcelorMittal beats second-quarter forecasts, takes buoyant view of full year BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS, the world's largest steel producer, posted forecast-beating core profit in the second quarter after keeping costs low, and said an improving global market and trade protection were feeding into an upbeat full-year outlook. U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a 25 percent tariff on steel imports in March, initially excluding the European Union and Canada but lifting those exemptions in June. While the group’s imports into the United States from Brazil and Canada were hit by the measures, ArcelorMittal said that on balance it had benefited from the tariffs as they had fed into higher steel prices. “We see a significant positive impact of the tariffs in our NAFTA segment results and we will continue to see this into the second half of 2018,” Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal told a conference call. The group also upgraded its forecast for global apparent steel consumption, which excludes the impact of inventory changes, buoyed by a rebound in Chinese demand due to an improved housing market and strong automotive and machinery industries. ArcelorMittal’s shares were 1.8 percent higher in early Wednesday trading, though they were little changed from the start of the year. ArcelorMittal has long complained about cheap exports from China and elsewhere flooding its markets in the United States and Europe. Mittal said he was not worried that a further ratcheting up of trade tensions would derail the global economic outlook, given much improved sentiment in the steel industry. “We believe the discussion on tariffs is not impacting the level of trade (to the extent) that it would take global GDP into negative territory,” Mittal said. “Clearly it is a risk, but perhaps we need to appreciate a bit more the improvements that have occurred and the size of this risk,” he added. The company’s second-quarter core profit surged 45 percent to $3.073 billion from $2.112 billion a year ago. That was well above the $2.892 billion expected in a Reuters survey of nine analysts. ArcelorMittal said this was because of improved margins as it kept costs low. The group said global apparent steel consumption would increase by 2.0 to 3.0 percent in 2018, up from the 1.5 to 2.5 percent growth expected in its May forecast. The upward revision was driven by a more positive market outlook in China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, while the company slightly moderated its forecast for a rebound in Brazil ahead of presidential elections. ArcelorMittal said its net debt decreased to $10.5 billion from $11.1 billion in March and added it expected to accelerate progress towards its net debt target of $6 billion."
-20.03190185823177," Italy's deputy PM says ArcelorMittal's Ilva offer not sufficient on jobs ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government, which has questioned the validity of ArcelorMittal's MT.AS planned takeover of Italian steelmaker Ilva, on Wednesday said it was not happy with new bid proposals put forward by the steel giant. Italy’s deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio said that while the Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal had improved its environmental pledges, it could still do more on the jobs front. While putting pressure on ArcelorMittal to enhance its original offer, the new coalition has also ordered a review of the 2017 tender process, warning it will scrap the deal if it finds serious irregularities. “We will pursue these two paths in parallel because we must be ready for all eventualities,” said Di Maio, who is head of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and also serves as both industry and labor minister. ArcelorMittal MT.AS said on Wednesday it had presented Di Maio with ""additional proposals"", adding that it hoped it could shortly complete its planned takeover of Ilva. “We have participated in this tender in good faith and remain hopeful that we will be able to complete the transaction soon,” it said in a statement. The industry ministry said on Tuesday the tender review would take 30 days and came after Italy’s anti-corruption body suggested the previous centre-left government might have failed to follow the correct procedures for such a public offer. ArcelorMittal agreed last year to buy Ilva, Europe’s largest steelworks, and had been due to take it over on July 1. However, the government delayed the handover, heightening speculation about the future of the troubled Ilva, which was placed under state-supervised special administration in 2015 three years after magistrates had intervened in the company, saying it had to be cleaned up or shut down. ArcelorMittal promised last year to pay 1.8 billion euros to acquire Ilva and then invest 1.2 billion to boost productivity and a further 1.1 billion to curb pollution at the firm’s main Taranto plant in the southern heel of Italy. It has also told unions it plans to reduce the Taranto workforce to around 7,600 from 10,900 now. Di Maio said ArcellorMittal had improved its environmental commitments, but added that the labor plan was “not satisfying”. He gave no further details. “ArcerolMittal does not want that its updated proposal be made public because it is worried about competitors getting hold of the information,” Di Maio said. Officials in Taranto have said Ilva is losing one million euros a day and warn that unless the ArcelorMittal deal is rapidly sealed, the business might be forced to close. Ilva is one of Italy’s largest industrial concerns and its closure would be a blow to local businesses that rely on it for much of their steel production."

-6.673506643526625," ArcelorMittal promises to present improved plan for Italy's Ilva ROME (Reuters) - Steel giant ArcelorMittal MT.AS said on Friday it would present improved proposals for its planned takeover of Italy's troubled steelmaker Ilva, as the new government questioned how it came to be awarded the deal. Ilva has been under state-supervised special administration since 2015, after magistrates said it must be cleaned up or closed. ArcelorMittal agreed last year to buy it after outbidding competitors and promised to fix the problems. It was due to take over the business on July 1, but the newly installed Italian government delayed the handover and has pressed ArcelorMittal to come up with a much better plan for the firm. In a statement issued on Friday, ArcelorMittal said it would unveil its new proposals in the coming days. “We have worked to increase the environmental and jobs plan, which will improve the original commitments and strengthen the environmental performance of Ilva and its support to local communities,” it said in a statement. “Once an agreement has been reached on the basis of this project, we are confident that all the parties, including the unions, will be satisfied and will be ready to conclude the deal quickly”, it added. The group said it had already promised to invest 4.2 billion euros in Ilva, including 1.2 billion to boost productivity and 1.15 billion to curb pollution. It has also told unions it plans to reduce the workforce in Ilva’s main Taranto plant to around 7,600 from 10,900 now -- a proposal the unions have rejected. ArcelorMittal added that it had taken part in the government tender in a “clear and transparent manner”. It released its statement shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who also serves as industry and labor minister, questioned how the tender was awarded, calling the process a “mess”. Earlier this month, Di Maio asked Italy’s anti-corruption unit to review the bidding process. “It has confirmed that our concerns about the Ilva tender procedure were well founded,” the deputy prime minister told parliament on Friday. He provided no details and gave no indication that he was considering pulling the contract from ArcelorMittal, but said he would seek an internal ministry investigation into the deal. Di Maio’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement had promised ahead of a March national election that it would shut down Ilva if it took power because of environmental concerns. Former industry minister Carlo Calenda, who oversaw the original tender, rejected Di Maio’s criticism. “(Di Maio) has said serious and false things in parliament,” Calenda wrote on Twitter. “If you think the bid was rigged, assume your responsibility and cancel it.”"
-5.179808876395236," Russia, Kazakhstan cut hot-rolled steel coil exports to Iran: traders MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia and Kazakhstan are cutting back sales of hot-rolled steel coils to Iran in part because of new U.S. sanctions on Tehran, steel traders said. The development shows that, despite protests from the Kremlin that unilateral U.S. sanctions should not affect Russian companies, the firms are changing their behavior for fear of falling foul of U.S. sanctions. Imports of Russian and Kazakh hot-rolled steel coils - used in industries from pipes to cars to agricultural equipment - make up only a small part of Iranian consumption, and can be replaced. The imports were already slowing before sanctions because of low prices and weak demand. But the U.S. sanctions have accelerated the slowdown, traders said. The coils are shipped to Iran by Russian steelmakers Severstal and MMK along with ArcelorMittal’s plant in Temirtau, Kazakhstan. “I believe that Arcelor and the likes are cutting trade with Iran because of (U.S. President) Donald Trump’s pressure on big companies,” an Iranian trader said. Alex Agoureev, an adviser to Paramjit Kahlon, CEO of ArcelorMittal CIS, confirmed that the company plans to suspend supplies to Iran due to the U.S. sanctions. ArcelorMittal is the world’s top steel producer. “Supplies to Iran will be temporarily suspended due to the sanctions. Once sanctions are lifted, the supplies will be resumed,” Agoureev said. He did not say when the suspension would happen or provide further details. Severstal and MMK declined to comment. A spokesman for the Iranian ministry of industry, mines and trade also declined to comment. “HORRIBLE DEAL” In May, Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and promised to reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran to undermine “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” As a result, a number of European energy and financial groups have said they will end projects in Iran or suspend dealings with the country. U.S. measures due to kick in after a 90-day “wind-down” period ends on Aug. 6 include sanctions on the purchase or acquisition of U.S. dollars by the Iranian government, on Iran’s trade in gold and precious metals, and on the sale, supply and transfer to or from Iran of graphite, raw or semi-finished metals, coal and industrial-related software. Russia and European Union states opposed the U.S. withdrawal from the deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin and French leader Emmanuel Macron have both said they will resist any move by the U.S. authorities to punish Russian or French companies for doing business with Iran. In a speech in May, Putin referred to U.S. laws being used to force non-U.S. companies to pay fines. “We need to put an end to this. It’s not acceptable,” he said. However, business executives have to confront the reality that many of their transactions are in dollars, which means they are exposed to U.S. jurisdiction. That makes it risky for them to ignore U.S. sanctions. Despite a promise by Macron to protect French business interests from any fallout from U.S. sanctions on Iran, French oil major Total announced it may pull out of Iran unless it secures a waiver from the sanctions. According to CRU, a market intelligence group specializing in metals, mining and fertilisers, Iran’s net hot-rolled (HR) coil consumption was 5.6 million tonnes in 2017, of which 0.8 million tonnes were imported. Of that, Russia supplied a total of 410,000 tonnes and another 240,000 tonnes were shipped from Kazakhstan. Their sales mostly consisted of hot-rolled coil less than 2mm thick which was not produced in Iran at a time, according to CRU. Puneet Paliwal, a senior analyst with CRU, said that the cut in imports should not have a big effect on Iran, where the less than 2mm thick HR coil is used in the pipes and profiles segment, a large steel end-use sector in the country. In June, the state-owned Mobarakeh Steel Company (MSC) began commercial production of 1.8mm HR coil, “which will substantially reduce import dependence of the country for the less than 2mm thick HR coil.” “The company claims that it will ramp up production to completely substitute imports within an year,” Paliwal said. “Thus, imposition of trade barriers (both Iran import tariffs and U.S. sanctions), alongside fresh domestic production in Iran, is likely to result in a sharp reduction in HR coil imports from the CIS nations.” Bahadour Ahramian, a board member of the Iranian Steel Producers’ Association, said it was largely expected - even before the U.S. decision to re-install the curbs - that Iran’s imports would fall this year thanks to the new MSC mill. “Exports might be hit by the sanctions, perhaps that’s (more so) something to watch,” said Ahramian."

Once sanctions are lifted, the supplies will be resumed,” said Agoureev, an adviser to ArcelorMittal CIS CEO Paramjit Kahlon. He did not say when the suspension would happen or provide further details.

6.542364162612486," Italy to ask for postponement of Ilva handover to ArcelorMittal: sources ROME (Reuters) - Italy's new government will ask for a postponement of a planned July 1 handover of the Ilva steel plant to ArcelorMittal MT.AS as it seeks more time to rejig the terms of the deal, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. The government is also thinking of giving Ilva a bridge loan to allow the steelmaker, the largest in Europe, to cover its production costs in the coming months, the sources said. ArcelorMittal declined to comment while a spokeswoman for Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio said she could not confirm the delay or the loan. Ilva, based in the southern city of Taranto, has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crime for years - charges that it denies. In 2012, Italian authorities ruled that emissions from the plant had caused deaths, tumors and respiratory diseases. The state took full control in 2015 and about half Ilva’s annual 11 million-tonne capacity was eventually mothballed. Last year ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, reached a 1.8-billion-euro deal with the previous Italian government to buy the troubled steelmaker. It pledged to invest another 2.3 billion euros to clean up and modernize the plant but said it wanted to cut 5,500 jobs out of a total of 14,000 by 2023. The Indian steel giant has still not reached an agreement on job cuts it could agree to and a delay could help it find a compromise with Rome’s help, one of the sources said. The 5-Star Movement, a member of the new governing coalition with the far-right League, has previously said it wants to completely eliminate polluting emissions at the Taranto plant. Di Maio, head of the 5-Star, will likely decide in the next few days what to do on Ilva after meetings last week with ArcelorMittal, the unions, environmental associations, local authorities and the commissioners, his spokeswoman said."
2.5599916906177125," Exclusive: JSW Steel plans bid for ArcelorMittal's Romanian plant LONDON/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's biggest steelmaker JSW Steel JSTL.NS is expected to make a bid for ArcelorMittal's MT.AS Galati plant in Romania, three sources told Reuters, potentially competing against Ukraine's Metinvest and Italy's Marcegaglia. ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has had to put six European assets up for sale to get approval from European competition authorities for its purchase of Italy’s giant Ilva plant. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies estimate the combined value of the assets up for sale is $752-940 million and Galati, the country’s biggest steel plant employing about 5,600 people, is the largest of those assets. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch is handling the sale, which it aims to complete by the end of 2018. According to the European Commission, ArcelorMittal has agreed to provide an undisclosed amount of financing to the buyer of Galati to ensure that its steel output grows and the plant remains viable and competitive. ArcelorMittal declined to comment. JSW, which wants to expand its steelmaking capacity outside India by 10 million tonnes per annum, also declined to comment. Industry sources had previously said that Marcegaglia and Metinvest were planning a joint bid for the plant but a Metinvest spokesman told Reuters the steelmaker would be bidding alone. “We do not consider any partnerships or consortiums. Metinvest is a financially strong group (able) to participate on (a) standalone basis in the bid for any of the assets proposed by ArcelorMittal,” the Metinvest spokesman said. Marcegaglia did not respond to requests for comment. The steel processor had previously been part of a consortium with ArcelorMittal bidding for the Ilva plant before the European Commission forced it to withdraw. Galati has crude steelmaking capacity of 3.4 million tonnes per annum and rolling capacity of 6.2 million tonnes. The equivalent figures for Ostrava, the next biggest plant up for sale, are 3.4 million and 3.9 million, respectively. The other four assets for sale have no crude capacity, and a combined rolling capacity of 7.4 million tonnes per annum. Galati was bought by ArcelorMittal’s former holding for 70 million euros in 2001, according to Jefferies. Close to a billion euros has since been ploughed into the plant, which turned a profit of $6 million for the first time in 2016, the investment bank said. Jefferies also said investors have been somewhat unnerved by the disposals ArcelorMittal has had to make to buy Ilva, given the joint crude capacity of the plants it is selling is roughly equal to Ilva’s near 7 million ton annual production. ArcelorMittal bid 1.8 billion euros ($2.08 billion) for Ilva and pledged to invest another 2.4 billion cleaning up another plant that has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crimes for years - charges that it denies. The steelmaker aims to complete the Ilva purchase by the end of June. As part of its overseas expansion plan, JSW in May agreed to pay 55 million euros for the Aferpi plant in Piombino, Italy, which has annual capacity of 2.5 million tonnes and was bought by Algeria’s Cevital in 2014. In India, it has bid for bankrupt Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel, Monnet Ispat, and has so far got approval for its debt resolution plan for Monnet Ispat. Last year JSW earmarked a billion dollars for acquisitions and expansions."

-14.966734026504167," ArcelorMittal gives bullish outlook after earnings beat BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal MT.AS said the outlook for 2018 had improved after a sharp pick-up in steel prices and increased iron ore shipments helped it deliver higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Friday. The group did not give a specific forecast for its own prospects, but repeated that it saw 2018 global apparent steel consumption, which takes into account inventory changes, growing by between 1.5 and 2.5 percent. The steel industry, worth about $900 billion a year, is seen as a gauge of the world’s economic health. ArcelorMittal said demand was likely to increase this year for steel in machinery and construction amid solid expansion in the United States and Europe, while Brazil, another of its large markets, had pulled clear of a two-year recession. The spread between the price of steel and its raw materials was also healthy, the company said. “The outlook for 2018 has strengthened as the year has progressed, with the combination of growing demand and supply-side reform driving higher capacity utilization rates and healthy steel spreads globally,” Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement. First-quarter core profit (EBITDA), the figure most closely watched by analysts, rose 13 percent year-on-year to $2.51 billion, above the average $2.33 billion expected in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts. ArcelorMittal shares matched a four-year high of 30.76 euros and were up 2.2 percent at 30.22 euros at 0820 GMT, making them among the strongest performers in the FTSEurofirst index .FTEU3 of leading European shares. Commerzbank analyst Ingo Martin Schachel said the results were strong at every level and mainly linked to higher profit margins, with plants running at full capacity after capacity reduction in Europe and North America and protective trade measures already in place. “The first quarter was better than expected and the market backdrop for the second and third quarters is better than we imagined at the start of the year. It’s improving almost on a week-by-week basis,” he said. ArcelorMittal said its average steel selling price was 18.2 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2017, with shipments up 1.4 percent. For iron ore, of which it mines more than 50 million tonnes a year, shipments rose 5.5 percent, while prices were down 13.1 percent. The firm has been a vocal supporter of trade measures against cheap imports into both the United States and the European Union, where it has the bulk of its operations. “Comprehensive solution for unfairly trade imports across geographies still required,” ArcelorMittal said in an overview of EU and U.S. measures, including the 25 percent import tariffs imposed since March 23 by U.S. President Donald Trump, with certain temporary exemptions, such as for EU steel. The principal target of such measures has been China, the world’s largest consumer and producer of steel and a key gauge for the global industry, even though ArcelorMittal itself has no direct exposure to the Chinese market. Chinese steel exports declined at the start of the year as local demand has grown and the state has reined its domestic steel capacity to curb stifling smog. However, they jumped in April despite the U.S. tariffs."
-9.940181492276023," ArcelorMittal hires Bank of America to sell European steel assets LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal has hired Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to sell a number of its steel assets to secure antitrust clearance to acquire Italian peer Ilva. ArcelorMittal offered in March to sell its galvanized steel plant in Italy, as well as units in Romania, Macedonia, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Belgium as a concession to EU regulators for its 1.8 billion euro (1.6 billion pounds) bid for Ilva. ArcelorMittal told Reuters on Wednesday that it had appointed Bank of America-ML to handle the asset sale. European and Asian steelmakers will be among the likely buyers as the European Commission has said the steel plants would be sold to buyers who would continue to operate them, allowing them to compete with ArcelorMittal. The EU antitrust watchdog decided to clear Arcelor’s offer on Tuesday, after seeking feedback from rivals and customers on the concessions. Concerns were initially raised that the deal may reduce competition in some flat carbon steel products and result in higher prices for customers in southern Europe. Global steel equity values have more than doubled since hitting 12-year lows in early 2016 at the depth of a steel sector crisis that resulted in job losses, bankruptcies and capacity closures worldwide. The ArcelorMittal takeover of Ilva, Europe’s largest steel plant with 11 million tonnes capacity, is expected to improve the pricing power of EU steelmakers in the longer term by reducing the number of sellers in the market. Steel majors Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp agreed in 2017 to combine their European steel assets. ArcelorMittal said it plans to invest a further 2.4 billion euros cleaning up and modernizing Ilva, which has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crime for years."

-16.11531902680405," ArcelorMittal to gain EU approval for Ilva acquisition: sources BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal MT.AS, the world's largest steelmaker, is on track to win EU antitrust clearance to acquire Italian peer Ilva after agreeing to sell a number of significant assets across Europe, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. ArcelorMittal has offered to sell its only galvanized steel plant in Italy, as well as units in Romania, Macedonia, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and in Belgium. Sources say that is a far bigger package of sales than originally planned as the company bowed to regulatory demands in its quest to buy Europe’s biggest capacity steel plant. The galvanized steel plant in Italy, Piombino mills, for example, makes 800,000 tonnes a year of the product. The EU competition enforcer has been concerned that the deal may reduce competition in some flat carbon steel products and result in higher prices for customers in southern Europe. The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 23, and ArcelorMittal declined to comment. Steel service center S.Polo Lamiere said it had provided industry feedback on ArcelorMittal’s concessions to the Commission. “The global feedback was that those remedies were considered sufficient by the different operators in the market, so the feedback the Commission received from stakeholders was positive,” its CEO Tomasso Sandrini told Reuters. The size of the divestments has prompted worries in some countries where the businesses to be sold are located. Luxembourg Economy Minister Etienne Schneider on Monday wrote to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, saying it was regrettable that regulators had demanded hefty asset sales from ArcelorMittal and that Europe needed a strong industrial base. Vestager said she would make sure that buyers of those assets have the expertise and financial resources to continue operating them. Ilva, based in the city of Taranto in southern Italy, has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crimes for years - charges that it denies. It was also the beneficiary of two loans worth about 84 million euros ($103 million), which it will have to repay to the Italian state after the Commission ruled that these constituted illegal state aid."
