-11.321331234882454," Smurfit Kappa reaffirms guidance after International Paper drops bid DUBLIN, June 6 (Reuters) - Smurfit Kappa reaffirmed its guidance on Wednesday that its full year earnings will be materially better than last year after rival International Paper (IP) decided to end its pursuit of the Irish packaging company. Smurfit twice frustrated a bid to combine the largest listed U.S. paper packaging firm with Europe’s biggest, arguing it was better served pursuing its future independently. IP’s second, raised offer valued the Irish group at 8.9 billion euros ($10.5 billion). IP walked away on Tuesday, blaming a lack of engagement from Smurfit’s management. Under Irish takeover rules, the Memphis-based group is barred from making a fresh attempt to buy Smurfit for 12 months. “The board believes that SKG has superior prospects as a standalone business and remains excited about the group’s prospects in the short, medium and long-term,” Smurfit said in a statement, adding that it expected the second quarter to represent another strong performance. David O’Brien, an analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, said that given IP is one of the few packaging companies capable of launching a bid for Smurfit, the Irish group is likely to stay as an independent company for now. Shares in Smurfit, which fell sharply earlier this week, were 2.3 percent higher at 34 euros by 0720 GMT. The shares hit a high of 37.10 euros during IP’s pursuit but are well up on the 28.60 euros they stood at before the initial bid. The second bid was pitched at 37.54 euros per share. Smurfit agreed last month to buy Dutch paper and recycling firm Reparenco for 460 million euros and said on Wednesday that it was targeting synergy benefits in excess of 30 million euros from the deal, a disclosure it was forbidden from making at the time under takeover rules. It also laid out a four-year plan in February to increase investment in its existing businesses by 1.6 billion euros. Elsewhere in the sector, UK-based DS Smith Plc this week offered to buy Spanish rival Europac for 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) including debt to bolster its position in western Europe’s fast-growing packaging market. Ireland’s Davy Stockbrokers increased its forecast for Smurfit Kappa’s full year core earnings by 6 percent for 2018 and 5 percent for 2019, reflecting the recent acquisition and strong underlying fundamentals in the sector. It also increased its price target for the stock to 42 euros, above the 37.50 euros per share International Paper bid. “It is little wonder therefore that SKG’s Board rejected the proposal from International Paper,” Davy analyst Barry Dixon wrote in a note.

-9.23616399883613," International Paper to drop bid for Smurfit Kappa London (Reuters) - International Paper IP.N confirmed on Tuesday that it will not make an offer for Irish packaging company Smurfit Kappa SKG.I, because of lack of engagement from Smurfit's management. “IP believes the revised proposal was highly attractive and formed a sound basis for engagement, which the company viewed as essential to determining the full value potential of the combination,” the paper-packaging firm said in a statement. International Paper has decided to end its pursuit after courting Smurfit for more than three months, according to people familiar with the matter.

-4.191302277305799," Ireland's Smurfit aims to see off takeover with Dutch acquisition DUBLIN (Reuters) - Smurfit Kappa SKG.I has agreed to buy Dutch paper and recycling firm Reparenco for about 460 million euros ($539 million), the Irish packaging group said on Thursday, in its effort to see off a takeover bid from U.S. rival International Paper (IP) IP.N. Smurfit said the acquisition of the privately-owned business accelerated its strategic objectives under a four-year plan laid out in February when it said it would increase investment in its existing businesses by 1.6 billion euros. Negotiations to buy the business that generated 41 million euros of core earnings in the 12 months to April 2018 began on Feb. 1, Smurfit said, before IP made its first approach. “The acquisition of Reparenco is complementary with our existing business; strengthens our integrated business model; and accelerates a central element of our medium term plan,” Smurfit Chief Executive Tony Smurfit said in a statement. Smurfit Kappa twice frustrated a bid to combine the largest listed U.S. paper packaging firm with Europe’s biggest, most recently rejecting a raised takeover offer from IP in March, arguing it was better served pursuing its future independently. IP, whose cash and shares offer in March valued the Irish group at 8.9 billion euros, said last week it would not make a hostile bid after being given until June 6 to make a binding offer or walk away.

One of the investors urging Ireland-based Smurfit Kappa to engage with IP is British asset management firm Janus Henderson Group PLC JHG.N, which holds a 4.3 percent stake in the Irish packaging company, the report said. on.ft.com/2KR7z81 “The message to Smurfit is to please either engage and get around the table with IP or give us reasons why you are not engaging,” Janus Henderson’s European equities head John Bennett told the FT. Bennett said Janus Henderson has told IP that it will not support an offer below 40 euros ($46.80) per share but would urge Smurfit Kappa to work towards a deal for an offer above 40 euros a share, according to the FT. Two other investors, holding more than four percent in Smurfit Kappa and not named by FT, shared the view that the company must engage with IP.

-4.5225907830227055," International Paper says it will not make hostile bid for Smurfit DUBLIN (Reuters) - U.S. packaging company International Paper IP.N will not make a hostile bid for Irish rival Smurfit Kappa SKG.I, it said on Wednesday after being given until June 6 to make a binding offer. Smurfit Kappa frustrated a bid to combine the largest listed U.S. paper packaging company with Europe’s biggest when it rejected a sweetened takeover offer in March, arguing that it was better served pursuing its future as an independent company. The Irish Takeover Panel said on Wednesday that, following representations made by Smurfit and its advisers, International Paper had three weeks to announce whether or not it will follow up with a binding offer. “International Paper believes its current proposal represents a compelling strategic and financial rationale for a combination with Smurfit Kappa,” the Memphis-based company said in a statement. “From the outset, IP has stressed the importance of proceeding on an agreed basis. To that end, IP confirms that it will not proceed with a binding offer unless it is recommended by Smurfit Kappa’s board of directors.” IP, which in March made a cash and shares offer that valued the Irish group at 8.9 billion euros ($10.5 billion), tweaked its terms to offer Smurfit shareholders a “mix and match” facility that could allow them to receive a greater or lesser proportion of cash or shares. It added that it would also seek a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange LSE.L to enable Smurfit Kappa shareholders to share in the potential value created by a transaction. IP suggested that the two companies should meet to discuss the potential for the combined company. Smurfit has said that IP’s latest proposal failed to value its intrinsic business worth and said it was very comfortable with the position it had outlined to its shareholders. A spokesman for Smurfit said it had no immediate comment on Wednesday’s statement. Shares in the Irish packaging group were down 3.6 percent at 0945 GMT."

1.562942966532232," Smurfit Kappa earnings soar as it fights off International Paper interest DUBLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - Smurfit Kappa’s first quarter earnings soared 22 percent which the Irish packaging group said on Friday should translate into a “materially better” full year outcome as it fights off interest from U.S. rival International Paper. Smurfit Kappa frustrated a bid to combine the largest listed U.S. paper packaging firm with Europe’s biggest when it rejected a raised takeover offer in March, arguing it was better served pursuing its future as an independent company. Before its annual shareholder meeting later on Friday, Smurfit said its first quarter core earnings rose to 340 million euros as a result of increased capital investment, higher prices and strong demand that saw revenue improve by 7 percent. “Trading in the second quarter remains very encouraging with good demand across most regions, continued corrugated price recovery and lower sequential recovered fibre costs,” Chief Executive Tony Smurfit said in a statement. “We have momentum in price recovery in our corrugated business, demand remains robust and paper markets remain tight.” Smurfit’s earnings slipped this time last year before especially strong demand in Europe helped it finish 2017 slightly ahead of the year before, and it said on Friday that it expected 2018 to be materially better. Smurfit, which designs and manufactures packaging for the likes of Unilever, Nestle and Procter & Gamble, said in February that it would increase investment by 1.6 billion euros over the next four years. Some 230 million euros has been invested to date. Smurfit disclosed a month later that it had rejected an initial approach from International Paper and spurned a second offer three weeks later that valued the Irish group at 8.9 billion euros at the time. International Paper said last week that it was disappointed it has not been able to engage with Smurfit since it rejected the raised bid. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Adrian Croft)"
