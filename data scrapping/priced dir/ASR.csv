23.850412629157155," Mexico fines Cancun airport $3.7 million over taxi monopoly MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s competition regulator said on Thursday it fined the airport at tourist hot spot Cancun $3.7 million for blocking new taxi operators, which it said reduced competition and effectively overcharged millions of passengers. Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASUR), the Mexican company that runs the Cancun airport along with 15 others across Latin America, said it will challenge the ruling and the 72.5 million pesos fine. The Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece) said that from 2010 to at least 2018, the airport gave mostly negative assessments to taxis wishing to operate at the Cancun airport, preventing them from receiving federal permits. “By being the only entity that can lease and grant spaces for taxi access... (the airport) took various actions to prevent new participants from offering said service,” Cofece said in a statement. As a result of the airport’s moves to limit the market, fares were marked up about 8% on average for several million trips. The regulator did not name any of the taxi operators that were blocked from the Cancun airport."

5.1134450037330526," Incoming Mexico government starts airport consultation, business leaders worry MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government opened polls on Thursday for a public consultation to decide whether to ditch a multi-billion-dollar new airport, a possibility that worries markets and business leaders. The poll from Oct. 25 to Oct. 28 will show if the government of leftist President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador should finish the ambitious but costly new Mexico City airport or scrap it and upgrade a military air base to complement a current hub. The consultation is being held in more than 500 municipalities, home to about 80 percent of the population, incoming transport minister Javier Jimenez Espriu said. More than 184,000 people cast ballots on Thursday in turnout that exceeded expectations, Lopez Obrador’s team said in a statement. The results of the poll, which will guide the final decision of the new government, are one of the first big tests of Lopez Obrador’s economic policy and his relations with the country’s business elite he criticized during the campaign. Moises Kalach, a senior member of Mexico’s powerful CCE business lobby, told media he was worried any contract cancellations could violate international treaties, adding that markets needed certainty. Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1 after a landslide victory, jokingly asked reporters to turn off their cameras as he cast his ballot at a Mexico City polling station, saying his vote was secret. He ruled out an impact on the economy, saying contracts to develop the new airport would be “backed, protected, no injustice will be committed” even if the project was scrapped. Some business leaders have warned that project cancellation could spook investors and hit the Mexican peso and government bonds. “The impact on risk premiums and particularly on the currency could be significant,” analysts at BBVA Bancomer said in a note. Opposition parties say the consultation has not followed the rules for referendums. “This consultation is unnecessary, since it will only serve to justify the decision that the president-elect has already made, and which he made public during his electoral campaign,” the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution said in a statement. The incoming president has railed against the new airport, saying it has been tainted by corruption and will be costlier than planned. The new airport, under construction on a drained lakebed on Mexico City’s eastern flank since 2015, is about 20 percent to 30 percent complete. The Texcoco airport is projected to cost 285 billion Mexican pesos ($14.6 billion), up from an original estimate of 195 billion, says incoming transport minister Jimenez Espriu.

The public will be polled from Oct. 25 to Oct. 28 on whether Lopez Obrador’s government should finish the ambitious new Mexico City airport or scrap it and upgrade the Santa Lucia military air base to complement the existing hub. The consultation will be held in over 500 municipalities, covering about 80 percent of Mexico’s population, incoming transportation minister Javier Jimenez Espriu said this month.

-7.579812920140454," Incoming Mexico government to survey public opinion on new airport MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government will hold a four-day public consultation to decide the fate of the capital’s part-built new airport and will upgrade facilities at the existing airport to ease congestion, a member of the next Cabinet said on Thursday. Incoming transport minister Javier Jimenez Espriu said the public would be polled from Oct. 25 to Oct. 28 on whether the government should finish the ambitious new Mexico City airport or scrap it and upgrade a military air base to complement the existing hub. “This is going to be taken seriously. Even if there are three votes, we will take it seriously,” Jimenez said at a news conference, adding that results would be released the following week. Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, has said the new airport has been tainted by corruption and will be more costly than projected. Mexican regional airport stocks GAP, OMA and ASUR fell by between 3 percent and 5 percent. The cancellation of the project would hit regional airports since 70 percent of domestic flights originate from the capital, said Alejandra Marcos at brokerage Intercam. If the project is scrapped, it would spook investors and could hit the Mexican peso and government bonds, she said. Jimenez said the airport, which has been under construction on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco on the eastern flank of Mexico City since 2015 and is around 20 to 30 percent complete, was over budget and behind schedule. He said the Texcoco airport was now projected to cost 285 billion pesos ($15 billion) compared with an original estimate of 195 billion pesos. The airport had been due to be completed during 2022, but Jimenez said it would likely take until 2024. The consultation will be held in over 500 municipalities covering about 80 percent of Mexico’s population, Jimenez said. Irrespective of the results of the survey, Jimenez said the delay in construction meant “major surgery” was required at the current airport in order to ease stretched capacity limits. The new government would invest up to 5 billion pesos to upgrade the current Mexico City airport and expand an international airport in the city of Toluca in the State of Mexico, about 34 miles (55 km) from the capital, he added. The aim is to lift capacity at the Mexico City airport from around 40 million passengers per year to 50 million and increase Toluca annual traffic from less than 4 million to 10 million."
