147.19101123595507," Norway oil drilling rig companies agree on wage deal with workers OSLO (Reuters) - Three Norwegian labour unions agreed on a wage deal with the owners of floating offshore oil rigs, preventing a strike that could eventually have halted the exploration for new oil and gas reserves, the unions and companies said in separate statements on Thursday. The deal between the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and the Industri Energi, Safe and DSO labour unions comprises around 7,500 workers. Companies drilling on behalf of oil firms in Norwegian waters include Transocean RIG.N, Odfjell Drilling ODFJ.OL, Maersk Drilling DRLCO.CO and Seadrill SDRL.OL. A separate group of oil and gas production workers, who are employed directly by oil firms, is due to start mediation next week, and a strike could break out on Sept. 30 unless a wage deal is found, labour unions said on Wednesday."

-53.8860103626943," With contracts canceled and debts mounting, offshore oil drillers face another shakeout DENVER/OSLO (Reuters) - The companies that operate offshore drilling rigs for major oil producers face a second wave of bankruptcies in four years amid a historic drop in energy prices that likely will leave surviving drillers more closely tied to big oil firms. A collapse of the offshore industry will have broad impact. Drillers and their suppliers have driven innovation that has helped shale and offshore wind companies by pioneering remote monitoring and control, and last year directly generated about 25% of global oil production. The offshore services business is the worst performing of the oilfield services sector, with shares of the 10 largest publicly traded down 77% since the start of the year. Four of the seven largest offshore drillers - Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc, Noble Corp, Seadrill Ltd and Valaris Plc - have sought protection from creditors or begun debt restructuring talks that could lead to bankruptcy. Two others are reaching out to their creditors. Pacific Drilling last month said it may need to modify terms of its debt, and was seeking alternative funding in the event creditors would not accept new terms. Shelf Drilling , the ninth largest by revenue, is seeking talks with creditors over loan covenants that take effect next year, executives said. The latest offshore industry’s turmoil “is going to change things in many ways,” Odfjell Drilling Chief Executive Simen Lieungh said in an interview. “Existing players and the existing structures will probably not be there as today,” he said referring to companies scrapping rigs. (For a graphic on global drilling rigs, click on: ) The sector had limped along as exploration fell due to high costs and the advent of cheaper U.S. shale. Then, a flurry of giant discoveries off the coasts of South America and Africa rekindled oil majors’ interest in deep water projects and led to a boom in offshore leases two years ago. Drillers began the year predicting a recovery with oil prices at $60 per barrel. But optimism soured as the pandemic crushed demand and oil prices fell below $20 in April. This month, the number of floating rigs at work is expected to hit the lowest level since 1986 as oil companies cancel or defer contracts, said industry executives and analysts. The last downturn was cushioned by help from oil producers. Between 2014 and 2016, as crude fell to $26 per barrel from over $100, oil majors spread work among drillers to keep exploring off the coasts of Brazil, Mozambique and in the Mediterranean. That allowed drillers whose rig contracts were canceled to pick up some jobs, albeit at lower lease rates. The offshore industry was financially stronger then. Many had entered that downturn with large order backlogs and held contracts with lease rates higher than today’s, said Jorn Madsen, CEO of Maersk Drilling. But with oil majors this year slashing their own spending by between 30% and 50% to preserve cash and pay dividends there is no safety net. Winners will be those companies that get debts refinanced and get through the next two years, said industry officials. Offshore service firms may need to scrap up to 200 of the about 800 existing floating rigs to regain profitable lease rates, said David Carter Shinn, head of analysis for rig brokerage Bassoe Offshore. There is little hope for a rebound in the next few years. Many oil producers are withdrawing from projects that require $60 per barrel to earn a profit, concluding it could be years before they see that price again. Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Petronas and Royal Dutch Shell ended drilling contracts early this year to save money. “Higher cost production in our industry will be shut in and projects will be delayed,” said Rick Fowler, chief operating officer at U.S. offshore oil producer LLOG Exploration. Chevron said it will limit offshore work to fields that connect to existing infrastructure rather than start new exploration. Exxon, BP, Total and Shell declined to comment or did not reply to requests for comment on the impact on their drilling plans. The abrupt halt of exploration has been devastating to drillers. They are writing down billions of dollars on the value of their fleets. Finding new money will be difficult, said Basil Karampelas, a managing director at SierraConstellation Partners who advises companies on financial restructurings. Bankruptcy investors evaluate companies on 13-week or 26-week cash flows in making decisions, he said. But for many drillers, there will be little to show. Creditors, he said, “will have to decide if they want to ante up to get past that period.” Many of the offshore drillers are scrapping or retiring vessels, having concluded it may be years before they are needed again. Valaris plans to scrap 11 rigs and put aside nine others, estimating it may take two years before they are needed again. Seadrill, which slipped into bankruptcy in 2017 after the last oil price downturn, pioneered a model for sharing costs that might prove a path forward, said analysts. It formed joint ventures with customers including a Qatar Petroleum spinoff and Sonangol Group that have survived the last downturn. The joint ventures focused on oil fields that have long lives and gave drillers a way to lower their contract risks. The Seadrill ventures “have delivered increased fleet utilization and incremental access to markets that are expected to show significant growth over the coming years,” Seadrill spokesman Ian Cracknell said. “It could be one of the few options to move forward,” said William Turner, a vice president at Welligence Energy Analytics. “There is not a lot more folks can do to lower costs, especially in deepwater. They are going to have to get creative to survive,” he said."

-75.47770700636943," Junk-rated energy firms speed to debt markets after 2019 drought NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dawn of the new decade has brought a reprieve for debt-laden companies in the energy sector: Investors are throwing money their way again, for now. Having been largely shut out of capital markets in 2019, low-rated energy firms, some on the brink of default, are racing to secure financing. They are finding willing lenders. Indeed, the first two weeks of the year have brought as many energy junk bond sales as in the last half of 2019, according to data from Dealogic, a data analytics firm. In addition, total return in the oil and gas sector is broadly outperforming the wider high-yield debt market after getting walloped last year. This new wave of deals may keep distressed companies alive for now, but it could ultimately prolong and worsen the pain. The fundamental story in the sector has not changed - companies are highly leveraged, the oil market is amply supplied and prices are not seen rising all that much despite the recent bump from the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. “We’ll see how long this window lasts, but I think everybody is trying to take advantage,” said Sreedhar Kona, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. Of the $14.9 billion in high-yield deals to price in 2020 so far, $9.45 billion - roughly two-thirds - came from energy companies, according to Refinitiv’s Eikon. The spark appears to have come from one of the weakest credits in the sector. In early December, Chesapeake Energy, battling to stave off bankruptcy, secured a $1.5 billion loan after repeated failed attempts. Since then, the ICE/BofAML U.S. junk-rated energy index, which tracks the value of U.S. high-yield energy bonds, has risen nearly 7%, more than double the total return of the wider non-investment grade market. Energy credit spreads - a measure of the compensation demanded by investors for the added risk of holding those bonds rather than safer U.S. Treasuries - have narrowed by the most since 2016, when the sector was recovering from a collapse in oil prices.

January’s rush to market was also aided by a brief rise in oil prices on the escalation of Middle East tensions after the Trump administration killed a top Iranian military official. Brent crude futures rose above $70 a barrel but have since given back all those gains and then some. The newly revived markets will be a lifeline in particular for companies on the hook for some of the $55 billion of energy debt maturing in the next three years, according to JPMorgan. Most of January’s junk energy issuance has been for refinancing purposes, including a $750 million deal from midstream servicer Genesis Energy and a $550 million deal for natural gas producer Range Resources. Demand has also been robust enough to support a $750 million offering from offshore driller Transocean rated by Moody’s at Caa1, the lowest category of junk. The market may provide a chance for companies like oil transport firm Hornbeck Offshore to refinance some of the $674 million it has maturing in the coming two years, $224 million of which comes due on April 1. Hornbeck has been trying to complete a deal for the past two years, according to Kona. “If companies with maturities inside three years can access the market, that really does change the liquidity profile, which is what’s in question today,” said PIMCO’S Pier. The oil and gas industry depends on access to capital markets to finance its growth. With urgent needs to refinance and service existing debt, firms may not also be able to raise the cash needed to invest in new projects. Even if they do, expectations for sustained higher oil prices in 2020, and therefore cash flow in the sector, are low. A Reuters poll in late December forecast U.S. crude prices averaging $60 a barrel or more only in 2023. They were at $58.20 on Tuesday. The more stringent terms companies have had to accept to get deals done may come back to bite. For example, Western Midstream, rated junk by Moody’s and one notch above junk by S&P, secured competitive pricing for its $3.5 billion offering only by adding a provision that gives investors an additional 25 basis points on their coupon for every ratings downgrade.

0.49833887043189784," RPT-U.S. value fund managers betting shift to value stocks won't last (Repeats to additional subscribers) NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The massive U.S. market rotation into value stocks over the last two weeks is finally giving value fund managers a reason to be hopeful after years of underperformance. Yet portfolio managers from firms such as Hillman Funds, Artisan Partners and Eaton Vance say that they are taking the rally in value stocks - so called because they trade at cheaper valuations than the rapidly expanding companies in the growth stock category - to sell some of their best performers and move into companies that are further out of favor. The move is based on views that the market’s shift to value stocks will not last. Among the companies that value funds are unloading are energy stocks, which surged 2.2% on Monday after an attack on Saudi Arabian crude facilities knocked out 5% of the world’s supply. “I’m a little skeptical that this has legs,” said Aaron Dunn, co-director of value equity at Eaton Vance, noting that a sell-side firm his fund works with told him that they were seeing few buy orders from long-only funds and getting more of their business from quantitative-based strategies. “This is more of a momentum reversal and the valuations aren’t that compelling anymore.” Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan argue that the U.S. rotation into value - which has also been seen in Europe - may run further. Yet investors like Dunn argue that the move into value is fleeting. Dunn said he continues to focus on companies like business jet company Textron Inc and hot water heater manufacturer A.O. Smith Corp, which have posted weak results lately but have better long-term prospects. Perceived improvement in U.S.-China trade negotiations and better-than-expected U.S. economic data helped ease investor concern about an impending recession, lifting bond yields and sparking the market rotation into value stocks, according to research from Goldman Sachs. At the same time, the rotation has pushed momentum stocks like plant-based meat company Beyond Meat Inc and restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc into their worst two-week return since 2009. “These catalysts released the potential energy created by investor crowding” while also propping up beaten-down small-cap stocks, according to a note from the firm. At the same time, the steep increase in the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note - whose jump from 1.45% at the beginning of September to 1.85% on Monday was the largest two-week gain since November 2016 - is helping boost the shares of financial companies that reap higher profits from interest rates, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities. “This looks more like a reprieve for value than a longer-term trend,” he said. “The real question for value is, ‘Do you believe that interest rates will continue to go higher when all indications are that the economy will remain sluggish for the remainder of the year?’” Mark Hillman, whose 25% gain in his Hillman Fund puts it among the top-performing large-cap value funds tracked by Morningstar this year, said the recent market rotation is sending many value stocks closer to their fair market value. He is focusing on companies that look like they remain significantly undervalued, such as retailer Nordstrom Inc and food company Kraft Heinz Co. “We still think there is plenty of opportunity in this space,” he said. Thomas Reynolds, a portfolio manager of the Artisan Value Equity fund, said the underperformance of large technology and communications companies suggests investors are moving out of the most-crowded trades. “People have been looking at these huge tech companies with strong balance sheets almost as a safety play,” he said. Any shift away from that mindset could continue to help companies like brokerage firm E Trade Financial Corp, which is up more than 9% since the start of the month, he said. “There are lots of companies out there that the market has ignored because their stories have not been perfect,” he said. The surge in value stocks could help push the broad stock market to new highs as investor fears of an imminent recession ease, said Charles Lemonides, founder of hedge-fund ValueWorks LLC, who has been moving into shares of companies like United Natural Foods Inc and Transocean Ltd. The benchmark S&P 500 is about 1.2% below its record high of 3,027.98. “The advance has finally broadened out and the old narrow leadership has come down in price,” said Lemonides, adding that he believes the S&P 500 will soon trade above 3,300. “As a group value stocks will likely be stable, and the exciting names will be 20 percent higher and still be below their old highs.” (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Dan Grebler)"

-8.053691275167777," Greenpeace activists halt BP's North Sea oil rig (Reuters) - Greenpeace activists said on Sunday they halted the progress of an oil rig destined for BP Plc’s North Sea exploration program off the coast of Scotland. The activists demanded that one of the world’s biggest energy companies immediately end drilling new wells and invest only in renewable energy or shut its operations and return cash to investors. Greenpeace said in a statement that a team of activists in boats drew up besides the 27,000-tonne rig as it was trying to leave Cromarty Firth. The statement quoted a Greenpeace activist from Scotland it identified as Jo as saying: “This rig and the 30 million barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fueling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world.” BP said in a statement: “While we recognize the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk.” The company said it was working with Transocean Ltd, the rig’s owner and operator, and other authorities to resolve the situation. BP added that it shared the protesters’ concerns about climate and that it supported the Paris climate agreement. Responding to BP’s statement, Greenpeace said that while the rig was owned by Transocean, it was on its way to the Vorlich field to drill new oil wells operated by BP. Last month, Greenpeace activists blocked BP’s London headquarters in St James’ Square in central London, demanding the company end its oil exploration."

Novartis has estimated Alcon’s value at around 25 billion Swiss francs ($25 billion), while some analysts predict an initial market capitalization of 21 billion francs ($21 billion) to 23 billion, implying shares worth from 43 to 47 francs.

Dominated by Nestle, Novartis and Roche, the SMI is Switzerland’s most important index. Membership is based on market capitalization, adjusted for the free float of readily tradable shares in its constituents. Alcon is being spun off in a one-for-five share deal announced by Novartis last June as it focuses on new drugs rather than the surgical devices and contact lenses Alcon makes. Joining the SMI may boost demand from funds focusing on the top Swiss companies. Yet Alcon’s inclusion means healthcare and medical technology will weigh even more heavily on the SMI. Novartis’s weighting had been capped 18 percent, but with Alcon the two will account for up to 21.5 percent of the SMI, Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts estimated on Wednesday. Novartis’s biggest owners - BlackRock, the Sandoz family, Capital Research Global Investors and Vanguard Group - will have similar holdings in Alcon, between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. “We anticipate incremental buying of Alcon shares by some funds seeking to build a full-size position, offset by others not wanting to own a non-pharma eyecare company,” Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said. Novartis bought Alcon’s eye surgery and contact lens portfolio in stages through 2010 for $52 billion from Nestle, only to see it lose ground to competitors as sales and profitability slipped. In surgical equipment, Alcon competes against Johnson & Johnson, Germany’s Zeiss and Bausch in a $9 billion per year market. Rivals in vision care, worth $14 billion annually, include J&J, Cooper and Bausch. In 2016, a new Alcon head, Mike Ball from Hospira, redoubled research and marketing spending to resurrect revenue, before Novartis chief Vas Narasimhan decided to shed the division. The last comparable-sized Swiss listing was in 2010, when oil driller Transocean floated on the same day its Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico."

-27.32426303854875," U.S. court voids $160 mln award against Italy's ENI in Transocean suit March 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday supported a lower court’s finding that Italian oil producer Eni SpA breached a contract with offshore drilling contractor Transocean Ltd, but voided a $160 million damages award. A three-judge panel found the lower court miscalculated damages because it used a standby rate to determine what Eni would have paid Transocean to complete the contract. It sent the damages decision back to the District Court to recalculate damages based on what work the rig could have performed. Transocean declined to comment on the ruling.

-39.84461709211987," Saipem joint venture push with U.S. drillers draws a blank: sources MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italian oil services company Saipem is trying to lure big U.S. rivals into joint ventures but has so far failed to secure deals for stakes in drilling operations valued at up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), six sources told Reuters. Saipem, controlled by Italian state lender CDP and oil major Eni, needs joint venture deals to revive growth and underpin its balance sheet after years of falling margins. Despite a recovery in oil prices this year, sluggish demand is still testing the outlook for oilfield service companies and is expected to trigger consolidation in an industry still recovering from the 2014 downturn in energy markets. Saipem has been reviewing options for its onshore and offshore assets for the past nine months in an effort to find a partner that would help it to cut costs, the sources said. The Milan-based company hired Citi last year to sound out interest from land-based rig businesses including Patterson-UTI, Pioneer Energy Services and Helmerich and Payne, the sources said. It also approached Swiss driller Transocean, which has operations across the United States and Canada, to combine some of their respective assets but talks have failed to take off, one of the sources said. Saipem and Transocean declined to comment while Patterson-UTI, Pioneer Energy Services and Helmerich and Payne representatives were not immediately available. Italy’s biggest oil contractor started looking for joint venture partners last summer, but efforts have been hindered by tough market conditions for international drillers and high price expectations. Patterson-UTI, Pioneer and Helmerich and Payne rank as the leading oil drilling companies in the United States but they have been hit hard by an industry downturn and are taking a cautious approach to merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, the sources said. In previous attempts to find a partner Saipem boss Stefano Cao held talks with Subsea 7 in 2017 but negotiations broke down, two of the sources said, and Subsea subsequently ventured in a hostile approach for McDermott. Saipem, which recently wrote off its Venezuelan assets, last year posted a 30 percent drop in core earnings at its offshore drilling unit while the onshore business posted a 24 percent rise to 135 million euros."

10.552147239263796," UPDATE 2-Norway tells three drillers to fix oil rig lifeboat safety (Adds Odfjell Drilling comment) OSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Norway’s Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) has told Transocean , Maersk Drilling and Odfjell Drilling to beef up emergency evacuation equipment and procedures on 22 offshore oil rigs, it said on Wednesday. Drilling rigs are equipped with enclosed lifeboats that can be dropped into the ocean in an emergency and owners must meet a series of technical and operational requirements for how to plan and carry out evacuations. “All the audits identified a non-conformity from the regulations. This was the same for Maersk, Transocean and Odfjell,” PSA said, adding the firms had been asked to explain how they would fix the shortcomings. “The PSA has now received a response from (each) company, but this does not describe how the breach of the regulations is to be corrected,” it said in a statement. The audits comprised nine rigs each at Maersk and Transocean and four at Odfjell. Maersk Drilling, a subsidiary of the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, said it needed more consultations with the PSA before deciding on the measures, which might require additional investments. “We are going to continue the dialogue to understand their reasoning… and to clarify what solutions have to be implemented,” Jakob Korsgaard, head of Maersk Drilling operations in Norway, told Reuters. “Depending on the outcome, it might require modifications or upgrades of our rigs, but it’s too early to say,” he added. Odfjell Drilling said they disagreed with the PSA’s conclusion. “Our opinion has been that we operate in accordance with current regulations,” Eirik Knudsen, the company’s vice president for corporate finance and investor relations, said in an email to Reuters. “We are now working to understand PSA’s basis for notification of order,” he added. To operate on the Norwegian continental shelf, each drilling rig must have so-called Acknowledgement of Compliance (AoC), which is awarded by the PSA. While the regulator could ultimately revoke an AoC if technical conditions and safety management systems don’t meet requirements, it was premature to discuss such measures, a PSA spokesman said. Transocean did not immediately respond to Reuters requests by phone and email for comment. The PSA gave the companies a March 31 deadline to fix the shortcomings.

-34.39440993788821," Offshore drillers eye recovery by 2020 (Reuters) - Battered oil and gas drilling companies are finally seeing piecemeal signs that the prices they charge for offshore rigs are bottoming out with Brent crude selling for more than $80 a barrel and some are forecasting a full turn in the market by 2020. At the depths of a global slide that took oil below $27 a barrel in early 2016, daily rates for leasing the most sophisticated floating drilling rigs had fallen to just $180,000 from $500,000 a day, as producer returns from North Sea, Latin America and Canadian drilling evaporated. Transocean Ltd, a top supplier of drilling vessels, said last month that rates for its new high-spec vessels in the North Sea are now fetching $300,000 a day. Drillers have been predicting an upturn for more than a year only to disappoint but debt ratings firm Moody’s Investors Services said last month that it believed 2018 could mark the low point for industry earnings. In addition to higher crude prices, analysts and industry players say a wave of consolidation is expected to help remove excess capacity from the market. Transocean last year acquired rival Songa Offshore SE [SONG.UL] and recently agreed to buy deep water expert Ocean Rig UDW for $2.7 billion. London-based Ensco Plc took over Atwood Oceanics for $1.76 billion last year and this month struck a $2.38 billion deal to buy smaller rival Rowan Cos Plc and its stake in a joint venture with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco. Tie-ups with state run giants like Aramco and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] are expected to boost rates in the Middle East for drillers in the jack-up - or shallow water - rig market, while the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa are already showing signs of recovery, Rystad Energy analyst Oddmund Fore said. “A significant number of units need to be re-activated to meet the growing demand and also an upwards pressure on utilization so ... we will see a substantial uptick in rig rates,” he added. North American oil producers are facing pipeline constraints in their onshore operations, particularly at the United States’ largest oil field in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The U.S. rig count, which hit 869 on Oct. 12, has largely been flat since June. Recent auctions of offshore blocks in Brazil, Mexico and large discoveries off Guyana point to future demand for drill ships. Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp bid heavily to clinch stakes nL2N1WE0B6 in Brazil’s offshore oil play last month and research firm IHS Markit expects 2020 global offshore rig demand to average 521 units, up from a 2018 estimate of 453 units. “We really see (the) ultra-deepwater drilling market turning up,” Transocean CEO Jeremy Thigpen said during a conference call in Oslo last month. In September, Transocean extended a crucial rig deal with Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras, while Noble Corp has signed a new drilling contract in the Middle East for its new jack-up rig and expects rising demand into 2019. “I think the path to recovery is quite clear for us all now ... and, dare I say it, we are seeing the green shoots of a recovery,” Diamond Offshore CEO Marc Gerard told a Barclays energy conference last month."

-39.72798854688619," Offshore driller Ensco to buy rival Rowan in $2.38 billion deal (Reuters) - Deep-sea oil driller Ensco Plc said on Monday it would buy smaller rival Rowan Cos Plc in an all-stock deal valued at $2.38 billion, to take advantage of a nascent recovery in the sector fueled by strengthening oil prices. Offshore drilling, the worst hit during the 2014 slide in oil prices, is set to benefit as recent auctions and discoveries worldwide indicate a rising need for specialized drill ships. “We’re starting to see a broad pick up in nearly all geographies and all market segments,” Ensco Chief Executive Officer Carl Trowell told analysts on a call. The combined entity will have an enterprise value of about $12 billion and will own a fleet of 28 floating rigs and 54 jack-ups, with drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa, among others. The deal also expands Ensco’s presence in the market for higher-specification rigs, which help operators drill in challenging conditions and also fetch higher rates. “ESV will now gain exposure to the ultra-harsh jackup market, which is a market that is quickly beginning to tighten, and double-down on its already robust market share position with Saudi Aramco via addition of RDC’s ARO Drilling JV,” Tudor Pickering Holt & Co analysts said. Rowan holds a 50 percent share in ARO Drilling and rigs leased by the joint venture will be owned by the combined company after the deal closes. The Rowan deal is Ensco’s second since OPEC-led efforts boosted oil prices as offshore drillers turn to deal making to increase bargaining power amid persistently low day rates and overcapacity. Transocean Ltd, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling contractors, recently agreed to buy deep water expert Ocean Rig UAW for $2.7 billion. Ensco, which bought rival Atwood Oceanics last year, said Rowan shareholders will receive 2.215 of Ensco shares for each share held. That translates to $18.78 per share and does not offer any premium to Rowan’s Friday close. Ensco shareholders will own 60.5 percent of the combined company and Rowan the rest.

-28.69641294838145," Seadrill CEO eyes rig market consolidation as oil prices rise OSLO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Offshore rig owner Seadrill is prepared to make acquisitions if opportunities arise amid ongoing consolidation in the industry, the company’s chief executive told Reuters. Competitor Transocean on Sept. 4 announced it was buying deepwater driller Ocean Rig for $2.7 billion, its second major deal this year as companies position themselves for an upturn in exploration amid rising oil prices. “Based on the number of conversations, I believe there will be more deals... There is still a significant amount of fleet renewal that needs to happen among our competitors,” Seadrill CEO Anton Dibowitz told Reuters in an interview. While Seadrill is comfortable with the current size and composition of its fleet, it also eyes consolidation, he added. “We have a history of doing transactions, and we are certainly not going to sit on our hands,” Dibowitz said. After emerging from U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July, Seadrill remains a key component of the business empire of Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, who holds a stake of about 30 percent. “We have an active and involved anchor shareholder and it’s certainly in our DNA,” Dibowitz said when asked about potential acquisitions.

-21.964285714285708," UPDATE 1-Driller Transocean eyes improved lease rates, activity in 2019 (Adds details) Sept 5 (Reuters) - Offshore driller Transocean Ltd expects rates to lease drilling rigs to improve and contracting activity to pick up in late 2019, an outlook that drove its recent decision to purchase rival Ocean Rig UDW Inc for $2.7 billion, Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen said on Wednesday. Transocean on Tuesday agreed to buy Ocean Rig, marking its second major acquisition this year. Earlier this year, it also closed on a $1.1 billion acquisition of Norwegian rig firm Songa Offshore. The acquisitions signal an improved outlook for the offshore drilling sector which has been slow to recover from the 2014 oil price crash. Offshore fields typically require higher oil prices because they are more costly to develop. “We are far more bullish than we have been historically,” Thigpen said at a Barclay’s conference in New York. The improved outlook for day rates and contracting activity underpinned the decision to acquire Ocean Rig, he said. Transocean’s stock fell more than 6 percent this week after it announced plans to buy Ocean Rig. The company expects the market for offshore drilling vessels to move back into balance in the coming years, as some 60 units are going to come off contracts and retire, Thigpen said. He estimated actual marketable supply of offshore drilling vessels is around 184, and will increase to about 218 in the coming years.

-17.522123893805315," Transocean to buy Ocean Rig in $2.7 billion deal (Reuters) - Offshore oil driller Transocean Ltd said on Tuesday it would buy peer Ocean Rig UDW Inc in a $2.7 billion cash-and-stock deal, its second major acquisition this year as the company bets on a recovery in the offshore sector. The acquisition signals new optimism for offshore drillers, which were hit hard by the steep plunge in oil prices from 2014. Offshore projects, which are more costly than onshore work and take years to develop, became less attractive after oil prices fell to below $30 a barrel in 2016. Global crude prices have since recovered to above $70, renewing producer interest in offshore basins around the world, including Brazil and the U.S. and Mexican Gulf of Mexico. The deal would provide Switzerland-based Transocean with nine ultra-deepwater drillships and two semisubmersibles, the company said. Annual cost savings are projected to be about $70 million. “The combination of constructive and stable oil prices over the last several quarters, streamlined offshore project costs, and undeniable reserve replacement challenges has driven a material increase in offshore contracting activity,” said Transocean Chief Executive Jeremy Thigpen. Ocean Rig shares were up 11.7 percent at $30.24, after climbing roughly 13 percent, while Transocean’s U.S.-listed shares fell 6.5 percent to $11.33 at mid-morning. Transocean earlier this year acquired Norwegian rig firm Songa Offshore in a $1.1 billion deal. “We see strong contract opportunities emerging across the globe for the combined fleet (particularly in Brazil),” analysts at Tudor Pickering & Holt Co wrote in a note on Tuesday. Majors, including Norway’s Equinor, Chevron Corp and BP, won bids for offshore blocks in Brazil, which hold billions of barrels of oil. Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil Corp said last month it had begun offshore exploration drilling off Australia’s southeast coast, while also pursuing finds at its offshore Guyana discovery. “The announcement is not a surprise. Industry consolidation is necessary to get these premium assets back to work over the next two to three years,” Leslie Cook, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie, said in a note. She added that, “as rates begin to float back up, the need to keep drilling costs down will drive demand for these newer rigs.” Transocean will pay 1.6128 newly issued shares and $12.75 in cash for each share of Ocean Rig’s common stock for an implied value of $32.28 per Ocean Rig share, which represents a premium of 19.2 percent to the stock’s close on Friday. Upon completion, Transocean shareholders will own about 79 percent of the combined company, while Ocean Rig shareholders will hold the remaining 21 percent."

-19.508196721311467," Maersk Drilling strong enough to stand on its own after listing: CEO (In this August 28 story corrects headline, paragraph 6 to show listing will be via demerger, not IPO)) STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Drilling rig contractor Maersk Drilling [IPO-MAER.CO] will provide strong competition for its peers when it is spun off from the A.P. Moller-Maersk MAERSKb.CO conglomerate next year, its chief executive said on Tuesday. A.P. Moller-Maersk said on Aug. 17 it would spin off its offshore drilling operation and list it in Copenhagen next year, the latest move by the Danish shipping company to focus entirely on transport and logistics. “We will be one of the strongest (players) when it comes to the balance sheet, we will be one of the strongest when it comes to the backlog (of orders),” Maersk Drilling Chief Executive Joern Madsen told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Stavanger, Norway. “We will be able to compete with the rest of the crowd,” he said. Maersk Drilling counts BP BP.L, Aker BP AKERBP.OL, Equinor EQNR.OL and Total TOTF.PA among its biggest customers. News of the listing came after the conglomerate tried to find a buyer for the unit, whose competitors include Transocean RIGN.S, Seadrill SDRL.OL and Odjfell Drilling ODLL.OL. Madsen reiterated on Tuesday that Maersk had “looked at various options” but did not provide further details about the process. “At the end of the day, it gives shareholders an opportunity to be a part of a potential (rig market) recovery... I’m very happy about the decision myself,” he said. Maersk has not publicly put a price tag on the drilling division, but analysts have previously valued it at around $4.8 billion. Maersk Drilling reported a 2 percent increase in second-quarter EBITDA to $159 million, as sales grew around 5 percent in the quarter to $366 million. An outright sale of Maersk Drilling has been made difficult by oversupply in the drilling rig market, which has yet to recover despite a rebound in oil prices. Maersk Drilling fleet utilisation rates stood at around 61 percent for floating rigs and 71 percent for jack-up rigs, below levels of around 85 percent which historically gave rig owners the power to increase rates. “Our customers are talking about longer drilling programmes and that is normally an indication that something is on the rise,” Madsen said, adding that the market consensus was for rates in the drilling industry to rise towards 2020. However, he said he expected the industry’s business model to change in the future, moving away from dayrates to more closer cooperation with its customers. “I don’t think we are going to see that the industry only remains with the dayrate model... We will see more and more oil companies come out and say ‘We want to work closer with you as a contractor and we want you to share with us the risk and the upside’,” he said. Madsen said the company currently didn’t plan to expand its fleet or change its composition, two-thirds of which are jack-up rigs which drill in shallow waters while the rest are floating rigs."

-1.6793893129770907," Norway oil workers' strike accelerates, drillers fear contract losses OSLO (Reuters) - A strike by Norwegian offshore oil and gas workers accelerated on Monday when hundreds more walked out in a dispute over pay and pensions after employers failed to respond to union demands for a new offer. The strike, which began last Tuesday, has had a limited impact on Norway’s oil production so far, but some drillers warned of possible contract cancellations if the dispute goes on for a month or more. A further 900 workers went on strike on Monday, joining almost 700 who walked out last week, and the Safe union said it would consider in the next few days whether to widen the strike to all of its 2,250 members. Safe went ahead with its plan to expand the strike after employers did not respond to its demands for higher wages and pension benefits by a midnight (2200 GMT) Sunday deadline. The expanded strike was not expected to have any immediate extra impact on oil or gas production beyond the closure last week of Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Norway’s biggest oil producer Equinor said it did not expect its output to be affected “in the short term” due to the escalation of the strike. “More drilling and well operations are affected. We will get delays ... In the short term we do not see any production or milestone consequences,” said Equinor spokesman Eskil Eriksen. He declined to comment on what the company considered “short term” and what the long-term consequences would be. It is the biggest strike in Norway’s oil sector since 2012, but has involved a relatively small number of workers. Norway’s oil industry directly employed 50,700 workers in 2017, around half of whom worked in production, according to Statistics Norway. There has been no contact between employers and the union since the strike began last Tuesday after Safe rejected a proposed wage and pension deal. Employers, represented by the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, said on Monday that the union “lacked understanding of the economic reality of the Norwegian continental shelf”. “It is ... utterly incomprehensible that Safe is willing to put at risk jobs, the shelf’s attractiveness and competitiveness, and Norway’s reputation as a safe and stable supplier of oil and gas resources,” lead negotiator Jacob Korsgaard said in a statement. Korsgaard told Reuters he did not plan further talks with the union this week, after saying on Saturday that a dispute like this could not go on indefinitely and that employers were considering counter measures. Reidun Ravndal, a member of Safe’s strike committee, said that while 900 additional workers were joining the strike on Monday, it would take some time for the strike to become fully effective because they have to follow safe shutdown procedures. One of the drilling companies affected, Odfjell Drilling, warned of financial losses and of contract cancellations if the strike lasts “a long time”. “There will be a financial loss, yes. We have mechanisms in the contracts to compensate, but if it lasts a long time consequences will be serious,” CEO Simen Lieungh told Reuters, without specifying a time span. “Contracts could be terminated,” he said, mentioning contracts with Equinor and Aker BP. Contract terminations is a concern for other drillers too, according to lead negotiator Jacob Korsgaard. “It is a real concern that increases every day,” he told Reuters. Asked whether the strike could lead to contract cancellations if it were to last more than a month, he said: “Definitely.” Last week Aker BP said a prolonged strike could postpone output from some of the wells it was planning to drill at its Valhall field, which it expected to put in production later in the year. The employees joining the action work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem, Transocean, Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling, Archer and COSL, among others. Asked whether the strike might be widened to the remaining drilling workers that belong to the union, Ravndal of the Safe union told Reuters: “We will have this discussion in the next few days.”"

The employers, who say workers already have fair wages, are considering countermeasures if the strike doesn’t end soon. “Obviously a conflict like this cannot go on for ever. All counter-measures are considered,” said Korsgaard, without giving details. In 2012, employers threatened to shut down all oil and gas operations in Norway after a weeks-long strike choked off 13 percent of the country’s output. In that strike, the government ordered offshore workers back to work to avoid a total shutdown, invoking laws that allow it to end strikes that threaten big economic damage. “The government has that measure if they find it relevant,” said Korsgaard."
-2.0786933927245816," UPDATE 1-Norway oil strike: sides not talking, Aker BP warns of production hit (Adds comments from union, mediator, background) OSLO, July 13 (Reuters) - A four-day oil workers’ strike in Norway that may escalate on Monday would have to last a month to impact Aker BP’s production from the Valhall field in the North Sea, the Norwegian energy company said. Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, closing Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Four days in and the conflicting parties were still not talking to each other, a union official and a mediator told Reuters on Friday. Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said activity at the Valhall IP water injection and Valhall DP drilling platforms would stop if the strike escalated. “If the strike is prolonged it will have later in the year impact on when wells are back in production ... if that is going to happen it means the strike has to be quite long,” he said during the firm’s second-quarter results presentation. Aker BP later told Reuters a strike of a month to six weeks could impact output at the field by “a few thousands barrels per day”. “Some of the wells that are drilled are planned to be put in production at the end of this year. If the strike lasts, the output will move to next year, which would have an impact on this year’s production outlook,” investor relations contact Kjetil Bakken said. In the short term, Aker BP plans to use any lost drilling time to perform maintenance and activities to raise the flow of oil and gas, Hersvik said. Aker BP holds a 90 percent stake in the Valhall field, which produced 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2017. The firm has plans to increase production. Just two days before 901 more oil workers could walk out, Norway’s Safe union and the country’s Shipowners’ Association, representing employers, have yet to talk to each other, the union’s negotiator said. “So far there is no contact. If they want to talk they have to do so,” Roy Aleksandersen told Reuters. A mediator appointed to smooth negotiations said neither side had tried to reach him since the industrial action began.

Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, leading to the shutdown of one Shell-operated field and helping send Brent crude prices higher. “We haven’t been contacted by the shipowners yet. They have to make the contact, they know our demands. Could be a strategic move from them to reach out before we shut more rigs on Sunday,” Safe union leader Hilde-Marit Rysst told Reuters. The union plans to have an additional 901 workers on strike from 2200 GMT on Sunday, unless the dispute is resolved. Those employees work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem, Transocean, Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling , Archer and COSL, among others. Still, Sunday’s possible escalation is not expected to lead to any further drops in output for now. The Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, representing employers, does not intend to initiate contact with Safe on Thursday, a spokeswoman said. “We have no contacts planned today,” she said. “What happens afterwards can change any minute.” The Shipowners’ Association is in contact with all drillers involved to assess the situation. Shell told Reuters it had completed the shutdown of the Knarr field, which had a daily output of 23,900 barrels of mostly oil, but also natural gas liquids and natural gas. Equinor, Norway’s largest oil and gas producer, reiterated that the strike had halted some of its drilling and well intervention operations, though the company’s output remained unaffected. “We will continue to evaluate what is happening and will monitor the situation,” said a spokesman for Equinor, formerly known as Statoil. One strike-hit rig, the Songa Enabler, is due to drill an exploration well in the Barents Sea for Equinor in August. “At the moment, it (this strike) will not have any immediate effect on our exploration plans. Exploration in the Barents Sea is in late summer, it has not started yet,” the Equinor spokesman said."

-6.7471590909090855," Hundreds of Norway oil workers go on strike, Shell shuts Knarr field OSLO (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, leading to the shutdown of one Shell-operated field and helping send Brent crude prices higher. One union said hundreds more workers would join the strike on Sunday if an agreement over union demands for a wage increase and pension rights was not reached. Royal Dutch Shell said that due to the strike it was temporarily closing production at its Knarr field, which has a daily output of 23,900 barrels of mostly oil, but also natural gas liquids and natural gas. Shutting the field, whose owners are Idemitsu, Wintershall [WINT.UL] and DEA, could take up to 36 hours, it said. Norway is Western Europe’s biggest oil producer. The disruption added to a rise in global oil supply outages and helped push Brent crude up 1.2 percent to $79.03 per barrel. The output of Norway’s biggest oil producer Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, was not affected so far, the company said, even though it was shutting drilling operations at its Snorre B platform. Shortly after a midnight deadline passed, a state-appointed mediator said talks between two trade unions, Safe and YS, and the Shipowners’ Association, representing the rig employers, had failed to reach a deal. “The parties were so far apart from each other there was no point presenting a proposal that could be recommended to both sides,” mediator Carl Petter Martinsen said in a statement. The Safe union wants pension rights to be the same for everyone regardless of whether an employee is new to a company or has many years of experience. It also wants wages for drilling workers to match those of workers for oil companies, which are higher. The Norwegian Shipowners’ Association said Safe was asking for a 50,000 Norwegian crown ($6,225) salary increase for unskilled workers, equivalent to about 8 percent of current wages. The leader of Safe said she did not recognize the figures presented by the Shipowners’ Association. Around 670 workers would walk out from Tuesday, with an additional 901 employees joining them from midnight on Sunday if the dispute is not resolved, Safe said in letters to the Shipowners’ Association. In total, up to 2,250 workers could join the action, it said. Norway’s oil sector directly employed 50,700 workers in 2017, of whom 26,700 worked in production and 23,500 in related services, according to Statistics Norway. The rest were occupied in transportation through pipelines. It was the biggest strike affecting the sector since a 16-day industrial action in 2012 cut the country’s output of crude by about 13 percent and its natural gas production by about 4 percent. Talks between the two striking Norwegian unions and rig employers will not resume for a few days, the leader of Safe, Hilde-Marit Rysst, told Reuters. “We have no contact with the employers yet. It will take some days at least before we hear from them ... If they want to contact us they will probably reach out to us before the bigger strike on Sunday,” Rysst said. The Shipowners’ Association, representing the employers, said it was keen to resolve the situation. “We have no scheduled contacts as of now but we have every will to seek a solution,” Jakob Korsgaard, lead negotiator for the Shipowners’ Association, told Reuters. “The effect of a strike like this is substantial financially.” He did not specify whether the association would contact the unions before Sunday’s strike escalation. Industri Energi, the union which represents the majority of Norwegian oil drilling workers, concluded a wage deal earlier this year with the Shipowners’ Association and is not on strike. Safe said 106 workers from the Teekay Petrojarl production ship operating at Shell’s Knarr field would walk out initially. Norway pumped 1.97 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids a day in 2017, according to BP’s Statistical Review published in June. Natural gas production was 123 billion cubic meters last year, BP reported, making Norway the world’s seventh biggest producer and Europe’s largest gas supplier after Russia. Safe said workers on rigs that conduct exploration or production drilling for oil firms would also walk out on Tuesday. That includes 117 workers from the Transocean Spitsbergen rig; 80 from the Songa [SONG.UL] Offshore Enabler; 71 from Odfjell Drilling’s Deepsea Stavanger; and 60 from North Atlantic Drilling’s West Elara rig. Others set to join the action include 40 Archer drilling workers on the Snorre B platform operated by Equinor; 67 from COSL working on the COSL Innovator rig; 50 from Island Offshore, a supply vessel firm; and 59 from the KCA Deutag MODU drilling contractor working on the Askeladden rig. The employees that could walk out on Sunday work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem, Transocean, Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling, Archer and COSL, among others. Some catering workers will also be striking, Safe said."

7.721712538226298," Seadrill CEO sees consolidation speeding up drilling market recovery OSLO, July 3 (Reuters) - Consolidation among smaller offshore oil rig companies would help to boost a recovery in the drilling market, the CEO of offshore rig firm Seadrill said on Tuesday, a day after it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Seadrill started trading new shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday and plans to list new shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange by end of July or beginning of August. Shares of Seadrill, controlled by Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, opened at $25 a share, but slid to $18 a share by 1508 GMT. Once the world’s largest offshore driller by the market capitalisation, Seadrill had to seek protection from creditors last September after being hit by prolonged oil market downturn which started in 2014. Oil prices have partly recovered since hitting a low in January 2016, and demand for drilling rigs is up. Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said consolidation of smaller players could help the drilling market’s recovery. “Anybody with the fleet of less than 10-15 rigs probably needs to be consolidated ... All who don’t have scale are candidates for consolidation,” he said. While there has been a lot of talk about the need to consolidate fragmented rig market, there have been only a few significant deals so far. Ensco acquired Atwood Oceanics, and Transocean bought Songa Offshore last year, while Borr Drilling took over Paragon Offshore this year. Danish shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk has been not yet found a buyer for its offshore drilling division, Maersk Drilling. “Whether it (consolidation) comes from us or from smaller competitors, it will be positive,” Dibowitz said. Seadrill itself was “comfortable” with the size and composition of its fleet, which includes 19 floating rigs and 16 jack-up rigs, he added. Dibowitz said the upturn in the market was becoming stronger with the numbers of tenders and opportunities increasing. He said the North Sea market had been “particularly attractive,” while demand for deep and ultradeep water drilling was up in Brazil, West Africa and U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The CEO said the company had continued to provide drilling rigs to oil and gas firm during the bankruptcy proceedings, but it had been a drag on business. “It would be absolutely easier for us to secure more work, because you don’t have that black mark or flag,” Dibowitz said in an interview. A Seadrill spokesman said eleven out of the company’s 19 floating rigs and nine out of 16 jack-ups were employed or about to start work. Dibowitz said the company would stick to its strategy to provide “any kind of asset in any market to any customer.. harsh, benign, shallow, deep.” (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis.

2.998379254457058," Norway's Odfjell Drilling to expand fleet as rig market recovers OSLO, April 20 (Reuters) - Offshore rig firm Odfjell Drilling plans to expand its floating rig fleet to between six and 10 from four now, it said on Friday, the latest sign of recovery in the energy industry. After cuts in exploration spending following an oil price plunge that began in 2014, energy firms are now hiring rigs as crude prices have recovered some ground. Odfjell raised $175 million via a new share issue on Thursday to help buy semi-submersible Stena Midmax Rig from Samsung Heavy Industries for $505 million. The new issue sent the Norwegian firm’s shares down 10 percent. Akastor, an investment company controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, also plans to invest $75 million to help finance the acquisition. “Financially it’s a very attractive deal, which should give us a return of 12 to 20 percent over the next six years,” Akastor Chief Financial Officer Leif Borge told Reuters, adding that his firm wanted closer ties with Odfjell. In total, Odfjell plans to raise $618 million, including $325 million in secured bank debt, to pay for the rig, upgrades, project supervision and working capital. Odfjell told investors it was talking with yards for pricing potential newbuilds for further fleet expansion to compete with companies such as Transocean or Seadrill. Odfjell operates four modern harsh-environment floating rigs, working in the North Sea under long-term contracts with BP , Statoil and Aker BP. The North Sea has seen the biggest increase in demand for harsh-environment floating rigs, with utilisation rates rising to more than 90 percent in 2018, Odfjell’s presentation to investors showed. Historically, utilisation rates at 85 percent or above were needed for drillers to demand higher prices from oil companies. To finance its new rig, Odfjell issued 38 million new shares on Thursday at 36 Norwegian crowns ($4.61). The company also said it planned to offer 4.3 million shares at the same price to other shareholders to reach the initial target of 1.56 billion crowns. The stock was trading at 35.55 crowns at 1305 GMT."
