-0.45346775878434864," After roller coaster year, Six Flags prepares theme park hiring spree (Reuters) - Six Flags Entertainment Corp will hire thousands of workers this year as it prepares to reopen its theme parks after pandemic-induced shutdowns, thanks to COVID-19 vaccine rollouts. The company, known for roller coaster rides such as the El Toro, Batman the Ride and Bizarro, said on Friday it was planning on reopening all of its 26 theme parks in North America and that it would hire workers for its parks virtually. Arlington, Texas-based Six Flags Entertainment was forced to shut some parks in 2020 and operate others at minimum capacity as rising COVID-19 cases prompted restrictions across the country. That forced the theme park operator to cut its full-time workforce by about 10% in October. Walt Disney Co also laid off more than thirty thousand workers last year and had to close its theme parks for a second time as cases rose in Paris and Southern California. Six Flags Entertainment said it was working with state and government officials to set reopening dates for parks in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mexico City and Canada."

-54.66598293002814," Six Flags raises possibility of canceling China theme parks, shares plunge (Reuters) - U.S. theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment Corp SIX.N on Friday raised the possibility of terminating all of its projects under construction in China due to the growing debt problems of its local partner, sending its shares down 16%. Six Flags said in a regulatory filing its partner in China, real estate developer Riverside Investment Group, had defaulted on its payments to the company due to a declining market. “The development of the Six Flags-branded parks in China has encountered continued challenges and has not progressed as expected,” Six Flags said. “While the company continues to work with Riverside ... the eventual outcome is unknown and could range from the continuation of one or more projects to the termination of all the Six Flags-branded projects in China.” The nearly sixty-year-old Texas-based company’s first park in China, Six Flags Zhejiang, outside Shanghai, was set to open this summer. Its delay and potential cancellation is the latest international roadblock for the American company after the cancellation of a project in Dubai last year. The projects in China were expected to provide a much-needed new source of revenue for the company, which on Friday also said fewer people visited its North American parks in the fourth quarter potentially causing revenue to fall by $8 million to $10 million. With the Chinese parks now in limbo, Wells Fargo cut its rating on the stock to “equal weight” from “overweight”. Six Flags said it would adjust its fourth-quarter revenue lower by $1 million due to its China troubles."
-6.540239006730928," Exclusive: Cedar Fair rebuffs $4 billion offer from Six Flags - sources (Reuters) - U.S. amusement park operator Cedar Fair LP FUN.N has rejected a $4 billion cash-and-stock offer from larger peer Six Flags Entertainment Corp SIX.N as inadequate, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Cedar Fair’s decision is a blow to Six Flags, which is already the world’s largest regional theme park operator and has been looking to expand its footprint so it can increase its ticketing pricing power. Six Flags had offered to acquire Cedar Fair for around $70 per share, to be paid for the most part by using Six Flags shares as currency, but also funded with a small cash component, the sources said. Cedar Fair shares were trading at around $58 right before Reuters broke news of Six Flags’ bid on Wednesday. Cedar Fair responded that Six Flags’ bid was too low, not least because it did not compensate Cedar Fair shareholders for giving up on the company’s tax-advantageous publicly traded partnership. This allows the company to pay out the majority of its earnings to shareholders without first paying U.S. federal or state income taxes. Six Flags Chief Executive James Reid-Anderson is preparing to retire by the end of February, and the company had offered Cedar Fair executives roles in the management of the combined company, though this was not enough to persuade them, the sources added. Reactions from stock market investors, as well as amusement park fans concerned about the impact of the potential deal on how Cedar Fair parks will be run, have been negative, and there is no indication that Six Flags will counter with a new offer, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Cedar Fair and Six Flags did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Based in Grand Prairie, Texas, Six Flags has 26 parks across the United States, Mexico and Canada. Headquartered in Sandusky, Ohio, Cedar Fair owns and operates 11 amusement parks, four outdoor water parks and an indoor water park in several U.S. states and in Toronto, Ontario. Dealmaking in the leisure and entertainment sector has been heating up. Earlier this week, private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N said it had agreed to acquire a 65% stake in U.S. resort operator Great Wolf Resorts Inc in a $2.9 billion deal. Great Wolf’s owner, Centerbridge Partners LP, will remain an investor in the company."

The move shows how Six Flags, already the world’s largest regional theme park operator, wants to expand its footprint so it can increase ticketing pricing power, even as Chief Executive James Reid-Anderson is preparing to retire by the end of February. Cedar Fair is considering Six Flags’ cash-and-stock offer, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, the sources said. Details of the offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Six Flags declined to comment, while Cedar Fair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cedar Fair shares jumped as much 11.4% on the news before paring gains, giving the company a market capitalization of around $3.36 billion. Six Flags shares fell as much as 5.3% before trimming losses, giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $4.3 billion.

-3.1037961897978916," Six Flags gets $7.5 million payout after Dubai partner ends project DUBAI (Reuters) - Six Flags will receive $7.5 million from the U.S. company’s Dubai partner DXB Entertainments, which has ended plans to build a Six Flags theme park. DXB owns Dubai Parks and Resorts, a group of theme parks in the south of Dubai including the Hollywood-inspired Motiongate and a Lego-themed water park. It said in February plans for Six Flags Dubai would not go ahead because financing was no longer available. DXB Entertainments said in a statement on Tuesday it will pay $7.5 million to Six Flags as part of a settlement agreement with both sides agreeing there would be no further claims. The Dubai theme park company said it will retain exclusive right of first refusal for use of ‘Six Flags’ intellectual property rights in the United Arab Emirates for five years. Numerous theme parks and other entertainment venues have opened in the UAE in recent years, although some have struggled due to low visitor numbers and high costs. DXB Entertainments first quarter loss widened to 215.7 million dirhams ($58.73 million), it reported in May. In neighboring Saudi Arabia, Six Flags is involved in a park in a project being built on a 334 square km (8,400 acre) site, making it 2-1/2 times the size of Disney World."
-9.36091911645764," UPDATE 1-Six Flags Dubai theme park put on hold as funding withdrawn (Adds detail, context) DUBAI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - DXB Entertainments PJSC said on Wednesday that the Six Flags theme park in Dubai had been put on hold as the financing for the project was no longer available. The move is the latest sign that the Gulf’s leading tourism and commerce hotspot is being buffeted by the impact of an economic slowdown in the region triggered by lower oil prices and geopolitical tensions. DXB Entertainments said the decision came after its board in August 2018 mandated a strategic review of its future development plans and capital deployment. That included Six Flags Dubai, once slated to open later this year. “In the intervening period, actions, including formal notification by Six Flags, resulted in funders’ concerns being raised specifically in relation to the revised projections for the Six Flags Dubai Project,” the firm said in a statement. As a result, the syndicated financing intended to help pay for the park is no longer available and the project cannot proceed, it added. A flurry of theme parks and other entertainment offerings have emerged in the United Arab Emirates in recent years, with some struggling due to low visitor numbers and high costs. The company last year said it had restructured 4.2 billion dirhams ($1.1 billion) in bank debt and received fresh funding from its majority shareholder, Meraas Holding, a Dubai government-linked developer. Its most recent third-quarter financial results showed a narrowing of losses compared to the year earlier and a rise in visitor numbers for the period. DXB Entertainments said the scope of its strategic review will be adjusted and an update will be provided in due course.

15.544464764878988," Saudi Arabia still moving ahead with three major development projects DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is still moving ahead with three major development projects, NEOM, the Red Sea tourism project, and an entertainment development that will include a Six Flags theme park. The global outrage over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has prompted some Western companies to put partnerships on hold, or hold off from taking funds from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, which is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. British billionaire Richard Branson earlier this month said he would suspend his directorship in two Saudi tourism projects around the Red Sea, citing Khashoggi’s disappearance. Saudi Arabia’s mega business zone called NEOM is still proceeding with prospective partners, despite the fallout over Khashoggi, NEOM’s chief executive Nadhmi al-Nasr said on Thursday. “I’ve had tens of meetings last couple of days with all the partners we’ve been talking to for last few years. The feeling is ‘let’s go,’” al-Nasr said. There will be 16 sectors in the NEOM economy, sectors that are meant to become competitive multinational corporations, al-Nasr said. Sector planning will last until May or June 2019, then construction and implementation afterwards, he added. Theme park operator Six Flags SIX.N is going ahead with plans to open in Saudi Arabia, Michael Reininger, the chief executive of Saudi Arabia's Qiddiya said. Qiddiya, which is about an hour’s drive from Riyadh, is being built on a 334 square km (8,400 acre) site, making it 2-1/2 times the size of Disney World. Construction of Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea tourism project will start in 2019 and open the first phase of its development in 2022, the Red Sea Development Company’s chief executive, John Pagano, said. Saudi Arabia plans to develop resorts on 50 islands off the Red Sea coast, backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. The Red Sea Project, to be built between the cities of Amlaj and al-Jawh, will offer a nature reserve, diving in coral reefs and heritage sites."
