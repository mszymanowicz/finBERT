13.739612185634245," Reuters names new White House correspondents and creates team to cover Trump post-presidency Reuters today announced three correspondents joining the White House team to cover the Biden administration, as well as the creation of a new team to cover the Trump post-presidency. Nandita Bose, Trevor Hunnicutt and Jarrett Renshaw will become White House correspondents for Reuters, joining a team that includes Jeff Mason, Steve Holland and Alexandra Alper. In addition, Jason Szep, global spot enterprise editor for Reuters, will run a new team focused on in-depth coverage of the Trump post-presidency. The team, which includes reporters Linda So, Joe Tanfani and Pete Eisler, will focus initially on the legal battles Trump faces on leaving office, working in collaboration with the Reuters legal news team and the broader newsroom. Bose began her career at Reuters as an intern in 2006. She was hired on the commodities desk to cover the metals market and went on to have assignments across Asia before moving to the United States. She moved to Washington two years ago and has focused on the intersection of company news and politics, delivering ahead-of-the-curve enterprise and scoops on companies such as Amazon and the incoming Biden administration’s ties with Silicon Valley. Hunnicutt, a onetime intern at Reuters, joined the markets desk in New York in 2015. He went on to join the economics team in 2019 as the Federal Reserve worked to stave off recession. Trevor joined the election team in fall 2019, covering Joe Biden for the remainder of the Democratic primary campaign and then the general election campaign. Renshaw joined Reuters in 2014 and covered the U.S. oil industry, including the war between oil and corn over ethanol mandates. He moved to the election team in 2019, covering the Trump campaign and the Biden transition team. Before joining Reuters, Jarrett covered local and state governments, including a stint covering Chris Christie’s tenure as New Jersey’s governor. Szep, who joined Reuters in 1990, brings deep and wide experience to his new role, having served across Asia and America on a range of reporting and editing beats, from economics and politics to war and diplomacy. His work has earned many honors in recent years, including the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 2014, with Andrew R.C. Marshall, for their coverage of sectarian violence in Myanmar.

7.433451405440428," Reuters cameraman detained in Ethiopia has seen no evidence against him, lawyer says NAIROBI (Reuters) - Reuters cameraman Kumerra Gemechu has been held in solitary confinement for nearly a week without charge or being given any evidence of wrongdoing, his lawyer said. His lawyer Melkamu Ogo said on Wednesday that police informed him that their lines of enquiry included accusations of disseminating false information, communicating with groups fighting the government, and disturbing the public’s peace and security. However, he said he has seen no evidence. Kumerra was arrested at his home in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa last Thursday and is being held until at least Jan. 8 pending a police investigation. Kumerra’s family said he was being held in a cold cell and was sleeping on a mattress on the floor. However, they said they were being allowed to visit Kumerra, as is his lawyer, and have brought him extra clothing, food and medication. The Ethiopian police and prosecutor’s office did not respond to questions from Reuters on the reasons for Kumerra’s arrest and the conditions in which he is being held, nor requests for comment on his case. “Kumerra is part of a Reuters team that reports from Ethiopia in a fair, independent and unbiased way,” Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement on Monday. “Kumerra’s work demonstrates his professionalism and impartiality, and we are aware of no basis for his detention.” Similar accusations have been levelled against several other journalists this year, Melkamu said. However, media watchdog groups say in most cases no formal charges were filed. Police and government officials did not respond to requests for comment. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has overseen sweeping reforms since taking office in 2018, including the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners and unbanning of scores of media outlets. However, some rights activists have expressed concern that his government may be reverting to some of its predecessor’s authoritarian ways. Thousands of people were arrested this year after outbreaks of deadly violence, including a conflict between the military and a rebellious regional force in the northern region of Tigray. Media watchdog groups, including the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF), reported the arrests of at least seven Ethiopian journalists in November, the month that fighting broke out in Tigray. “After freeing the journalists who were in prison when Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in 2018, the Ethiopian authorities are now going into reverse,” said Arnaud Froger, who heads the RSF’s Africa desk. The prime minister’s office did not return calls and messages seeking comment. However, his government has previously said the nation is facing security threats, and it is committed to maintaining law and order. Reuters has been unable to determine whether Kumerra’s arrest was connected to his work. His wife, Hawi Desalegn, said the couple’s three children were deeply upset about his arrest. On Tuesday, she said that their 4-year-old son woke up several times in the night before crying “Daddy” and that their 7-year-old daughter was displaying outbursts of anger. Her 10-year-old sister bursts into tears every time his name is mentioned, she said. “We try to avoid talking about her dad in her presence.”"

The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 0.1% by 0803 GMT, struggling to break past a fresh 10-month high hit in the previous session. Drugmaker AstraZeneca rose 1.6%, giving the biggest boost to the index, after the company said it is working with the government to begin vaccinations early next year. The regulatory approval is a welcome boost for AstraZeneca and the Oxford team, which has been accused of lack of clarity about the results from late-stage trials.

11.481138498428958," How Reuters analyzed court data on qualified immunity (Reuters) - (This article, originally published May 8, has been updated to include information to the latest story in this series: SPECIAL REPORT-Challenging police violence...while Black USA-POLICE/IMMUNITY-RACE.) Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has repeatedly criticized her fellow justices for creating, as she put it in a 2018 dissent, an “absolute shield” for police officers accused of excessive force. So Reuters reporters decided to test her words. Sotomayor isn’t alone in faulting the court for making it too easy for cops accused of violating the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the public from unreasonable search and seizure. Groups from across the political spectrum have set their sights on the obscure legal doctrine known as qualified immunity, created half a century ago to shield police and other government employees from legal liability for actions they take on the job. But no one had measured whether the critics were right: Were the Supreme Court’s actions making it easier for police to beat back lawsuits by claiming qualified immunity? And how were the high court’s interventions playing out in the lower courts? To answer these questions, Reuters reporters built and analyzed a database made up of information from all three levels of the federal courts: district and appellate courts and the Supreme Court. Reporters first analyzed 529 federal circuit court opinions published from 2005 through 2019 on appeals of cases in which cops accused of excessive force raised a qualified immunity defense. Not all opinions are published, but those that are set precedent for lower courts. We identified the cases by searching written opinions in Westlaw, a legal research service owned, like Reuters, by Thomson Reuters Corp. Westlaw researchers estimate that the search captured nearly all relevant cases. Reporters manually reviewed almost 1,000 opinions to eliminate those unrelated to excessive force or for which no qualified immunity defense was raised. Among those excluded from the analysis were claims against correction officers for incidents that occurred in jails and prisons. For every relevant opinion, reporters recorded dozens of characteristics related to the facts of the case, such as whether and how the civilian was armed, the type of force the officers applied, and whether the civilian was injured or died in the encounter with police. We also recorded whether the court granted qualified immunity and some specifics about that decision. For example, did the court find that the civilian’s civil rights may have been violated, or did the court skip this question? Did the court find a clearly established precedent that the force was unconstitutional? Our analysis of this data showed the appellate courts’ growing tendency, influenced by guidance from the Supreme Court, to grant police immunity. More than ever, they are ignoring the question of whether cops have violated a plaintiff’s constitutional rights, thereby avoiding establishing a precedent for future cases and making it harder to win cases against the police. The failure to set precedents is particularly challenging for plaintiffs because the data also showed that appellate courts are increasingly requiring a nearly identical case from the past to serve as a precedent that clearly establishes an officer’s actions as illegal – a high standard that again makes it hard to win against the police. The appellate court analysis revealed another important finding: Though the U.S. judicial system prides itself on impartiality and the even application of justice across the nation, wide regional variations exist in the rate at which officers win immunity appeals. To probe this phenomenon more deeply, Reuters turned to the district courts, where litigation begins. We focused on federal districts in Texas, a state within the jurisdiction of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where police won appeals at a high rate, and California, in the 9th Circuit, where their success rate was much lower. We looked at qualified immunity decisions from 2014 to 2018 and recorded how judges in the different districts interpreted the Supreme Court’s recent guidance. It is impossible to build a complete list of excessive force, qualified immunity cases from district court data, but after consulting with legal specialists, Reuters reporters are confident they reviewed the vast majority of cases. We started by filtering Westlaw’s federal district court docket listings to identify all civil rights cases, which is how almost all excessive force cases start. We further whittled the list by selecting only cases with the types of motions in which qualified immunity typically is raised. By a combination of computer analysis and a manual review of at least 2,000 cases, we ultimately categorized 435 excessive force lawsuits in which officers sought qualified immunity – 277 in California and 158 in Texas. Our analysis found striking differences in how district judges in the two states were ruling on qualified immunity requests, despite a mandate to follow and apply the same Supreme Court precedents. Judges in Texas, for example, were more likely to grant immunity to officers who used force against unarmed civilians than judges in California did for officers in cases where civilians were armed. In one of her dissents, Justice Sotomayor called out a “disturbing trend” in which the Supreme Court intervened more often at the request of officers than civilians. To quantify just how often this was happening, Reuters downloaded the Supreme Court’s docket and paired it with Westlaw data to identify police use-of-force cases mentioning qualified immunity. Reuters used decisions from the Supreme Court’s terms from 2005 through 2018, the last term for which complete data was available. Reporters again manually reviewed cases to determine which party petitioned the court and the petition’s outcome. We excluded pro se cases, those in which petitioners served as their own lawyers, because requests not drafted by attorneys have a significantly lower success rate. In total, Reuters identified 121 relevant petitions – 65 submitted by police and 56 submitted by civilians. Our data confirmed Sotomayor’s statement. An officer was 3.5 times more likely than a civilian to have a petition accepted. The circumstances of a case – whether a civilian drew a weapon or resisted arrest, for example – can influence judicial decisions on qualified immunity. Yet even after controlling for such factors, we still found a significant increase over time in appeals decisions granting qualified immunity, as well as significant differences in outcomes between regions and in the Supreme Court’s own decisions about whether to take a case. We did not find significant differences in grant rates for plaintiffs of different races after accounting for other factors, but there were significant differences in the level of injury among plaintiffs of different races. Plaintiffs and defendants sometimes disagree about whether a person was armed during an encounter with police. We considered a person armed only if a weapon was recovered at the scene. In our count of people armed with guns, we included firearms as well as objects specifically designed to look like them, such as BB and toy guns. When police mistook other objects for guns or weapons – such as a flashlight – we counted the person as unarmed. We determined the plaintiff’s race in 95% of the cases we analyzed by consulting court records, other official records such as coroner’s reports, or attorneys. In 1% of cases, we relied on local news reports that mentioned the plaintiff’s race. We were unable to determine the race in 16 cases. To analyze the impact of a plaintiff’s injury, we classified injuries as severe if they involved gunshot wounds (excepting grazing) or brain injuries, if they resulted in permanent disability, or if they required surgery or hospitalization."

9.388108600000928," EXCERPTS-Russian central bank governor speaks at press conference (Adds quotes) MOSCOW, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Below are excerpts translated from Russian by Reuters from Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking at an online press conference after the central bank kept its key rate unchanged at 4.25% on Friday. “When taking a decision on the key rate in the future, we have to additionally assess how the situation will develop and also whether there is still room left for lowering the rate. It is difficult to give an assertive answer to this question now.” “If the impact of one-off factors is quickly exhausted and there is a reversal in the dynamic of inflation expectations, then I do not rule out that there might be grounds for additional downward movement in the rate. But such grounds may not appear.” “For the whole of 2021 we think the orientation of monetary policy will be soft. The timing and pace of normalisation will depend on the development of the situation, there are a lot of uncertainties.” “As far as publishing the rate trajectory is concerned, we will indeed publish this next year, most likely in the first half of the year.” “Certainly our view on the balance of proinflationary and disinflationary risks has changed slightly. We don’t see the predominance of disinflationary risks as we saw it previously.” “Current annual inflation indicators are markedly higher than the trajectory of our October forecast. At the end of 2020, inflation is seen in the range of 4.6-4.9%.” “Our preliminary estimate is that annual inflation will be around 5% in the first quarter of next year. Then, if the impact of one-off factors subsides relatively quickly, it will drop and return to 4% in the middle of the year.” “We of course think the share of the state in the banking sector should be decreased. We are firmly committed to exiting the banks we have holdings in. And the sooner we do this, the better.” “If a decision is taken to introduce a digital rouble, this will be a very gradual process.” “In our view, it will not have any impact on credit rates, and deposit rates will be the same with or without a digital rouble.” “The administrative regulation of prices is really a very, very extreme measure.” “The government’s measures, if fully implemented and the whole effect is realised by the end of December, it would have the effect of a small decrease in inflation by 0.1 percentage points.” (Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya, Andrey Ostroukh, Darya Korsunskaya, Oksana Kobzeva and Anastasia Lyrchikova; Writing by Alexander Marrow, editing by Maria Kiselyova)"

6.823603273594872," How Reuters is helping customers track the race for a COVID-19 vaccine As the global race to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus enters a critical stretch, Reuters dedication to speed, accuracy and innovation has put clients ahead when it comes to delivering crucial updates on the fight against COVID-19. When news broke that the UK had become the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine and that Moderna was hot on its heels having applied for regulator permission in the US and Europe, more than a thousand broadcast channels used Reuters footage to tell the story. On the day coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 200,000 a day, Reuters went inside a Chicago hospital to tell the story behind the numbers, showing how families were keeping in touch with severely sick relatives using tablet computers and Facetime in a piece that was widely used by media outlets worldwide. Comprehensive text and video footage was bolstered by a Wider Image piece looking at how COVID-19 upended life as we know it in a matter of weeks, detailing the journey from the first cases in Wuhan to the rapid global spread through a series of striking images, showing the impact of the pandemic around the world. In addition, a series of innovative Reuters graphics allows users to track the latest news on cases and vaccines progress around the world. Data on the outbreak from 240 countries and territories, including new cases and deaths, is updated daily to track the latest trends. Reuters ‘Tracking the vaccine race’ graphic makes sense of the most important information on the race for a vaccine and offers readers a comprehensive roundup of leading candidates, new technologies to watch and all the latest developments through graphics and clear visuals. Reuters Data Visualization Developer Travis Hartman explains the process behind the new vaccine graphic: “I’d say the main challenge in getting the piece together was to refine what information was most important to surface from the massive amount out there on all the vaccines available. The project went through many iterations before it came to its final presentation and has both an “at-a-glance” summary at the top and a sortable set of cards for each vaccine at the bottom, which hopefully provides our many types of consumers with the information that they need.” Reuters Medical News Editor, Christine Soares says “The visual theme of a “Scorecard” and little individual “baseball cards” was a great solution to the editorial challenge of tracking what is perceived as a “race,” but without us appearing to pick winners and losers, or even appear to be calling them that. Rather, the idea is to define some of the important criteria to think about with regard to the vaccines and then just show in a neutral way which “boxes” a specific vaccine “checks,” as well as where it stands objectively in its progress toward reaching the market. Then readers can judge which aspects are most meaningful to them.” Get access to all the latest news on the race for a vaccine on Reuters.com and Reuters Connect.

8.791342475187513," Reuters launches two new journalism diversity initiatives, in partnership with the National Association of Black Journalists, Facebook and CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism Reuters today announced two new initiatives to increase newsroom diversity for emerging journalists and members of National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), through partnerships with Facebook and CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism. In partnership with the Facebook Journalism Project, an emerging journalist recruited by NABJ will receive a year-long fellowship with Reuters in 2021. A journalist selected by NABJ will join the Reuters Fact Check team and receive training opportunities throughout the year by NABJ and CrowdTangle, a public insights tool from Facebook to aid professional development. This comes as part of a wider Facebook initiative, in which nine journalists will have an opportunity to participate in a year-long fellowship in newsrooms of IFCN-certified fact-checking organizations in the United States. Reuters has also launched a new scholarship fund in partnership with CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, awarding a full-tuition scholarship to an NABJ member, for applicants of the 2021-2022 academic year and enrolling in Fall 2021. The admissions team will consider students with an interest in financial, business or political reporting, including experience in data analysis, investigative reporting skills or fluency in multiple languages. The NABJ recipient of the scholarship will receive a variety of training opportunities by Reuters newsroom, including mentorship by editors throughout the academic year, inclusion in Reuters learning events and a paid 10-week summer internship with Reuters. “At Reuters, we are dedicated to supporting new and aspiring journalists and helping them to develop their skills. Working with NABJ, Facebook and CUNY will help us advance our efforts to better reflect the world we cover – and ultimately help create a more diverse news industry,” said Stephen J. Adler, Editor-in-Chief, Reuters. “NABJ is proud to partner with Reuters, the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism and Facebook to help provide a gateway for the next generation of fact-checking professionals and financial, business, political and investigative journalists,” said Dorothy Tucker, NABJ President. “The training, networking, mentorship, scholarship, and internship opportunities that are being made available to NABJ students are exemplary of the kind of offerings that news organizations, higher education institutions and tech companies can provide in working together to diversify and enhance our industry.” “One of the ways we support the fact-checking ecosystem is through fellowship programs in partnership with organizations around the world,” said Keren Goldshlager, Integrity Partnerships at Facebook. “We’re excited to work with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) and fact-checking partners including Reuters to help promote diversity within the fact-checking industry.” “We are thrilled to be partnering with Reuters and NABJ in this exciting new scholarship program, as it unites us with two outstanding organizations that we have long admired,” said Dean Sarah Bartlett, of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, CUNY. Reuters new fellowship and scholarship opportunities with Facebook and Newmark School of Journalism build on its longstanding partnership with NABJ. The Reuters-NABJ fellowship program began in 2015, awarding training opportunities every year to rising reporters, recent graduates or business professionals who demonstrate a clear commitment to a career in journalism. The Reuters-NABJ scholarship program, launched in 2017, has supported multiple student journalists in journalism school programs and provided training opportunities with the Reuters newsroom.

8.802897600394807," How Maradona's 'Hand of God' quote went round the world LONDON (Reuters) - It became the most iconic sporting comment of all time but the English-speaking world very nearly did not get to hear Diego Maradona’s pithy reflection on his infamous goal in Argentina’s 2-1 defeat of England at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Reuters sports correspondent Rex Gowar was in the bowels of Azteca Stadium after the match when Maradona confessed to the most talked-about piece of cheating in soccer history. “It was my first World Cup with Reuters,” Gowar, who first encountered a teenaged Maradona in Buenos Aires as a photographer for an Argentine newspaper, recalled on Wednesday after hearing the news of Maradona’s death, aged 60. “We were near the changing rooms with a group of Argentine soccer writers, it was the normal sort of melee that you had after a match of that importance.” While it was long before the days of mobile phones, social media and 24-hour rolling news coverage, the outrage was already brewing after TV replays clearly showed Maradona had used his hand to knock the ball past England keeper Peter Shilton for Argentina’s opening goal in their 2-1 win. The fact that his second goal, a few minutes later, was a work of genius was overshadowed by the raging controversy over the first. To pour petrol on the fire, Maradona then uttered the words that filled back pages around the globe. “Un poco con la cabeza de Maradona y otro poco con la mano de Dios,” (“a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God”) Maradona told the select few reporters sniffing around for the day’s killer quote. It was gold dust. “I was part of the melee that heard the quote,” Gowar, who went on to cover all four of Maradona’s World Cups and 10 in all, said. “The quote came out of us probing him. No one knows who he said it to exactly but of course as soon as I heard the quote it impressed me and it certainly impressed my desk.” The English media pack picked over the bones of another failed bid for glory by a team saddled with trying to re-create their 1966 triumph, lacing their copy with a sense of injustice at Maradona’s brazen act of deception. With no official translations, however, they were not to hear about Maradona’s admission until the Reuters wire dropped into their offices. Some, Gowar says, did not believe he actually said it, perhaps upset that they had missed the quote of the decade. While England’s soccer writers seethed, their Argentine counterparts eulogised Maradona. “They were not trying to dispute that he had used his hand,” Gowar recalls. “They knew what had happened but thought it was very cheeky of him, they were impressed that he had managed to get away with it.” Bizarrely, Gowar nearly missed the iconic moment after a slipping in his hotel bathroom on the morning of the match. “After breaking my fall with my right elbow, which still carries the scar, I improvised a bandage and headed for the Azteca stadium,” his account of the day read. “Did we Argentines believe then that England would be just another hurdle easily overcome on the way to what was to be their second World Cup title? It is easy to think that now, but Maradona had a trick up his sleeve just in case.” Sat high in the media tribune, Gowar described the moment that was to become part of sporting legend. “My colleagues from Reuters were shocked when Maradona, pretending to have headed the opening goal, ran off celebrating. The referee, pointing to the centre spot, was surrounded by England players demanding a hand ball decision,” he said. “The press tribune high in the third tier of the giant stadium and a long way from the goal where he scored immediately buzzed, hardly believing the referee had missed the trick.” Few journalists can boast Gowar’s insight into the remarkable career of Maradona. He got an exclusive interview with a 19-year-old Maradona in April 1980, weeks before he mesmerised England at Wembley on a European tour by then world champions Argentina, and he was in the United States 14 years later when Maradona’s dream of winning a second World Cup was shattered by a positive doping test. “It shattered our dream too,” Gowar said.

0.8518213822413618," IOC's Bach says Tokyo bid payments to former Dentsu executive did not break rules TOKYO (Reuters) - International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach said on Monday no IOC rules were infringed by payments in 2013 and 2014 totalling more than $8 million from the Tokyo Olympic bid committee to an executive of the Tokyo organising committee. Reuters revealed in March that Haruyuki Takahashi, a former executive of advertising agency Dentsu Inc, was paid the money by Tokyo’s bid panel for undisclosed activities. “With regard to Mr. Takahashi, we received confirmation that there was no infringement on the IOC rules,” said Bach, who is visiting Japan to inspect preparations for the Olympics, delayed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.. Takahashi had told Reuters his work included lobbying IOC members such as Lamine Diack, the ex-Olympics powerbroker, to whom he gave gifts such as digital cameras and a Seiko watch. Takahashi said he was paid through his company, Commons Inc, for “wining and dining” people who could further Tokyo’s bid, and for marketing and other activities related to Tokyo’s Olympic campaign. Takahashi now sits on the board of the organising committee of the Games. In its reporting, Reuters cited banking records provided by Japan to French prosecutors as part of their investigation into whether Tokyo’s bid committee paid $2.3 million through a Singapore consultant to win Diack’s support for Japan to host the 2020 Games. Responding to queries about the Tokyo bid committee’s past payments to the Jigoro Kano Memorial International Sport Institute, the head of the institute, Yoshiro Mori, who is also the president of the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, said he was not directly involved in its finances. “It’s true that I am the president of that organisation, but I wasn’t directly involved in the handling of the finances,” said Mori, who was seated next to Bach at a news conference in the Japanese capital. He added that he did not know about the roughly $1.3 million the institute received from the bid and could not comment. Bach said the matter was an “internal affair” of the organising committee. Reuters had reported that the non-profit had only one staffer, who said the institute used the money to hire consultants to support Tokyo’s campaign. The institute’s website does not list any activities explicitly linked to the bid. The staffer said she did not know why the institute, and not the bid, hired the consultants."
-1.689979199213144," Exclusive: TikTok-owner ByteDance to rake in $27 billion ad revenue by year-end: sources HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - TikTok-owner ByteDance is on track to generate at least 180 billion yuan ($27.2 billion) in advertising revenue in China this year, which will cement its no. 2 spot in China’s digital ad market, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The company’s overall revenue goal for 2020 is around $30 billion, Reuters previously reported, so the latest figures mean it is performing in line with its plan. While TikTok is what ByteDance is best known for globally, the app contributes little to the Chinese company’s revenue overall. It relies on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, for nearly 60% of ad revenue, followed by news aggregator Jinri Toutiao for 20% and long-form video platform Xigua for under 3%, according to one of the sources. ByteDance declined to comment. The group is one of only a few Chinese companies with global reach, but it is currently battling plans to force it to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations because of Washington’s national security concerns over the data of more than 100 million U.S. users. ByteDance overtook Baidu to become China’s second largest digital ad player in the first half of 2019 with 23% ($7.6 billion) of the total digital ad spend in the country, according to consultancy R3, with Alibaba Group in first place, raking in $10.9 billion or 33%. The gap between ByteDance and Alibaba has narrowed this year, according to the second source. Although ByteDance did not disclose ad revenue for 2019, Reuters has reported it generated total revenue of $16 billion last year. As ByteDance pursues its global ambitions, it is also looking to step up investment in three main areas at home next year - e-commerce, search and longer-form videos, the source said. It plans to invest around 10 billion yuan, including the value of traffic and advertising support to partners, on Xigua next year, its longer form video app, with the aim of increasing the number of daily active users to over 100 million, the first source said. Douyin’s e-commerce platform, one of the fastest-growing sectors within the company, is projected to hit around 150 billion yuan in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year, according to both sources, who declined to be named as the information had not been made public. The final numbers will be adjusted at the end of the year to take account of key campaigns around events such as year-end sales, which haven’t been officially launched yet, the people said. Douyin held its first major shopping festival on Wednesday, in tandem with Alibaba’s mega shopping event Singles’ Day. Douyin’s rival Kuaishou, which filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering last week, reported total revenue and ecommerce GMV for the first half of this year of 25.3 billion yuan and 109.6 billion yuan respectively. In the search arena, ByteDance launched Toutiao Search for the Chinese market last August to take on China’s search engine Baidu. It has since hired experts including former Baidu executives to improve its platform’s architecture and range of search results. ByteDance is in talks with investors to raise around $2 billion in a new financing round that will value it at $180 billion after the investment, more than double its valuation in the last fundraising round two years ago, Reuters has reported. It is also exploring whether to pursue a standalone public listing for Douyin or list some of its Chinese operations including Douyin and Toutiao as a package in Hong Kong or Shanghai.

0.28076026832068635," Coronavirus surge throws oil recovery into reverse: Kemp (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) LONDON (Reuters) - Oil futures prices have started to signal OPEC+ may have to do more to offset a second wave of coronavirus and a renewed economic slowdown. Between mid-September and mid-October, Brent’s six-month calendar spread had been tightening, a signal traders expected production to run below consumption and inventories to fall. Over the last ten days, however, the spread has gone into reverse, implying traders are less confident about an inventory draw down over the next six months (tmsnrt.rs/3mSwcnP). This has coincided with a second wave of coronavirus across most of North America and Europe and further business closures and travel restrictions in several major economies. Libya’s oil production, which had been badly disrupted by the country’s civil war, has also started to increase, which is adding extra barrels to the market and pressuring the spread. So far, the spread reversal is only a relatively weak signal that the market rebalancing process is being blown off course. But the spread has been an accurate indicator of changes in the production-consumption balance since the start of the year, clearly identifying turning points, especially when smoothed to reduce day-to-day volatility. Most traders already anticipate OPEC+ will postpone the output increase scheduled for January in response to a slower-than-expected resumption in international aviation and oil consumption. OPEC+ officials have done little to dispel the increasingly widespread assumption they will postpone the increase by at least three months until the start of April. But the spread’s renewed weakness indicates that might not be enough, and it has coincided with an uptick in official chatter that OPEC+ might actually reduce output further. Deeper cuts would strain the group’s political unity; some members have been pushing to be allowed to raise their production (“OPEC and Russia study deeper oil cuts - two sources”, Reuters, Nov. 3). Rolling over existing production levels for three months remains a simpler course. Nonetheless, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate, the implied hit to consumption will keep the option of deeper cuts on the table.

3.1195204680835613," Thomson Reuters revenue rise, cash flow outlook lift shares (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TOTRI.N said third quarter revenue rose on gains in its legal and corporates divisions and cost cuts helped lift its 2020 free cash flow outlook, prompting a near 4% rise in its shares on Tuesday. The news and information company said the results gave it “increasing confidence” for its full-year financial forecast, although the course of the COVID-19 pandemic could change this. Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, said in a statement that its revenue rose 2% to $1.44 billion in the third quarter, while its operating profit rose 21% to $318 million. “I’m very pleased to report our markets and businesses continue to prove resilient in the face of a challenging broader macro-environment,” Chief Executive Steve Hasker said. The company said its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 42% in the third quarter as a result of higher revenue and a pandemic-related cost cutting program. Executives said during an analyst call that Thomson Reuters had surpassed its cost cutting target by about $30 million to reach a total of about $130 million, and that the company planned to reinvest in its core businesses during the fourth quarter. Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a research note that it was a “solid quarter” for Thomson Reuters, that demonstrated the “resilience of its subscription based model”. Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood said in an interview that Thomson Reuters was still evaluating acquisition targets and could announce a deal this year or early in 2021. The company has about $700 million to spend as part of a $2 billion budget to fund expansion in its legal, tax and accounting businesses. Thomson Reuters’ adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share were ahead of the 38 cents analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, while the company’s quarterly revenue was also slightly above Wall Street expectations. The Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals and Corporates divisions all had higher organic quarterly sales and adjusted profit. Thomson Reuters said its results were boosted by strong sales from Practical Law, Westlaw Edge and its European and Canadian businesses and a revenue increase from the tax division after a U.S. tax filing deadline extension from April to July. Organic revenues at the Reuters News division slipped 2%, reflecting a decline in the agency business and the ongoing impact of the coronavirus crisis on its events business. Thomson Reuters reaffirmed its full-year guidance of revenue rising by 1% to 2% and raised its free cash flow forecast to about $1.1 billion, at the higher end of the previous outlook. The company also confirmed that London Stock Exchange's LSE.L purchase of the Refinitiv data and analytics business is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, when it also expects to incur a tax bill of about $600 million. Thomson Reuters executives said that the company could fund the payment through free cash flow, its cash on hand of $1.2 billion or by drawing on credit facilities. The sale of Thomson Reuters’ 45% Refinitiv stake will result in it holding 15% of the LSE, estimated to be worth some $9 billion, which it plans to sell within five years and use the proceeds to reinvest in its main businesses."

5.24716340924176," Reuters in the news Here’s a look at where Reuters journalists and journalism were in the news this week: For a piece in Neiman Reports, Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler wrote about building trust in journalism: “With the U.S. election less than a week away, every major news organization is honing its coverage plan. Collectively, we’re fully aware that we must avoid premature “calls” that don’t reflect the complexities of early voting, potential voter suppression, and multiple legal challenges. But there’s so much more to getting election coverage right — and to generating trust at a time of profound distrust in so much of the media. As a global news organization with a nearly 170-year history of speed and accuracy, Reuters has a clear view of how to do this. Our Trust Principles, embedded in our charter and overseen by an independent board, hold us to “integrity, independence and freedom from bias.” From this standard, we’ve adopted practices that we work hard to maintain, even as many in the industry have taken sides during the Trump years, with polarization challenging the news business as it has swept the country.” Adler and Reuters Global Managing Editor Reg Chua spoke with Press Gazette about how Reuters is covering the 2020 U.S. elections, exploring everything from safety, trust to disinformation and how journalists will be positioned across the country on November 3. “One of the things that’s going to make this interesting from a staffing perspective is ordinarily, you have an election – the people covering it are working night and day, they’re exhausted… And then basically, when the election is over – while you still have some people covering transition – people take a vacation essentially before gearing up for the inauguration,” Adler told Press Gazette. “It’s very likely that can’t happen [this year], so we’re actually planning different times of shifts and a way to extend the intensity if necessary for a couple of months afterwards. So that’s different.” Reuters released part 2 and part 3 of its investigation into the hidden crisis inside U.S. jails this week. The second installment in the series explored how jails with healthcare overseen by private companies incur higher death rates on average than those with care handled by government agencies. The third showed that, in an effort to contain the coronavirus disease, jails across America held 11% fewer inmates and that the unprecedented mass release could be seen as an opportunity to unwind the United States’ signature practice of mass incarceration. One of the reporters on the series, Jason Szep, also gave readers an inside look at how the investigation started. The latest installments of the investigation were featured in The Washington Post, The Crime Report, Westlaw newsletter, Gannett, Sirius XM radio and more. Nigeria Bureau Chief Alexis Akwagyiram and Senior Correspondent Libby George spoke on Vox’s Today Explained, Times Radio and more, about the ongoing protests over police brutality unfolding across Nigeria. On Vox, Akwagyiram explained, “The protests were sparked by the killing of a man in the southern state of Nigeria called Delta State. A video went viral of a man who had allegedly been killed by SARS officers…This was the latest example of the human rights abuses. Off the back of that people started using the hashtag #EndSARS to share their own experiences.” The UN wrote a story exploring the perspectives of journalists on the ground covering the coronavirus pandemic. The piece features Reuters Chief Photographer for the Benelux, Yves Herman, who covered the pandemic daily for several months, reporting from hospitals, retirement homes, funeral services and morgues all while wearing full protective gear. Herman explained: “Despite the risks, I felt it was a really important subject to cover. To my knowledge, it is one of the only stories in the world, except perhaps the Second World War, which affects absolutely everyone.” With 2,500 journalists in 200 locations, Reuters covers the real world in real time.

2.580921457799524," Reuters honored for excellence in visual storytelling for Hong Kong protest, COVID-19 and plastic graphics Reuters last week received four journalism award recognitions for its interactive graphics, from the Online News Association (ONA) and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA). Reuters won an Online Journalism Award—presented by ONA and which celebrates the best in digital journalism around the world—for Excellence and Innovation in Visual Storytelling for a series graphics on the Hong Kong protests. The series was also named a finalist in the Explanatory Reporting category. Reuters also had one winner and one finalist in the Asian Digital Media Awards, presented by WAN-IFRA. Drowning in Plastic won the top prize for Best Data Visualization, while a series of explanatory infographics on COVID-19 was named a finalist for Best Special Project for COVID-19. Asia Graphics Editor Simon Scarr explains what went into creating the award-winning graphics on the protests and how instrumental graphics can be when it comes to delivering the full picture of a story: “When large-scale demonstrations plunged Hong Kong into political crisis in June 2019, the size of the crowds became a contentious issue. Police gave relatively low numbers and protest organisers offered sharply higher estimates. The competing claims were being watched as a proxy for the degree of public support for the protesters and their demands. The Reuters Graphics team deployed to Hong Kong in order to cover the July 1 rally, one of the summer’s defining mass protests. From this one short trip, the team gathered enough information to produce a series of powerful visual stories. The primary aim was to conduct an independent crowd-counting analysis for the march. The team deployed to elevated positions along the route and spent hours collecting data. The complicated and time-consuming process paid off with a powerful independent analysis, “How many protesters marched on July 1?” While monitoring the rally, footage from Reuters cameras also helped the team document human chains passing equipment to those fighting against police and the evolving hand signals protesters used to communicate amidst the chaos. The result was another in-depth explanation titled “Coordinating chaos.” A separate camera filmed the entire march from start to finish, allowing the team to combine the crowd count data with an annotated time lapse of the rally. “Mass movement” was an immersive experience that brought the reader as close to the rally as possible without setting foot in Hong Kong. A few months later, the protests became increasingly violent. Reuters set out to quantify and depict the escalating force of the police response and explain the events unfolding. A huge data collection exercise formed the backbone of a special report titled “Weapons of mass control, tactics of mass resistance”. As protesters and police continued to clash on the front lines, Reuters discovered another battle was quietly raging. Some innovative data reporting revealed that edit wars were playing out over the city’s depiction online on the crowd-sourced internet encyclopaedia, Wikipedia. The piece, “Wiki wars: Hong Kong’s online frontline,” visually presented those findings. The projects drew on innovative reporting techniques, data, visuals, and strong presentation to connect the dots for readers and to illustrate the evolving nature of the protest movement.” For the latest from Reuters Graphics, click here.

2.2330793614420057," White House drops plan to bail out oil refiners denied biofuel waivers: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House has dropped a plan to provide funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to oil refiners that are denied exemptions from the nation’s biofuel regulations, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The Trump administration was considering doling out at least $300 million in cash to the facilities, potentially from the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, triggering an outcry from Midwest lawmakers who argued the money should be used for farmers, not the oil industry, Reuters previously reported. The oil refining industry had also expressed opposition to the plan, saying the administration should instead reform the nation’s biofuel policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that refiners blend biofuels into their fuel mix or buy credits from those that do. The RFS has helped farmers by creating a huge market for corn-based ethanol, but refiners say the regulation costs them a fortune. Under the RFS, small refiners that can prove compliance would cause financial harm can apply for exemptions. The Trump administration is considering exemption requests covering the 2019 compliance year, and is under pressure to reject them because of a court ruling earlier this year that cast doubt over the legitimacy of the waiver program. The Trump administration had previously ramped up the number of exemptions given to refiners each year, angering biofuel producers and farmers who say the waivers dent demand for their products."

4.694048236221754," How Reuters is using drones to go where journalists can’t, capturing unique and compelling visuals for customers When a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate exploded at the port city of Beirut in early August, it was Reuters use of drones that made it possible to show the true extent of the devastation caused by the blast. Following up with the impact on survivors, Reuters used drones to tell the story of one victim haunted by the blast. Drones are one of the newest tools being used in newsgathering and have enabled access to unique perspectives and angles otherwise impossible to capture. As the leading global news agency for visual content, Reuters has been at the forefront of drone use in newsgathering, delivering customers compelling video and pictures to tell stories in unprecedented ways. When Hurricane Laura tore through the Caribbean and made landfall in the U.S., Reuters drone video provided unmatched coverage of the early stages of the storm for clients as millions of people braced for impact. After fires destroyed Greece’s largest migrant camp on the island of Lesbos, leaving nearly 13,000 people without shelter, Reuters had professional, broadcast-quality drone footage to offer clients that others struggled to match.

6.21061567092873," Reuters fast and first with key news across commerce, politics and technology Here’s a look at where Reuters was first in delivering essential news across commerce, politics and technology this week. -Reuters was first to report the Trump administration was considering whether to add Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) to the Commerce Department’s blacklist, a move that would effectively halt the shipments of U.S. goods to the company and severely harm its future prospects. Shares of China’s top chipmaker fell 23% in Hong Kong stock trading after the news, while shares of the Chinese firms' Asian and European rivals rose. Shares of SMIC’s U.S. equipment suppliers, including Lam Research and KLA Corp, fell 7-8%. -Reuters was first to report the exact contents of the British government’s proposed Brexit legislation. The bill, if approved, would give ministers the power to ignore parts of the Withdrawal Agreement's Northern Ireland protocol by modifying the form of export declarations and other exit procedures. The head of the European Union Commission said she was very concerned by the news that Britain would breach the Withdrawal Agreement and international law. News that London explicitly acknowledged “inconsistency” with international law in the draft legislation sent sterling down more than half a cent against the U.S. dollar in 30 minutes to $1.2885, its lowest level since July 28. -Reuters was first to report that Microsoft Corp alerted one of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms that it had been targeted by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to three people briefed on the matter. The hacking attempts targeted staff at Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats, over the past two months, but failed to gain access.

2.9685596064335016," Thomson Reuters cuts sales outlook, narrowly misses earnings estimates NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters TRI.TO cut its full-year sales outlook due to disruption to the global economy from the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday as it reported higher quarterly sales and earnings which fell slightly short of Wall Street estimates. The company, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, said it was targeting a $100 million cost reduction program to address the changed business environment and noted it has no debt due until 2023. It said it has enough liquidity for the next 12 months and does not expect to change its dividend payout. The news and information provider, which owns Reuters News, reported a 2% rise in first quarter revenue to $1.52 billion, helped by gains in its legal and corporates businesses, and said operating profit rose 6% to $290 million. Adjusted earnings of 48 cents a share were 1 cent below Wall Street expectations, according to Refinitiv. Thomson Reuters TRI.N U.S.-listed shares were flat in early trading, while its Toronto-listed shares were down 0.9%. The stock had dropped by about a third between late February and late March, but has since recovered most of those losses. Thomson Reuters forecast total revenue growth of 1%-2% this year, below its February estimate of 4.5%-5.5%, saying its business of selling information and software electronically and by subscription was not immune to the global economic downturn. “These were impressively stable results,” said Matt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones, who cited Thomson Reuters’ recurring revenues as a source of strength. “Its ability to weather the downturn is very high. Thomson provides mission critical information that businesses need. They’re still looking at growth for this year,” Arnold said, adding that it was “very hard to find” companies which were growing in the current tough business climate. “We don’t plan any layoffs at this point in time,” Steve Hasker, who succeeded Jim Smith as chief executive of Thomson Reuters in February, said in an interview with Reuters. “We are focused on investing in our business.” Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood, said Thomson Reuters would continue to seek opportunities as part of a $2 billion acquisitions budget. But the company does not expect to buy back shares in the near term, he told analysts on a conference call. Executives said they would evaluate potential targets that may come up at the end of this year or early in 2021, adding that it was too early to predict when world markets may recover. The company has spent $1.3 billion through the beginning of the year and Hasker, who was formerly president of Nielsen NLSN.N, said any purchases would be considered ""bolt-ons"" to existing businesses and not in new sectors. The coronavirus pandemic has brought major economies to a halt, pushed millions into unemployment as businesses shutter, and emptied trading floors around the world as companies scrambled to slow its spread among their workers. Thomson Reuters executives said that they aimed to cut discretionary expenses, while nearly all the company’s own 24,000 employees have been working remotely during the outbreak. Reuters News revenues were flat at $155 million, while organic revenues fell 4% due to COVID-19 related cancellations of events in the Reuters Events business, the company said. Thomson Reuters also said it expects the sale of data company Refinitiv to close in the second half of 2020. London Stock Exchange LSE.L said last month it was committed to completing its $27 billion takeover of Refinitiv, in which Thomson Reuters has a 45% stake, with no plans to revise savings targets as recession looms."

2.9685596064335016," Alaska newspaper wins public service Pulitzer Prize; Reuters wins for photography (Reuters) - The Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica won the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism on Monday for revealing one-third of Alaska’s villages had no police protection, while the photography staff of Reuters won the breaking news photography award for documenting last year’s violent protests in Hong Kong. The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky, took home the breaking news honor for its coverage of hundreds of last-minute pardons issued by former Governor Matt Bevin. The prize for investigative reporting went to the New York Times’ Brian Rosenthal, who uncovered how thousands of New York City’s taxi drivers had their lives ruined by predatory lending. The Pulitzer Prize for Reuters, a unit of Thomson Reuters, was the newsroom’s eighth since 2008, and fifth in the last three years. For its coverage of the protests, which grew out of concern that China was intent on curtailing Hong Kong’s freedoms, Reuters’ staff was also a finalist for the international reporting award, which was won by The New York Times. The Pulitzer Prizes, the most prestigious awards in American journalism, have been handed out since 1917, when newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer established them in his will. Monday’s announcement had been postponed for two weeks because some journalists on the 18-member Pulitzer board are busy covering the coronavirus pandemic. In normal years, the prizes are announced at Columbia University in New York. On Monday, Dana Canedy, who administers the Pulitzers, delivered the news from her living room via video, after weeks in which board members hashed out the finalists and winners remotely. “Ironically, the very first time the Prizes were presented was June 1917 — less than a year before the 1918 outbreak of the Spanish Flu pandemic,” Canedy said. “During this season of unprecedented uncertainty, one thing we know for sure is that journalism never stops.” The Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica series found rampant sexual abuse in rural villages that are largely populated by indigenous people, where law enforcement was effectively nonexistent. The public service award is generally seen as the most coveted of the 15 journalism categories. The Pulitzers are also awarded in seven book, drama and music categories. ‘DEEPLY MEMORABLE’ Many of the winning Reuters photographs depicted the violent clashes between Hong Kong protesters and authorities, including images taken in the midst of skirmishes with tear gas, rubber bullets and hurled bricks. “Our photographers brilliantly captured the magnitude of the protests in Hong Kong,” Stephen J. Adler, Reuters editor-in-chief, said in a statement. “Their images were beautiful, haunting, illuminating and deeply memorable.” The Seattle Times shared the national reporting prize for its series exposing design flaws in Boeing Co’s 737 Max passenger jet that led to two fatal crashes, as well as a contributing lack of government oversight. ProPublica also won in the category for an investigation into the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet following several deadly accidents at sea. For the first time, the board gave out an “audio reporting” prize, which went to the public radio show This American Life as well as reporters for the Los Angeles Times and Vice News for an episode examining the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy that has stranded tens of thousands of asylum seekers on the southern side of the U.S.-Mexico border. The Washington Post won the explanatory journalism award for a series documenting the many places that have already warmed by 2 degrees Celsius because of climate change, hitting a threshold that experts warn could be catastrophic if reached globally. The New York Times, which had won a record 127 Pulitzer prizes and citations before this year, received three more on Monday, including the commentary prize for Nikole Hannah-Jones’s personal essay launching the newspaper’s sweeping 1619 Project, which “seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America’s story,” in the words of the Pulitzer board. The board also issued a special citation to Ida B. Wells, the African American investigative journalist and civil rights activist. Wells, who was born into slavery in Mississippi in 1862, traveled the Deep South chronicling the use of lynching to oppress black Americans. The journalism prizes often go to venerable institutions such as the Times or the Post, but they are also won by local publications whose work does not always gain national attention. Jeffery Gerritt, editor at the small newspaper Palestine Herald-Press in Palestine, Texas, won the editorial writing prize for columns detailing how pre-trial inmates died in jail without adequate health care. Among the awards for letters, music and drama, Colson Whitehead won the fiction prize for the novel “The Nickel Boys,” chronicling the horrors of an abusive reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida. He won the same award for his previous book, “The Underground Railroad.” The music award went to “The Central Park Five,” an opera by Anthony Davis about the five African American and Latino teenagers who were wrongly convicted in the 1989-90 New York “Central Park jogger” rape case.

-20.339266684104107," Reuters partners with Facebook Journalism Project to help newsrooms around the world spot deepfakes and manipulated media Reuters, the world’s largest multimedia news provider, announced today the launch of an e-learning course to help newsrooms around the world spot deepfakes and manipulated media, produced in partnership with the Facebook Journalism Project. ‘Identifying and Tackling Manipulated Media,’ available today here , aims to help newsrooms fully equip themselves to identify and reject manipulated video, pictures and audio to help fight the spread of misinformation. The ‘Identifying and Tackling Manipulated Media’ course encompasses real world examples, hypothetical cases and insights into the evolving technology used to create and detect manipulated media. The course aims to combat these risks by teaching journalists about the various types of altered media including the growing threat of the ‘deepfake’ and the ways in which newsrooms can be better equipped to handle this type of misinformation in order to move forward with confidence to verify and publish genuine content from third-party sources. It is now available in English, French, Spanish and Arabic, with more languages to launch in 2020. The spread of inaccurate and misleading information is a significant and growing global problem. It is a major challenge for journalists and a source of alarm for governments, institutions and individuals all over the world, as it has had an increasing impact on elections. Some of the most powerful and effective forms of misinformation are video and images, as they are highly shared on social media and can be understood by all. Staged events, recycled video, deceptive editing, tampering and the recent rise of AI-driven ‘deepfakes’ videos all pose a fundamental threat to an informed democracy. This type of misinformation has become a major challenge for journalists who strive to determine facts surrounding complex and often emotionally-charged topics. Reuters has been at the forefront of addressing this growing threat, with a specialist team of editors dedicated to authentication of user generated content. The team frequently encounters media that has been taken out of context, mislabeled, edited, staged or manipulated with CGI, and has been leading the charge in raising awareness and educating journalists around the world. Audiences, too, are aware of the growing risk: a recent Reuters Institute study found more than half (55%) of people around the world are concerned about their ability to separate what is real and fake on the internet. News organizations can play an important role in allaying their audiences’ concerns by being able to identify manipulated or misleading media themselves. “Organizations around the world are increasingly alarmed by the spread and impact of misinformation on society. It’s become a major challenge for media organizations as they’re bombarded with user-generated and other third-party content,” said Jess April, Director Strategic Partnerships & Program Management, Reuters. “It’s a threat we at Reuters encounter every day, and this new course puts that expertise into practice to educate journalists and newsroom about identifying manipulated media to help stop the spread of misinformation. Providing trusted news and intelligence to the world is at the heart of what we do and sharing our knowledge of this growing threat is critical to that mission.” “We need to work across industries to better identify and address manipulated media. Partnering with Reuters to launch this free e-learning course is an important step to help journalists spot this type of content so we can stop the spread of misinformation online,” said Julia Bain, Facebook Integrity Partnerships.

3.2324391929079668," Column: Hedge funds were divided on oil, until Trump tweeted LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers were deeply divided over the future direction for oil prices, until the United States announced fresh tariffs on China and sent prices plunging late last week. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts by 20 million barrels over the seven days ending on July 30. But hedge fund buying came when trade talks between the United States and China appeared to be back on track and before the announcement on Aug. 1 of new tariffs (tmsnrt.rs/2Yv8PJu). Fund managers were net buyers of Brent (+20 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+7 million) and European gasoil (+6 million) but sellers of NYMEX and ICE WTI (-11 million) and U.S. gasoline (-2 million). Before the tariff announcement, there were indications of a deep split between those portfolio managers bullish about oil because of supply disruptions and OPEC cuts and those bearish because of the economy. Funds added 37 million barrels of bullish long positions, as well as 17 million barrels of bearish shorts, in the week ending July 30, according to exchange and regulatory records. Bullish longs rose to 844 million barrels, up from a recent low of just 744 million in the middle of June. But bearish shorts also climbed to 241 million, the highest level since February. Before the tariff announcement, the market was more evenly split between hedge fund bulls and bears than at any time since the middle of June. But the announcement bombed into this delicate balance, severely disrupting traders’ assumptions, sending Brent tumbling by more than 7% on Aug. 1, the largest one-decline for more than three and a half years. From a positioning perspective, the oil market still looks close to balance, with a roughly equal chance of short covering or long liquidation moving prices higher or lower. From a fundamental perspective, however, the economic outlook has clearly deteriorated, with U.S. interest rate traders marking up the probability of recession sharply.

-0.36235946990522," Thomson Reuters raises outlook, grows fastest since financial crisis LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp raised its sales and earnings outlook for 2019 and 2020 on Thursday after reporting 4% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, which it said was its best since 2008. The news and information provider also confirmed that, along with Blackstone, it had agreed to sell Refinitiv, which provides data and news to financial customers, to the London Stock Exchange in a $27-billion all-share deal. Growth in the second quarter was driven by recurring revenues at all three of its biggest units - Legal, Corporates and Tax & Accounting - since the news and information provider sold a majority in its Financial and Risk business, now known as Refinitiv, to Blackstone last year. Adjusted earnings of 29 cents per share beat the average analyst estimate of 18 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares in the company, which hit an all-time high last week, rose as much as 2.2 percent in morning trading. The stock has risen 88 percent since last May, helped by a $10-billion share buyback and new product launches. “Thomson Reuters is making nice progress in repositioning the business after the sale of Refinitiv,” said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. “It’s showed up in the quarter through nice organic growth and profitability improvement.” In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Jim Smith said the launch of legal research product Westlaw Edge last year had been a key driver behind 4 percent organic growth at the company’s legal division, its biggest business. “It’s been a very, very solid performer for us and continues to gain a lot of traction,” he said. The strong performance enabled the company to lift its guidance for 2019 and 2020 revenue growth and earnings to the upper end of its previous forecasts. It now expects organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% this year, compared with 3% to 3.5% previously, and 4% to 4.5% next year, versus 3.5% to 4.5% before. The company anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion this year, compared with $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion previously. It expects an EBITDA margin of 31% next year having previously forecast 30% to 31%. Thomson Reuters will hold a 15-percent stake in the London Stock Exchange on completion of the Refinitiv deal, which is expected in the second half of 2020, the companies said. A Thomson Reuters representative will also sit on the LSE board. Under the agreement, Thomson Reuters cannot sell its LSE stake for two years following completion of the deal. It can sell a third of its shares in each of the third and fourth years after completion, and the rest thereafter. Smith told Reuters the company will decide whether to sell its shares as the lock-up expires. “Over the course of time, we would likely see that investment shifted behind our core businesses,” he said. Smith said the deal would “create a great deal of value” for Thomson Reuters shareholders. Thomson Reuters set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from last year’s Blackstone deal for acquisitions. The company has made three acquisitions so far and has about half of the funds left for more deals, Smith said in an interview. “We’re considering a number of further options but one can never predict the timing of M&A,” Smith said."
-0.36235946990522," Breakingviews - Thomson Reuters beats Blackstone in Refinitiv deal HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - When Blackstone bought a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ financial data business last year, it found two ways to minimise its risk. First, it used debt financing so that its consortium of investors only needed to put up a small amount of equity – just under one-third of the total $20 billion price. It also added an insurance policy of sorts that would reduce its downside if things didn’t go well. If the London Stock Exchange’s takeover of Refinitiv goes ahead, that bet will pay off – but not in Blackstone’s favour. LSE boss David Schwimmer is offering Refinitiv shareholders 37% of the company he wants to create. Based on the exchange operator’s market value on Friday, when talks with Refinitiv were disclosed, that stake was worth $14 billion. The subsequent jump in LSE shares lifted it to $17.5 billion by Thursday. The use of debt to finance the original Refinitiv buyout magnifies the gains for the investors, which include Breakingviews parent Thomson Reuters. Last year they put in a total of just $6.5 billion in equity and equity-like securities. If the deal closes next year as planned, Blackstone and its co-investors, Singapore’s GIC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, will have done very well for not quite two years’ work. So will Thomson Reuters, which owns 45% of Refinitiv. But the gains aren’t spread equally. Blackstone supplemented its equity in Refinitiv with warrants and preferred shares. If the buyout fared poorly, these instruments would increase the private equity group’s share of Refinitiv at Thomson Reuters’ expense. However, if the deal performed well, Thomson Reuters’ share would rise instead. The upshot is that if the LSE deal goes ahead, Thomson Reuters comes out on top. Blackstone’s side will emerge with just under 22% of an enlarged company worth a total of $47 billion, based on Breakingviews calculations using the LSE’s share price on Thursday morning. The firm led by Stephen Schwarzman would have grown its $4 billion investment by a factor of 2.5 times. But Thomson Reuters will exchange its initial $2.5 billion holding for a 15% stake in the LSE worth $7.3 billion – almost triple what it put in. That’s not money in the bank. Both Blackstone and Thomson Reuters won’t be able to sell any LSE shares until at least 2022, under the terms of what both sides call a “relationship agreement”. Some shares will be handed to Refinitiv executives as an incentive to stick around. And by proposing the deal, the LSE may have sent out a beacon to those who would like to take over the UK exchange themselves. Thomson Reuters may have beaten Blackstone by a whisker – the question is whether it can collect the prize."

8.151975614352526," Thomson Reuters profit tops Wall St. forecasts, shares hit all-time high NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by demand for information it sells to legal professionals, and reaffirmed its forecast for the rest of this year and 2020. Its Canadian-listed stock rose 1.9% to C$83.76 after earlier hitting an all-time high of $C84.45. The shares are up more than 60% over the past 12 months. The news and information provider and parent of Reuters News reported earnings excluding special items of 36 cents per share, compared with 28 cents per share a year ago, helped by lower interest expenses and by stock repurchases. That beat the average analyst estimate of 25 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. First-quarter revenue rose 8 percent to $1.49 billion, slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $1.5 billion. For 2019, the company repeated its forecast for revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% before the effect of currency, and growth of about half that pace in 2020. Currency exchange rates slightly reduced sales across the company’s operations but excluding that effect, each of the company’s units reported higher revenue. The largest business, Legal Professionals, reported a 3-percent rise in sales in constant currency to $594 million and a 19-percent jump in adjusted earnings. Law firms account for the bulk of the segment’s customer base. “What’s driving our business is the ever-increasing regulatory environment that our clients have to deal with and needs for efficiencies and tools to help our professional customers do their job,” Chief Executive Jim Smith said in an interview. Last year, Thomson Reuters sold a 55-percent stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit, which provides data and news primarily to financial customers, to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP. The F&R unit is now a standalone business called Refinitiv. Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, has said it set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from the Blackstone deal for purchases to help expand its Legal, Tax & Accounting and Corporates businesses. Asked for an update on that acquisitions strategy, Smith said: “We are still hunting. We are actively exploring the market.” Reuters News revenue more than doubled to $155 million in the latest quarter, due to a 30-year agreement for Reuters to supply news and editorial content to Refinitiv, which began in the fourth quarter of 2018. Thomson Reuters in November appointed Michael Friedenberg as president of Reuters News. The senior leadership team just reviewed Friedenberg’s strategy and will share it with the board in June, Smith said on Wednesday."

13.797704201234792," Sony stock surges after Reuters reports Third Point re-building stake TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp shares surged more than 9 percent on Tuesday after a Reuters report saying Third Point LLC was again raising its stake in the Japanese conglomerate stoked speculation that fund owner Daniel Loeb was preparing to agitate for more change. Third Point, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle targeting $500 million to $1 billion in capital to buy Sony shares, people familiar with the matter said. A Sony spokesman declined to comment on the report. Sony shares rallied 9.3 percent to a one-month high in Tokyo trade, recovering from a slump last month triggered by concern that its turnaround of recent years had lost momentum. The electronics and entertainment conglomerate had a market value of 6.7 trillion yen ($60 billion) at Tokyo’s Tuesday close. The move would be Third Point’s second campaign for change at Sony in six years, coming as investors look for the company’s next profit pillar amid signs its gaming business is slowing and as its PlayStation 4 console nears the end of its lifecycle. Third Point wants Sony to explore options for some of its business units, including its movie studio, which the fund believes has attracted takeover interest, the sources said. Sony Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida sees movies, music and other intellectual property as central to stable revenue growth, having battled years of losses in consumer goods such as television sets that are more susceptible to price competition. “I don’t think a sale of the pictures business is an option for Sony now because entertainment content is becoming crucial for the company,” Ace Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said, pointing out synergies seen in the success of action game Marvel’s Spider-Man and the related movie series. “The profit margin at Sony’s pictures business is thinner than rivals, but that’s a result of past management decisions, including the sale of rights to Spider-Man merchandise.” The business is on track to recover from a series of short-term measures that cost the company long-term profit, Yasuda said. Sony forecasts its pictures segment to report 50 billion yen in operating profit for the year ended March, less than a tenth of the estimated 870 billion yen profit for the entire company. Sony has recently downsized or exited several television channels within the pictures segment to cut costs, while scoring blockbuster hits such as ‘Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle’ and ‘Venom’. Third Point last exited a stake in Sony in 2014 with a roughly 20 percent gain on its investment after spending a year and a half pushing for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, a call rejected by Yoshida’s predecessor, Kazuo Hirai."

9.937624316902847," Thomson Reuters eyes 'substantive' purchases after Blackstone deal TORONTO (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TOTRI.N is looking to make ""substantive"" acquisitions to boost its legal and tax units after selling a majority stake in its financial terminal business, Chief Executive Jim Smith said on Tuesday. Smith’s comments, following better-than-expected third-quarter profit announced earlier in the day, sent Thomson Reuters shares up 4.5 percent to an 18-year high. The news and information provider has set aside $2 billion for deals, Smith told Reuters in an interview, after raising $17 billion from selling 55 percent of its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N. “We are interested in bigger, more substantive deals,” Smith said. “I wouldn’t expect a string of small, bolt-on acquisitions. We’d rather spend that $2 billion on a handful of deals rather than spread across a couple of dozen.” Thomson Reuters could spend more than $2 billion if it found the right purchase, Smith told analysts on a conference call after reporting quarterly earnings. “If an absolute home-run deal presented itself, we would certainly consider it,” he said. The company had previously indicated that it wanted to use the funds to bolster its Legal and Tax & Accounting businesses, which are its two biggest units after the F&R deal. Last month, it agreed to buy Integration Point, a trade management software business, for an undisclosed fee. The F&R unit now operates as a standalone business named Refinitiv. Shares in Thomson Reuters have risen 35 percent since May 11, helped by its plan to buy back $10 billion of its shares. The stock hit a high of C$62.99 in afternoon trading. Smith said the company was on track for a solid 2018 and a better performance in 2019. The company reiterated its forecast, originally given in May, for low single-digit revenue growth in 2018. On the conference call, Smith told analysts that the company’s longer-term goal was for mid-single digit growth. Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said she was encouraged by growth in the company’s core businesses but was cautious about the outlook. “We believe there is some uncertainty around Thomson Reuters’ earnings growth over the next couple of years as the company transitions to its new operating structure,” she said. The company said it now expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.3 billion for the year, having previously said it expected $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The year-ago figure was $1.6 billion. Smith said he expected underlying profit to improve next year. For the third quarter, Thomson Reuters reported a smaller-than-expected fall in profit. Earnings per share were 11 cents, adjusted for one-time items, down from 27 cents a year ago, hurt by a higher tax expense. That beat analysts’ average estimate of 3 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Overall revenue rose 3 percent, excluding the effect of fluctuating exchange rates, to $1.29 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.32 billion, on average. Excluding exchange rate effects, Legal revenue rose 4 percent, Tax & Accounting revenue rose 3 percent and revenue from Reuters News fell 4 percent. Adjusted EBITDA fell 21 percent, excluding the effect of exchange rates, to $302 million, due to the higher income tax expense from the company’s continuing operations, offsetting higher earnings from its discontinued operations."

4.919493678522429," Thomson Reuters closes deal with Blackstone TORONTO (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TOTRI.N said on Monday it had completed the sale of a majority stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N. The news and information provider agreed in January to sell a 55-percent stake in the business, which provides data and news primarily to financial customers, in a deal which values the total F&R business at about $20 billion. The transaction is Blackstone’s biggest bet since the 2008 financial crisis and pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg’s eponymous terminals are the market leader in providing traders, bankers and investors with news, data and analytics. It also gives Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, an ally as it seeks to reinvigorate a business facing challenges from a shrinking and budget-conscious customer base. Thomson Reuters retains a 45-percent stake in the F&R business, which has been renamed Refinitiv, a name derived from the 160-year-old Reuters brand with the objective of enabling “definitive action in financial markets.” The business will be led by David Craig, previously head of the F&R unit, who became CEO of Refinitiv following completion of the deal. Thomson Reuters said it received about $17 billion in gross proceeds at the closing, out of which it plans to return $10 billion to shareholders. As part of that process, the company launched a $9 billion share buyback in August. The tender offer is scheduled to close on Tuesday. From the remainder of the proceeds, the company said it would redeem $4 billion of debt, keep $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet to fund acquisitions, and use $1 billion to cover expenses related to the transaction. Following the deal, Thomson Reuters had said it expects its legal business to account for 43 percent of its revenue. Reuters News will remain a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. Under the terms of the deal, Refinitiv will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years to secure access to its news service, equating to almost $10 billion."

13.002462207127973," Verdict postponed in Reuters journalists case as pressure mounts on Myanmar YANGON (Reuters) - The verdict in Myanmar’s prosecution of two Reuters reporters accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act was postponed on Monday until Sept. 3 because the judge overseeing the case is sick, a court official said. Scores of reporters and diplomats had gathered at the Yangon court to hear the verdict on journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, the culmination of eight months of hearings in a landmark case that has come to be seen as a test of progress towards democracy in the Southeast Asian country. “We are disappointed not to have received the judge’s decision today,” Reuters said in a statement. “Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have already spent more than eight months in prison based on allegations of a crime they did not commit. We look forward to receiving the verdict next week, when we very much hope that they will be acquitted and reunited with their families.” Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be immediately reached for comment on the postponement of the verdict. The climax of the case comes amid building pressure on the administration of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi over a security crackdown in the western state of Rakhine that was sparked by militant attacks in August 2017. Later on Monday a U.N mandated fact-finding mission will release a report on the crackdown, which triggered the exodus of more than 700,000 stateless Muslim Rohingya, according to U.N. agencies. Most are now living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council will hold a briefing on Myanmar in New York. Monday’s court proceedings lasted just a few minutes, long enough for a judge standing in for Judge Ye Lwin, who has overseen the case against the Reuters journalists, to announce that a ruling would be made next week. “The judge is in poor health, so I am here to announce that the verdict is postponed to the third,” said Judge Khin Maung Maung. Defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters that the stand-in judge had said the verdict was ready but it had to be pronounced by the judge assigned to the case. Wa Lone smiled broadly and made a thumbs-up sign with his hands in cuffs as he walked into the court, with Kyaw Soe Oo just behind him. “We are not afraid or shaken. The truth is on our side. Whatever the situation is, we will not be shaken. They cannot make us weak,” Wa Lone told reporters after the brief hearing. Several journalists who came to cover the verdict wore T-shirts that read “Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo” and “Journalism is not a crime.” “LITMUS TEST” The Reuters reporters are accused of breaching the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison, by collecting documents relating to the country’s security forces. They told the court during their trial that two police officials handed them papers at a north Yangon restaurant moments before other officers arrested them last December. One police witness testified the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists to block or punish them for their reporting of a mass killing of Rohingya and other abuses involving soldiers and police in Inn Din, a village in Rakhine. The United Nations has called the military’s campaign in northern Rakhine a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. Myanmar has denied allegations of killings, rapes and arson made by refugees against its security forces, saying it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against Muslim militants. But the military acknowledged the killing of the 10 Rohingya men and boys at Inn Din after arresting the Reuters reporters. In April the military said seven soldiers had been sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor for their part in the killings. (Deletes extraneous word “the” from paragraph 4)"

11.20450599806602," Thomson Reuters to move forex derivatives to Dublin due to Brexit LONDON (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp said on Tuesday it would transfer its $300 billion-a-day foreign exchange derivatives trading business to Dublin from London ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union next year. Major electronic bond and forex trading platforms have announced plans over the past year to shift their trading businesses out of London ahead of Brexit in March 2019, with most of Thomson Reuters’ rivals opting for Amsterdam. Thomson Reuters has applied to the Irish central bank to move its foreign exchange Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) to Dublin so that it can continue to sell into the EU’s single market, the company said in a statement. It intends to transfer all “existing client relationships of the Thomson Reuters MTF and Dealing, as well as Fixed Income Callouts and Auctions, from RTSL to our new Irish legal entity ahead of the Brexit date.” Neill Penney, the company’s co-head of trading, said there were no plans to move staff from London but that some new personnel would be hired in Dublin. He said Thomson Reuters had opted for Dublin over Amsterdam because it was the most cost-effective, would “minimize disruption for clients” and because Dublin’s growing role as a center for financial technology and research would “open a number of doors” should the company want to expand. “It doesn’t matter for our customers which European city we are in ... From a technology front, the technology is remaining where it is, which is in London and New York,” he said. All spot forex trading, where its volumes top $100 billion a day, would remain in London, as would its post-trade services. Thomson Reuters runs one of the world’s largest trading platforms in the $5 trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market. Even if only the legal entity, the departure of any part of a currencies trading business will be a blow to London. Foreign exchange trading remains the crown jewel of the city’s financial services industry with volumes traded in the city far surpassing its nearest rival. Big banks and trading platforms compete on speed when trading forex and invest heavily in cutting edge technology in London. While trading platforms - or even some of the dealers themselves - head elsewhere after Brexit most of the hardware is likely to remain in London because of the high-speed sub-Atlantic cables linking it to New York. Bloomberg, MarketAxess and Nex Group have chosen Amsterdam as their EU hub for their trading units, media have reported. Bonds platform Tradeweb, in which Thomson Reuters has a stake, also announced plans to move to Amsterdam, a city that hosts many of the fast-moving algorithmic trading businesses active in FX and fixed income markets. Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News. Its forex business is part of the trading operations being bought by private equity giant Blackstone."
