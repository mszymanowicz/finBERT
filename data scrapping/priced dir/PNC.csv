The premium to be paid by the larger BBVA is currently under discussion, the source said, adding that BBVA was not considering a capital increase to fund the deal, which could be in cash or shares, as it had just agreed to sell its U.S. business to PNC Financial Services Group Inc for $11.6 billion.

35.50444842935445," Spain's BBVA exits U.S. in $11.6 billion deal with PNC MADRID/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA BBVA.MC is to sell its U.S. business to PNC Financial Services Group Inc PNC.N for $11.6 billion in cash in one of the biggest global bank deals this year, which sees yet another European lender retreat from the United States. The sale will further consolidate the U.S. banking sector and prompted speculation BBVA could use the cash to buy up a rival bank in its domestic market. This is the second-largest U.S. banking deal since the 2008 financial crisis and creates an American bank with nearly $560 billion of assets and a presence in two dozen states. The move underscores how a loosening of financial regulations and lowering of corporate taxes under President Donald Trump has emboldened regional lenders to pursue scale through dealmaking, as they compete with bigger players such as JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N. PNC and BBVA had been in talks about a deal for the last few weeks, and decided to press on after the U.S. elections because they believe the regulatory environment will not change with Democrat Joe Biden as president and the Republicans likely controlling the Senate, sources familiar with the matter said. Other European lenders such as Deutsche Bank DKBGn.DE and HSBC HSBA.L have also been downsizing their U.S. operations. For BBVA, the transaction represents an unwinding of its $9.6 billion acquisition in 2007 of Compass Bancshares Inc, which it turned into its U.S. subsidiary. BBVA decided to retreat from the U.S. market after a poor performance there weighed on its stock, the sources said. The stock was down 36% year-to-date until Friday. “It makes sense to divest in the U.S. because others could do better, we also believe we can grow in places where we could do better,” BBVA chairman Carlos Torres told analysts in a call. Investors had been growing impatient with BBVA’s efforts to tackle its U.S. problems after the Spanish lender took a $1.5 billion writedown last year in its fourth-quarter earnings, blaming low interest rates and declining growth. However, BBVA will still handle some wholesale banking from New York and maintain its brokerage business there. Shares in BBVA jumped almost 15.6% to 3.6710 euros, while shares in Spain's Sabadell SABE.MC rose 15.73% to 0.380 euros as the market bet BBVA could use part of the proceeds from the sale to buy its smaller Spanish rival, which has a market capitalization of around 1.8 billion euros. “The sale now frees up capital to reinvest in existing markets, Sabadell in Spain would bring significant synergy potential in Spain, and/or to improve shareholder remuneration (BBVA admits that it will consider share buy-backs),” Spanish broker Alantra said in a research note. In September, two sources told Reuters that Sabadell had held informal talks about a possible tie-up, including with BBVA. Torres told analysts the U.S. deal would allow BBVA to better deploy capital in its existing core market and improve its franchises, without giving names. He also said the bank would analyse M&A opportunities if they arise. Sabadell declined to comment on any M&A strategies. BBVA’s U.S. sale, expected to close in mid 2021, will increase the bank’s common equity tier one ratio, a key measure of financial strength, by 300 basis points, giving it a proforma capital ratio of 14.46%. BBVA executives told analysts the deal would also boost its capacity to increase payouts to shareholders, including a potential “sizeable” share buyback, and would have a 580 million euro ($687 million) positive impact on its net profit. PNC said it expected the deal to add about 21% to its earnings in 2022. The deal comes about six months after PNC sold its 22.4% stake in mutual fund giant BlackRock Inc BLK.N for $14.2 billion. PNC booked after-tax gains of $4.3 billion on the sale, which it will use to fund the deal with BBVA as it seeks to expand its footprint in the southwest of the United States, the sources said."

The lender sold its stake in BlackRock in May that put an end to longstanding questions about when it would sell the lucrative position. Like big U.S. banks that have reported results so far, PNC set aside $2.46 billion as loan loss provisions in the quarter, up from $180 million a year earlier. Banks have been building up their reserves to cover defaults from consumers and companies as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the U.S. economy. PNC, one of the largest local U.S. lenders by assets, said net loss from continuing operations, which excludes the one-time gain, was $744 million. The bank’s net income from discontinued operations, which includes gains from the sale, was $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common shareholders jumped to $3.59 billion, or $8.40 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $1.31 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier, the bank said on Wednesday.

11.365747044443118," BlackRock's top investor PNC Financial to sell entire stake (Reuters) - PNC Financial Services Group Inc PNC.N plans to sell its entire 22% stake in the world's largest asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the U.S. bank said on Monday, exiting one its most attractive investments after more than two decades. PNC, BlackRock’s largest shareholder, will sell its common and preferred shares in a secondary offering and BlackRock will repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, assuming the sale goes well. The Pittsburgh-based lender currently owns about 35 million shares in the asset manager, which is valued at roughly $17.3 billion, based on BlackRock’s last close on Monday, according to Reuters calculation. It also holds preferred shares. The divestment puts an end to longstanding questions about when PNC would sell its lucrative position that had over time become a burden amid tighter capital regulations. “We feel the time is now right,” PNC Chief Executive Officer William Demchak said in a statement. Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said besides the regulatory pressure, PNC may want additional liquidity to deal with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Since share prices are down 40% year-to-date, it may also be looking at acquiring another regional bank, he said. “The sale of BlackRock shares likely signals that PNC is looking to make a sizeable deal during a period of market disruption, which is consistent which their actions in the past,” Sanders said. During the 2008 financial crisis, PNC had acquired National City Corp in an opportunistic way. PNC acquired a stake in BlackRock in 1995 and spun it off after a few years while retaining a large stake. Shares of BlackRock slipped nearly 3% in after-market trading, as investors prepared for pressure from the offering, while those of PNC Financial rose 5%."

Second-quarter interest income is expected to rise in low-single digits, and fee income in mid-single digits, the bank said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. Earlier on Friday, the U.S. lender - one of the largest by assets - just about met first quarter profit estimates, as provisions for bad loans and a rise in expenses overshadowed growth in loans and higher interest income. Net income attributable to shareholders stood at $1.20 billion in the reported quarter ended March 31, up 2.7 percent from a year ago. Earnings per share came in at $2.61, in line with analysts' expectations. [reut.rs/2ZaNZvF] During the quarter, the bank set aside $189 million to cover for bad loans, more than double from a year ago. The loan loss provision was higher than anticipated largely due to growth in loans, said chief executive officer Bill Demchak. The bank’s loan portfolio grew about 5 percent to $232 billion, while net interest income rose about 5 percent to $2.48 billion, helped by higher interest rates. Lending at peer Wells Fargo, which reported its quarterly results on Friday, rose marginally, boosted by growth in commercial loans. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based PNC Financial reported a 2 percent rise in expenses, mainly due to higher spending on its online banking business as it battles online lenders, asset managers and insurers, besides the big banks, for a piece of the lending business. Lately, U.S. banks have been reaping the benefits of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which raised rates four times since the first quarter last year. However, interest rates will be little help for banks going forward.

10.642782916965846," PNC Financial profit misses as it sets aside more to cover bad loans (Reuters) - U.S. regional bank PNC Financial Services Inc's PNC.N fourth quarter profit fell below analysts' estimates on Wednesday, as it set aside more cash to cover bad loans. Shares of the bank were down 0.8 percent at $120.16 in afternoon trading. The Pittsburgh-based bank’s provisions for credit losses rose 18.4 percent to $148 million, while income from its corporate and institutional banking fell 32.2 percent. However, higher provisions for credit losses reflected loan growth, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Demchak on a post-earnings conference call. Total revenue rose nearly 2 percent to $4.34 billion as net interest income grew 5.8 percent and average loans grew 2.2 percent. U.S. banks have been reaping the benefits of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which raised rates four times in 2018. But higher interest rates have proved to be a double-edged sword for regional banks in recent times, since it reduces the ability of borrowers to take out loans. Lending at Wells Fargo WFC.N, which reported its quarterly results on Tuesday, fell, and at peer U.S. Bancorp USB.N rose just 1.4 percent. Texas-based regional bank Comerica's CMA.N total loans rose marginally. Going forward, Demchak sees “healthy loan demand as the repricing of the risk in capital markets drives business back to the banks”. Markets widely expect two more interest rate hikes in 2019, although many analysts have also said the Fed is likely to take a “wait and see” approach for rate hikes. Net income attributable to common shareholders of PNC fell to $1.28 billion, or $2.75 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.02 billion, or $4.18 per share, a year earlier.

3.3795930525136053," PNC partners with OnDeck for online small business lending (Reuters) - PNC Financial Services Group's PNC.N PNC Bank will use technology from digital lender OnDeck Capital ONDK.N to extend loans to small businesses online, the companies said on Monday. From 2019, businesses in the United States will be able to apply for lines of credit of up to $100,000 through their mobile devices or computers on PNC’s website and receive an answer within minutes, they said. PNC believes the service — which combines the bank’s credit expertise and balance sheet with OnDeck’s origination technology — will make it easier and faster for small businesses to access credit. “The goal is to take the lending experience, which normally takes multiple days to get approval, down to three or five minutes,” Lakhbir Lamba, head of retail lending at PNC Bank said in an interview. New York-based OnDeck is one of the most established companies that lends to businesses through its website and then sells loans to financial institutions such as banks. The partnership with PNC is its second deal with a large bank, having first partnered with JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N in 2015. The deal comes as more large banks start offering loans to businesses and consumers online, a model that was pioneered by younger companies looking to upend traditional lending. Some banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, have built their own technology to lend online, while others, such has Banco Santander SAN.MC, have opted to partner with financial technology companies. “This provides further weight to the trend in the industry of banks and fintechs partnering,” OnDeck’s CEO Noah Breslow, said in an interview. Last week OnDeck set up a subsidiary called ODX to provide technology and other services to banks looking to lend to small businesses online. It said it has several other large banks in the pipeline as potential partners."
-2.6517257000724213," PNC expects small rise in quarterly loan growth, shares fall (Reuters) - U.S. regional bank PNC Financial Services Group Inc on Friday reported disappointing quarterly loan growth and said it expected only a small improvement in lending for the final three months of the year, sending its shares down 5 percent. The company’s performance comes against the backdrop of heightened expectations for business borrowings as companies take advantage of lower taxes to boost investments. However, PNC’s loan growth rose a meager 2 percent in the third quarter, slower than the 4 percent increase it generated in the second quarter. The bank’s loan growth was also well below JPMorgan Chase & Co’s 6 percent rise and Citigroup’s 4 percent. “Investors want to see the benefits of tax reform and a strong economy materialize into loan growth at the banks. In that regard, we didn’t see that happen for PNC this quarter,” Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said. The bank said loan growth was likely to be up modestly, with increase in both its net interest income and fee income coming in low single digits. Besides competition from bigger banks, regional lenders are also battling online lenders, asset managers and insurers for a piece of the lending business, Sanders said. To counter the threat, the bank has been spending heavily to boost its online banking business, while trying to attract customers with reward schemes. That drove a 6.2 percent jump in PNC’s total non-interest expense, also pressured by higher employee wage bill. A number of brokerages had previously said they were expecting roughly no change in the company’s non-interest expenses. Net interest income rose 2 percent to $2.4 billion, helped partly by higher interest rates, which allow banks to charge more on loans. The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since the third quarter last year, bringing the short-term overnight funds rate to 2.25 percent. The bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, also rose. PNC’s net income rose 26 percent to $1.32 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share came in at $2.82, compared with the average analyst estimate of $2.72 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. The regional bank’s shares are down 9 percent this year."

That is true even though some 80 percent of PNC’s current customers report visiting branches no more than once each year, she said. “I think it is a factor of trust.” PNC’s strategy shows another way that U.S. banks are trying to navigate cost pressures and customer reliance on mobile phones as they compete for deposits. Citigroup Inc, for example, is using its mobile banking app to attract deposits nationally without opening any branches outside of the six cities where it has offices. JPMorgan Chase & Co has also been experimenting with a digital-only account called Finn, which it introduced in October in St. Louis, where it has no branches. But JPMorgan is also is opening about 60 new Chase branch offices in each of three markets it is entering: Washington, Philadelphia and Boston.

PNC Financial, one of the largest U.S. lenders by assets, said its loan portfolio grew 2.2 percent to $222.8 billion with commercial lending accounting for nearly 70 percent of total loans. Net income attributable to diluted common shares rose to $1.28 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.03 billion, a year earlier. On a per share basis, the Pittsburgh-based regional bank earned $2.72, blowing past analysts’ estimates of $2.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net interest income rose 7 percent to $2.41 billion, helped by higher interest rates, which the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised four times since the second quarter of last year. Non-interest income climbed 6 percent to $1.91 billion due to growth in asset management and consumer service revenue, which offset a decline in residential mortgages. Provision for loan losses came in at $80 million, down 18 percent from a year ago, and below the $100 million to $150 million forecast in April. Expenses rose 4 percent to $2.58 billion from $2.48 billion a year earlier due to ongoing business investments, the company said. Total revenue rose 6.5 percent to $4.32 billion from $4.06 billion a year ago. Shares of the bank were up 1.4 percent at $139.97 in premarket trading on Friday."
