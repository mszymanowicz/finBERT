3.935336905757119," Sacked GAM director says he looks forward to clearing his name ZURICH (Reuters) - A former GAM Holding AG executive, who was sacked after allegedly breaching the Swiss asset manager’s rules, said on Monday that he looked forward to clearing his name after most of the allegations against him were dropped. GAM initially suspended the executive, Tim Haywood, last July, a move that triggered an investor exodus and a sharp fall in the company’s share price. The asset manager said on Thursday that Haywood had been fired as it announced a 929 million Swiss franc ($929 million) loss in 2018. Haywood said on Friday he planned to appeal the decision. “After 15 months of investigations most of the allegations have been dropped,” he said in a statement on Monday. “The remaining allegations leveled against me do not by any stretch constitute ‘gross misconduct’, even if they weren’t substantially disputed, which they are,” he said. “I am exploring all legal options and look forward to the opportunity to clear my name and return to work.”"
5.6545725441928445," Sacked GAM Holding manager plans to appeal dismissal ZURICH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A former GAM Holding AG executive, who was sacked after allegedly breaching the Swiss asset manager’s rules, said on Friday that he planned to appeal his dismissal, saying he felt he was “unjustly singled out.” GAM had initially suspended the executive Tim Haywood last July, a move that triggered an investor exodus and a sharp fall in the company’s share price. The asset manager said on Thursday that Haywood had been fired as it announced a 929 million Swiss franc ($927.42 million) loss in 2018. Haywood, the ex-GAM manager, said: “I intend to appeal this decision which has been prejudged since the announcement of my suspension.” “I dispute many of the findings, while noting the majority of the allegations have been dropped,” Haywood said in a statement. “Meanwhile, I have been made redundant by a process which I also consider to have been run unfairly. This reinforces my belief that my dismissal from GAM was a foregone conclusion, and that I have been unjustly singled out.”"
