20.49744921015712," Corning wins U.S. funding to boost vial output for COVID-19 vaccines (Reuters) - Glass maker Corning Inc GLW.N said on Tuesday it would receive $204 million from the U.S. government to boost the manufacturing capacity of its vials that will be used to store coronavirus vaccines and treatments. Companies developing coronavirus vaccines, such as AstraZeneca AZN.L and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up the production of a vaccine. Billions of vials will be needed for vaccines of the new coronavirus, with world leaders looking towards treatments as a way to re-open stalled economies. Corning's funding comes a day after the U.S. government awarded $143 million to privately-held SiO2 Materials Science to boost the production of its vials and syringes. (bwnews.pr/37eauUA) Corning said it will provide priority access of its vials to companies that have tied up with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for developing treatments and vaccines. The funding from BARDA will go towards scaling up production of the company’s ‘Valor Glass’, which is designed to minimize contamination and could potentially speed up manufacturing processes. The company signed a long-term agreement in May with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, for the glass vials. Pfizer said they would be used for some existing sterile injectable drugs and a range of new products."

42.64935757531806," Pfizer ties up with glass maker Corning for vial supply (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc has signed a long-term agreement with glass maker Corning Inc to procure vials for storing drugs, the companies said on Thursday. Pfizer said the glass vials will be used for some of its existing sterile injectable medicines and that they were also being assessed for storing a range of new products. The company did not provide details of these new products. Pfizer, like rivals Merck & Co and AstraZeneca, is racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, which does not yet have an approved vaccine or treatment. With vaccines being seen by world leaders as a way to restart stalled economies, drugmakers are looking to scale up their production to meet surging global demand. Some companies such as AstraZeneca have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines that are expected to need billions of vials. It would be essential to fill a vial with five to 10 doses of the vaccines to cope with the requirement of huge volumes of vaccines and the relative shortage of vials, Johnson & Johnson’s Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said on Thursday. Johnson & Johnson also has a potential COVID-19 vaccine under development which it plans to test in humans by September."

1.6857138826913154," Apple awards iPhone supplier Corning $250 million from U.S. manufacturing fund (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday said it would award Corning Inc $250 million from a $5 billion fund dedicated to U.S. advanced manufacturing. Corning supplies glass to Apple for products such as the iPhone and Apple Watch. Since the first iPhones hit the market in 2007, the glass on every iPhone sold has been produced at Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky, plant. Apple and Corning did not disclose the terms of the deal. In the past, Apple has made long-term supply agreements here with its vendors in which it provides upfront cash to lock in supplies of parts and better prices. The supplier, in turn, gets capital to carry out research and development or upgrade factories. With few exceptions, Apple devices are assembled in China, where the company’s supply chain has become increasingly concentrated over the past five years. The clustering has put Apple at the center of the trade war between the United States and China. Tariffs on many Apple products such as AirPods wireless headphones took effect on Sept. 1, with most analysts expecting Apple to absorb the cost of the levies if required to pay them. Apple has not disclosed any financial impacts specifically related to tariffs. In the meantime, Apple has spent the past several years emphasizing its supplier base in the United States. Apple announced its fund for U.S. suppliers in 2017, setting aside $1 billion and boosting the figure to $5 billion a year later. The company said it spent $60 billion with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers in 2018. Counting $200 million in 2017, Corning has now received $450 million from Apple’s fund. Apple said in a statement that its spending with Corning supports 1,000 jobs at Corning, including about 400 manufacturing jobs at the plant in Kentucky. “This award underscores Apple and Corning’s shared belief in the vital role that ingenuity plays in creating industry-leading products, and the pride that both companies take in applying American innovation and advanced manufacturing to solve some of the world’s toughest technology challenges,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a statement. Apple has now awarded $1 billion from the fund. Other awards were $390 million to chipmaker Finisar Corp, which makes chips for Apple’s facial recognition technology in Texas, and $10 million for a joint venture between Alcoa Corp and Rio Tinto’s aluminum business to develop a carbon-free aluminum smelting process."

0.606034447731342," Smartphone screen maker Corning beats revenue, profit estimates (Reuters) - Apple supplier Corning Inc bucked the trend for shaky phone and chipmaker results on Tuesday, beating expectations for both revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, helped by demand from telecom companies looking to upgrade their networks to 5G. Shares of the company, which makes screen glasses and optical fiber products, rose 5.4 percent to $32.00 before the opening bell. Telecom companies across the world have been ramping up their efforts to build high-speed next-generation 5G network, driving up demand for optical fiber. Net sales from Corning’s optical communications division surged 26 percent to $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter, as the company secured more contracts from companies upgrading their networks. The division is on track to surpass its 2020 sales goal of $5 billion, Corning said. Corning’s net sales from its specialty materials unit, which makes Gorilla Glass used in smartphones, tablets and notebook PCs, rose just 2 percent to $399 million after several quarters of rapid growth. Smartphone makers Apple and Samsung have warned investors about weakening demand from China, with several mobile component suppliers following their suit. Corning reported net income of $292 million, or 32 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.41 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose to $3.04 billion from $2.64 billion.

2.119267723150872," Silicon Valley executive settles SEC insider trading charges (Reuters) - A former senior executive at a Silicon Valley company now owned by Corning Inc agreed to pay $415,468, including a fine, to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges of “serial” insider trading, the regulator said on Tuesday. Yao Li, a former vice president of technology at Sunnyvale, California-based Alliance Fiber Optic Products Inc (AFOP), was accused of reaping illegal gains after learning from colleagues that the company would likely report disappointing revenue for three different quarters in 2014 and 2015. The SEC said Li, 59, of Newark, California, used the inside information to sell AFOP stock he owned and sell borrowed shares short, betting on a decline, despite a company policy banning short sales. Without admitting wrongdoing, Li agreed to pay a $196,203 fine, give up $196,203 of illegal gains and pay $23,062 of interest. He also accepted a five-year ban on being an officer or director of a public company. Li’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Corning, which is based in Corning, New York, said Li’s actions “in no way” related to its June 2016 takeover of AFOP, which valued that company at about $305 million. The SEC said its case stemmed from its market abuse unit’s analysis and detection center, which tried to spot suspicious trading patterns such as “improbably successful trading” prior to earnings announcements over time. On June 13, AFOP’s founder and former chief executive, Peter Chang, was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to insider trading ahead of the Corning takeover and two of the revenue shortfalls."

12.35377506700086," Corning sees smartphone glass sales decline seeping into current quarter (Reuters) - Corning Inc GLW.N on Tuesday reported a drop in sales at its screen glass unit for the first time in at least four quarters, and said it expects the weakness to spill into the current quarter, adding to growing market jitters about demand for high-end smartphones. Shares of the specialty glass maker, whose Gorilla glass became the screen of choice for many smartphones including Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone and Samsung's 005930.KS Galaxy, were down about 3 percent in morning trade. “Soft Apple and a broader slowdown in front of new smartphones launched in Asia caused the weakness in specialty material (the unit that makes Gorilla Glass),” Oppenheimer & Co analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said. At least two other Apple suppliers - contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW and chipmaker AMS AMS.S - have pointed to soft demand from smartphone customers in the past week. Analysts have attributed the softness to weaker-than-anticipated demand for the California company's iPhone X. Global sales of smartphones to end users was nearly 408 million units in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 5.6 percent year-over-year decline for the first time ever, Gartner Research said in February. Corning said net sales in its specialty materials business fell 7 percent to $278 million in the first quarter, missing analysts’ estimates of $293 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company expects a similar year-over-year decline in the unit in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer R. Tony Tripeny said in a post-earnings conference call. However, he said the company’s long-term goal is to double sales in mobile consumer electronics despite a matured smartphone market. Sales in its LCD business, which makes glasses used in televisions and PCs, also declined 5 percent to $745 million, below Wall Street estimates of $747.5 million. The only bright spot was demand for optical fiber cables as telecom companies invest in upgrading their networks ahead of the rollout of 5G. The industry will spend $225 billion on 5G between 2019 and 2025, according to a research note published by Morgan Stanley in October. (mgstn.ly/2vLY07U) Net sales from Corning’s optical communications business, which makes fiber optic cables and connectors and contributes nearly one-third to its total sales, rose 8 percent to $886 million. On an adjusted basis, Corning earned 31 cents per share on revenue of $2.51 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 30 cents and adjusted revenue of $2.49 billion."
