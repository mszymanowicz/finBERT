14.558292310627744," UnitedHealth gets FTC approval for DaVita unit purchase (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc won anti-trust approval to buy DaVita Inc’s primary and urgent care unit for $4.3 billion, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. The deal is part of an effort by health insurers to cut costs by playing a more direct role in medical services, including shifting patients to cheaper, more accessible locations for routine or non life-threatening emergency medical services. The FTC approved the deal on condition that it sell a Las Vegas facility to Utah-based to Intermountain Healthcare. The deal was announced in December 2017 as $4.9 billion but was reduced last December to $4.3 billion. DaVita will be rolled into UnitedHealth’s Optum unit, which has some 30,000 physicians. Denver-based DaVita operates medical groups in six states that serve 1.7 million patients through about 300 clinics. Optum said on Wednesday it had completed the transaction.DaVita’s kidney dialysis unit is not included in the deal. The FTC was split on the proposed transaction, with the three Republicans voting to approve it. The two Democrats, Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, said that they would have pressed for stronger action in Colorado, even if it meant going to court. Separately, Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, said that it won an agreement from the companies to take steps to address those concerns through a price freeze in one case and similar measures."

-30.132361829654762," DaVita unit to pay $270 million to resolve Medicare payments probe (Reuters) - A medical care unit of DaVita Inc DVA.N has agreed to pay $270 million to resolve claims it provided inaccurate information about patients that caused Medicare Advantage plans operated by private insurers to obtain inflated payments from the government. The civil settlement with HealthCare Partners Holdings, which Denver-based DaVita acquired in 2012 and is in the process of selling to UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N, was announced on Monday by the U.S. Justice Department. HealthCare Partners did not admit wrongdoing. DaVita in a statement said the $270 million will be paid for out of escrow funds that it required HealthCare Partners’ former owners to set aside when DaVita acquired it in 2012. According to court papers, HealthCare Partners, a California-based independent physician association, contracted with insurers to provide medical services to Medicare Advantage patients. More than one-third of Medicare recipients receive benefits through Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers, who the government pays a predetermined monthly sum for each person they cover based on individual diagnostic traits. Under this part of Medicare, the healthcare program for the elderly, the government makes so-called “risk adjustment” payments based on data it receives regarding the health status of a patient covered by a Medicare Advantage plan. The case stemmed from a broader investigation into data that insurers who operate Medicare Advantage plans submit to receive “risk adjustment” payments. The probe has already led to the U.S. Justice Department suing UnitedHealth in a similar case. The Justice Departments said HealthCare Partners instituted practices that led insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans to submit incorrect information about patients’ diagnoses and obtain inflated payments, which the company shared in. HealthCare Partners also scoured patients’ records for diagnoses its medical providers failed to record which it then submitted to the insurers for use in obtaining increased Medicare payments, the Justice Department said. Those allegations stemmed from a whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2009 against various insurers and, later, HealthCare Partners by James Swoben, a former employee of an insurer that did business with DaVita, the Justice Department said. His lawsuit, pending in federal court in Los Angeles, was filed under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government’s behalf to recover funds paid out based on fraudulent claims. The government may intervene in such cases. For his role in bringing the case, Swoben will receive nearly $10.2 million, the Justice Department said. The case is U.S. ex rel. Swoben v. Secure Horizons, et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 09-5013."

2.1097576020026376," U.S. jury orders DaVita to pay $383.5 million in wrongful death lawsuits (Reuters) - A federal jury in Colorado has awarded $383.5 million to the families of three patients who said they suffered cardiac arrests and died soon after receiving dialysis treatments at clinics run by DaVita Inc. The jury in Denver decided on Wednesday that DaVita was negligent and concealed facts from the patients regarding GranuFlo, a product that lawyers for the families claimed the company knew could cause toxic pH imbalances. Jurors awarded the families of deceased patients Irma Menchaca, Gary Saldana and Deborah Hardin compensatory damages of $2 million, $1.5 million and $5 million, respectively, and $125 million to each family in punitive damages. Denver-based DaVita said late Wednesday it disagreed with the “unjust” verdict and plans to appeal. “Our first priority is the safety of our patients,” DaVita said. “Our clinical outcomes - among the best in the industry - demonstrate our commitment to providing the highest level of care.” The wrongful death lawsuits were filed after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012 issued a recall of GranuFlo, a product made by Fresenius Medical Care that helps remove waste products and maintain proper pH balance in a patient’s blood. Excess acetate contained in GranuFlo could lead to metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which blood pH level is too high and is associated with an increased risk of stroke or heart attack, lawyers for the families said. The families contended DaVita failed to inspect and review the composition of GranuFlo. “DaVita ignored many red flags that preceded the loss of life of these three patients and many others,” Rob Carey, a lawyer for the families, said in a statement. The case is White et al v. DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado, No. 15-cv-02106."
