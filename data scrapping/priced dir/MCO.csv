Moody's said here it was reviewing SoftBank for a further downgrade as the tech conglomerate moves to sell down core parts of its portfolio to offset the weak performance of its tech bets. That decision is based on “excessively pessimistic assumptions” and “will cause substantial misunderstanding among investors” and “result in significant confusion for issuers”, SoftBank said in a statement. “We decided to request Moody’s to withdraw its corporate and foreign currency bond ratings.” SoftBank said this week it would raise as much as $41 billion through asset sales to fund its biggest ever stock buyback, after investors sold shares due to concern over high leverage and souring bets on unproven startups via the $100 billion Vision Fund. SoftBank’s shares have rallied 55% since the buyback announcement, which will see the group retire almost half its shares. But its ability to engineer the sale of part of a portfolio that includes Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba is under scrutiny as the coronavirus outbreak rattles markets. “Asset sales will be challenging in the current financial market downturn, with valuations falling and a flight to quality,” Moody’s analyst Motoki Yanase said. SoftBank has declined to identify the assets that will be sold down or monetized, with likely candidates including stakes in Alibaba and domestic wireless carrier SoftBank Corp. It plans to make the transactions over the next four quarters Last week S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook for SoftBank to negative but stopped short of a ratings downgrade. After the asset sale announcement, S&P said Softbank “has the potential to ease the downward pressure on its credit quality.”"

5.64762970611924," Moody's, Israel's Team8 to create cyber risk standard for businesses TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's Corp MCO.N and Israeli cyber group Team8 launched on Thursday a joint venture to assess how vulnerable businesses are to cyber attacks and create what they hope will become a global benchmark. Cyber attacks are in focus after a virus from Ukraine spread around the globe in 2017, crippling thousands of computers, disrupting ports from Los Angeles to Mumbai and even halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia. Similar to the way that banks can check their stability with a stress-test, Moody’s and Team8 are developing a framework to measure companies’ defenses and preparedness for such attacks in comparison to other businesses and over time. The service will be a tool for companies engaging in mergers and acquisitions or when purchasing cyber insurance policies, said Derek Vadala, chief executive of the joint venture who most recently served as head of Moody’s cyber risk group. The venture did not disclose financial details. “Companies doing business with each other are spending more and more resources on understanding what is the risk associated with doing business with third parties and fourth parties,” Team8 CEO Nadav Zafrir told Reuters on the sidelines of a Tel Aviv University cyber conference. “We believe that not only is that already slowing down the economy, but that we are going to see this slant continuing to deteriorate,” Zafrir, an ex-commander of Israel’s elite 8200 military intelligence unit, added. The cyber health of companies has in the past had an impact on credit ratings as well. In March, Standard & Poor's downgraded Atlanta-based credit bureau Equifax EFX.N reflecting the possible fallout from a 2017 data breach. Moody's in May revised its outlook of Equifax citing the breach. Moody’s said the new cyber rating product was not related to its credit ratings service. The new company will be based in New York and in Israel and will initially have a dozen employees, but is expected to grow to hundreds in coming years. A creator of cyber defense startups, Team8 is backed financially by Moody's and other major companies like Microsoft MSFT.O, Airbus AIR.PA and Qualcomm QCOM.O. Companies are well aware of growing cyber threats, and total spending on information security products and services is expected to reach $124 billion in 2019, according to a report from advisory company Gartner which estimated spending surpassing $114 billion in 2018. A coordinated global cyber attack, spread through malicious email, could cause economic damages of between $85 billion and $193 billion, one hypothetical scenario developed as a stress test for risk management showed. In this scenario, claims paid by the insurance sector are estimated at $10 billion-$27 billion, the report produced by insurance market Lloyd’s of London and Aon said. Vadala said the company was building its model and expected to have beta customers in a year. The idea is to engage thousands of companies so the index becomes the global standard, he said."
-10.923993488623342," HK Court of Final Appeal upholds regulator's action against Moody's HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody’s has failed in its final attempt to overturn action taken against it by Hong Kong’s securities regulator for a 2011 report alleging corporate governance failings at a number of Chinese companies. On Monday, Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal dismissed an appeal by Moody’s Investors Service Hong Kong Limited in relation to the Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) disciplinary action concerning a “special comment” report Moody’s published in 2011, the SFC said in a statement. The case has been watched closely by the financial industry and corporate governance activists as it could redefine the limits on what can be written in reports on public companies and potentially curtail the activities of Hong Kong re search firms. Credit ratings agencies have been directly regulated by the SFC since June 2011. In July 2011 Moody’s published a report that raised concerns about corporate governance at 49 Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. Following an inquiry into the report, the SFC fined and reprimanded Moody’s in November 2014, but Moody’s appealed against the action to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal, which did not uphold all aspects of the SFC’s claims against Moody’s, and slashed the fine. Moody's later appealed to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal and then the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. [tinyurl.com/y7bh7e2h] [tinyurl.com/ybrvd6ul] The SFC’s statement on Monday said that the Court of Final Appeal would issue its reasons later. “Moody’s is disappointed that the Court of Final Appeal has dismissed its appeal regarding the scope of the SFC’s jurisdiction but we recognize its importance for market clarity,” Moody’s said in a statement."
-9.693870085772085," Moody's to pay $16.25 mln to settle SEC charges WASHINGTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Tuesday that it charged Moody’s Investor Service with failing to clearly define and consistently apply credit-rating symbols in a first-ever ratings-related enforcement action by the regulator. Moody’s did not admit or deny the SEC charges but did agree to pay $16.25 million to both settle charges and review its rating symbol policies and controls, the regulator said in a statement.
