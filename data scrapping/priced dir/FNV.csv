1.102380700617988," BHP-backed SolGold agrees funding of up to $150 mln from Franco-Nevada LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - BHP-backed SolGold Plc, the copper-gold company focused on Ecuador, has agreed a financing package of up to $150 million with streaming company Franco-Nevada Corp to develop its Alpala project, sending its shares up by around 10%. Toronto-listed Franco-Nevada, which provides miners and oil and gas producers with upfront cash in exchange for future production, will receive a perpetual 1% net smelter return (NSR) interest from SolGold. An initial funding of $100 million could be increased to $150 million, which would also increase the NSR for Franco Nevada, the company said in a release. SolGold will spend the coming months developing a feasibility study of the Alpala project that is expected to start production of copper and gold in 2025, Ingo Hofmaier, SolGold’s executive general manger – Project & Corporate Finance - told Reuters by phone. The company, which earlier this year strengthened its takeover defence by adding U.S. investment bank Citi to its advisors, is in talks with investors and banks to secure an overall $2.7 billion needed to complete the project, Hofmaier said. BHP , the world’s biggest miner, owns 15.31% of the Brisbane-based miner, while Australian gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd owns 15.23% of it, Refinitiv data shows. SolGold’s share price at 0940 GMT was up 9% 26.90 pence, after reaching 30.25 earlier. It outperformed the wider sector, which fell around 1%. (Reporting by Clara Denina; editing by Barbara Lewis)"
25.411814952722594," Franco-Nevada sees 25% hit to energy revenue on falling oil TORONTO, March 10 (Reuters) - Franco-Nevada Corp, which provides miners and oil and gas producers upfront cash in exchange for future production, expects to see a 25% hit to revenue from its energy business this year as the global downdraft in crude prices takes a toll on output and drilling activity, a company executive said on Tuesday. Toronto-listed Franco-Nevada said it expects revenue from its energy assets of $80 million to $95 million this year, down from $115.9 million last year. The 2020 forecast assumes a U.S. oil price of $45 per barrel. Oil prices had their biggest one-day rout since the 1991 Gulf War on Monday after Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled they would hike output. (Reporting by Jeff Lewis; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"
-9.267684112918161," Continental Resources inks deal with mineral royalty manager HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shale oil producer Continental Resources Inc said on Monday that it formed a subsidiary to manage mineral royalties with Franco-Nevada Corp, part of Continental’s plan to diversify revenue sources. Mineral rights are often less-risky investments than drilling wells, which can carry large operational, labor and environmental concerns. Continental, controlled by billionaire wildcatter Harold Hamm, will as part of the deal receive $220 million from Franco-Nevada, which manages gold and commodity royalties around the globe. The companies will fund the subsidiary with $125 million each year for the next three years to buy mineral rights in the SCOOP and STACK oil plays of Oklahoma, near where Continental already has operating wells. Continental will only be required to fund 20 percent of that amount but will be entitled to between 25 percent to 50 percent of the subsidiary’s revenue, according to a press release. With mineral rights, investors typically agree to pay for a cost of a well’s development in exchange for a percentage of future revenues. By forming the subsidiary with Franco-Nevada, Continental is effectively gaining access to a less-risky revenue stream. The company will also have access to data from wells in which the subsidiary invests, a key source of market information. Continental plans to use proceeds from the subsidiary to cull its $6.16 billion debt load. The company is slated to post quarterly results on Tuesday. “We are pleased to announce yet another growth vehicle to Continental within our core business,” Hamm said in the press release. Shares of Oklahoma City-based Continental rose slightly in Monday trading to close at $62.75."
