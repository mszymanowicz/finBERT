12.097598911036306," Australian regulator raises antitrust doubts over Aon's $30-billion Willis Towers bid (Reuters) - Australia’s competition regulator on Thursday raised initial concerns over Aon’s $30 billion bid for Willis Towers Watson to create the world’s largest insurance broker, close on the heels of a similar move by EU antitrust regulators. The merger could significantly hurt competition in commercial risk, reinsurance and employee benefits broking and advisory services in Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. The pandemic has triggered a sharp rise in claims for insurers and hit their investment portfolios, which along with falling valuations have sparked several deals in the insurance industry. Aon bid for Willis in March last year in an all-stock deal, which was the insurance sector’s largest ever. Representatives of Aon and Willis declined to comment on the matter. The regulator said the deal may lead to price increases or reduced service levels for large or high-value commercial insurance customers and may also limit the insurance coverage and pricing smaller brokers could get for their customers. It was particularly concerned about the effects of the merger on reinsurance broking services, which it deemed vital for the Australian economy. Australian insurers have been hit by claims from natural disasters such as wildfires and hailstorms and have bumped up their reinsurance covers in recent times to help shield the impact of these unforeseen large-scale payouts. The European Commission had raised similar concerns about the deal in December, but suspended its investigation in February as it waited for the U.S. insurance broker to provide data required for the case.

13.373637933914726," EU antitrust regulators halt Aon, Willis probe, await data BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have suspended their investigation into Aon’s $30 billion bid for Willis Towers Watson while they wait for the U.S. insurance broker to provide data required for the case. The European Commission, which kicked off its probe in December because of concerns the deal to create the world’s largest insurance broker may hurt competition in major markets, said it stopped the clock on Monday. “This procedure in merger investigations is activated if the parties fail to provide, in a timely fashion, an important piece of information that the Commission has requested from them,” a spokeswoman for the EU competition enforcer said. “Once the missing information is supplied by the parties, the clock is re-started and the deadline for the Commission’s decision is then adjusted accordingly,” she said. Aon declined to comment. The previous deadline for the EU decision on the deal was May 10. The EU investigation was launched after Aon declined to provide concessions during the Commission’s preliminary review. The merged company would leapfrog current global leader Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc."
10.242627670706616," Natural catastrophes cause above-average $100 billion in insurance losses in 2020: Aon LONDON (Reuters) - Natural catastrophes resulted in $97 billion in insured losses in 2020, 40% above the average for this century, in a year when insurers also faced hefty bills due to the coronavirus pandemic, insurance broker Aon said in a report on Monday. Hurricane Laura, which hit the United States and Caribbean in August, caused a $10 billion insured loss, the largest global insured loss event of 2020, Aon said. Economic losses from natural disasters - insured and uninsured combined - totalled $268 billion, with seasonal floods in China between June and September causing the greatest loss event at $35 billion. Seasonal floods during the same period in India caused the greatest number of deaths, at 1,922, Aon said. Social distancing requirements due to the pandemic made processing claims harder, Aon said, with insurers using drones or customers’ own pictures rather than sending loss assessors to the scene of the disasters. “Focus at the corporate and federal levels will be critical around investments in risk mitigation, resilience, and sustainability as the landscape around climate change solutions continues to accelerate with renewed urgency,” said Steve Bowen, Director and Meteorologist for Aon’s Impact Forecasting team. Reinsurer Swiss Re last month pegged insured losses from natural catastrophes at $76 billion, while Munich Re estimated them at $82 billion."
7.05169154663343," Aon's $30 billion Willis Towers deal in EU antitrust crosshairs BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Aon’s $30 billion bid for Willis Towers Watson to create the world’s largest insurance broker faces a five-month long investigation after EU antitrust regulators voiced concerns that the deal may hurt competition in key markets. The merger of the world’s second and third largest brokers would overtake world No. 1 Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. The deal came just as financial markets were sliding as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has triggered a sharp rise in claims for insurers, on top of other challenges such as climate change, and hit their investment portfolios. Falling valuations and companies looking to shore up business models have in turn sparked a run of deals across the insurance industry. Aon said it was confident of securing EU approval without having to sell any assets to allay competition concerns and that it was on track to close the deal in the first half of 2021. The European Commission said the deal could significantly reduce competition in markets for commercial risk brokerage services, re-insurance brokerage and provision of retirement and health & welfare services to commercial customers. It cited brokerage services to large multi-national customers in property and casualty, financial and professional, credit and political risk, cyber and marine as well as customers in the space and aerospace manufacturing industry as the most affected. The EU investigation will also examine the provision of reinsurance brokerage services and the provision of retirement and health & welfare services. The EU competition enforcer set a May 10 date for its decision. Reuters had reported on Dec. 15 that the EU competition enforcer would open an in-depth investigation into the deal after Aon declined to offer concessions to address EU competition concerns."

5.77797482116358," Exclusive: Aon alleges fraud in arbitration over $300 million Brazilian deal: documents SAO PAULO (Reuters) - British insurance broker Aon Plc AON.N has accused the founder of Brazilian health and benefits insurance broker Admix of defrauding it when it acquired the company four years ago in a 1.35 billion reais ($300 million) deal, according to arbitration and court documents reviewed by Reuters. The sale contract with Admix founder Cesar Antunes da Silva included a clause calling for Aon to pay him up to 150 million reais two years after the deal closure if certain revenue targets were met. Another 80 million reais were placed in an escrow account as guarantee for any problem in the deal, a common practice in M&A transactions. Citing what it called “fraud and omissions” by da Silva in the sale process, Aon in 2018 did not pay the earn-out clauses or release the amount in the escrow account, according to the documents. Aon is seeking at least 200 million reais in damages via arbitration. Lawyers for da Silva said Aon was trying to use the arbitration to compensate for losses stemming from its own “mismanagement” of Admix after the acquisition, according to the documents. They said the insurer took two years to complain of omissions and are demanding that Aon pay the remaining value in the escrow account and the earn-out payments. Aon and da Silva’s lawyers declined to comment for this story, saying the arbitration was confidential. The arbitration, which began in December 2018 in Sao Paulo, is registered by the International Chamber of Commerce under the number 24146/GSS and details of its contents have not been previously reported. The dispute underlines how disappointing the deal has proven for Aon, which is aiming to become the world’s largest insurance broker. When it was announced, the then head of Aon’s health and benefits division, John Zern, said the acquisition doubled the brokerage giant’s presence in Brazil, while its head for Risk Solutions in Latin America, Fernando Pereira, said the deal would enhance Aon’s activities in Latin America. Both have left the company since the deal. At the time, Admix had 1.4 million beneficiaries across 6,700 companies of all industries and sizes and placed 2 billion reais in health and benefits premiums a year. Aon has also asked the arbitration judges to revalue Admix, alleging irregular underwriting policies, and to reimburse the price difference. The alleged underwriting irregularities happened only after the company was sold, da Silva’s lawyers say, according to the documents. Aon also alleges Admix failed to inform it about contract cancellations, including the cancellation of a high number of contracts before the deal closed by health care operator Unimed. Da Silva argued in his response in the arbitration that most of those were transferred to other insurance brokers within the same group. Aon also accused the Admix founder of failing to disclose significant labor lawsuits filed by its own employees. Aon’s arbitration lawyers also accused a former Admix insurance broker of intimidating witnesses because he sued certain of the British insurer’s employees who had made depositions within the arbitration proceedings and accused him of fraud. The broker, Nadjair Diniz Barbosa, and his lawyer declined to comment. Aon did not disclose the arbitration in its 2019 financial statements as it has done with other arbitration proceedings in New Zealand and the United States, and antitrust investigations in Europe. Aon declined to comment on why the arbitration was not disclosed in the financial statements. Aon announced on Monday a $30 billion deal to acquire rival Willis Towers Watson WLTW.O and become the world's largest insurance broker."

8.865132021100985," Aon buys Willis for $30 billion in world's largest insurance deal (Reuters) - Aon Plc AON.N said on Monday it would buy Willis Towers Watson Plc WLTW.O for nearly $30 billion, in an all-stock deal which will make it the world's biggest insurance broker and give it more pricing power, but also attract regulatory scrutiny. The acquisition, the insurance sector's largest ever, unifies the second and third largest brokers globally into a company worth almost $80 billion, overtaking market leader Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc MMC.N. It comes at a time when insurers are facing rising claims and new threats from the global outbreak of coronavirus and climate change. Aon had scrapped plans last year to pursue a merger with Willis, a day after media reports forced it to reveal it was in the early stages of considering an all-stock offer for the Irish-domiciled company. The merger agreement came right after a 12-month restriction under Irish rules for revisiting the deal expired. The timing also coincides with a violent market correction, as Wall Street’s main stock indexes plummeted and the Dow Jones Industrials crashed 2,000 points on Monday, driven by 20% slump in oil prices and the rapid spread of coronavirus. This also weighed on Aon, whose shares dropped 16% on Monday, much more than the 8% drop in Willis shares. When asked about the timing of the deal, Aon Chief Executive Officer Greg Case told Reuters: “This is the time we move,” noting that he spoke to 250 senior colleagues on Monday who were “energized” by the deal. “In a world of volatility, clients have needs around protecting assets,” Case said. Willis shareholders will receive 1.08 Aon shares for each of their shares. The offer represents a premium of 16% to Willis’ closing price on Friday. Aon shareholders will own about 63% and Willis investors about 37% of the combined company. The deal is expected to add to Aon’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full year, with full savings of $800 million achieved in the third year. Aon will keep headquarters in London and be led by Aon CEO Case and Aon CFO Christa Davies. Willis CEO John Haley will become executive chairman. Aon and Willis put together insurance contracts for clients that involve a number of insurance providers, for anything from airlines to large sporting events. Brokers also play a key deal-making role in the 330-year-old Lloyd’s of London [SOLYD.UL] commercial insurance market, which carries out much of its business face-to-face and insures specialist risks like oil rigs and soccer stars’ legs. Aon and Willis also provide investment and employee benefits advice, and broker deals for reinsurers, who share part of insurers’ exposure to potential large losses like hurricanes, in return for part of the premium. The combined entity will work across risk, retirement and health businesses. The deal will also allow the “new” Aon to offer clients services in areas like cyber, intellectual property and climate risk, executives said. Interactive graphic on insurance deals tmsnrt.rs/2IJODcx (GRAPHIC: Aon and Willis agree largest ever insurance merger - ) The deal follows Marsh’s purchase last April of British rival Jardine Lloyd Thompson for $5.7 billion. “The insurers and re-insurers are unlikely to be happy about the deal given the scale of the two players coming together,” said analyst Ben Cohen at Investec. The deal terms state Aon must pay $1 billion to Willis if the deal falls through. Aon’s Davies said she was confident of getting all the necessary approvals for the deal. “We have had great counsel on the topic of anti-trust, feel really good about it,” Case said.

2.8836323785030116," GrainCorp locks in derivative to drought-proof earnings SYDNEY (Reuters) - GrainCorp Ltd, Australia’s largest listed bulk grain handler, has signed a 10-year deal with insurance broker Aon Plc to boost its earnings during times of severe drought, after taking a profit hit from prolonged dry weather. GrainCorp’s revenues have been under pressure for the last few years after drought across Australia’s east coast cut production - limiting the bulk grain handler’s ability to earn revenues from storing the crops and exporting them. To reduce cash flow volatility, GrainCorp said on Friday it has entered into an agreement that will see it receive extra payments in times of drought, while it will have to pay out when seasonal conditions are good. GrainCorp shares rose nearly 5 percent in morning trade on expectations the agreement would kick in during the current year on forecasts for extended hot, dry weather across east coast growing areas. “The contract will smooth GrainCorp’s cash flow and allow for longer term capital allocation and business planning through the cycle,” Chief Executive Mark Palmquist said in a statement. Under the deal, GrainCorp will receive a payment of A$15 ($10.46) per tonne when grain production from Australia’s east coast winter crop falls below 15.3 million tonnes. Payments will be capped at A$80 million a year. In times of ample production when east coast grain production tops 19.3 million tonnes, GrainCorp will have to pay AON A$15 a tonne. This will be capped at A$70 million a year. The contact will be benchmarked against data from Australia’s chief commodity forecaster, GrainCorp said. The data shows east coast grain production has only fallen below 15.3 million tonnes once in the past 10 years. In contrast, winter grain production from Australia’s east coast has topped 19.3 million tonnes four times in the last decade. But with grain production suffering this season, analysts expect the contract, which will take effect from July 1, to provide an immediate shot in the arm. “It looks like a sensible deal where it cuts in and cuts out,” said Richard Barwick, analyst at CLSA. “It will kick in this year on current conditions.” Shares in GrainCorp rose nearly 5% to hit a one-month high of A$8.08 a share by 0135 GMT. Last month, the company posted a larger-than-expected half-yearly loss and also cut its dividend as severe drought withered crops. GrainCorp said the agreement will cost less than A$10 million pre-tax each year."

14.75837976901806," Insurer Aon abandons Willis Towers takeover plan, shares rise (Reuters) - Aon Plc said on Wednesday it had scrapped plans to pursue a merger with rival insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson Plc, a day after it revealed it was in early stages of considering an all-stock offer for the Irish company. Aon’s shares rose 4.4 percent in afternoon trading, recouping some of the losses incurred on Tuesday after news of the potential merger surfaced. The company did not give any reason for abandoning the deal.

Shares of Willis Towers rose as much as 8.6 percent to hit an all-time high of on Tuesday after a Bloomberg report said the companies were in preliminary talks. Aon’s shares fell nearly 8 percent. Following the report, Aon was forced to confirm that it was in early stage talks with Willis Towers due to Irish regulatory requirements. “As a result of media speculation, those regulations required Aon to make the disclosure at a very early stage in the consideration of a potential all-share business combination,” Aon said in a statement. Shares of Willis Towers were down 6.5 percent at $169.88 in afternoon trading. A deal would be hard to make sense, considering regulatory issues it would have faced, wrote Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan in a note reacting to Tuesday’s Bloomberg report. Greenspan also said “regulatory issues (including accretion and lost business) could have impacted its (Aon’s) decision not to pursue a deal at this time.”"

Insurers are increasingly divesting non-core parts of their business, putting valuable assets out on the market, a report by Willis Towers and Mergermarket showed in October. Global insurance mergers and acquisitions jumped to 37 billion euros in the first six months of 2018, the highest first-half total since the financial crisis, the October report said reut.rs/2H0vvI9. In September, U.S. financial services group Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc agreed to buy Jardine Lloyd Thompson, valuing the British insurance and reinsurance broker at about 4.3 billion pounds. The Aon-Willis merger could be the largest among insurance brokers amid volatility surrounding Britain’s impending exit from the European Union and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington threatening appetites. Earlier on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported about the potential deal. Willis Group Holdings, the world’s oldest insurance broker, merged with human resources consultancy Towers Watson & Co in 2016. The deal allowed Willis to better compete with now potential acquirer Aon and rival Marsh & McLennan Co.

12.859569694302467," Russian state reinsurer signs brokerage deal with Aon Plc subsidiary MOSCOW, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The Russian National Reinsurance Company (RNRC) has signed a one-year agreement with a local unit of London-based insurance broker Aon Plc that will allow RNRC to reinsure risks for up to 10 billion roubles ($149 million), RNRC boss Nikolay Galushin said on Tuesday. RNRC was created by Russia’s central bank in 2016 to cater to firms that have been blacklisted by Western reinsurers because of sanctions. Galushin said that the deal with the local unit of Aon Plc did not include coverage of sanctions risks. Galushin told Reuters in June that insurers who were covering the risks of dozens of industrial plants in Russia had turned to RNRC for cover after additional U.S. sanctions made it difficult to get reinsured elsewhere. Russia’s relations with the West have soured since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, the United States and other Western countries have imposed broad-ranging sanctions against Russian companies, banks and individuals."
