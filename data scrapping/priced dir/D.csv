9.635844344705507," GE alleges Siemens Energy used stolen trade secrets to rig contract bids NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co accused a Siemens Energy AG subsidiary of using stolen trade secrets to rig bids for lucrative contracts supplying gas turbines to public utilities, and cover up improper business gains totaling more than $1 billion, according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday. GE sued the rival company, Siemens Energy Inc, in a U.S. district court in Virginia, alleging the theft traces back to May 2019, when the industrial conglomerates bid to provide gas turbine equipment and servicing to Dominion Energy Inc. Dominion is a Virginia power utility that provides electricity to about 4 million customers on the east coast. The suit comes in the wake of Siemens AG spinning off its energy business to create Siemens Energy. GE alleges that Siemens Energy used trade secrets improperly received from a Dominion employee in part to win contracts that would boost the price of its separate listing that took place in September. Siemens identified the receipt of GE’s trade secrets “through its own robust compliance processes,” a spokesman said. Following an internal investigation, Siemens “implemented extensive remedial measures in response,” the spokesman added, such as “swift and appropriate discipline of the involved employees, including separation from the company.” A Dominion representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “This story is a negative for sentiment on Siemens Energy, which has recently been among the sector’s best performers,” Citi analysts said in a note. Shares in Siemens Energy were down 6.5%. In the course of GE’s bid for business with Dominion, the lawsuit alleges, a senior Dominion employee started sending to a Siemens account manager confidential business information GE had submitted. The information also included Dominion’s analysis of all bids, giving Siemens a “blueprint” to win contracts worth up to $340 million with the utility for the business, known as the Peakers Project, GE alleged. The recipient of GE’s trade secrets at Siemens passed the information to colleagues that included those preparing the Dominion bid, which they used to help win the business, the lawsuit said. The Dominion employee, no longer employed there, passed the information to the Siemens manager at least half a dozen times, in some instances forwarding it from his personal email address to that of the Siemens manager’s wife, the lawsuit said. The employee on the receiving end remains at Siemens, the lawsuit said. In a bid package, GE had provided Dominion with technical specifications for four gas turbine models, pricing for different combinations of the equipment and details on how the company would service and maintain it, the lawsuit claims. Gas turbines are combustion engines that convert natural gas to energy powering generators that supply electricity to large residential and business developments. Siemens only alerted GE to improperly receiving the trade secrets 16 months later, in September, through what GE described as a “nothing to see here, folks” letter minimizing the infraction, the lawsuit alleged. The alert came after Siemens completed its own internal investigation and Dominion finished its own inquiry, the lawsuit claims. Dominion alerted GE to the alleged malfeasance before Siemens did, the lawsuit said. GE asked a judge to halt Siemens from using the allegedly stolen material and pay damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars or more. Siemens Energy, in its listing prospectus dated Sept. 7, 2020, said it had “identified a business area that received, during a bidding process, confidential competitor and customer information, which may have negative consequences for us.” A spokesman for Siemens Energy declined to comment on the identity of the competitor. The litigation is the latest legal battle involving the corporate rivals, which have squared off in lawsuits over patent infringement as recently as last year. The alleged theft has put GE at a disadvantage competing for upcoming contracts worth at least $120 million apiece, the lawsuit claims. GE and Siemens are competing on another Dominion bid due Jan. 19, adding urgency to resolving the theft allegations, the lawsuit said. Since first improperly receiving the information in May 2019, Siemens has won eight other gas turbine bids over GE’s competing proposals valued at more than $1 billion, the lawsuit alleges. In most of those proposals, GE bid some of the same gas turbine models from the Dominion project, and in one case equipment with similar specifications, the lawsuit said. According to GE, the Siemens employee receiving the trade secrets passed them to numerous colleagues, some of whom played key roles in preparing other gas turbine bids. GE lost the Dominion bid to Siemens in July 2019 without explanation, the lawsuit alleges, and Siemens employees continued to disseminate and use GE trade secrets to tailor at least two additional gas turbine proposals. Siemens has also “steadfastly refused” to assure GE that documents containing the trade secrets have been destroyed, the lawsuit claims. The Siemens spokesman said the company has removed GE’s confidential information from all its internal systems and restricted employees who received the trade secrets from working on similar bids or proposals and reassigned employees to other parts of its business."

-12.526349978358764," Dominion Maryland Cove Point LNG export plant starts to exit outage (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc’s Cove Point liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Maryland started to exit a three-week annual maintenance outage on Monday, according to data from Refinitiv. The amount of natural gas flowing on pipelines to the plant was on track to reach 0.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Monday from around zero since it shut on Sept. 20, the data showed. One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. The timing of this outage was in line with Dominion’s 2018 and 2019 annual maintenance shutdowns. Dominion spent about $4 billion to add the LNG export terminal to Cove Point’s existing LNG import terminal. It sent out its first cargo in March 2018. Dominion agreed to sell 25% of Cove Point to a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which will operate the facility once it completes the acquisition of Dominion’s gas transmission business later this year. Dominion will retain a 50% passive interest in Cove Point. U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 10.6 bcfd in 2021 and 12.1 in 2022 from 10.0 bcfd now. By the mid-2020s, analysts say, the United States will become the biggest LNG exporter in the world, ahead of current global leaders Qatar and Australia. Cove Point is designed to liquefy about 0.75 bcfd of gas. Dominion sold the project’s capacity for 20 years to a subsidiary of GAIL (India) Ltd and to ST Cove Point, a joint venture between units of Japanese trading company Sumitomo Corp and Tokyo Gas Co Ltd. ST Cove Point has agreed to sell some of the LNG to Tokyo Gas and some will go to Kansai Electric Power Co Inc, according to Sumitomo’s Pacific Summit Energy (PSE) unit."

0.33329769046128954," Dominion takes $2.8 bln charge to exit Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday it took a $2.8 billion charge in the second quarter related to the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina. Atlantic Coast was the most expensive U.S. gas pipeline under construction when Dominion and partner Duke Energy Corp exited the $8 billion project earlier this month due to regulatory uncertainty following years of delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns. It is just one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines mired in legal and regulatory battles with local and environmental groups that have found numerous problems with U.S. permits issued by Trump administration agencies. When Dominion started work on the 600-mile (966-km) pipe in 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. In the weeks before canceling the project, however, Dominion said it could finish the project in early 2022 only if it received new federal permits soon that would survive court challenges. In addition to regulatory delays, Atlantic Coast was also hurt by a short-term hit to gas demand from the coronavirus and a longer-term hit from growing consumer interest in clean energy projects. Still, there was a need for the pipeline and that will now be left unmet, Chief Financial Officer James R. Chapman said on a post-earnings call. Virginia is one of several states seeking to achieve 100% carbon-free power over the next two decades. Even though gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and considered by many analysts to provide a bridge from dirty coal to clean renewables, it still produces carbon. Dominion has plans to invest up to $55 billion over the next 15 years on zero-carbon generation, energy storage, gas distribution replacement and renewable natural gas."
11.53591075992323," Atlantic Coast natgas pipe cancellation poses supply challenges: Dominion (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said cancellation of the $8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline in the United States would present challenges in meeting growing demand but that increased supply of clean energy should fill some of the gap. Dominion was building the pipeline to meet growing gas demand in southeast Virginia and eastern North Carolina. The project was the latest of several in the United States abandoned after long delays in the approval process and as the fall in demand caused by coronavirus makes the case for more capacity less pressing. Dominion and its partner in the project, Duke Energy Corp, said on Sunday they abandoned the 600-mile (966-km) project, which was billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. “These communities still need new infrastructure for electric and gas reliability and economic development,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said. “The cancellation ... will leave some significant challenges unaddressed.” The pipeline would have supplied enough gas for about 7.5 million U.S. homes a day. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie said the real losers from the cancellation would be power consumers in the U.S. Southeast, including units of Duke, Dominion and Southern Co that will need to find other gas supplies to fuel the region’s coal-to-gas switching efforts. Before state governments imposed coronavirus lockdowns, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast gas demand would reach record highs almost every year through 2050. EIA now projects U.S. demand will drop about 4% in 2020 and another 4% in 2021 from a record high in 2019. Dominion plans to invest up to $55 billion over the next 15 years on zero-carbon generation, energy storage, gas distribution replacement and renewable natural gas. Dominion aims to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide and methane emissions from its power generation and gas infrastructure operations by 2050."
11.53591075992323," Dominion, Duke exit pipeline project after years of delays (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc and Duke Energy Corp said on Sunday they decided to abandon the $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline project after a long delay to clear legal roadblocks almost doubled its estimated cost. Despite a favorable ruling by the United States Supreme Court in June, the two companies said it was not enough to justify the project’s economic viability given the increased legal uncertainty and anticipated delays. The court ruling, which granted the federal government authority to allow the natural gas pipeline to cross under the popular Appalachian Trail in rural Virginia, was a solution to only one of several hurdles facing the project. “This announcement reflects the increasing legal uncertainty that overhangs large-scale energy and industrial infrastructure development in the United States,” the statement added, quoting Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell and Duke CEO Lynn Good. According to Dominion and Duke, the cost for the ACP project increased to $8 billion from the original estimate of $4.5 to $5.0 billion. Last year, the Trump administration’s move to speed up major energy projects had backfired amid challenges by environmentalists and others who opposed three of the biggest U.S. pipelines, one of which was ACP. Over the years, judges had halted construction on these projects, ruling that the administration granted permits without conducting adequate studies or providing enough alternatives to protect endangered species or national forests. “VICTORY,” environmental group Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) said. “SELC is relieved to see Duke and Dominion make the right decision to walk away from it,” said Greg Buppert, a senior attorney at SELC. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club said that Duke and Dominion did not decide to cancel the project but that people and frontline organizations that led this fight for years “forced” them to walk away. Sierra Club and SELC were two of the environmental groups that sued to stop the pipeline after the U.S. Forest Service gave the green light for the project to run through the George Washington National Forest. “The well-funded, obstructionist environmental lobby has successfully killed the Atlantic Coast Pipeline,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette said in a statement. The project would have lowered energy costs for consumers in North Carolina and Virginia, he said. ACP was first announced in 2014 to tackle lack of energy supply across North Carolina and Virginia. Dominion expected to complete it in early 2022. In a separate announcement on Sunday, Richmond-based Dominion said it agreed to sell its natural gas transmission and storage network for $4 billion to Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s energy unit."
10.133281769416284," Buffett's Berkshire to buy Dominion Energy gas assets for $4 billion (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N said its energy unit will buy Dominion Energy Inc's D.N natural gas transmission and storage network for $4 billion, helping billionaire Chairman Warren Buffett reduce his conglomerate's cash pile while letting Dominion focus on utilities operations. The transaction announced on Sunday includes more than 7,700 miles (12,390 km) of natural gas transmission lines and 900 billion cubic feet of gas storage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy is buying Dominion Energy Transmission, Questar Pipeline, Carolina Gas Transmission, 50% of the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, and 25% of the Cove Point liquefied natural gas facility in Maryland. Dominion will retain 50% of Cove Point. Brookfield Asset Management Inc BAMa.TO owns 25%. The Berkshire unit will also assume $5.7 billion of debt, giving the transaction a $9.7 billion enterprise value. It expects a fourth-quarter closing, pending regulatory approvals. “We are very proud to be adding such a great portfolio of natural gas assets to our already strong energy business,” Buffett said in a statement. Dominion expects up to 90% of future operating earnings to come from utilities. The company and Duke Energy Inc DUK.N separately announced on Sunday they would abandon their $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, running under the Appalachian Trail and through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina. Dominion and Duke cited delays and uncertain costs, despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court decision last month. Berkshire controls 91.1% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which owns the MidAmerican Energy, NV Energy and PacifiCorp utilities, natural gas pipelines, wind power assets and electricity businesses in Britain and Canada. The unit accounted for 12% of Berkshire’s $23.97 billion of operating profit in 2019. Its chairman, Greg Abel, is also a Berkshire vice chairman. Berkshire ended March with $137.2 billion of cash, reflecting Buffett’s four-year inability to find major acquisitions, even as the coronavirus pandemic took hold and stock prices plunged. Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined additional comment."

-4.012042660781627," Dominion seeks more time to complete U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc asked U.S. energy regulators for two more years to complete the long-delayed $8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, which the company now expects to enter service in early 2022. “Due to unforeseen delays in permitting, additional time is required in order to complete the construction,” Dominion said in a filing late on Tuesday. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved Dominion’s request to build Atlantic Coast in October 2017, authorizing the company to complete the project by October 2020. Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects delayed in recent years by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. The company still needs to renew permits from the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that were knocked out by decisions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and a state air permit for a compressor in Virginia. Dominion said it expects to receive the necessary approvals by the end of the year. The company already received one ruling in its favor this week when the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a Fourth Circuit decision and ruled that the Forest Service has legal authority to permit the pipe to cross under the Appalachian Trail. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-km) project in December 2018 after the Fourth Circuit stayed a biological opinion from the FWS that allowed construction in areas inhabited by endangered species. Atlantic Coast is owned by units of Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
-8.409143390785873," LNG tanker from Trinidad arrives in U.S. as European stockpiles fill fast (Reuters) - The Kinisis, a ship carrying liquefied natural gas from Trinidad, arrived at Dominion Energy Inc’s Cove Point LNG plant in Maryland on Saturday as some energy firms look to send cargoes to the United States with stockpiles in Europe filling fast. Another ship, Madrid Spirit, is moving across the Atlantic Ocean from Nigeria that may also drop its cargo in the United States. Global LNG demand growth has slowed this year as coronavirus lockdowns cut energy use, causing gas prices in Europe and Asia to drop to record lows. Those price declines allowed U.S. gas futures <0#NG:> to trade at a premium over major European benchmarks <0#TRNLTTF:> <0#TRGBNBP:> for the first time in a decade in late April. With gas more expensive in the United States than Europe where stockpiles are expected to be full by the end of summer, U.S. LNG buyers canceled dozens of cargoes for June and July, and analysts said it made sense for some energy firms to send LNG to the United States for storage. The United States, which is the world’s third biggest LNG exporter behind Australia and Qatar, does not receive a lot of LNG imports, but they do occur. There were 21 LNG deliveries to the United States last year, mostly from Trinidad, while the U.S. exported more than 500 cargoes. European gas prices, however, have soared around 60% since the start of June after falling to record lows in late May, making gas in Europe more expensive than the United States again. Energy traders said they expect LNG buyers to keep canceling U.S cargoes this summer - U.S. LNG exports fell to a 13-month low in June - but not by as much as previously thought following the spike in European gas prices."
-0.2490993660231786," Dominion to keep exporting LNG from Maryland Cove Point during June maintenance (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said it plans to conduct maintenance at its Cove Point liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Maryland in June but does not expect that work to affect the export side of the facility. Dominion notified customers in a posting on its website that it would work on the plant’s “small liquefier” from June 2-15. The company said that work is unrelated to the LNG export service. The amount of pipeline gas flowing to Cove Point has held around 0.76 billion cubic feet per day - near the plant’s capacity - since the facility exited its last maintenance outage in the middle of October, according to data provider Refinitiv. Even though the plant is not expected to stop LNG exports in June as some traders and brokers said earlier in the week, analysts noted this is a good time for any LNG export plant anywhere in the world to shut. The global LNG market is oversupplied due to several factors including a sharp drop in demand from coronavirus lockdowns that have caused gas prices in Europe and Asia to plunge to record lows in recent weeks. In April, LNG buyers canceled about 20 U.S. cargoes due to be shipped in June. Analysts said they expect even more cancellations in coming months especially now that U.S. gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana are more expensive for June, July and August than the European Title Transfer Authority (TTF) benchmark in the Netherlands. So far, analysts said those cancellations were at U.S. LNG plants located on the Gulf of Mexico where most gas is priced at the Henry Hub. Gas for Cove Point, however, mostly comes from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, which is currently about 20% cheaper than the Henry Hub."
3.394826691453434," UPDATE 1-Dominion confirms $8 bln Atlantic Coast natgas pipe cost, early 2022 in service (Adds details) May 5 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc confirmed on Tuesday its previous cost and schedule estimates for the roughly $8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina that is expected to enter service in early 2022. That cost and schedule, however, depends on the company being allowed to cut trees along the pipeline’s route during the upcoming November 2020-March 2021 season, Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell told analysts after the company released its first quarter earnings. “We can maintain the existing schedule and cost estimates, so long as we can take advantage of the November 2020 through March 2021 tree filling season,” Farrell said, noting “We remain confident in the successful completion of the project.” Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects to have received federal permits in recent years but which have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. Farrell said the company expects to overcome those challenges this year. In the Appalachian Trail case, Dominion said it expects the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in its favor in coming weeks, allowing the pipe to cross the trail along its existing route. In the biological opinion case, Farrell said Dominion is working with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and expects to receive needed authorizations by the end of this quarter. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-kilometer) project in December 2018 after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stayed a FWS biological opinion. On the Nationwide Permit issue, which the Army Corps of Engineers uses to authorize waterbody crossings, Farrell said he expects the U.S. Department of Justice and industry will resolve a legal opinion that questions the legitimacy of the Army Corps’ use of the program “in a timely manner.” In a case involving TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL oil pipe, a federal judge in Montana said the Army Corps was inappropriately using the permit program. The Justice Department asked the judge to limit his ruling so it does not affect the entire program, which could stall hundreds of projects. Atlantic Coast is owned by units of Dominion and Duke Energy Corp.

If approved, that will bring Dominion's share in the pipeline to 53%, up from 48%. Duke Energy Corp DUK.N will own the remaining 47%. Southern will remain an anchor customer of the pipe through its Virginia Natural Gas subsidiary. In addition, Dominion said it agreed to buy Southern’s Pivotal LNG, which distributes liquefied natural gas for marine and road transportation. The total cost of the Atlantic Coast stake and Pivotal was about $175 million, Dominion said. Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects that have received federal permits in recent years but have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. Some analysts have questioned whether Dominion will be able to complete Atlantic Coast following numerous delays and cost increases related to regulatory and legal battles over state and federal permits. Dominion CFO James Chapman told analysts on Tuesday: “Major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of (Atlantic Coast) as an alternative pipeline option to the region.” Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell told analysts the company could restart pipeline construction after receiving some key permits that are expected during the first half of this year. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in May or June in a case about whether the pipeline can run underneath the Appalachian Trail in Virginia."

Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects that have received federal permits in recent years but have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. In the Supreme Court case, Dominion and its partners, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co, say the U.S. Forest Service was correct in issuing Atlantic Coast a permit to cross the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. In his brief, Herring asked the court to affirm the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that invalidated the Forest Service permit. “The Forest Service failed to conduct the meticulous review of Atlantic’s permit application called for by the Service’s governing statutes and regulations,” Herring said, noting “the permitting process was rushed and slipshod and driven by Atlantic’s arbitrary deadlines.” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said the company respectfully disagreed with the Attorney General, noting the Forest Service has the full authority to authorize the Appalachian Trail crossing. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case on Feb. 24. Dominion has said it expects to complete Atlantic Coast in early 2022. “Our region’s current infrastructure is not keeping up with growing demand for gas,” Ruby said, noting communities in southeast Virginia and northeast North Carolina are experiencing chronic shortages of gas, forcing utilities to shut off service to major industries and the U.S. military during the winter. Herring, however, questioned whether the project is needed, citing numerous sources that indicate gas demand is actually decreasing, and that renewable energies are becoming more cost competitive. “The ever-rising costs of building [the pipeline] will be passed on to consumers, by the companies that have contracted with Atlantic to carry gas through the pipeline.” When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. In addition to the Appalachian Trail case, the Fourth Circuit also rejected a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), saying the agency’s decisions were arbitrary and would jeopardize endangered species. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-kilometer) project in December 2018 after the Fourth Circuit stayed an earlier FWS’ permit."
-14.990370844140699," Dominion still sees U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe online in 2022 despite Morgan Stanley's doubts (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc D.N said on Monday it was confident it will complete the proposed $7.3-$7.8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina by early 2022, in response to a prediction by investment bank Morgan Stanley that a court decision would likely scuttle the project. “We remain committed to completing the project for the good of our economy and the environment,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said, noting the company expected to complete construction in late 2021 with final in-service in early 2022. Dominion made its comments after Morgan Stanley said in a report that “Atlantic Coast will likely not be completed given the Fourth Circuit’s likely (in the bank’s view) rejection, for the third time, of a newly issued Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement that we expect to come by the first quarter of 2020.” In July, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) second Biological Opinion because the court found the agency’s decisions were arbitrary and would jeopardize the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee and other endangered species. Federal agencies use Biological Opinions when authorizing projects that could adversely affect threatened or endangered species or critical habitats, and issue take statements to limit the number of those species that could be harmed. Ruby said Dominion expects the FWS will issue a new Biological Opinion in the first half of 2020. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-kilometer) project in December 2018 after the Fourth Circuit stayed the FWS’ second Biological Opinion. Dominion and its partners, Duke Energy Corp DUK.N and Southern Co SO.N, are also working through a dispute over where the pipeline can cross the Appalachian Trail. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to take up the Appalachian Trail case, which is also important for the construction of EQM Midstream Partners LP's EQM.N Mountain Valley gas pipe from West Virginia to Virginia. Analysts at Height Capital Markets said they expect the Supreme Court will issue a ruling in May or June 2020. Analysts at Morningstar said they expect the Appalachian Trail dispute will be resolved by a favorable Supreme Court decision or an administrative or legislative solution. Morningstar said a route revision was the likely compromise for the endangered species dispute but noted that could boost the project’s costs to around $8 billion and push completion into 2022. When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
1.2029706827103148," U.S. Supreme Court takes up fight over $7.5 billion natural gas pipeline WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by Dominion Energy Inc and President Donald Trump’s administration of a lower court ruling that halted construction on a $7.5 billion natural gas pipeline due to run underneath a section of the popular Appalachian Trail in rural Virginia. The administration and companies involved in the project have asked the justices to overturn a ruling that found that the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to grant a right of way for the pipeline. Environmental groups had sued to stop the pipeline after the Forest Service gave the green light for the project through protected National Park Service land. The December 2018 ruling by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put a stop to construction of the 600-mile (965-km) Atlantic Coast Pipeline, intended to run from West Virginia to North Carolina. Dominion Energy leads a consortium of companies in the project that also includes Duke Energy Corp. At issue is the Forest Service’s decision to allow the pipeline to cross underneath the 2,200-mile (3,500 km) long Appalachian Trail - a popular hiking route in the eastern United States stretching from Georgia to Maine - in the George Washington National Forest. “The Supreme Court’s acceptance of our petition is a very encouraging sign and provides a clear path forward to resolve this important issue,” said Aaron Ruby, a Dominion spokesman. A ruling is due by the end of the court’s new term, which starts on Monday and ends in June. The Supreme Court’s eventual ruling may also affect the proposed 300-mile (480-km) Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is intended to run from West Virginia to southern Virginia and crosses the trail in the Jefferson National Forest. ‘COSTLY AND UNNECESSARY’ After a lengthy application process involving multiple federal agencies, the Forest Service granted the consortium a right of way under the trail in January 2018, prompting environmental groups to file a lawsuit. “The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a dangerous, costly and unnecessary project and we won’t stand by while Duke and Dominion Energy try to force it on our public lands, threatening people’s health, endangered species, iconic landscapes and clean water along the way,” the Sierra Club and Southern Environmental Law Center, two of the environmental groups challenging the pipeline, said in a joint statement. The 4th Circuit ruled that the Forest Service did not have the power to grant a right of way under a federal law called the Mineral Leasing Act. The court cited a section of the law that says federal agencies can grant rights of way for pipelines on “federal lands” but specifically excludes land that is part of the federal National Park system like the Appalachian Trail. The Trump administration disputed that interpretation, with Solicitor General Noel Francisco saying in court filings that the National Park Service has only limited authority to maintain the trail and that the Forest Service has the authority to approve rights of way across it. Lawyers for the pipeline consortium noted that more than 50 pipelines already cross under the trail. The 4th Circuit’s ruling has the effect of “rendering the footpath a 2,200-mile barrier separating resource-rich areas to its west from consumers to its east,” the consortium said in court filings. The environmental groups have said the project could go ahead under a different route that does not cross the trail on federal land. State and private landowners have the authority to grant rights of way under the trail, the groups added."
10.247408692467342," U.S. court vacates Dominion Atlantic Coast natgas pipe permit (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday vacated a permit by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that allowed Dominion Energy Inc to build its Atlantic Coast natural gas pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Dominion suspended construction of the long-delayed $7.0-7.5 billion project in early December after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, stayed the Fish and Wildlife Service’s permit, called an incidental take statement. The court on Friday found the Fish and Wildlife Service fast-tracked its decision to reissue an incidental take statement in 2018 19 days after federal energy regulators resumed formal consultation with the agency following the court’s decision to stay an earlier version of the permit from 2017, Fourth Circuit Chief Judge Roger Gregory said in the court’s opinion. “In fast-tracking its decisions, the agency appears to have lost sight of its mandate under the (Endangered Species Act),” Gregory said, noting the Fish and Wildlife Service’s decisions in granting the 2018 incidental take statement were “arbitrary and capricious.” In response, Dominion said it expects the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Fish and Wildlife Service will be able to immediately begin working to correct the errors identified by the court. “Once the new Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement are issued, we will seek the necessary approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to resume construction,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said in an email. “We’re confident we remain on track to complete the project by late 2021,” Ruby said. When Dominion started work on the 600-mile pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."

6.804422419668412," U.S., Dominion Energy ask Supreme Court to hear Atlantic Coast natgas pipe case (Reuters) - The U.S. Solicitor General and Dominion Energy Inc asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal of a decision that stopped Dominion from building the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline across the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Dominion argued in their filings on Tuesday that the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the Cowpasture v. U.S. Forest Service case impedes energy infrastructure development on the East Coast. In December, the appeals court vacated a permit that allowed the Atlantic Coast pipe to cross the Appalachian Trail on National Forest land because the court said the Forest Service lacks authority to grant pipeline rights-of-way across the trail on federal land. Dominion said the decision could turn the Appalachian Trail into a 2,200-mile (3,541-kilometer) barrier separating resource-rich areas to its west from consumers to its east. The company noted there were already approximately 56 pipelines across the Appalachian Trail. Some energy analysts think there is a good chance the Supreme Court will hear the case and have warned Dominion may cancel the project if the court refuses to hear it. “After reading the Solicitor General’s arguments, we’re increasing our odds to just under 50% that the Supreme Court decides to hear the case,” Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets in Washington said in a note on Wednesday. “We believe the Court may view this as an issue of national importance,” Price said, noting “if the court declines to take up the case or upholds the ruling, we anticipate (Atlantic Coast) owners may cancel the projects.” Dominion, however, said it plans to complete the project and believes it has a good chance of getting the Supreme Court to hear the case and support its view. Dominion has said it hopes to overcome other legal challenges that will allow it to resume construction of the $7.0-$7.5 billion pipeline later this year and complete it in 2021. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the Fourth Circuit in another case stayed a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit that authorized Dominion to build the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. When Dominion started work on the 600-mile pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."

0.1369943358208545," U.S. asks Supreme Court for more time on Atlantic Coast natgas pipe appeal (Reuters) - The U.S. Solicitor General asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to extend the time the government has to file a petition in an appeal of a circuit court decision preventing Dominion Energy Inc from building the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline across the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. Solicitor General Noel Francisco is seeking a one-month extension until June 25. Without the extension, the time expires on May 28. Some analysts think Dominion could cancel the pipeline if the Supreme Court does not hear the case because the project’s costs have ballooned due to legal and regulatory delays. In December, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Cowpasture v U.S. Forest Service case vacated a permit that allowed the pipe to cross the Appalachian Trail on National Forest land. The court determined the Forest Service lacks authority to grant pipeline rights-of-way across the trail on federal land. Dominion said it welcomed news that the Solicitor General would join the case, noting for decades that 56 other pipelines have operated across the Appalachian Trail. Earlier this month, Dominion’s Chief Executive Thomas Farrell said it would increase the chances the court will hear the case if the Solicitor General joins the appeal. Farrell said Dominion hopes to overcome other legal challenges that will allow the company to resume construction of the $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion pipeline in the third quarter and complete it by early 2021. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the Fourth Circuit stayed a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit that authorized building the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington, DC, said they expect the Supreme Court to grant the extension but do not expect the court to take up the case. The court will likely make a decision in the fourth quarter. “If the court declines to hear the case, we anticipate Dominion and Duke will decide to terminate the project as rerouting the pipeline would likely be cost prohibitive,” the Height Capital Markets analysts said, noting it will be “extremely difficult” for the utilities to pass on additional costs to ratepayers. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co. When Dominion started work on the 600-mile (966-km) pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
0.18225139989618802," Dominion to resume work on U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe in third quarter (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday it expects to resume construction of the $7.0 billion-$7.5 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina in the third quarter and complete it by early 2021, despite legal and regulatory challenges. “It’s been a very frustrating process, but we are winding our way through it ... and we’re making progress,” Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell said on Dominion’s first-quarter earnings call. The company still needs to resolve two major legal cases before it can complete the project, which has been on hold since late last year. Atlantic Coast is designed to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the U.S. Southeast. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about five million U.S. homes for a day. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stayed a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that authorized building the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. The company said oral arguments in that case will be presented on May 9, with a decision expected about 90 days later. Dominion said a positive decision would allow it to restart partial construction in the third quarter. Dominion is also seeking an order from the U.S. Supreme Court overturning a Fourth Circuit decision that invalidated the U.S. Forest Service’s authorization to build the pipe across the Appalachian Trail. That case, if the Supreme Court takes it up, would be heard in 2020, so full construction would resume after that decision, Dominion said. When the company started work on the 600-mile (966-km) Atlantic Coast in the spring of 2018, Dominion said it expected the project would cost an estimated $6.0 billion-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. Since then, Dominion has upped the project costs and extended the timeline. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co."
0.6978370988890525," Dominion to keep Connecticut Millstone nuclear plant in service (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday that it reached a 10-year agreement with Connecticut utilities that will keep the state’s only nuclear power station in service. Dominion had until Friday to tell the regional power grid operator, ISO New England, if it would retire the two reactors at the 2,088-megawatt Millstone station. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. Millstone produces about half of the electricity in Connecticut and around 98 percent of its carbon-free energy, making the plant key to meeting the state’s aggressive carbon reduction goals. “This is a huge win for Connecticut, the region, and our colleagues at Millstone,” Paul Koonce, president and chief executive of Dominion’s Power Generation Group, said in a statement. “Not only does this preserve the vast majority of Connecticut’s carbon-free electricity, it preserves good jobs for the 1,500 women and men who work at Millstone and keeps 4,000 other residents employed,” Koonce said. Dominion, of Richmond, Virginia, has been saying for years that Millstone’s reactors, which began operating in 1975 and 1986, are not economically viable in the current low power price environment. Power prices in New England over the past five years have been the lowest ever, according to Reuters data going back to 2000, due to increasing use of generators fired with cheap natural gas from shale formations and renewables like wind and solar. That makes it tough for facilities using other sources of energy like coal and nuclear to compete. After three years of working with politicians and regulators on a plan to keep the plant in service, the state in December selected Millstone for a contract to purchase a little over half of its output for 10 years. The price of that contract, however, was not firm, so Dominion said it was negotiating with the state and two local utilities, which are units of Eversource Energy and Avangrid Inc. Dominion said this agreement marks another milestone in its multi-year progression towards a more regulated and long-term contracted earnings profile and the resulting reduction in business risk. The contract represents a “modest financial uplift,” which results in expected operating earnings per share levels that are within its existing guidance for 2019 and beyond, the company said."

4.484357914777499," UPDATE 1-Dominion confident it will complete W. Va.-N.C. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Recasts, adds analyst comment, details and background) Feb 26 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Tuesday it remains “confident” it will complete the $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina despite a court decision denying its request for a rehearing on a permit. On Monday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Atlantic Coast’s request for an en banc rehearing related to the court’s invalidation of the project’s U.S. Forest Service Appalachian Trail crossing authorization. The company said it expects to file an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in the next 90 days and is also pursuing legislative and administrative options to obtain the approvals needed to continue building the pipeline. The company said it believes it could restart at least partial construction in the third quarter of 2019. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the appellate court stayed a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that authorized the pipe to be built in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said in a report they believe it would be more prudent for the pipeline to reroute through a section of the Appalachian Trail on private- or state-owned land. “Re-routing would likely take less time than a Supreme Court proceeding or an Act of Congress,” Height Capital Markets said, noting they expect the pipe will enter service in the fourth quarter of 2020 if the companies remain committed to the project. On Feb. 1, the company said it planned to put part of the project into service in late 2020 and complete the full 600-mile (966-km) project in early 2021. When the company started work on Atlantic Coast last spring, Dominion said it expected the project would cost an estimated $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. The company boosted that cost estimate to $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion and delayed the completion to mid-2020 last November. In February, it raised the estimate to $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion and delayed the completion to early 2021 due to delays caused by numerous environmental lawsuits, among other things.

4.570169678172062," Dominion aims to cut U.S. methane releases by 50 percent by 2030 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Tuesday it plans to cut the amount of methane escaping from its natural gas wells, pipelines and other infrastructure by 50 percent over the next decade as part of its effort to combat global warming. The company, one of the biggest U.S. power and gas utilities, held contests among its business units to determine how much methane emissions they could reduce, said Diane Leopold, president and CEO of Dominion’s Gas Infrastructure Group. “Rather than focus on saving money, which drove some of our early methane emission programs, we started thinking about sustainability and methane reductions,” Leopold said. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. The energy industry is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, there is a market for methane. The more methane kept in pipes, the more gas companies can sell to customers. Dominion said the goal is to prevent more than 430,000 metric tons of methane, or 23 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas, from entering the atmosphere between 2010 and 2030. The company said that would be equivalent to taking 2.3 million cars off the road for a year. Dominion has 3.4 million gas distribution customers in West Virginia, Ohio, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and the Carolinas, over 100,000 miles of gas pipelines and 1 trillion cubic feet of underground storage and production. Leopold said the company will cut methane emissions across all its gas businesses by reducing venting during planned maintenance and inspections, replacing older equipment and expanding leak detection and repair programs, among other things. The amount of methane that leaked from U.S. gas systems was about 1.4 percent to 2.3 percent of the country’s total output, according to studies by the EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. Leopold said the company did not want to estimate the cost of its programs since the goal was to reduce methane emissions. “We wanted to find out how much methane we could save, not the dollars we could save,” Leopold said. She said Dominion held competitions to design programs to reduce methane emissions. In one, the company asked its businesses to figure out how much emissions they could reduce with $1 million. Dominion said this initiative builds on previous efforts to cut methane on the gas side of its business and carbon emissions on the power side. The company is also working with customers to help them cut their methane emissions. Dominion has partnered with Smithfield Foods to invest at least $250 million in North Carolina, Virginia and Utah to capture waste methane from hog farms that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and convert it into renewable natural gas to heat homes and power local industries. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is rolling back Obama-era rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saying lighter regulations will boost economic growth. Opponents say this will worsen global warming. “With or without regulations, we’re going to proceed with our programs,” Leopold said."

10.052990965474502," Dominion delays U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe, boosts costs (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday the estimated cost of its Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina has risen to $7.0 billion-$7.5 billion, adding that it has delayed the expected completion date to early 2021. The company said previously the project would cost an estimated $6.5 billion-$7.0 billion, excluding financing, and be completed in mid 2020 due to delays caused by numerous environmental lawsuits. “We remain highly confident in the successful and timely resolution of all outstanding permit issues as well as the ultimate completion of the entire project,” Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell said in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings release. He noted the company was “actively pursuing multiple paths to resolve all outstanding permit issues including judicial, legislative and administrative avenues.” Earlier this week, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed a previous court decision against U.S. Forest Service permits that allowed Dominion to build the Atlantic Coast pipeline across national forests and the Appalachian Trail. Dominion said it expects construction could recommence on the full 600-mile (966-kilometer) pipeline route during the third quarter of 2019, with partial in-service in late 2020. When the company started work on Atlantic Coast in the spring of 2018, Dominion said it expected the project would cost an estimated $6.0 billion-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. That was before the company suspended construction in early December after the Fourth Circuit Court stayed a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that authorized the pipe to be built in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Atlantic Coast is designed to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the U.S. Southeast. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U.S. homes. Atlantic Coast is not the only big pipeline fighting environmental groups in court over permits. EQM Midstream Partners LP is facing similar challenges in its quest to build the Mountain Valley gas pipe from West Virginia to Virginia, which is now at least $1 billion over budget and a year behind schedule. Separately, Dominion said it expects the 38-mile Supply Header project in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which will feed gas into Atlantic Coast, will enter service in late 2020 at a cost of $650 million-$700 million. Previously, the company said Supply Header would cost around $500 million and enter service in late 2019."
12.249078222177774," U.S. court stays ruling against Dominion Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court has stayed a previous court decision against Forest Service permits that allowed Dominion Energy Inc to build the $6.5-$7 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline across national forests and the Appalachian Trail. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday froze the previous decision by a three-judge panel until the full court decides whether it will rehear the case en banc. The appeals court panel had said in December that the U.S. Forest Service had “abdicated its responsibility to preserve national forest resources” when it issued the permits. Dominion argued that the ruling by the three-judge panel to vacate the Forest Service permits went beyond the court’s authority and created an “impregnable barrier (from Georgia to Maine) dividing energy sources west of the (Appalachian) Trail from consumers east of the Trail.” Dominion spokesman Karl Neddenien said on Wednesday the company remained confident it would complete the 600-mile (966-kilometer) pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, even though the timing is “somewhat fluid” due in part to federal lawsuits. In the past, Dominion said it expected to finish the project in mid-2020, but the company has suspended all construction since early December after the Fourth Circuit stayed a federal permit in another lawsuit. That other lawsuit involved the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Incidental Take Statement, which authorized the pipeline to build in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Given the composition of the Fourth Circuit, analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington, D.C. said “a rehearing en banc could plausibly bode well for Atlantic Coast.” Height Capital Markets said the panel was comprised of three judges nominated by Democrats, while 7 of the 12 remaining active circuit judges were appointed by Republicans. “While the appointing president’s party doesn’t necessarily define a judge’s legal perspective, we continue to see political affiliation play an outsized role in debates involving environmental rules,” Height Capital Markets said. Separately, a bill passed a committee in Virginia’s legislature last week that would add restrictions on Dominion’s ability to pass the costs of transporting gas on the Atlantic Coast pipeline to its Virginia-based power plants. Dominion said the bill was unnecessary since Virginia’s utility regulator “already has a strong process in place to protect consumers.” “Atlantic Coast is going to lower consumer energy costs and make their electricity more reliable,” Dominion’s Neddenien said."
7.310975733484441," Virginia gives Dominion permit for Atlantic Coast natgas pipe compressor (Reuters) - An environmental board in Virginia unanimously approved an air permit for a compressor station on Tuesday for Dominion Energy Inc’s planned nearly $7 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina. The fight over the permit was just one of several battles Atlantic Coast and other pipelines are facing to move gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in the U.S. Southeast. There are two big gas pipes under construction in Virginia - Atlantic Coast and EQM Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley project. Both are at least $1 billion over budget and about a year behind schedule due primarily to legal battles with environmental and local groups opposed to the projects. “While the (compressor) approval process has concluded, we know we have to continue building trust in the community,” Karl Neddenien, spokesman for Atlantic Coast said in an email, noting the company will invest in a new community center, a rescue squad and more. In December, the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board delayed a vote on the compressor over concerns it would violate civil rights by forcing the historically African-American Union Hill community to bear an unequal burden from pollution and other disruptions. In addition to the compressor permit, Dominion has been dealing with legal battles over other state and federal permits. In early December, Dominion suspended all construction on Atlantic Coast after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stayed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Incidental Take Statement, which authorized pipeline construction in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Neddenien said construction of the 600-mile (966-km) project remains on hold pending clarification of the scope of the Fish and Wildlife permit stay. Before the court issued the stay, Dominion said it expected to complete Atlantic Coast in mid-2020. Now, however, the company said it was waiting for the outcome of its request for clarification before offering any update on the project’s schedule or cost. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington, D.C., said in a report that they do not expect Atlantic Coast to enter service until the fourth quarter of 2020, assuming the utilities remain committed to the project. Atlantic Coast, which is designed to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas, is a partnership between units of Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co."
1.583307195515031," U.S. court vacates Atlantic Coast natgas pipe permit, Dominion to appeal (Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday dealt another blow to Dominion Energy Inc’s planned $6.5-$7.0 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, vacating a permit that allows it to cross national forests and the Appalachian Trail. Dominion said it would “immediately” appeal the court’s decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said the U.S. Forest Service “abdicated its responsibility to preserve national forest resources” when it issued the permit. The court said the Forest Service had “serious environmental concerns that were suddenly, and mysteriously, assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company’s deadlines.” It noted that the agency raised concerns about the project in 2016 and early 2017 but had a “change of course” in May 2017. Dominion said the court decision “has now undermined the judgment of ... nearly every federal agency that has reviewed this project.” The Fourth Circuit has overturned several permits for Atlantic Coast and another gas pipeline working its way across West Virginia and Virginia, EQM Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley project, following challenges by environmental groups, like the Sierra Club. “The Trump Administration’s efforts to streamline the pipeline permitting process has inadvertently hurt projects...as regulatory haste repeatedly continues to create legal problems,” analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington, D.C., said in a report. Height Capital Markets said the appeals court’s decision last week to stay the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Incidental Take Statement authorizing Atlantic Coast’s construction in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species could push the project’s full in service date into the third quarter of 2020. Dominion in November delayed the full in-service date for Atlantic Coast to the middle of 2020 from late 2019. In response to the Dec. 7 court order, Dominion suspended all construction on the project and said the court stay was “not only unwarranted, but overly broad.” The company said the Dec. 7 stay affected all 600 miles (966 kilometers) of the project, but issues covered in the case affected only four species and roughly 100 miles in West Virginia and Virginia. The pipeline is designed to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in the Southeast. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co."

5.119330272533922," Dominion does not expect U.S. court order to hold up Atlantic Coast pipe (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Tuesday it does not expect a court decision to stay a federal permit for part of its Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline to delay construction of the $6-$6.5 billion project from West Virginia to North Carolina, which the company aims to complete by the end of 2019. On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an order staying implementation of a permit from the U.S. Forest Service for the pipeline. That Forest Service permit authorized construction and operation of Atlantic Coast on national forest lands in Virginia and West Virginia. Dominion said the Forest Service permit affects only 20 miles (32-km) of the 600-mile pipeline designed to carry 1.5-billion cubic feet per day. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. “While we respectfully disagree with the Court’s ruling, it will not have a significant impact on our construction schedule,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said in an email. “We will continue working in all other areas of West Virginia and North Carolina, where we are making significant progress,” Ruby said. The Southern Environmental Law Center, which opposes the pipeline, asked the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Tuesday to stop work on the entire project due to the court’s latest ruling. The Fourth Circuit decision was the third time in four months the court has vacated or stayed federal authorizations for Atlantic Coast, the Southern Environmental Law Center said in its FERC filing. FERC regulates construction of interstate gas pipelines and has temporarily stopped work on parts of the Atlantic Coast project in the past due to prior Fourth Circuit court rulings. “Opponents’ delay tactics will not stop this project. They will only drive up consumer energy costs, delay the transition to cleaner energy, and make it harder for public utilities to reliably serve their customers,” Ruby said, noting “We will complete this project.” Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Virginia energy company Dominion (48 percent), North Carolina’s Duke Energy Corp (47 percent) and Georgia energy company Southern Co (5 percent). Dominion will build and operate the pipe. Atlantic Coast is one of several pipelines currently under construction to connect growing output from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in other parts of the United States and Canada."

Dominion Energy, which owns a stake of about 15 percent in the company, offered 0.2468 of its shares per Dominion Energy Midstream common unit, valuing each unit at $17.75 based on closing prices as of Sept. 18, the company said. The offer represented a discount of nearly 2 percent to Dominion Energy Midstream’s Wednesday close of $18.05, but was at a premium of 8.2 percent based on the 30-day volume-weighted average unit price. Shares of Dominion Energy Midstream were down 3.3 percent at $17.45 in extended trading, while those of Dominion Energy were largely unchanged. Pipeline companies are reorganizing their business structure after the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in March stopped them from claiming an income tax allowance as part of the fees they charge shippers. “Continued weakness in MLP capital markets combined with the prolonged disruption in Dominion Energy Midstream’s common unit price since the March 15 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission policy revision were key factors that led to this decision,” Dominion Energy Chief Executive Officer Thomas Farrell said."

-0.3568314907108317," Dominion does not expect U.S. court order to hold up Atlantic Coast pipe (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday vacated permits by two federal agencies that allowed Dominion Energy Inc to build its Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline, a decision the company does not expect to hold up its $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion project. In response to the court’s concerns about the environment, Dominion said it would work with the agencies to reinstate the permits for the 600-mile (966-km) pipe from West Virginia to Virginia and North Carolina. “We believe the court’s concerns can be promptly addressed ... without causing unnecessary delay,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said in an email. In the meantime, Ruby said Dominion will continue work in West Virginia and North Carolina. The company has said it expects to finish the 1.5-billion cubic feet per day pipe by late 2019. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. The ruling was the latest victory for the Sierra Club and other opponents of gas pipelines in the 4th U.S. Court of Appeals. Last week, the court told EQT Corp to stop work on its Mountain Valley pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia after voiding two federal permits for that project. Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley are two of several pipelines under construction to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. In the Atlantic Coast case, the Sierra Club and others challenged decisions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued an Incidental Take Statement under the Endangered Species Act authorizing the company to build the pipeline in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species, including mussels, bumble bees, crustaceans and bats. The court wants Fish and Wildlife to put more limits on how the company deals with the animals in a 20-mile portion of the pipeline’s route in West Virginia and 80 miles in Virginia. Dominion said it will avoid those areas until the agency clarifies the limits, which the company expects shortly. The court wants the National Park Service to better explain why permitting a pipeline to cross under the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia is consistent with the conservation and preservation purpose, including scenic views, of a national highway. Dominion said it expects the Park Service to provide the information and promptly reissue the permit."

3.5872314556298157," Dominion Atlantic Coast natgas pipe on track for late 2019 start (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Wednesday that its $6-$6.5 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia and North Carolina remained on track to enter service in late 2019 after federal regulators approved the start of construction for the project in North Carolina. “Yesterday’s approval was another major step forward for the project and keeps us on track for late 2019 in-service,” Aaron Ruby, a spokesman at Dominion, said in an email. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued that approval in a filing Tuesday afternoon. Like other pipeline approvals, FERC said “if any court or agency invalidates a required federal authorization after construction has begun...(FERC) may take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the protection of environmental resources, including issuance of a stop work order.” The Sierra Club, an environmental group opposing the pipeline, said in a statement following the FERC decision that the project is facing multiple lawsuits and a challenge that could force a rehearing at FERC. The Sierra Club also said the Virginia State Water Control Board is revisiting the sufficiency of the project’s current water certifications, which could be revoked. The 600-mile (966-km) Atlantic Coast project is designed to carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in Virginia and North Carolina. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Virginia energy company Dominion (48 percent), North Carolina’s Duke Energy Corp (47 percent) and Georgia energy company Southern Co (5 percent). Dominion will build and operate the pipe. To feed gas into Atlantic Coast and other pipelines, Dominion also wants to build the 38-mile (61-km) Supply Header project in West Virginia and Pennsylvania at a cost of about $500 million. Atlantic Coast is one of several big pipelines expected to enter service over the next couple of years to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada."
