2.322174319821837," UPDATE 2-Inter Pipeline says no decisions made on strategic options after Brookfield offer (Adds details on Heartland Petrochemical Complex, analyst comment) CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s Inter Pipeline Ltd said on Friday no decisions have been made as it initiates a strategic review of its options, a week after rejecting an unsolicited bid from its largest shareholder, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. The Calgary-based company, whose assets include over 7,000 km (4,300 miles) of oil pipelines, 5 million barrels of oil storage in western Canada and natural gas liquids processing plants, announced a formal review on Thursday, including a possible “corporate transaction.” Brookfield had offered C$16.50 per share for Inter and said it was willing to go as high as C$18.25 if the pipeline operator gave it access to due diligence. At the top price, Brookfield’s offer valued Inter at C$7.8 billion ($6.18 billion) but the pipeline company rejected the offer, saying it was too low. On a conference call on Friday, held to discuss Inter’s quarterly earnings, Chief Executive Christian Bayle made it clear the board would consider an acquisition by Brookfield as part of the review process. “The intention is to evaluate a broad range of corporate options, one of which obviously is a possible corporate transaction. I think it’s fair to say the board would not preclude including Brookfield in that process if they would participate,” Bayle said. “No timetable has been set and no decisions have been made regarding strategic alternatives.” The board will continue to look for a partner for Inter’s Heartland Petrochemical Complex (HPC) in central Alberta. The C$4 billion project is expected to be operational by early 2022 and Bayle said Inter would release more information on HPC contracts and earnings before the next quarterly results. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said they expected the strategic review would reaffirm the board’s belief that Brookfield’s offer is below intrinsic value, given HPC will start up next year, and said Inter’s search for a partner for the facility would be key. “We suspect the outcome will play a pivotal role for investors in determining whether bringing in a partner can de-risk HPC sufficiently or if Brookfield is better suited as the owner,” they said in a note. In 2019 Inter rejected an unsolicited C$12.4 billion buyout offer from an unnamed bidder, which several media outlets reported was Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. That offer valued Inter shares at around C$30 each. Bayle declined to comment on that offer. Inter shares last traded up 46 cents in Toronto at C$17.96.

3.972480717202589," Inter Pipeline starts review of options after rejecting Brookfield bid (Reuters) - Canada’s Inter Pipeline Ltd said on Thursday it has launched a review of options, including a possible ‘corporate transaction’, just a week after it rejected an unsolicited bid from its largest shareholder Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. Brookfield, which acquires and manages infrastructure assets, had offered C$16.50 per share for Inter and said it was willing to raise it to as much as C$18.25 if the pipeline operator gave it access to due diligence. At the top price, Brookfield’s offer valued Inter at C$7.8 billion ($6.15 billion) and would have made it the biggest Canadian oil and gas deal since 2017, according to data provider Dealogic. However, the Calgary-based company rejected the offer, saying it was too low. While Inter on Thursday did not give any detail on the type of corporate transaction it might consider, it said it continues to look for partner for its C$4 billion Heartland Petrochemical Complex in Alberta province. The company had in 2019 rejected an unsolicited C$12.4 billion buyout offer from an unnamed bidder, which, according to several media reports, was Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. That offer valued Inter shares at around C$30 each. The company’s assets include over 7,000 km (4,300 miles) of pipelines and 5 million barrels of oil storage in western Canada, as well as natural gas liquids processing plants. Separately, Inter posted a 68% jump in fourth-quarter profit, helped by higher volumes and capital fees at its oil sands transportation business. Excluding items, it earned 24 Canadian cents, above expectations of 19 Canadian cents, according to Refinitiv IBES.

6.05494021288873," Inter Pipeline rejects Brookfield's offer as too low, shares jump (Reuters) - Canada’s Inter Pipeline Ltd on Thursday rejected an unsolicited offer from its largest shareholder Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, but its shares jumped as investors bet on an eventual deal. Brookfield, which acquires and manages infrastructure assets, said on Wednesday it intended to offer C$16.50 per share, a 23% premium to the stock’s prior closing price, and said it was willing to raise it to as much as C$18.25 if the pipeline operator gave it access to due diligence. Inter Pipeline stock jumped 31% in Toronto to C$17.50, while Brookfield shares dropped 3%. The pandemic has hit Canadian oil and gas companies hard, crushing fuel demand, and leading to reduced crude production. Inter Pipeline’s assets include over 7,000 km (4,300 miles) of pipelines and 5 million barrels of oil storage in Western Canada, as well as natural gas liquids processing plants. At the top price, Brookfield’s offer would value Calgary-based Inter at C$7.8 billion ($6.16 billion) and would be the biggest Canadian oil and gas deal since 2017, according to data provider Dealogic. Inter said that was not sufficient for it to enter into exclusive talks with the infrastructure firm. The pipeline operator said Brookfield has not made a formal offer and if it does, the company’s board will review it with advisors. Brookfield declined further comment. Brookfield’s offer is low, but serious enough that Inter Pipeline should negotiate, said Rob Thummel, managing director of TortoiseEcofin, Inter Pipeline’s eighth-largest shareholder according to Refinitiv. “I think they should absolutely look at it and consider it,” he said. A rival bid seems unlikely given that the energy sector is focused on repaying debt and buying back shares, not acquisitions, he said. Even so, Keyera Corp, another Canadian energy infrastructure company, may now attract some interest, said Thummel, who manages shares in that company as well. Its shares rose 1.8%. Keyera could not be reached. Brookfield said it had first approached Inter in September with offers at premiums as high as 50% to the company’s trading price. The talks fell through as Inter had a “more optimistic outlook of future growth” and attached to itself a value that was well over Brookfield’s assessment, Brookfield said. Several analysts sided with Brookfield, saying accepting the offer would be the most likely outcome for Inter Pipeline. Brokerage RBC said many shareholders would be unhappy if Inter says no, particularly after it refused another offer two years ago, which had valued it at C$12.4 billion. Inter Pipeline’s shares had fallen nearly 38% over the last year prior to Brookfield publicly expressing interest.

6.05494021288873," Brookfield lobs $5.6 billion unsolicited offer for Canada's Inter Pipeline, prepared to sweeten bid CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. made an unsolicited C$7.08 billion ($5.6 billion) offer on Wednesday to buy Canada’s Inter Pipeline Ltd as it seeks to benefit from rebounding oil and gas demand, after an approach last year was rebuffed. Brookfield, which owns and operates assets in the utilities, transport and storage sectors, said it has acquired 19.65% economic interest in Inter Pipeline, to become the top shareholder in the Calgary-based company. The infrastructure firm offered C$16.50 per share for Inter Pipeline, a 23.13% premium Wednesday’s close, valuing the company’s equity at C$7.08 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at about C$13.5 billion. Brookfield said it is willing to sweeten its offer to between C$17 and $18.25 a share if it is granted access to due diligence. Brookfield said it started amassing Inter Pipeline shares in March 2020 and first approached the company to discuss a deal in September, but discussions stalled as the two companies had markedly different views of Inter Pipeline’s value. Pipeline space for crude was in high demand in western Canada before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and caused both oil demand and supply to fall sharply. The region’s production has rebounded quickly this year. “Despite a strong recovery in global equity markets and a return of commodity prices to pre-COVID levels, IPL’s share performance and credit profile continues to be strained,” Brookfield said in a statement detailing its offer. Inter Pipeline did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares in the company nearly halved through 2020 but have ticked up about 13% since the start of this year. Inter Pipeline’s assets include over 7,000 km (4,300 miles)of pipelines and 5 million barrels of oil storage in western Canada, as well as natural gas liquids processing plants. It also owns storage terminals in Denmark and Sweden. Pipeline companies are attractive to pension funds and private equity firms alike as they generate steady cash flow through long-term contracts, helping limit volatility in crude oil prices tumble. Such steady yielding assets are especially in demand during near zero interest rate environment. The offer is fully financed, with a maximum cash consideration of about C$4.9 billion and a maximum aggregate number of BIPC shares issued of about 19 million, Brookfield said. In 2019, Inter Pipeline rejected an unsolicited C$12.4 billion buyout offer from an unnamed bidder, with media reports later revealing the suitor as Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.

-13.057439063004795," Brookfield a potential suitor for Trans Mountain, analyst says (Reuters) - Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP could be a potential buyer of the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain oil pipeline, a Stifel FirstEnergy analyst said, as the project expansion struggles with increasing costs arising from regulatory delays. In 2018, Ottawa bought the 67-year-old pipeline for C$4.5 billion to ensure expansion proceeded, but has faced opposition by environmental and some indigenous groups. Brookfield could be a potential “dark horse”, as it recently completed a $20 billion capital raise, and continues to have excellent access to capital markets, analyst Ian Gillies said in a research note on Monday. “We would also expect various indigenous groups to pursue acquiring the pipeline”, Gillies wrote, adding that any further cost overruns would make Trans Mountain an unattractive M&A candidate for existing Canadian infrastructure companies. Trans Mountain and Brookfield were not immediately available for comment. The expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline is expected to cost C$12.6 billion ($9.46 billion), a sharp increase from a previous estimate, due to court and regulatory delays, rising costs of land, labor and accommodations for indigenous groups who had raised concerns. Last week Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal dismissed a challenge to government approval of the pipeline expansion, clearing some uncertainty from the project. Toronto-Canada based Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, which engages in the acquisition and management of infrastructure assets, last year bought a number of federally-regulated natural gas gathering and processing assets from pipeline operator Enbridge. Bloomberg earlier reported that Canada’s government will start a new round of consultations aimed at hashing out an agreement between indigenous groups that are competing for a stake in the Trans Mountain pipeline."

5.750778063155479," How Canada's Brookfield snatched bargain assets amid Brazil panic SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Rampant corruption scandals and a deep recession soured many foreign investors on Brazil in recent years, but one Canadian group saw opportunity. Brookfield Asset Management Inc and its subsidiaries have made nearly a dozen major acquisitions there since 2013. The companies have spent about $10 billion on energy, infrastructure and real estate assets few others would touch due to the legal, political and economic risks involved. “A crisis is a good time to find value,” said a person close to the group, who called Brookfield a “contrarian investor.” That includes buying assets from companies entangled in the blockbuster “Car Wash” investigation, which jailed dozens of businessmen and politicians. The deals confirmed Brookfield’s reputation as one of the strongest-stomached investors in Brazil. In 2016, for example, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP led a $5.2 billion acquisition of a pipeline operator from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company at the heart of the Car Wash scandal. Recently, another Petrobras pipeline network with half the capacity fetched a top bid of around $8 billion from other investors. Bargain-hunting Brookfield gave that deal a pass. The Canadians’ savvy is built on nearly 120 years of experience in South America’s largest economy. But the recent buying spree pushed the company to new extremes of due diligence and bulletproofing, according to interviews with six people involved in the deals. The company declined to comment on investments in Brazil, which account for about 15 percent of its $286 billion portfolio and represent its biggest market after the United States. Chief Executive Bruce Flatt, whom some call the Warren Buffett of Canada for his value-investing approach, called recent Brazil acquisitions “quality businesses from sellers in need of capital” in a February letter to investors. Brookfield’s purchase of gas pipeline operator Nova Transportadora do Sudeste SA (NTS) from Petrobras was part of a controversial divestment program aimed at trimming the oil firm’s massive debt load. Critics have decried the privatizations, and Ciro Gomes, a leading leftist presidential candidate, has pledged to reverse sales of state energy assets if elected this year. Foreseeing the risk, Brookfield tasked dozens of lawyers with drafting an ironclad agreement. Brookfield has a right to compensation if Petrobras changes the contracts in a way that hurts the Canadians’ cash flow, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The head of Brazilian investment banking at a global bank, who was not involved in the NTS deal, said it was an example of Brookfield’s willingness to bet big while protecting itself. “Everyone was stunned by their $5 billion bid at the time,” the banker said. That successful deal persuaded other investors to consider bidding on the other Petrobras pipeline unit, the person added. Analysts at Saibus Research raised their target price for shares in Brookfield Infrastructure Partners after the NTS deal, citing a boost to its recurring profit margins. Shares have climbed 18 percent to more than $38 in New York since the deal was reported. Started in 1899 as the Sao Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company, Brookfield grew into a diversified global investment firm. Until 2005, it went by the name Brascan, a reflection of its roots as a Canadian investment firm in Brazil. Brookfield, too, has grappled with graft allegations in Brazil. Its homebuilding unit was among around 30 developers accused of paying bribes to building inspectors in Sao Paulo between 2010 and 2012. Former employees of the unit, which later changed its name to Tegra, confessed to paying bribes and were cooperating witnesses in the trial of the building inspectors. Brookfield said the company was not a target of the investigation and cooperated with authorities. In a separate case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened an investigation in 2012 into accusations that Brookfield’s Brazil shopping mall unit bribed Sao Paulo officials to win construction permits. The SEC dropped the case in 2015 without bringing any enforcement action. Brookfield denied wrongdoing. One of Brookfield’s toughest recent deals will test its ability to avoid fallout from another municipal graft scandal. Last year it agreed to pay $1 billion for a 70 percent stake in a sewage and water utility owned by Odebrecht SA, an engineering group ensnared in the Car Wash probe. Prosecutors accused Odebrecht of paying bribes to secure contracts with some of the 186 municipalities where the utility operates. Odebrecht, which reached a leniency deal with prosecutors, said in a statement it is cooperating with law enforcement and “has created internal controls to detect and prevent unlawful behavior.” Some 60 lawyers working for Brookfield spent eight months assessing the risks. They arranged for $100 million of the purchase price to be set aside to cover potential liabilities if city governments break off contracts or demand compensation due to alleged kickback schemes. Since subsidiary Brookfield Business Partners LP BBU_u.TO closed the deal in April 2017, none of the municipal contracts held by the company, now called BRK Ambiental, were rescinded and only one is in litigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter."
