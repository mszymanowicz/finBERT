2.795133179875046," Ofgem recommends independent body to steer Britain to net zero LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s energy market regulator Ofgem recommended on Monday that an independent body be set up to help lead the way to the government’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Ofgem said the the body should be fully separated from National Grid and run the electricity system, helping to charge millions of electric vehicles and enabling a huge increase in renewable power while maintaining secure energy supplies. Last month, the government said it would consult on reviewing the management of the country’s energy system. Ofgem, which will work closely with government in its review, estimates that an independent body with new responsibilities for running the electricity system could save consumers between 0.4-4.8 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) from 2022 to 2050. The body could design and plan new grid infrastructure and provide independent advice to the government on how best to hit its target of net zero emissions by 2050, Ofgem said. “I welcome Ofgem’s contribution to the debate over the future structure of our energy system and will consider its recommendations thoroughly,” said Kwasi Kwarteng, the government’s Business and Energy Secretary."

Britain has a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 which will require a huge increase in the amount of renewable power. “Significant periods of coal-free electricity generation and record-breaking levels of power from zero carbon sources were key factors… while record low electricity demand during the nation’s lockdown also contributed,” National Grid’s ESO (Electricity System Operator) said. Measures on homes and business to contain the novel coronavirus curbed electricity demand last year The country was powered coal-free for over 5,147 hours in 2020, compared with 3,666 hours in 2019, National Grid ESO said. In total coal provided 1.6% of Britain’s electricity in 2020, compared with around 25% five years ago. Britain plans to close coal plants by 2024 as part of efforts to reach its net zero emissions goal by 2050. The record for the highest level of wind power generation was broken several times in 2020, with wind contributing a record 60% of Britain’s electricity on August 26. Solar power also saw a new record, proving a third of the country’s electricity on several days during May, National Grid ESO said."

The company’s thermal generation unit (EDF ETG) “regularly sent misleading signals to the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO) about the capabilities of its generation plant” from September 2017 to March 2020, Ofgem monitoring had found. EDF Energy regularly inflated the minimum amount of power – known as the stable export limit (SEL) - that it said its West Burton B (WBB) plant could supply at times it did not plan to generate electricity, it added. “In many cases, this meant that the ESO had to purchase more energy from the plant than needed, when the plant was used to balance the system,” Ofgem said. EDF ETG had admitted it breached its obligations under Britain’s grid code and the Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and agreed to make a voluntary payment of 6 million pounds, Ofgem added. “Ofgem has concluded that there is no merit in opening a formal investigation,” the regulator said. “Although the breach was inadvertent, and EDF ETG considered its approach would reduce costs for the electricity system operator, we should have done better,” the company said in a statement, adding that it took the issue “extremely seriously and apologises for the error”. It had now changed its approach to ensure it fully complied with regulations. ($1 = 0.7429 pounds)"

0.5450617531291682," Britain can meet energy demand this winter, says National Grid LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will have enough electricity and gas supply to meet power demand this winter, even after the Brexit transition period ends, National Grid said on Thursday. National Grid, which operates the UK power network, expects there to be sufficient generation and capacity through Britain’s power links with Europe, called interconnectors, to meet demand throughout winter 2020/21. “We expect interconnector flows to be unaffected by the end of the EU transition period ... furthermore, even in the highly unlikely event of no interconnector flows between Britain and continental Europe, we have the tools and capabilities to ensure security of supply,” the grid operator said. The so-called de-rated margin, or surplus power margin, is forecast at 4.8 gigawatts (GW), much less than the 7.8 GW forecast last winter. The lower surplus is due to generation outages and plant closures but still within acceptable standards to ensure the system runs safely and securely and it is above levels forecast for winters 2015/16 and 2016/17. Demand for energy on the electricity system dropped by as much as 18% earlier this year after lockdown restrictions to counter the COVID-19 pandemic but has since started to recover to normal levels. Even if there is an increase in people working from home this winter, a reduction in commercial and office energy use should offset a demand rise, National Grid said. Total gas demand this winter is forecast to be 50.9 billion cubic metres, comparable with last winter levels. LNG volumes coming to Britain have increased over the past few years to 14,000 million cubic metres in 2019/20. National Grid expects volumes to be as high as that this winter as the global supply of LNG continues to exceed demand. Domestic and European gas storage levels continue to be strong and strengthen UK security of supply in the event of high gas demand this coming winter, National Grid said."

Energy demand has slumped across the world as countries shut industry and ask people to stay at home to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, making it more difficult for power grids to balance supply and demand. “To help respond to the COVID-19 crisis, EDF has been asked by the National Grid ESO (Electricity System Operator) to consider reducing output from its Sizewell B power station in Suffolk,” an EDF Energy spokesman said via email. National Grid said offering capable plants a one-off, fixed term contract was one of a number options it was exploring to help manage the system, and confirmed it was in discussions with EDF over Sizewell B. “If utilized this approach would give additional options to our control room engineers, as well as being a more cost efficient and secure outcome for consumers too,” a National Grid spokesman said via email. Industry sources said a contract requiring EDF to half output at the 1,200 megawatt Sizewell B plant for four months could cost National Grid about 50 million pounds ($62 million). Neither company would reveal financial details of a possible contract. Britain’s fleet of nuclear reactors, operated by EDF Energy, the British arm of France’s EDF, typically provide about 20% of its electricity. The Sizewell B plant is the youngest plant and uses different technology to the rest of them, meaning it is able to reduce capacity more easily. National Grid typically spends more than a billion pounds a year on services to help balance the grid and often pays constraint payments to renewable power generators such as wind farms over the summer months when demand is weak. “No one should be concerned about their electricity supply, we have comprehensive plans in place to ensure we safely and securely manage the system at all times - including through this unprecedented period,” the National Grid spokesman said."

14.503253470617523," National Grid to pay $36 million and lift natgas moratorium after NY settlement (Reuters) - National Grid Plc on Monday agreed to pay $36 million in response to an ultimatum from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and compensate natural gas customers in New York City and Long Island that were adversely impacted by a moratorium. National Grid, which will invest most of that money in new energy conservation and clean energy projects, said in a statement it will immediately lift the moratorium on signing up new gas customers for about two years. National Grid, which owns and operates electricity transmission networks in the United Kingdom, also supplies power and gas to customers in New York and New England in the United States, including about 1.8 million gas customers in New York City and Long Island. At the heart of the conflict was National Grid’s decision in May to impose a moratorium on signing up new gas customers in downstate New York and refusal to reconnect service to more than 1,100 pre-existing clients. The utility blamed New York regulators’ rejection of Williams Cos Inc’s $1 billion Northeast Supply Enhancement gas pipeline project from Pennsylvania to New York and New Jersey, which the blue-chip company was counting on to meet growing demand for gas. “National Grid will pay a significant penalty for its failure to address the supply issue, its abuse of its customers, and the adverse economic impact they have caused,” Cuomo said in a statement. National Grid agreed to settle after Cuomo sent a letter on Nov. 12, threatening to revoke the utility’s certificate to operate its gas franchise in downstate New York for allegedly failing to provide “adequate and reliable service” as required by state law. The governor, who has been pushing utilities to invest in renewable power and energy efficiency programs rather than new fossil-fired infrastructure, gave National Grid 14 days to say how it would fix supply problems. The governor has threatened to revoke other companies’ franchises before, but no utility has ever lost its New York franchise, according to state energy officials. Ratings agency Moody’s placed two of National Grid’s utilities in the United States on review for downgrade on Nov. 18, citing heightened regulatory uncertainty and saying the impact extended to other utilities operating in New York. “The threat to revoke a utility’s license represents a weakening of the consistency and predictability of New York’s utility regulatory environment,” credit rating agency Moody’s said. The ratings agency added that the letter seemed to bypass the regulatory process. National Grid, whose stock was up about 1.3% on Monday, was not the only New York City gas company to impose a moratorium on signing up new gas customers. In January, Consolidated Edison Inc blamed tight gas supplies when it announced it would impose a moratorium on new gas customers in March in parts of Westchester County, located north of New York City. Con Edison also received threats from the governor in 2018 and 2019 that he would revoke the utility’s electric franchise following power outages. It reached agreements with gas pipeline operators to increase the pressure on existing pipes so they can deliver more of the fuel. Con Edison said that should allow it to lift the Westchester moratorium once the new capacity is available around November 2023."

The utility, which runs Britain’s energy system and operates a gas franchise in New York City and Long Island, also said it expected to avoid being fined by Britain’s energy regulator over widespread outages in August. It offered the assurances after reporting higher-than-expected half-year profit. Earlier this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo threatened to strip National Grid of its licence to supply gas in the city and Long Island, saying that it had failed to provide “adequate and reliable service”. He gave the company 14 days to respond and explain why it should retain the license. National Grid said it continued to work with all parties to find a long term solution to ensure gas supplies and was confident it would be able to satisfactorily address Cuomo’s concerns. The company also ran into trouble in its home market after a blackout caused by a lightning strike left more than a million customers including homes, businesses, a hospital and Newcastle Airport without power. “We did a thorough and detailed investigation...we are not expecting the (regulator) Ofgem will fine us because everything operated as intended and in line with our license and security standards,” Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew told Reuters. National Grid shares climbed 1.2% to 902 pence by 0921 GMT, outperforming the broader index, which was down 0.4% National Grid reported its underlying profit before tax fell 4% to 785 million pounds ($1 billion) for the six months ended Sept. 30. The result came above the 748 million pound figure that analysts had expected here, with the power company citing the strength of its U.S. business. National Grid also set a new target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 for a cleaner energy future, in line with the country’s goal. It had in 2008 set an 80% reduction plan by 2050. “This objective will be supported by work in other areas, such as offering further energy efficiency programmes for our U.S. customers, proposals for renewable natural gas and hydrogen blending programmes,” Pettigrew said. The pledge follows calls from politicians, corporations and organisations around the world to tackle global warming and the disruption to climate conditions."

18.957300711222295," N.Y. governor threatens to revoke National Grid's natgas certificate (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday gave UK energy company National Grid Plc 14 days to explain why the state should not revoke the utility’s certificate to operate its gas franchise in downstate New York, saying that it had failed to provide “adequate and reliable service.” The governor, in a statement, cited National Grid’s imposition of a moratorium on new customers, failure to address supply issues and the neglect of the needs of customers. National Grid said in response that it “is in receipt of the letter ... and will review and respond accordingly within the timeframe outlined.” The company said it will “continue to work with all parties on these critical natural gas supply issues on behalf of all our customers in downstate New York.” In May, National Grid announced a moratorium on new gas customers in New York City and Long Island after New York regulators rejected a pipeline that Williams Cos Inc wants to build that will provide gas to National Grid’s downstate customers. Williams has said it hopes New York and New Jersey will ultimately approve the pipe, called Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE), which would transport about 0.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas from Pennsylvania to New York - enough to supply about 2.3 million homes. In October, National Grid said it would reconnect about 1,000 gas customers in New York City and Long Island following a state order after the utility previously refused to reinstate service, citing short supply. Those were existing customers who had their service turned off for things like renovation or construction, according to local media reports. Cuomo said National Grid has made clear that its only plan for future supply was based on the construction of Williams’ NESE pipeline. “The plan to build such a pipeline was risky at best. The pipeline required multiple regulatory approvals in both states (New York and New Jersey), faced multiple potential legal challenges and construction hurdles,” Cuomo said. The governor said National Grid could have planned to truck or barge more gas into the region to increase supplies and adopted more demand response and energy efficiency programs to reduce usage. National Grid does have a plan to truck liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas (CNG) to New York and New England to ensure customers have enough gas to heat homes and businesses on the coldest days this winter."
19.59539763279344," National Grid to truck natgas to meet winter demand in New England/New York Nov 12 (Reuters) - National Grid Plc will truck liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) to New York and New England to ensure customers have enough gas to heat homes and businesses on the coldest days this winter. The Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board last week approved National Grid’s plan to install a temporary LNG vaporization facility in Portsmouth, Rhode Island to provide gas when needed to Aquidneck Island. In January, almost 7,500 customers on Aquidneck Island lost gas supplies during a brutal freeze. Aquidneck Island is home to Newport, Portsmouth and Middletown, Rhode Island. While much of the county is awash in gas with U.S. production at record levels and growing, some gas companies in the Northeast still struggle to meet demand on the coldest winter days. Opposition to buildout of pipeline infrastructure, particularly in New York state, has prevented some areas farther north from accessing booming Appalachian supply,” Daniel Myers, market analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a report on Tuesday. In addition to trucking LNG to Rhode Island, National Grid said it plans to transport CNG to Long Island, New York to help meet demand this winter, according to a report by S&P Global Platts. The company has operated temporary LNG and CNG stations in New York and Rhode Island to provide consumers with gas on peak winter days in the past, according to the S&P Global Platts article. National Grid, which has imposed a moratorium on signing up new gas customers in New York City and Long Island, has said it hopes this is a temporary fix while it waits for long-delayed pipeline projects to enter service. Regulators in New York and New Jersey have so far rejected Williams Cos Inc’s proposed $1 billion Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) project. Williams, however, has said it hopes to overcome the states opposition and get the pipe built. National Grid, which has agreed to buy gas from Williams’ NESE project, has said it cannot sign up new gas customers until the pipe is allowed to proceed because it would not have access to enough gas to supply the new customers without the new pipe. NESE is designed to transport about 0.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas from Pennsylvania to New York - enough to supply about 2.3 million homes. National Grid serves about 1.8 million customers in New York City and Long Island."
11.791419545408404," UK regulator looks to cut costs of new Hinkley Point grid link (Reuters) - British energy market regulator said it would grant National Grid 637 million pounds ($803.38 million) to build the transmission link for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, lower than the company’s initial request for 717 million pounds. Ofgem said on Tuesday consumers will save money under its plans to reduce National Grid Electricity Transmission's (NGET) funding request to connect the new Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor to the grid. bit.ly/2piprDs The regulator’s move comes after EDF said last month that its Hinkley Point C nuclear plant could cost up to 2.9 billion pounds more than its last estimate, and face further delays. Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace its aging coal and nuclear plants due to close in the 2020s. Once complete, Hinkley C is expected to provide around 7% of the country’s electricity. EDF said Hinkley Point C was estimated to cost 21.5-22.5 billion pounds. EDF initially promised Hinkley C would be powering ovens to cook Britons’ Christmas dinners in 2017 and was originally forecast to cost 18 billion pounds. The 3.2 gigawatt plant, which EDF is building with China General Nuclear Power Corp, is now expected to begin generation at the end of 2025. Ofgem said it cut the allowed funding after rejecting 40 million pounds in “risk funding” that NGET had sought to be included in the upfront cost of the link. NGET may be in a position to seek additional funding for some risks, such as extreme weather or widespread flooding, if they are efficiently managed and take place during construction, Ofgem added. Ofgem said it had planned to use the new “Competition Proxy” funding model to fund the link, but updated analysis showed that this may no longer deliver the best savings for consumers. Ofgem plans to use its network price control framework to allow NGET to fund the investment and recoup the cost from consumers’ energy bills over 45 years. The regulator now plans to use the next network price control which takes effect from March 2021-2026 known as RIIO2. Bernstein analysts called Ofgem’s move “positive”. National Grid, which was granted permission to work on the station in 2018, said it would look to provide further evidence to Ofgem to support its view of the capital costs for the Hinkley-Seabank project, meant to allow for the safe connection of the nuclear power station. “While we welcome Ofgem’s minded-to position not to proceed with the Competition Proxy Model (CPM) for this project, we continue to question the value of the CPM,” National Grid said in a separate statement. At the time, the Hinkley-Seabank project was forecast to cost 650 million pounds. Ofgem said it would make a final decision on the allowed cost and whether to use the RIIO2 price control model following a six-week consultation period."

12.63898647545684," National Grid says it will reconnect natgas customers after NY order Oct 14 (Reuters) - National Grid Plc said on Monday it was taking steps to reconnect about 1,000 natural gas customers in New York City and Long Island following a state order after the utility previously refused to reinstate service, citing short supply. On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said National Grid is facing millions of dollars in penalties for failing to connect existing gas customers as required by law. National Grid said in May it would not process new applications for gas service in downstate New York until Williams Cos Inc’s $1 billion Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York receives the permits it needs to get built. The customers National Grid will now connect were existing customers that had their service turned off for things like renovation or construction, according to local media reports. The governor said the Public Service Commision (PSC) ordered the company to immediately connect gas service to 1,157 residential and business customers. “Our objective is to contact all customers outlined in the order by the end of this week ... Our goal is to re-connect the majority of these customers within the mid-November timeframe,” John Bruckner, president of National Grid New York, said in a statement. He said the company would expand existing conservation and energy efficiency programs to reduce energy use, which will help create additional capacity to serve these customers. “But let’s remember, while securing contingency supply solutions will help our customers in the short-term, we still need additional, long-term and firm supplies of natural gas,” Bruckner said. Environmental regulators in New York and New Jersey have denied to issue the pipeline permits in part because the pipe could harm the environment. The PSC said it will review National Grid’s reliability planning protocols since this is the start of the cold-weather period, and the pipeline the company has depended on would not have been available this winter even if it had already been approved. “We know how frustrating this situation has been for customers ... waiting to be approved for gas service,” Bruckner said. “Unfortunately, that’s not possible given the current constraints on gas supply.” National Grid is not the only gas company worried about a lack of fuel supplies in New York. Consolidated Edison Inc imposed a moratorium on new gas customers in Westchester County in March due to a lack of new pipeline infrastructure. Westchester is located north of New York City."
15.49337583266187," RPT-UPDATE 2-UK can meet winter energy demand if Brexit happens - National Grid (Repeats with new media slug, text unchanged) LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Britain will be able to meet energy demand this winter even if it leaves the European Union, but could need regular supplies of liquefied natural gas, National Grid said on Thursday. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31 but it is still unclear on what terms it will exit or indeed whether it will become the first sovereign state to depart the bloc. National Grid, which operates the UK power network, expects Britain’s power links with Europe, called interconnectors, to continue to flow but in the unlikely event they fall to zero there is sufficient surplus power to meet demand. National Grid has been under scrutiny after a power outage in August affected 1.1 million electricity customers in Britain. “We anticipate no additional adequacy or operability challenges for the coming winter as a result of the UK’s planned exit from the EU,” the grid operator said in its 2019/20 winter outlook report. “Our analysis shows ... margins that are sufficient even in a scenario with no interconnector flows between the UK and continental Europe. However, the market would need to attract regular LNG supplies to the UK,” it added. Liquefied natural gas imports into Britain quadrupled during the winter of 2018/19 to 6.6 million tonnes and peaked at 1.6 million tonnes in April, a multi-year high, as supplies from the United States and Russia inundated Europe and depressed prices. As global LNG production currently outstrips demand, National Grid said it expects to see high levels of LNG supply to Britain this winter, similar to last winter. But high LNG flows into Europe correlate with weak demand in Asia, where top LNG buyers Japan, China and South Korea are much more dependent on the liquid gas. Should there be an unusually cold winter there, fewer cargoes are expected in Europe. National Grid expects this winter’s gas demand to be slightly higher than last winter at 52.3 billion cubic metres due to higher exports to Ireland and Europe. Peak gas demand could be as high as 499 million cubic metres a day, greater than the highest recorded demand. Some 23.5% of total gas demand will be for generating electricity. The so-called de-rated margin, or surplus power margin, is forecast at 7.8 gigawatts (GW), 0.7 GW more than the forecast margin of winter 2018/19. Peak electricity demand is expected in the first half of December and the operational surplus is also forecast to be at its lowest at this time. However, the grid operator expects enough generation and interconnector imports to meet demand throughout the winter, it said."

17.731099147253293," UK power grid, train systems need review after August blackout: grid operator LONDON (Reuters) - Systems that secure Britain’s power supplies and keep trains running should be reviewed after a blackout caused by a lightning strike and unexpected power outages last month created travel chaos, the grid operator said on Tuesday. An outage lasting about an hour on the evening of Aug. 9 cut off 1.1 million electricity customers, including homes, businesses, a hospital and Newcastle Airport, as well as causing severe disruption on the rail network. A lightning strike and unexpected generation losses resulted in more than 1 gigawatt (GW) of supply going offline and a large drop in the frequency of electricity running through the grid. National Grid said in its final, technical report to the regulator Ofgem that there should be a review of the electricity grid system to ensure it was resilient as the scale of power generation loss exceeded normal protection standards. It also said internal protection systems on electric trains should be reviewed to ensure they could continue to operate through disturbances in the electricity system, such as a drop in frequency, one of the reasons some trains stopped running. “There should also be a wider industry review, including (the government), Ofgem, the ENA (Energy Networks Association) and other stakeholders to establish new and enduring communication arrangements for similar events,” National Grid said in the report, commissioned by Ofgem. Ofgem, which can impose penalties up to a maximum of 10% of the regulated companies turnover in Britain, opened its own investigation to establish whether any of the grid and network operators or generators breached their license conditions. National Grid said a lightning strike hit the transmission system late afternoon on Aug. 9, which resulted in tripping around 150 megawatts (MW) of generation. At the same time, unexpected power losses at Orsted’s Hornsea offshore wind farm and RWE Generation’s Little Barford gas-fired power station, resulted in more than 1 GW going offline and a large drop in frequency. The frequency drop resulted in a further trip of 350 MW of generation and then one of the gas turbines at Little Barton tripped, bringing the total loss of generation to almost 1.7 GW. This led to customers being automatically disconnected. Supplies were restored within 40 minutes, the report said. However, disruption to rail services extended through into Saturday morning as 30 trains stopped operating."

The report said security standards should be reviewed to see it was appropriate to take steps to improve the system’s resilience. The update was published in a final report to Ofgem by the company, explaining the circumstances surrounding a blackout that cut power and caused transport disruptions. National Grid had said in a preliminary report on Aug. 20 that a lightning strike caused the blackout and also led to the almost simultaneous loss of output from two generators."
11.4773258838449," Lightning strike caused power cut in Britain: grid operator LONDON (Reuters) - A blackout in Britain which cut power to one million customers and caused transport chaos on Aug. 9 was due to a lightning strike, the grid operator said in a report to regulator Ofgem, which said on Tuesday it would investigate the matter further. Ofgem commissioned the report into the causes of the outages from National Grid and said it would open its own investigation to establish whether any of the grid and network operators or generators breached their licence conditions. “Having now received National Grid’s interim report, we believe there are still areas where we need to use our statutory powers to investigate these outages,” said Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem’s executive director of systems and networks. “This will ensure the industry learns the relevant lessons and to clearly establish whether any firm breached their obligations to deliver secure power supplies to consumers.” Ofgem’s powers under the Electricity Act, which it will use to conduct the investigation, allow it to impose penalties up to a maximum of 10% of the regulated companies UK turnover. National Grid reported annual revenue, or turnover, of 14.9 billion pounds ($18 billion) for the year to March 31, 2019. An hour-long outage on the evening of Aug. 9 cut off one million electricity customers, including homes, businesses, one hospital and Newcastle Airport and caused disruption on the rail network. National Grid said the power cuts were the result of an unusual issue that led to the almost simultaneous loss of output from two generators - Orsted’s Hornsea off-shore windfarm and RWE’s Little Barford gas-fired plant. There were many lightning strikes that hit the electricity grid that day, but only one had a significant impact - on a transmission line at 1652 local time, which returned to normal operation after around 20 seconds, the grid’s report said. Around 500 megawatts of generation capacity was also disconnected - all of which is normal for such events. However, immediately after the lightning strike and within seconds of each other, Hornsea and Little Barford reduced supply to the grid, disconnecting 1,378 MW of generation. “As generation would not be expected to trip off or de-load in response to a lightning strike, this appears to represent an extremely rare and unexpected event,” National Grid said. “This unexpected loss of generation meant that the frequency fell very quickly and went outside the normal range of 50.5Hz – 49.5Hz,” it added. Back-up power and other tools were used but the size of the generation loss meant the frequency fell to 48.8Hz which is a level at which secondary backup systems were required to disconnect some demand to ensure the safety of the network. This, along, with additional generation, returned the system to normal by 1706 and network operators started to returned supply to customers by 1737, the report said. National Grid said it will deliver its final report to Ofgem by Sept. 6, in which it will examine the exact failure mechanisms at Little Barford and Hornsea, as well as demand side impacts and communication processes. Separately, an emergency committee will also investigate the incident, the government said last week."

Labour’s nationalisation plan has prompted infrastructure owners to warn of damage to investment, high taxpayer costs and a slower transition to green energy. The proposals have also rekindled lingering worries among investors about potential radical changes to public policy if Labour, Britain’s main opposition party, won a general election. British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing intense scrutiny over her leadership, with many calling for her departure, as she struggles to sort out how Brexit would pan out after her EU exit deal has been defeated thrice. Mounting concern over the nationalisation plan took the focus off National Grid’s largely in-line results. Shares in National Grid and peer SSE fell for a second straight session on Thursday as worries that nationalisation could be below market valuation unnerved investors. “National Grid has nearly a million shareholders who directly own shares in National Grid and that dividend is important for their income and quite often for their pensions. And similarly of course a large number of pension funds in the UK are also investors,” Pettigrew said. “The UK’s duty, if they did do nationalisation, is to pay fair value. We would expect if they looked to something less than that, there would be significant legal challenges from our investors.” He noted that not everyone in Labour believed nationalisation was the right approach, adding the company would continue to engage with the more than 100-year-old party. “WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” Britain has a mixed record on the success of privatisation since major infrastructure and services were taken out of public ownership by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her successors from the 1980s onwards. Management of Britain’s train tracks and stations was privatised in the 1990s but operator Railtrack ran into financial difficulty, blamed for a series of safety failures that led to several fatal crashes, forcing the government to return provision to public ownership. On Thursday, the government said it would renationalise the management of probation services in England and Wales five years after a heavily criticised programme of privatisation was deemed to have put members of the public at risk. Britain’s energy infrastructure, such as gas pipes and electricity cables, is owned by companies including SSE, National Grid and Iberdrola’s Scottish Power. National Grid, despite the dip in underlying operating profit, said it expected to spend nearly 5 billion pounds in the current year on capital investments, almost 500 million pounds more than in 2018/19. National Grid, one of the world’s largest investor-owned energy companies, has said Labour would cause an “enormous distraction” with its plan, which it said would delay Britain’s move to green energy. “What’s the problem that the Labour Party is trying to solve?” Pettigrew asked.

4.972949258908535," UPDATE 1-National Grid profit falls as U.S. storm costs bite (Adds details) May 16 (Reuters) - National Grid Plc, which runs Britain’s energy systems, on Thursday reported an 18% fall in its annual operating profit on costs related to storms in the United States, while it faces plans of re-nationalisation of energy utilities back home. The company’s earnings have been hurt by a string of snow storms that lashed the U.S. East Coast last year at the time when it battles regulatory changes in its home market while pushing to streamline operations and invest more. National Grid on Thursday said it expected to spend nearly 5 billion pounds in the current year in investments, nearly 500 million pounds more than in 2018/19 and forecast asset growth at the higher end of its 5-7% target range in the medium term. Compounding worries, several UK media outlets reported this week that a leaked Labour Party document showed plans to re-nationalise the country’s energy networks at a price decided by Parliament. “Looking ahead, we will continue to contribute to the important regulatory agenda in the UK and the US, to create value for shareholders, and play a central role in driving decarbonisation,” Chief Executive Officer John Pettigrew said in the earnings statement. National Grid, which has operations in New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, all of which are along the U.S. East Coast, said operating profit for the 12 months ended March 31 fell to 2.87 billion pounds ($3.69 billion) from 3.49 billion pounds a year earlier. However, on an underlying basis which exclude the storm costs, operating profit was 2% lower. U.S. operations account for over 60% of the company’s revenue, with UK revenue accounting for the rest.

-0.7367249390409465," National Grid says state ownership would delay UK's move to green energy May 15 (Reuters) - A plan by Britain’s opposition Labour party to take the country’s energy networks back into state ownership would damage investment and delay the move to greener energy sources, National Grid said on Wednesday. ""At a time when there is increased urgency to meet the challenges of climate change the last thing that is needed is the enormous distraction, cost and complexity contained in these plans,"" it said here in a statement. Multiple media outlets, including the Financial Times, earlier reported that a leaked Labour party document showed plans to re-nationalise the country’s 60-billion-pound plus energy networks at a price decided by parliament. Fears that the nationalisation would be below market value dragged shares in SSE and National Grid down by 1.4% and 0.8% respectively on Wednesday.

-1.4662696940995201," National Grid shares fall on report UK opposition Labour party plans to renationalize utility LONDON (Reuters) - National Grid shares fell more than 3 percent on Thursday after the BBC reported that Britain’s main opposition Labour party is preparing to announce plans to renationalize the utility. At 1412 GMT, the shares were down 3.1 percent at the bottom of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index and set for their worst day since the end of December. Traders attributed the drop to the report, which they said detailed that the left-wing Labour party would release a policy paper on Thursday outlining the plan to transfer the utility back to public ownership. The policy rekindled lingering worries among investors about potential radical changes to public policy if Labour won a general election. The next election is not due until 2022 and there is no guarantee that Labour would win, but the deadlock over the nation’s chaotic exit from the European Union has increased the chances of a vote this year. Among its other policies, the party has pledged to break up state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland if it got into power. In a speech on Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) director general Carolyn Fairbairn criticized proposals to renationalize parts of the UK’s infrastructure, utilities and public services. She said it would cause profound harm to the country’s economy and hurt the people they are intended to help. Reuters was not able to view the report because it had been removed from the BBC’s website. A BBC spokesman said the report was pulled after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn delayed a speech he was due to make on Thursday announcing the policy.

-7.05580850537866," No-deal Brexit wouldn't disrupt gas, power flows from Europe: UK National Grid LONDON (Reuters) - National Grid, which runs Britain’s energy systems, said on Tuesday that electricity and gas flows from continental Europe would continue as normal even under a no-deal Brexit as it has made preparations for all scenarios. “We anticipate no additional operability challenges for this summer as a result of the UK’s planned exit from the EU,” National Grid said in its Summer Outlook, covering the period from April to October. Britain imports around 5-6 percent of its electricity via interconnectors with continental Europe. “Should the UK leave the EU with no deal, cross-border trading of energy would take place outside of the (EU) single market framework, i.e. under World Trade Organisation rules for the majority of countries,” National Grid said. There are no tariffs on electricity or gas shipments between the EU and other WTO members. Nearly three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, and three days before it was supposed to leave the bloc, it remains unclear how, when or even if Brexit will take place. Britain also imports more than half of its gas via pipelines from continental Europe and Norway and through shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from countries such as Russia, the United States and Qatar. LNG is more widely available on the world market as Russia and the United States have been ramping up deliveries. National Grid said it expects higher deliveries of LNG than last summer and that it expects there will be sufficient gas supply to meet demand. It also said it would be able to meet electricity demand. It forecast gas demand during the summer period will total 36.1 billion cubic meters, almost 6 percent higher than summer gas demand in 2018, once weather related adjustments were made. Electricity demand in Britain is expected to peak at 33.7 gigawatts (GW) this summer while the minimum summer electricity demand is forecast at 17.9 GW."

The 560 million pound ($735 million) Nemo Link, a joint project between National Grid and Belgian transmission system operator Elia, is capable of transmitting a gigawatt (GW) of electricity and is one of a handful of new interconnectors being built between Britain and continental Europe to increase the UK’s power supply flexibility. “Interconnectors like Nemo Link are the perfect tool to move renewable energy from where it is produced to where it is needed most,” said John Pettigrew, chief executive of National Grid, which owns and operates much of Britain’s energy distribution network. “By connecting the UK and Belgian electricity markets, we will also ensure customers have access to different sources of generation and lower-priced electricity,” he said. Britain already runs a 2 GW interconnector with France and 1 GW connection with the Netherlands. A 1 GW link to France called IFA2 and the 1.4 GW North Sea Link to Norway are also under construction and due to begin operations as of next year. In addition a 1.4 GW cable to Denmark, the Viking Link, has been approved, National Grid said. Average UK daytime demand for electricity is about 32 gigawatts, depending on the season, and that power is primarily provided from gas-fired power stations, wind turbines and nuclear plants.

5.948992887089091," UK-Belgian power link to begin operation in early 2019 LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The first electricity power link connecting Britain and Belgium is due to start operation in the first quarter of 2019, with construction now complete, Britain’s National Grid said on Wednesday. Both countries are keen to increase their electricity supplies, with Belgium in particular needing new sources of power with five of its seven ageing nuclear reactors closed for repairs. The 600 million pound ($764 million) Nemo project is being developed by National Grid and Belgian grid operator Elia. It will enable up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity to flow between the countries, enough to power around one million homes. “Nemo Link is the UK’s first interconnector since 2012, increasing our electricity capacity from these power cables by a quarter and further enhancing security of supply for us and Belgium,” Britain’s business and energy secretary Greg Clark said in a statement issued by National Grid. The British power grid operator said it was investing more than 2 billion pounds in new interconnectors with Europe. It plans to build a 1,400 MW link between Britain and Denmark, a second link with France and another link with Norway. Britain already has power links with France, the Netherlands and Ireland, which bring in around 6 percent of its electricity. Britain’s government has warned operators of electrical power links with Europe that they will need to set up alternative trading arrangements if the country leaves the European Union next year with no exit deal."

However, Ofgem said it will set the revenue National Grid can earn from the upgrade based partly on the regulator’s experience in tendering contracts to own new transmission links to offshore wind farms. The Hinkley–Seabank (HSB) project will cost 650 million pounds ($852 million) and allow for the safe connection of EDF Energy's EDF.PA planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The project will also provide additional capability and relieve transmission constraints in the South West of England. National Grid said it will review Ofgem’s decision an consider all options before Ofgem formalizes its proposals in the grid operator’s license later this year or early in 2019. “Ofgem’s decision does not affect our commitment to delivering HSB to time and to quality as per our license obligations,” it added.

-3.308954324286481," Britain's National Grid offers tool to calculate carbon emissions by region OSLO, May 15 (Reuters) - British utility National Grid has developed a tool that can forecast the carbon intensity of electricity generation by region for up to 48 hours ahead of the power production, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. In the previous version of its tool, National grid was able to calculate only the overall carbon emissions in Britain. The new tool, developed in a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe and WWF, will help consumers understand when and where the power is “greener” in order pick the right moment of the day to consume cleaner energy, said the firm. “This tailored information can tell people in advance when’s best to turn on the washing machine, load the dishwasher or charge the car, helping everyone to use power when it’s cleanest and most likely more cost efficient,” said Duncan Burt, director of the system operator at National Grid. On Tuesday, the new forecasting tool predicted that over the next 24 hours North East England and South Scotland will be providing the greenest electricity. Britain recently clocked up over 72 consecutive hours without the need for coal-fired power, National Grid said, adding that solar energy provided more power than gas did in a day for the first time.
