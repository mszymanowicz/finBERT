16.31855138511743," UPDATE 3-Australia's Westpac sees profit rebound as economy recovers, shares surge * 1Q21 cash earnings of A$1.97 bln vs A$1.70 bln a year earlier * Result driven by reversal of bad debt charges, outlook improves * No. 3 bank sees restored mortgage growth and improved margins * Shares surge 6% to highest in a year (Updates throughout with share price reaction) SYDNEY, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp on Wednesday reported a rebound in first quarter profit, benefiting from a reversal in bad debt charges as the Australian economy and the housing market recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The strong result pushed Westpac’s shares up more than 6% to their highest level in a year. Australia’s success in containing the pandemic, supported by unprecedented amounts of monetary and fiscal support, has helped the country’s banks overcome bad debt provision charges and near-zero interest rates. Westpac’s profit for the three months to Dec. 31 stood at A$1.97 billion ($1.53 billion), 16% higher than the A$1.70 billion profit of a year earlier. Earnings were boosted by a A$501 million impairment benefit due to a better-than-expected outlook. The quarterly result from Australia’s third-largest bank was also more than double the quarterly average of A$808 million in the second half of fiscal 2020, the lender said. Core earnings at the Sydney-based bank were up 28%, driven by higher revenues and improving margins, it said, as the resurgent housing market drives a rebound in home loan sales. “The economy is recovering, consumer and business confidence is strong, and the labour market has been much more resilient than expected,” said Chief Executive Officer Peter King. “While uncertainty remains around the impact of local COVID outbreaks, there is cause for optimism.” The result was much better than analysts from Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgans Financials expected and Westpac’s shares rose more than 6% to A$23.87 against a slightly lower broader market. Westpac added, however, that the good quarter result was unlikely to be replicated through the rest of the year, because “margins remain under pressure and investment spending is likely to increase through 2021.” Westpac’s total stressed asset exposure fell 15 basis points to 1.76% in the quarter, it said, while assets on its watchlist fell to 0.8%. Westpac also announced that it would revert to providing only half-year profit updates, rather than quarterly statements, as it had only done so last year to update the market during the pandemic."

27.848108164634077," Westpac's chairman hopes bank will return to 'consistent' dividends Dec 11 (Reuters) - The chairman of Westpac Banking Corp said he hopes Australia’s No.3 bank will be able to pay more “consistent” dividends in future after payouts were affected by regulatory issues, a record fine and the COVID-19 pandemic. Many investors rely on dividends in Australia, where around 8% of the population manage their own retirement income, and banks are favoured for their consistency. “I am conscious how important dividends are to individual shareholders and know how unhappy you have been about the decision not to pay a first-half dividend as well as the lower dividend for the year,” Chairman John McFarlane told the bank’s annual shareholder meeting. While dividends at Australia’s so-called ‘Big Four’ banks have been constrained by a regulatory limit imposed in light of the pandemic, Westpac was the only one to not pay an interim dividend earlier this year. Instead of paying a final cash dividend, it chose to pay shareholders in additional shares via a dividend reinvestment scheme. Westpac has struggled with shrinking capital levels to account for a record A$1.3 billion ($979 million) fine for enabling millions of illicit payments, including to people exploiting children, large provisions for bad loans and regulatory shortcomings.

27.501657013713327," UPDATE 1-Westpac signs enforceable undertaking with regulator due to weak risk controls (Adds analyst comment, background) SYDNEY/BENGALURU, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp agreed to a court-backed undertaking with Australia’s banking regulator on Thursday to address “long-standing weaknesses” in its risk controls and poor oversight. The enforceable commitment follows two years during which Westpac failed to improve its risk governance, the regulator said, contributing to a lawsuit and fine for enabling millions of improper payments, including to people exploiting children. In a statement, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said it had concluded Westpac had “failed to deliver the expected risk governance improvements despite almost two years of remediation”. “This has undermined APRA’s confidence in Westpac’s ability to remediate these weaknesses in a timely manner.” The regulator had flagged the agreement on Tuesday, when it said Australia’s No. 3 bank had breached capital requirements and therefore would have to increase the amount of cash it keeps on hand for liquidity purposes. “We continue to observe new prudential issues arising while long-standing weaknesses persist, and we believe Westpac’s governance, culture and accountability frameworks and practices are still in need of a substantial uplift,” APRA Deputy Chair John Lonsdale said in the statement. Westpac said the agreement will force it to develop and fund a plan to remediate its shortcomings with a clear timeline, have its progress reviewed each quarter by an independent third party, and integrate the delivery of such plan into remuneration metrics for executives. The lender has 90 days to submit its plan to the regulator. Shares in Westpac were 0.6% lower. “Today’s announcement once again highlights the ongoing issues facing Westpac which is having a sustained detrimental impact on returns,” UBS analysts said in a note.

24.374167353374546," Westpac enters enforceable undertaking with regulator to address weak risk controls Dec 3 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp agreed to a court-backed undertaking with Australia’s bank regulator on Thursday to address “long-standing weaknesses” in its risk controls and oversight. On Tuesday, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) released a review saying it was forcing Westpac to raise its cash reserves after it fell short of prudential standards, its second enforcement action in a year against the country’s No. 3 lender. After that review was released, the APRA instructed Australia’s third-largest bank to add an extra 10% to the amount of cash it keeps on hand until an independent review of its risk management was completed. “Although the bank has made progress in some areas over the past year, it is not good enough,” APRA Deputy Chair John Lonsdale said in a statement. “We continue to observe new prudential issues arising while long-standing weaknesses persist, and we believe Westpac’s governance, culture and accountability frameworks and practices are still in need of a substantial uplift.” Westpac now has 90 days to submit its plan to the regulator. This year the bank has paid a record A$1.3 billion ($963.95 million) fine over a 2019 lawsuit accusing it of enabling millions of improper payments, including to people exploiting children.

24.374167353374546," Australia's Westpac sells general insurance unit to Allianz for $535 million SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp will sell its general insurance arm to German insurer Allianz for A$725 million ($535 million), it said on Wednesday, further trimming its portfolio to beef up capital and focus on local business. The transaction is the latest in a series of sales of underperforming insurance assets by the country’s Big Four banks, as lenders re-focus on local core operations, after a series of scandals ramped up regulatory scrutiny on the sector. For Allianz, the deal - which includes a 20-year distribution agreement to sell motor, travel, home contents and other insurance products to Westpac customers - will boost its presence in Australia’s general insurance market, where it is among the top five players. The price is equivalent to about eight to 12 times its earnings according to Credit Suisse and it would mean a small post-tax gain in fiscal 2021 from the sale, which Westpac says will boost its core capital by around 0.12%. “The sale is entirely consistent with Westpac’s strategy of reviewing and now exiting non-core activities,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note. Westpac shares were 0.55% lower following the announcement, broadly in line with the financial sector which was 0.65% lower. Westpac’s capital was diluted this year by large COVID-19 provisions for potential bad debts and a record fine in September for enabling millions of improper payments, including to people exploiting children. The lender had to raise capital to fund some shareholder payouts and is still seeking buyers for its other non-core businesses, including its wealth management platform and banking units in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. The sale also comes a day after the banking regulator forced Westpac to increase the amount of cash it keeps on hand for liquidity purposes until an independent review of its risk management is finished. In a separate statement, Allianz said the companies would seek regulatory approval to then “welcome Westpac’s general insurance employees after the transaction has been finalised,” which is expected in the second half of 2021."

24.833985531414704," UPDATE 2-Australia's Westpac hit with a second bank regulator penalty (Writes through, adds analyst comment, shares) SYDNEY, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Australian bank regulator said on Tuesday it was forcing Westpac Banking Corp to raise its cash reserves after it fell short of prudential standards, its second enforcement action in a year against the country’s No. 3 lender. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said a review of the bank’s risk management found it incorrectly calculated several key capital ratios through 2019 and 2020, reflecting “weaknesses in risk management and oversight, risk control frameworks and risk culture.” The breaches were since fixed, but APRA ordered the Sydney-based lender to add 10% to the amount of cash it keeps on hand until the bank completed an independent review of its risk management. Neither the regulator nor the bank put a dollar figure on the penalty. The enforcement action draws Westpac back into the kind of regulatory intervention it hoped to put behind it when it agreed in September to a record A$1.3 billion ($955 million) settlement with the country’s financial crime watchdog over a 2019 lawsuit accusing it of enabling millions of improper payments, including to people exploiting children. APRA previously ordered Westpac to put aside A$500 million over the payments scandal. Westpac had kept its available capital “comfortably above regulatory minimums” but the new penalty “sends a message to the wider banking industry that breaches of prudential standards are not acceptable” APRA Deputy Chair John Lonsdale said in a statement which did not specify the nature of the breaches. Westpac said the breaches were mainly related to its New Zealand unit. APRA had found the bank had an “immature and reactive risk culture, unclear accountabilities and inadequate oversight”, Westpac said, adding that “we ... accept the need to work faster to address our shortcomings”. Westpac shares were up 1% by midsession, against a broader market gain of 1.2%. “It’s part and parcel of getting the systems right,” said Bell Potter analyst TS Lim. “Its reputation is not as good (as other banks) but it’s a pretty small number.

27.544087997983173," Westpac expects gradual interest adjustment by RBNZ next year WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Westpac said on Tuesday eased its expectation of deeper cuts in interest rate saying it was now expecting the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to cut rates twice next year to -0.25% by August. The bank had previously forecast three cuts beginning in April, and the rates to reach -0.5% by August. The prospects of deeper interest rate cuts looked less likely after New Zealand’s central bank said last week that it would re-impose mortgage curbs and work with the government on fixing a housing bubble. “We now expect the RBNZ will choose a slower return to the inflation and employment targets, via more gradual interest rate adjustments,” Westpac Chief Economist Dominick Stephens said in a note. This less-aggressive approach to interest rate cuts and positive vaccine news will also mean a higher exchange rate, Westpac said. It is now forecasting that NZD/USD will rise to 74 cents by the middle of the year. The NZD/AUD will linger in the low-90s rather than dropping below 90 cents, it added."
27.872496045225255," Westpac hobbled by spending needs as Australian banks adjust to pandemic economy SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX lags rivals as its dated systems is forcing it to spend, rather than save, while profit margins are eroded by record-low interest rates, investors said after Australia's biggest banks issued earnings and trading updates. A sprawling organisation, aging software and convoluted procedures have been Westpac’s main enemy, investors said, leading to record fines due to breaches of anti-money laundering law and market-share losses in mortgages, its main product. That has left the 203-year old lender prioritising costly restructuring and system upgrades over lending growth. Westpac’s cheap stock makes it attractive to investors. Still, few are convinced of a quick price rise considering the central bank has cut interest rates three times to aid post-pandemic economic recovery, squeezing banks’ interest margins. “The question the market is asking itself is: is it cheap enough yet?” said portfolio manager Matthew Ryland at Greencape Capital, an investor in all of Australia’s “Big Four” banks. Westpac has over A$900 billion ($650 billion) in assets and for years was the second-largest bank by market value. Having seen its share price fall 28% since the breaches surfaced a year ago, it was passed last month by National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) NAB.AX. The bank's stock is now worth 0.89 times its book value, the second-lowest of the Big Four, showed data from Refinitiv Eikon. By comparison, the multiple for leader Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) CBA.AX is 1.7. “Westpac had a terrible year but there’s maybe some upside relative to the other banks,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, which also owns Westpac stock. At its annual earnings briefing, Westpac said it was working to recover market share in mortgages after a cautious attitude combined with inefficiency sent prospective borrowers elsewhere. New management since and a cost-focused strategy scheduled for next May has also given hope of revival, albeit gradual. “Westpac is 12 to 18 months behind peers in terms of getting a grip on its cost-out program,” said Greencape’s Ryland. Westpac declined to comment. UBS, which has a “buy” recommendation on Westpac stock, in a client note said all banks have to spend on IT, compliance and other business upgrades because of COVID-19, but Westpac’s cost challenge was bigger. The average recommendation on Westpac stock of 14 analysts is 2.5, where 2 is “buy”, 3 is “hold” and 4 is “sell”. Their top pick is NAB at 2 followed by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX at 2.1, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. CBA, widely regarded as having better cost control and IT infrastructure, is rated 3.4, reflecting its more expensive price. ($1 = 1.3845 Australian dollars)"
36.37941384505537," Australia's 'Big Four' banks pocket central bank cut, trim fixed loan rates SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s four major banks said on Wednesday they would not cut rates for a majority of their home loan customers, even after the central bank pledged to keep rates near zero for about three years, as the lenders attempt to safeguard profits. Instead, the so-called ""Big Four"" lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX, National Australia Bank NAB.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX - said they would cut interest rates for small- and medium-sized businesses and lower fixed rates for mortgage holders to record lows. By not passing the rate cut to the majority of their home loan customers, the banks are saving between 3 to 5 basis points on their net interest margins, JPMorgan analysts said, which have shrunk from more than 3% in early the 2000s to below 2% now. The Australian central bank on Tuesday cut its cash rate to 0.1% to prop up the economy from the country’s worst downturn in a generation, vowing not to raise it for at least three years. The four banks, which hold about 80% of the country’s mortgages, already have more money that they can use amid weak demand for credit. Lower rates, therefore, hurt them. CBA first announced a 100 basis point cut in its four-year fixed rate home loans for owner-occupied customers to 1.99% a year, its lowest ever, and trimmed rates for businesses. Westpac and NAB then followed suit. ANZ was the last of the four banks to announce that it would slash its fixed home loan rates across one- to five-year terms by between 0.2% and 0.4% per year. Shares of CBA and Westpac each ended 2% lower on Wednesday, underperforming the broader market .AXJO, which closed down 0.1%. NAB fell 1.1% and ANZ finished 0.9% weaker. “We are in an extraordinary period with the official cash rate at a historical low and unconventional monetary policy measures in place,” said Richard Burton, head of Westpac’s consumer division. “It is critical we carefully manage interest rate changes.” Up to 40% of the funding of Australia’s Big Four banks is rate insensitive, meaning it doesn’t benefit from rate cuts, according to JPMorgan. A number of smaller non-bank lender competitors, which fund themselves through capital markets and therefore benefit directly from the rate cuts, have passed on the full rate cuts to home loan customers."
32.42851111953486," Australia's Westpac underwrites dividend payout as cash earnings plunge SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said on Monday it would resume paying dividends as it reported a 62% plunge in cash earnings due to write-downs, lower margins and a record fine over a money-laundering case. Australia’s second-largest bank, which was the only one of the Big Four that dominate the Australian system to stop shareholder payouts earlier this year, said it would pay investors the maximum dividend allowed by the regulator in the second half. Citigroup will underwrite a dividend reinvestment scheme, where the payment, 61% lower than in 2019, will be made in shares rather than cash, safeguarding its capital but diluting shareholders who do not participate in the scheme. Westpac reported cash earnings of A$2.61 billion for the year ended Sept. 30, 62% lower than a year ago, hurt by A$3.18 billion in impairment charges taken due to a sharp increase in stressed loans and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were also hit by a record $1.3 billion fine to settle a lawsuit accusing Westpac of allowing millions of suspicious payments, including some enabling child exploiters. The settlement ended a difficult chapter for Australia’s oldest bank, which has seen it lose about a third of its value since the lawsuit was announced in November last year. The coronavirus pandemic’s damage to economic growth triggered Westpac’s decision to sell its wealth management, insurance and banking business in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Westpac, which had elected not to pay an interim dividend earlier this year, declared a 31 Australian cents-per-share final dividend, equivalent to 49% of statutory earnings for the half year, the maximum allowed by the banking regulator. Westpac expects to rectify issues with its slow credit approval processes for mortgages, which has caused the bank to lose market share to its peers. “We are addressing the issues that have impacted performance in our mortgage book and expect to see improvement start to flow in 2021,” Chief Executive Peter King said."

King took over as CEO of Australia’s second-largest bank at a tumultuous time for the lender, coming in the aftermath of a lawsuit accusing Westpac of enabling millions of payments to people exploiting children, which saw his predecessor resign. The bombshell lawsuit, which was settled in September for a record A$1.3 billion ($926.77 million), battered the lender’s reputation and led to a series of other senior management changes. “In the short time Peter has been CEO, he has made a significant contribution to Westpac, in a year of unprecedented change,” said Chairman John McFarlane, another new appointee this year. The bank has been undergoing a major overhaul, selling stakes in companies it owns, and earlier in October announcing its exit from banking operations in China and some other Asian markets to focus on its core domestic and New Zealand businesses. King, who took on the CEO role on a permanent basis in April for an agreed two years, had been slated to retire this year. ($1 = 1.4027 Australian dollars)"
28.25252112625678," Australia's Westpac flags $870.4 million hit to second-half cash earnings SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said on Monday it would take an $870 million hit to cash earnings in the second half, due mostly to write-downs in the value of its life insurance business and the additional costs of a record fine. The announcement, one week before its full-year results and dividend announcement are due, added uncertainty about the ability of the country’s second-largest bank to resume investment payouts. The A$1.22 billion ($870.4 million) hit to cash earnings also includes an increase in provisions related to customer refunds and litigation, and a write-down for capitalised software, the bank said. Credit Suisse said the separate write-downs and provisions were already expected by analysts, following the A$1.3 billion settlement announced last month for allowing illicit payments, for which the lender set a further A$415 million aside. In aggregate, however, they “may contain some ‘sticker shock’” for the market, Credit Suisse said. Westpac this year became the only one of Australia’s four major banks to slash dividend payments in the first half of the year, as it took the largest bad-debt provisions of all majors for possible losses in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. That has left it with one of the weakest capital positions of the four majors. In total, the announced charges and provisions will reduce the bank’s common equity tier 1 ratio by 24 basis points, Westpac said. About A$568 million of goodwill will be written off at Westpac Life Insurance Services and Westpac’s Auto Finance business. A further A$182 million will top up its customer remediation provision, the bank added. An A$26 million pre-tax gain on the sale of its stake in Zip Co Ltd Z1P.AX in the first half of fiscal 2021 partially offset the other write-downs, Westpac said. It will report full-year results and its dividend decision on Nov. 2."

Australia’s second-largest lender, whose capital has been eroded by a record lawsuit settlement and surge in bad-debt provisions due to the coronavirus outbreak, said the sale will add around 8 basis points to its common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The offer price for the sale is A$6.65 per share, a discount of 6.1% to Zip’s last closing price of A$7.08, and implies a deal values of about A$368 million for Westpac’s stake, based on Refinitiv data. This week, Westpac teamed up with Zip's rival Afterpay Ltd APT.AX to offer savings accounts and budgeting tools, marking a push into the buy-now-pay-later sector. The sector’s popularity has surged due to an online shopping boom triggered by the pandemic. “We are continuing to explore opportunities with Zip, including working to integrate their buy-now-pay-later functionality into our mobile banking apps across Westpac and our regional bank brands,” said Westpac Chief Information Officer Gary Thursby. Westpac said settlement of the sale, a bookbuild to institutional investors being managed and underwritten by UBS, is expected to occur on Oct. 26."

30.761735579813028," Afterpay, Westpac link up for Australia savings accounts (Reuters) - Australian buy-now-pay-later firm Afterpay Ltd will team up with Westpac Banking Corp to offer savings accounts, the two companies said on Tuesday, signalling a shift by the alternative credit firm into mainstream banking. The accounts will be available to Afterpay’s three million-plus customers in Australia from next year through Westpac’s digital banking platform, and will help give the firm greater insight into its customers’ financial habits, it said. The announcement sent Afterpay’s shares up 6% and past the A$100 mark for the first time, highlighting the staggering rise for a stock that was at just A$8 in March. For Westpac, which last month reached a record A$1.3 billion settlement with Australia’s financial crime agency for allowing illicit payments, the venture marks a push into fintech and will help it target younger customers. Afterpay will be Westpac’s first digital banking platform customer, and the Melbourne-based firm will also offer budgeting tools and other services over time. The partnership goes live in the second quarter of 2021. Afterpay and its buy-now-pay-later peers, who let users buy goods and pay over interest-free instalments, have been heralded as disruptors of traditional credit and have surged in popularity as the coronavirus crisis accelerates the shift online. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tim Piper said in a note that processing repayments through Westpac could lower costs for Afterpay, while more customer data could result in “better credit decisioning and potentially lower loss rates.” While Afterpay currently does not conduct credit checks on its customers, it says the tie-up opens the door to new revenue streams and could be adopted globally. “We will gather greater insights into how they (customers) prefer to manage their finances and better understand their savings goals,” Afterpay Chief Executive Anthony Eisen said. Rival Zip Co Ltd also on Tuesday expanded its in-store offering for users to any store that accepts Visa, widening the company’s presence."
24.884246551560725," Australia's Westpac to exit China, other Asia markets as focus swings to home SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX is exiting banking operations in China and some other Asian markets to focus on its core domestic and New Zealand businesses, as it grapples with capital constraints amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The country’s second-largest lender, whose capital has been eroded by a record lawsuit settlement and a surge in bad-debt provisions due to the pandemic, said on Wednesday it will exit operations in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Mumbai and Jakarta, where it does business with institutional clients. It will instead consolidate its international operations into branches in Singapore, London and New York. Under pressure from regulators to increase their capital bases, and from investors to show higher returns from their investments, Australian banks have been selling non-core assets, including their offshore operations. Following a failed big push to Asia under its previous CEO, Westpac's rival Australia and New Zealand Banking Corp ANZ.AX in 2016 exited operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Taiwan. The Melbourne-based bank now lends only to big corporate clients in the region. Westpac’s move is expected to impact between 150 to 200 staff, mostly based in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and will be done in stages taking between 12 to 24 months to complete, a person familiar with the bank’s plans told Reuters. With one of the weakest capital positions out of the four major banks that dominate the local industry, Westpac said the changes will not affect its cash earnings materially but will help improve capital efficiency by reducing its risk-weighted assets by over A$5 billion ($3.6 billion). “These are the actions of a bank that is capital-constrained,” said Brian Johnson, senior banking analyst at Jefferies in Sydney. “This will release capital even if it won’t have much impact on earnings.” Westpac shares fell 1.4% on Wednesday, in line with the sector which underperformed the broader market's .AXJO 0.3% loss on the day. The bank’s move comes as relations between Australia and China continue to sour, following Australia’s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus - which first emerged in China.

The ""Big Four"" banks helped the S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO close 1.5% higher. The benchmark index recorded its best weekly gain since the week ended Aug. 14. The changes remove responsible lending laws introduced in the wake of the global financial crisis that, among other things, require banks to check whether information provided by borrowers in their loan applications is correct. Calling the move a very good sign from banks’ point of view, Henry Jennings, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcustoday Financial Newsletter said, “It would enable people to get a loan quicker, speed up the paperwork, free up the credit market and hopefully stimulate some economic activity.” Jumping nearly 7%, Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX was the biggest percentage gainer among its peers with others adding between 2.8% and 6.4%. Aiding sentiment, Fitch Ratings said the A$1.3 billion ($918.19 million) record fine agreed by Westpac to settle a lawsuit by financial crime agency AUSTRAC is manageable for the Australia’s second-largest lender.

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.5% to 5,964.60 by 0105 GMT, following a 0.8% slide on Thursday. For the week, the benchmark has risen 1.7% so far, and was set for its biggest weekly gain since Aug. 14. The heavyweight financial index gained over 3% and was set for its best session since June 16, after the government announced to ease lending rules. The changes will ease the regulatory burden and reduce the cost and time faced by consumers and small businesses seeking to access credit, Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said. Westpac Banking Corp was the top gainer on the index, jumping as much as 7.3% to its highest since Sept. 8. Also, Fitch Ratings said the A$1.3 billion ($917.15 million) fine agreed by Westpac to settle a lawsuit by financial crime agency AUSTRAC is manageable for the lender. The remaining three of the “Big Four” banks gained between 3% and 5%. Sentiment was also boosted by a fall in infections in Victoria, the country’s COVID-19 hotspot, to a three-month low, improving hopes that restrictions will be eased sooner than expected.

31.591289676566912," Australia's Westpac agrees to $920 million fine over exploitation payments SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX agreed on Thursday to pay a record A$1.3 billion ($920 million) fine to settle a lawsuit accusing it of enabling millions of payments to people exploiting children, closing off its darkest chapter. Ten months after financial crime agency AUSTRAC dropped the bombshell lawsuit, the second-largest Australian lender said the parties agreed on a payout for allowing illicit payments to continue for years, plus 76,000 additional breaches discovered once legal proceedings had started. “We are committed to fixing the issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again,” Westpac Chief Executive Peter King said in a statement. AUSTRAC said the settlement showed it would do whatever was necessary to stop criminals from exploiting the Australian financial system. “Our role is to harden the financial system against serious crime and terrorism financing, and this penalty reflects the serious and systemic nature of Westpac’s non-compliance,” AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement. The payout exceeds the A$900 million Westpac said it was setting aside for the lawsuit in April, and dwarfs a A$700 million fine against larger rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX when it admitted to allowing thousands of payments between money launderers in 2018. In court documents published on Thursday, AUSTRAC said Westpac had raised the number of customers suspected of making illicit payments from 12 to 260 after widening its monitoring from the Philippines to all of Southeast Asia and Mexico. Attorney General Christian Porter called the bank’s initial settlement offer “totally inadequate” and said Thursday’s fine “more properly reflects ... acceptance of the fact that these represent some of the greatest failures of a corporate entity in Australia’s history to abide by Australian law.” The settlement comes at a fraught time for Australian banks in general, with a powerful inquiry last year accusing the industry of rampant fee-gouging and predatory sales tactics to inflate bonuses. Banks now must tread the sensitive path of getting thousands of borrowers to pay their mortgages again after offering loan holidays tied to government-ordered shutdowns to fight the pandemic. The payout will trim Westpac’s capital ratio - the money it is required to keep on hand compared with its loan book - by about 0.11% to 10.7% and could result in dividend cuts when the bank reports full-year profit in November, analysts estimate. Last month, Westpac became the only Australian bank to cancel its half-year dividend, citing rising default risks because of the virus. Westpac shares were down 1.5% in morning trading, in line with other banks, while the broader market .AXJO dipped 1% on concerns about the effect of global virus-related shutdowns. JPMorgan analysts said Westpac’s oversight gaps may have been related to “significant complexity of Westpac’s IT systems, which we think will continue to hamper its cost growth outlook... and likely requires further investment to fix”. Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said the fine resolved most of Westpac’s ongoing legal issues related to the illicit payments and “provides a lot more certainty for them going forward”. “Plus it’s hard to run a bank during COVID, so that’s one less distraction for Peter King,” Lim added.

The change in view follows a speech by RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle where he signalled the likelihood of more monetary easing.

19.898637996462888," Westpac sells vendor finance business to focus on core banking (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX on Friday agreed to sell its vendor finance business to a U.S. private equity firm, as part of its strategy to focus on core banking operations and trim its portfolio of underperforming businesses. The unit, which supports third parties to fund small-scale equipment finance loans, would be sold to Angle Finance, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, Westpac said. Westpac did not specify the deal value, but said it expects a small accounting loss on the sale and negligible impact on the bank’s balance sheet and capital ratios. The deal will result in the transfer of about A$500 million ($359.80 million) worth of Westpac’s customer loans, and is expected to be completed by the end of April 2021. In May, the Australian bank kicked off a review of its underperforming divisions including wealth platforms, superannuation and retirement products, insurance and auto finance businesses.

17.309202206352996," Australia's Westpac scraps dividend as coronavirus crisis squeezes capital SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX scrapped its interim dividend on Tuesday, becoming the first major Australian bank to officially cancel a shareholder payout amid the coronavirus crisis, knocking its share price lower. Australia’s banks have been grappling with record-low interest rates, higher default risk and loan holidays for struggling borrowers, as the country faces its first recession in nearly three decades. With many investors relying on bank dividends for their retirement income, the pressure to maintain payouts is intense, but analysts flagged Westpac’s shrinking capital levels could lead it to cancel its final payout as well. In a quarterly update on Tuesday, the country’s second largest lender said its core capital level had shrunk 1 basis point to 10.80% due to higher capital allocations to riskier exposures, a level close to the 10.50% baseline preferred by regulators. Westpac said it booked A$826 million ($596 million) in credit impairment charges during the quarter, and increased provisions to cover for bad debts, as mortgage stress was emerging, customers were being downgraded and delinquencies were increasing. “Westpac’s priority has been to remain strong so we can continue supporting customers through this challenging period,” Westpac’s CEO, Peter King said in a statement. “While there have been some signs that the economy is performing better than early expectations, significant uncertainty remains.” The bank reported third-quarter cash earnings of A$1.32 billion, above the first-half average as coronavirus-related impairment charges eased. However, net interest margin, a highly watched measure of bank profitability measure, was 8 basis points below the first-half average, hurt by record low rates. “While cancelling of the interim dividend was not a surprise the lower capital outcome will raise questions about a final dividend,” Credit Suisse analysts told investors in a note. Westpac shares fell 3.5% in morning trade to A$16.97, in a slightly firmer broader market .AXJO. Westpac also said it had contacted 85% of the 135,000 customers receiving deferral plans, and around half of them were expected to resume regular payments."

Australia’s second-largest bank said that, as a result, it would launch a multi-year programme to fix shortcomings in its management of non-financial risk that the report found to be “immature and reactive”. The report was requested by the regulator after the financial crime watchdog sued Westpac for millions of money laundering law breaches in an ongoing case. The case may go to trial next year as there are allegations Westpac disputes. “Our reassessment confirms that our management of non-financial risk is currently not at the standard we set for ourselves,” incoming Chief Executive Officer Peter King said in a statement. The report found Westpac to be “overly complex which results in confusion around accountability and challenges in execution.” The case brought last year triggered the exit of Westpac’s previous CEO and chairman in a major managerial shake-up, with Westpac just this week filling the last of its top three positions. The bank is yet to appoint new unit heads in its consumer and institutional banking divisions. The new programme announced on Friday will focus on improving risk frameworks, setting higher leadership standards and providing additional training to staff, the bank said.

1.9917071828874398," Australian regulator loses legal appeal in Westpac bank lending case SYDNEY, June 26 (Reuters) - An Australian appeals court on Friday threw out a regulator lawsuit against Westpac Banking Corp, saying the country’s second largest lender’s method for determining whether homebuyers could service their mortgages had not broken the law. The case became one of the most closely watched of numerous regulator lawsuits against leading banks after a financial misconduct inquiry in 2018 and 2019 prompted a crackdown on a sector accused of rampant fee gouging and irresponsible lending. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had lodged the appeal after a judge found in the bank’s favour last year, saying borrowers could cut back on “wagyu beef ... washed down with the finest shiraz” to make repayments. But a three-judge panel of the Federal Court found again that Westpac did nothing wrong by using an automated system rather than manually checking each applicant’s living expenses. “A consumer may choose to, and can be expected to, forgo particular living expenses in order to meet their financial obligations under a credit contract,” wrote one of the judges, Michael Lee. Another judge, Jacqueline Gleeson, wrote that Westpac had not identified a single case among the 262,000 mortgage borrowers where the person was given a loan when they should not have been. “The case concerned a large data set in which Westpac’s algorithm did not demonstrably fail to achieve the result for which it was said to have been designed,” she wrote. In a market filing on Friday, Westpac acknowledged the appeal ruling without commenting further. An ASIC representative was not immediately available for comment."

In a bombshell lawsuit in November, AUSTRAC sued the country’s second-largest bank for 23 million alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including payments between known child exploiters. After the lawsuit, the bank upgraded its systems and found additional issues including suspicious matters related to potential child exploitation and issues involving 272 customers, the bank said in a statement. Westpac said in the statement that after it reported those matters to AUSTRAC, which in its original lawsuit accused the bank of failing to monitor a dozen customers who could have been child exploiters, the watchdog was now looking into the new matters. “Westpac has now been informed by AUSTRAC that it is further investigating these matters and has notified Westpac it may amend its statement of claim to include allegations arising from these investigations,” the statement said. AUSTRAC declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so because the case is before the court. Earlier this month, Westpac said an internal investigation had concluded that child exploitation payments made through its system were the result of “faults of omission” and not intentional wrongdoing. In its defence, filed with the courts last month, the lender admitted to record keeping failures and inadequate customer due diligence, as well as breaches of certain correspondent banking obligations.

Westpac said in a statement that AUSTRAC had requested further information on matters including suspicious transactions for 272 customers previously reported.

Last November, Australian regulator AUSTRAC filed a civil lawsuit, accusing the bank of presiding over 23 million payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols, including those made by Australians to child pornography purveyors in the Philippines. The country’s second-largest bank last month admitted to charges of breaching money laundering laws, but denied accusations it enabled illegal payments between known child sex offenders. Unclear accountabilities as well as a lack of understanding and expertise caused compliance failures, the company said in a statement. The bank, which concluded its investigation into issues raised by AUSTRAC, said that the failure to correctly report international transfer of funds was due to a mix of technology and human error going back more than a decade. “Consequences that have been applied to individuals include significant remuneration impacts and disciplinary actions,” Westpac Chief Executive Officer Peter King said. “A number of relevant staff had already left the company.” The allegations from the regulator have led to a string of senior management changes at the company, including the chief executive and chairman roles. Earlier this week, the bank announced that the head of its institutional bank was retiring. A report from the advisory panel review into the charges noted that the directors could have recognised the systemic nature of the crimes the bank was facing earlier.

In its defence filing, Australia’s second largest bank admitted it had failed to correctly report various international transfers of funds as required by law, adding that it accepted the gravity of the issues raised by the regulator AUSTRAC. The Sydney-based lender has already set aside A$900 million ($580 million) for an expected fine from the case. “Westpac and AUSTRAC continue to engage constructively and are discussing a Statement of Agreed Facts and Admissions,” the lender said in the separate statement released to the media. The statement said Westpac had admitted to record keeping failures and inadequate customer due diligence, as well as breaches of certain correspondent banking obligations. Last November, the regulator AUSTRAC filed a civil lawsuit accusing the bank of presiding over 23 million payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols, including payments by Australians to child pornography purveyors in the Philippines. In the 57-page document filed with the court, Westpac denied AUSTRAC’S accusation that it failed to identify activity indicative of child exploitation risks. It said its monitoring programme complied with the law and noted that it had implemented detection systems to monitor “heightened child exploitation risks associated with low value payments” to the Philippines through its low-value money transfer product LitePay. Westpac also admits that between 2013 to 2018, it failed to report to AUSTRAC 19,428,039 international transfer reports within 10 business days, as required by law. It denies however, that it failed to carry out transaction risk assessments but admits those were not sufficient to identify reasonable risks including that banking services it provided through banks in other countries might “inadvertently or otherwise” involve or facilitate money laundering or financing of terrorism. It also admitted its risk rating systems ignored when its counterparty banks operated in jurisdictions “subject to trade or financial sanctions”, the document shows."

18.029564605597415," Westpac earnings plummet, halts dividend, flags insurance and wealth exit SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said on Monday it would not pay a dividend in June, as it posted a 70% drop in first-half cash earnings and announced a strategic review of its underperforming wealth, pension investments and insurance units. Hit by steep costs from a money laundering scandal and a surge in charges for bad loan provisions due to the coronavirus outbreak, Australia’s second-largest lender said it would postpone its decision on whether to pay an interim dividend and review its options over the course of the year. The decision, expected by analysts after a similar move by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX last month, was prudent, the bank said, but acknowledged it would hurt many shareholders who rely on its dividends as a source of income. The bank paid an interim dividend of 94 Australian cents last year and has paid one every six months for the past three decades, according to Refinitiv data. “It was a disappointing result,” Peter King, who was promoted to Chief Executive Officer in November, told analysts in a call. “We’re absolutely committed to turning around our performance ... and we are going to refocus on banking.” The Sydney-based lender said cash earnings for the six months ended March 31 fell to A$993 million ($636 million), less than a third what it earned last year, and below an average forecast from 6 analysts of A$1.22 billion. The result was largely driven by pre-announced write downs of more than $2.36 billion due to the economic deterioration expected from the pandemic, and to cover a potential fine over accusations it enabled millions of illegal payments including between known child sex offenders. On Monday, Westpac also said it would review whether underperforming businesses such as wealth platforms, retirement products, insurance, and auto finance businesses would be more successful under different ownership. The units under review, which generate about 10% of group revenue, will form a new division. The businesses “have not performed to the level of the banking businesses (and) have also absorbed a significant amount of management time,” King said. “As a result, we’ll focus where we have scale and competitive advantage, and that’s our banking businesses.” The review would provide an opportunity to “release” some A$4 billion in regulatory capital, the bank said, which analysts estimate would add about 0.99% to its core equity capital ratio. The lender is the only one of Australia’s four major banks to have retained such businesses in recent years, following a string of scandals stemming from some of those units. Westpac shares fell 1.1% in late morning trade, in line with the broader market .AXJO. On a cash earnings basis, net interest margin - a gauge of profitability - was 2.13%, marginally higher than last year. Even before the pandemic, Australian banks were grappling with record-low interest rates and were still in the midst of repaying customers millions of dollars in refunds after a government inquiry found widespread misconduct in the sector. In a bid to ensure stability of the banking system despite the looming credit losses, regulators across the world and in Australia have urged lenders to consider postponing dividends or using buffers like reinvestment plans to better manage capital."

27.2171196758779," Australia's Westpac sees over $2 billion hit to earnings amid virus SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said it would write down more than A$3.67 billion ($2.36 billion) in its first-half results, with most of the charges stemming from the economic deterioration expected from the coronavirus outbreak. Westpac is the second of Australia's Big Four banks to reveal estimates of losses related to the pandemic, taking a larger charge and a more forthright approach than its smaller peer National Australia Bank NAB.AX on Monday, analysts said. Australia’s second-largest bank said on Tuesday that it would take a pre-tax impairment charge of A$2.24 billion due to potential virus-related credit losses, equivalent to about 0.62% of gross loans, up from 0.13% in the previous half. That was on top of the A$1.43 billion after-tax impairment charge it flagged earlier, partly to cover a potential fine over accusations it enabled millions of illegal payments including between known child sex offenders. “Having materially strengthened capital over the last decade, building significant buffers, we are well positioned to absorb this increase and respond to future developments,” Westpac’s newly appointed CEO Peter King said in a statement. The statement suggests that despite the large charges, Westpac may not launch a capital raising when it announces interim results on May 4, Goldman Sachs GS.N analysts said. Investors fear capital raisings from the Big Four could be in the offing after NAB tapped investors for A$3.5 billion and slashed its dividend to the lowest in almost three decades. Westpac shares rose 1.36%, partially reversing previous day's heavy losses, in a market .AXJO that was slightly lower. Australian banks, counting the cost of years of financial misconduct through fines and refunds, are now bracing for a surge in bad debts as customers seek loan and payment deferrals amid an economic downturn triggered by measures to contain the virus, which has killed 84 people in the country. The world’s No.12 economy is expected to plunge into its first recession in 30 years due to the health crisis, and the government has committed A$320 billion, or about 16% of GDP, in relief funding, Australia’s biggest emergency package ever. Two of the country's Big Four lenders have so far detailed a hit to upcoming earnings, with No. 3 lender National Australia Bank NAB.AX making an A$1.22 billion provision in late-April, equivalent to about 0.38% of gross loans. ""Investors will rightly query whether NAB has taken sufficient provisions,"" Citigroup C.N analysts said in a note. Westpac said its virus-related impairments were based on a number of assumptions, such as lower expected economic growth, higher unemployment and an expected fall in both residential and commercial property prices, without elaborating. It also includes an assessment of additional stress that could emerge in various industries as a result of the outbreak. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX is due to report interim results over the next fortnight. Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, which has a different financial calendar, reported slightly lower interim earnings in February."
27.2171196758779," Westpac forecasts negative interest rates for NZ later this year WELLINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - Westpac said on Tuesday that negative interest rates would be a natural next step for New Zealand’s central bank as it responds to the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. The lender said in a note that Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) would lower the official cash rate (OCR) by 75 basis points to -0.5% in November this year. “We expect that the RBNZ will signal either its intent or its willingness to move to a negative OCR at the August monetary policy statement,” Chief Economist Dominick Stephens said in the note. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has already cut rates by 75 basis points to 0.25% in March, and pledged to keep it at that level for at least 12 months. It also launched a quantitative easing programme in which it bought NZ$33 billion ($19.79 billion) worth of government and local government bonds. But the massive stimulus currently being delivered to the economy would not be enough, Stephens said in the note. “We think more will be required later this year, and a negative OCR would be a natural next step,” he said. Inflation would drop well below 1% unless the Reserve Bank and Government act vigorously to stimulate the economy, Stephens warned. Speaking to parliamentarians earlier this month, RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr did not rule out negative interest rates. The New Zealand dollar was down 0.8% to $0.5966 as talk of further policy easing pushed bond yields to record lows. Stephens also forecasted that RBNZ would almost double its quantitative easing programme to NZ$60 billion at the monetary policy meeting on May 13. “We estimate that total government debt will be over $130 billion by June next year, so the Reserve Bank will be on track to own about 45% of the New Zealand Government Bonds on issue.” New Zealand eased strict lockdown measures on Tuesday that saw an additional 400,000 people return to work and some businesses opening after weeks of lockdown.

20.250715541356662," UPDATE 2-Australia's Westpac puts $578 mln price on exploitation scandal (Recasts throughout) SYDNEY, April 14 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp said it expects a A$900 million ($578 million) fine over accusations it enabled millions of illegal payments including between known child sex offenders, the first time it has put a price on the scandal. The country’s second-largest lender gave the estimate on Tuesday as part of a broader update about one-off charges it expects will eat into half-yearly profit which it plans to report next month. Though Westpac has publicly taken responsibility for payments at the heart of a lawsuit by the financial crime watchdog, the dollar figure gives a sense of the scale of the impact of one of its darkest chapters. Last November, the regulator AUSTRAC filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Sydney-based bank of presiding over 23 million payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols, including payments by Australians to child pornography purveyors in the Philippines. The lawsuit saw the bank’s CEO leave and its chairman bringing forward his retirement but the lawsuit has continued, leaving investors unsure of the cost to the bank which is - like its rivals - already setting aside money to reimburse customers for wrongly charged fees. When it reports profit for the six months to end-March, the bank said it expects to make a provision of A$900 million “for its potential liability in relation to the AUSTRAC claim”. The actual fine imposed by the court “may be materially higher or lower than the provision”, it added. Analysts had forecast a fine of about A$1 billion. On top of the penalty provision, the bank said it expected to report one-off costs totalling A$130 million to improve its financial crime programme, support industry initiatives on financial crime monitoring, and support organisations fighting child exploitation. “In addition to closing relevant products and recruiting an additional 200 people in financial crime and compliance, I am putting in place a clearer accountability regime that will speed up decision making, improve implementation and more clearly define responsibility and its associated risk management,” said CEO Peter King in the update. King, formerly the bank’s chief financial officer, was formally promoted to CEO earlier this month. The cost of the AUSTRAC lawsuit comes as banks around the world cope with shrinking asset values and the prospect of higher loan impairments as the new coronavirus shuts down economies. The virus has so far infected about 6,400 Australians and led to 61 deaths. The Australian bank regulator has asked lenders to consider postponing dividends to ensure they remain stable during the crisis. Westpac said it will factor in a likely decline in half-year profit when calculating its interim dividend, but it would give a final decision at its results announcement. The bank gave a host of smaller provisions it would likely make with the half-year result, including a A$70 million decline in asset values due to the coronavirus and A$260 million to reimburse customers who were wrongly charged fees. All up, it expected provisions of around A$1.43 billion. Westpac announces results for the six months to end-March on May 4. ($1 = 1.5564 Australian dollars)"

King, Westpac’s former chief financial officer, has been acting CEO since his predecessor left late last year following allegations the bank facilitated millions of breaches of anti-money laundering laws including enabling payments to known child exploiters. Australia’s second largest lender had carried out a global search for a permanent CEO but chairman John McFarlane said the company had determined that management stability was vital in times of economic stress and uncertainty. McFarlane said given the level of uncertainty triggered by the coronavirus pandemic “it is difficult to make a reasonable assessment of its potential impact at the moment, we expect to see a rise in our credit provisioning this year and probably beyond”. A two-year contract is unusual for a new CEO signing on to lead one of Australia’s biggest companies. King had announced his retirement just two months before the money-laundering bombshell dropped in November, and agreed to delay that retirement plan to take up the CEO reins. King will lead the bank at a time when economies and financial markets around the world convulse from sweeping shutdowns, including in Australia, intended to slow the spread of a new coronavirus that has killed nearly 50,000 people. In Australia, about 5,100 have been infected and 23 people have died. The Australian central bank has enacted extraordinary measures to prop up the economy including quantitative easing and buying bonds, and lenders like Westpac have slashed loan rates and frozen repayments to soften the blow of a recession that most economists say is inevitable. Easing the burden on businesses faces, however, brings with it rising loan losses, and given the uncertain timeline of the crisis, for an untold period of time. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged A$320 billion in fiscal support, more than 15% of annual economic output, in a bid to keep the economy running. King said in a statement that Westpac would focus on responding to the coronavirus crisis. “We have a critical role to play alongside government and regulators in supporting Australians and New Zealanders and our countries’ financial systems,” he said. McFarlane said the company’s CEO and executive short-term bonuses for 2020 would be canceled due to the alleged breach of anti-money laundering laws.

-20.94549836114564," Australia's Westpac and ANZ served junk insurance class action lawsuit Feb 28 (Reuters) - A class action lawsuit has been filed against Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group on Friday over the sale of “junk insurance” to consumers. The class action filed by law firm Slater and Gordon relates to consumer credit insurance and alleges that Australia’s second and fourth largest banks misled consumers when adding these products to credit cards and personal loans. Consumer credit insurance protects a consumer’s capacity to meet payments on loans and other credit in the event something were to affect their ability to do so. Westpac will defend itself against the claims made in the class action, it said in a statement on Friday. ANZ did not immediately respond outside regular business hours. “Many people who were sold the insurance had disabilities, were unemployed, or were critically ill, and therefore not eligible to claim on the policies,” Andrew Paull, Slater and Gordon’s practice group leader said in a statement. “Others were led to believe the insurance they bought was free, or mandatory. Neither was the case,” he added. Westpac added that it does not sell these type of insurance products anymore. National Australia Bank, the country’s third largest lender, reached a A$49.5 million ($32.65 million) settlement last November for a similar lawsuit over the sale of worthless insurance policies to customers for their credit cards."
-42.06209163906636," Australia's Westpac flags earnings downgrades after lawsuit, bushfires SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said on Wednesday its 2020 profit would be hit by a rise in costs related to improving risk management systems in the wake of a money-laundering scandal and the country's deadly bushfires. Westpac, which previously expected a 1% increase in costs for the year, said those projections would likely increase due to better risk management practices in response to regulatory pressure in the aftermath of accusations including the facilitation of offshore payments relating to child exploitation. “Westpac remains committed to materially lifting its approach to risk management. As a result, we are identifying further issues to address,” the Sydney-based bank said in a limited capital update. The country’s No. 2 bank said since AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial crime watchdog, sued it for 23 million alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws in November “the number of regulatory investigations and reviews into the Group’s businesses has risen”. The bank was now prioritizing the screening and reporting of transactions indicative of child exploitation to AUSTRAC within 24 hours, and expected to develop and fund a A$30 million “impact framework” program to “address child safety and human rights” the statement said. “The Group expects to incur additional expenses in FY20 associated with this work and will need to reconsider its current cost growth expectations.” Westpac also pegged insurance claims for calamities, including the bushfires and hailstorms earlier this year, at A$140 million before taxes ($93.60 million) and said bushfire relief for customers would cost it an additional A$26 million, which would be booked in the second half of fiscal 2020. “Bushfires, storms and coronavirus are expected to have an economic impact which may ultimately affect banking activity and growth,” the bank said in a limited trading update. Devastating wildfires in Australia and the coronavirus outbreak threaten growth prospects, including that of China, Australia’s largest trading partner. Westpac’s revised cost projections would be unveiled when it reports its half-year results in May, it said. On top of the challenges facing the country’s banks, such as low interest rates and increased regulatory scrutiny following a scathing misconduct inquiry into the sector, Westpac is also facing a potentially massive fine related to the money-laundering scandal. The country’s top financial regulators, the Australian Securities and Investments Commissions (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) were both conducting its own investigations into the matter, the lender said. As of the end of 2019, Westpac’s common equity tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8%, only 1 basis point higher than what it was on Sept. 30, as it was dragged down by a A$500 million in extra capital required by the banking regulator due to AUSTRAC’s claims. Besides a civil penalty, the bank also expects higher litigation and regulatory investigation expenses in the year, it said. ($1 = 1.4957 Australian dollars)"

Bernstein said in a statement the class action was filed on behalf of investors who bought Westpac’s securities between Nov. 11, 2015 and Nov. 19, 2019. The law firm accused the lender of not carrying out appropriate due diligence on transactions in Southeast Asia and the Philippines, and failing to monitor terrorism financing risks with movement of money into and out of Australia among others.

-43.26530243419106," Australia's Westpac hires 'Mack the knife' McFarlane to chair crisis-hit bank SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX named a former Barclays BARC.L boss as chairman on Thursday, entrusting veteran banker John McFarlane with the task of steering it through the country's biggest money-laundering scandal. The bank, Australia’s second largest by market capitalization, said the 72-year-old would become a non executive director in February before taking the chairman’s role in April. McFarlane stepped down as chairman of Barclays in May after four years. Previously he had chaired British insurer Aviva AV.L which followed nine years as chief executive (CEO) of Westpac rival Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX (ANZ). Scottish-born McFarlane takes over just two months after Westpac’s top two executives stepped down following charges by the regulator for breaching of anti-money laundering laws which potentially facilitated child exploitation. Westpac’s current troubles are part of wider ructions in the Australian banking industry. Two of the top four banks that dominate the domestic market have lost their leaders in the wake of damaging revelations from a government-backed inquiry into misconduct in the industry. McFarlane’s appointment, however, failed to boost the bank’s shares on Thursday as investors said the prospect of a huge fine - estimated by analysts to be up to A$1 billion - for the anti-money laundering breaches continued to weigh on the bank’s earnings prospects. Westpac shares closed at $A25.08, down 0.24% while the broader benchmark S&P/ASX200 .AXJO lost 0.6%. “I was surprised to see the stock was down. I thought there would have been a better reaction,” said Matt Haupt, portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which owns Westpac shares. “I think some investors are still worried about the size of the fine and what will come out of the Austrac investigations.” ‘MACK THE KNIFE’ Westpac’s chief financial officer Peter King, who had flagged his retirement, is currently serving as Westpac’s interim chief executive. McFarlane has been a hands-on chairman in previous roles, sparking speculation he may not rush to appoint a new permanent CEO. “He will shake up the executive ranks, and he won’t hurry in appointing a CEO, he will back his own ability to be an executive chairman,” said Matthew Wilson, banking analyst at Evans and Partners. In Britain McFarlane was nicknamed “Mack the knife” during his chairmanship of Aviva and then Barclays. In both, he acted as executive chairman for some time. In a statement earlier on Thursday, McFarlane said that the appointment of a “world-class” CEO could “take time”. Vas Kolesnikoff, Australian head of governance adviser ISS, said Westpac needed to ensure there was a distinction between the chairman and the executive, with the search for a permanent chief executive underway. “You need to have somebody who is running the bank and you need to have a board that is sufficiently independent to oversee management and addressing all the issues,” Kolesnikoff said. Martin Lawrence, governance analyst at Ownership Matters, a proxy advisory firm, said McFarlane came with a reputation for “drastic change”. “If there needs to be hard decisions made, I don’t think he is going to be afraid to make them,” he said. Former Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer left the bank after the money-laundering scandal was revealed while chairman Lindsay Maxsted also accelerated his departure from the bank’s board. At last month’s annual meeting, the lender’s shareholders voted down executive pay for a second year due to investor outrage over the scandal.. Westpac gave no details on Thursday of McFarlane’s remuneration."

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) filed a lawsuit last year alleging that country’s second largest lender was liable for one of its financial planners’ failure to act in the best interests of customers.

-36.87985060699302," Australian regulator investigates Westpac directors, executives after scandal SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking regulator will use its increased investigative powers for the first time to examine whether Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX directors and executives broke the law as part of the bank's money laundering scandal. Westpac will be required to hold an extra A$500 million ($339 million) in capital after the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) announced an investigation into the bank’s alleged money laundering breaches. Westpac shares were down 1.2% in early afternoon trade on Tuesday, while the broader ASX200 was 0.1% higher. Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said that while the APRA capital changes could be absorbed by the bank, the investigation would be a further distraction for its executive team. “The bigger issue is that Westpac will be reviewing the risk practice at the same time that the bank is going to be transitioning to a new chief executive,” he said. In a research note to clients, Macquarie analyst Victor German said Westpac’s increased “compliance and regulatory expenses will continue to weigh on earnings in the short to medium term” as the bank worked through the AUSTRAC claims. APRA said in a statement the lender would now need the extra capital to “reflect the heightened operational risk profile of the bank”. It is the first time APRA has carried out a formal investigation using the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) legislation which came into effect in July last year. Under the laws, APRA has the powers to directly disqualify directors and executives itself rather than pursue people through the Australian court system. APRA will investigate whether Westpac’s directors or staff gave false or misleading information to auditors, a charge that carries up to five years jail. Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted, who will retire early as a result of the allegations, said the bank “accepted the gravity” of the AUSTRAC claims and would co-operate with the APRA investigation. “As previously stated, these shortcomings are unacceptable and we are determined to urgently fix these issues and lift our standards,” Maxsted said in a statement to the ASX. Westpac in June was ordered by APRA to hold an extra A$500 million following a self-assessment program which found it needed to toughen its oversight of “non-financial risk”. Australia’s second-largest bank by market capitalization was accused by AUSTRAC, the financial crimes agency, last month of breaching anti-money laundering laws up to 23 million times between 2013 and 2019.. The investigation could take up to two years, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. “AUSTRAC’s statement of claim in relation to Westpac contains serious allegations that question the prudential standing of Australia’s second-largest bank,” APRA Deputy Chairman John Lonsdale said in the statement. “While Westpac is financially sound, there are potentially substantial gaps in risk governance that need to be closed.”"

-35.61064550126143," Shareholders lash Australia's Westpac over money laundering bombshell SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp on Thursday became the biggest Australian company to have shareholders vote down its executive pay for a second year, at a marathon annual meeting dominated by investor outrage over a child exploitation payments scandal. The “second strike” delivers a symbolic blow to the country’s oldest bank and fifth-largest listed company as it seeks to reassure owners and customers it can find reasons and solutions for its deepest crisis in decades. It also puts a cloud over the annual meetings next week of rivals Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), with investors expecting details of NAB’s engagement with regulators as it has also flagged weakness in money-laundering controls. “We are shattered by what has happened,” Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted told about 600 investors at an emotional six-hour meeting in Sydney. “It’s a total anathema to what we stand for,” added Maxsted, who brought forward his retirement in light of the scandal. Westpac was sued three weeks ago by Australian regulators who cited 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, in the country’s biggest ever such scandal. Westpac has said it accepts most of the regulator’s assertions - which included the facilitation of payments to child exploiters - and its chief executive and compliance head have quit. The bombshell lawsuit, coming as the country was still digesting a damaging financial misconduct inquiry, has sent Westpac’s shares down 9.3% in the three weeks since it was announced, wiping A$8.8 billion off its market value. The bank could pay a fine of more than A$1 billion ($678.60 million), analysts have said. The stock closed down another 1.2% on Thursday, while the broader Australian market was down 0.7%. “All of us are members and owners of a company that, even at the best, you could say accidentally allowed child abuse to go on for five years,” said Chris Schott, a former Australian senator, at the meeting in his capacity as a shareholder. “It’s inconceivable someone didn’t have the wit to think something was wrong,” added Schott, who told the meeting he voted for the establishment of AUSTRAC while in office. Several Westpac directors narrowly survived protest votes against their re-election but shareholders voted down the company’s executive pay plans for a second year running. Under Australian law, a second vote against executive pay triggers a separate vote on whether to remove the whole board. Just 9% of investors voted for the “board spill” motion, though, due to support from large institutional shareholders, sparing the company further humiliation and upheaval at the top. “We acknowledge we should have implemented more robust transaction monitoring earlier than we did. This would have generated more suspicious matter reports to AUSTRAC,” Maxsted said earlier in prepared remarks. He said the company would withhold all or part of its executive bonuses for 2019, subject to an assessment of accountability for the transactions at the heart of the AUSTRAC lawsuit. Asked at the meeting whether the board would indeed forego fees this year, Maxsted said “we will act in the best interests of the company.” That drew a barrage of “just go” responses from a number of shareholders, with another later shouting, “You’re asleep at the wheel, mate”. Maxsted was also asked whether the board could guarantee the bank’s interim dividend would not be reduced. “I can say when we reset the dividend we felt that in relation to how much more difficult the environment is for banking then the payout ratio was too high,” he said. “We have been trying to preserve that ... but the decision was taken because of the impact on profitability.” The biggest vote against a director was in relation to Peter Marriott, a former finance chief of ANZ who has been on the board since 2013 when the payments at the center of the scandal began. He was re-elected with just 58% of the vote, below the near-unanimous support large company directors typically receive. “All of us continue to reel from the devastating events over the past few weeks. These events are unprecedented as are the headwinds facing the financial services sector in the past few years,” Marriott said."

The S&P/ASX 200 index was down 0.6%, or 39.70 points, at 6,712.90, as of 0104 GMT. The benchmark closed 0.7% firmer on Wednesday. Westpac, the country’s oldest and second-largest bank, said it would implement additional transaction monitoring as it seeks to hold back an avalanche of outrage over a scandal that includes accusations of enabling child exploitation payments. The bombshell lawsuit, as the country was still digesting a damaging financial misconduct inquiry, has sent Westpac’s shares down 9% in the three weeks since it was announced, wiping about A$8.6 billion ($5.84 billion) off its market value. The financial sub-index declined 0.8%, with the rest of the “Big Four” banks down between 0.7% and 1.2%. “They (investors) don’t like to be reminded of the headwinds that banks face,” said Henry Jennings, senior analyst and portfolio manager, Marcustoday. “It just reminds people that banking is not what it used to be in terms of the compliance and regulatory framework which now needs to be adhered to, as it is more expensive and does weigh on profits.” Investors were cautious despite the U.S. Federal Reserve signalling that borrowing costs will not change anytime soon, as the economic outlook of the world’s top economy remains “favourable”. Energy units retreated 0.6% as a surprise climb in U.S. crude inventories hit oil prices and raised concerns over global demand outlook. Sector heavyweight Woodside Petroleum Ltd fell 0.3%, while peer Oil Search Ltd dropped 0.8%. Oil and gas explorer FAR Ltd plunged up to 28% to its lowest in more than five years as it announced the completion of a A$146 million placement to fund development of a Senegal oil field project. Tech stocks declined 1.5%, with software developers Xero Ltd and WiseTech Global Ltd falling 1.9% and 3.1%, respectively. Lynas Corp, the world’s only major rare earths producer outside China, jumped 9.3% and was the top gainer in the ASX benchmark after Reuters reported that the U.S. Army plans to fund construction of rare earths processing facilities in the United States.

-25.030233897682653," Australia Westpac's board set to survive investor anger over payments scandal SYDNEY, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp, grappling with a money-laundering scandal and accusations of enabling child exploitation payments, could see angry investors vote on Thursday against its proposals on executive pay and the re-election of a long-serving director. But Australia’s oldest and second-largest bank is unlikely to see its board ousted at the annual shareholders’ meeting as institutional investors are not in favour of such a move, investors and analysts said. Westpac was sued by Australian regulators three weeks ago, who cited 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, in the country’s biggest ever such scandal. Westpac has said it accepts most of the regulator’s assertions, and its chairman, CEO and compliance chief have subsequently quit. The bombshell lawsuit, as the country was still digesting a damaging financial misconduct inquiry, has sent Westpac’s shares down 8% in the three weeks since it was announced, wiping A$7.7 billion off its market value. The bank could pay a fine of more than A$1 billion, analysts have said. “It will be a long meeting with many shareholders venting their anger,” said Carol Limmer, who monitors Westpac for retail investor lobby group Australian Shareholders Association, which plans to vote against the bank’s executive pay. “Some shareholders would be concerned at the impact on the share price and also future dividends. Some would be horrified at the child exploitation aspect,” Limmer added in an email. A vote against the pay proposals for top executives on Thursday would make Westpac the biggest Australian company where such proposals have been rejected for two years in a row. Under Australian law, if more than a quarter of shareholders vote against a company’s executive pay at back-to-back annual meetings, they may hold another vote at the meeting to remove the whole board. That “board spill” motion requires support from 50%. Fund managers say more than a quarter of shareholders may vote against Westpac’s executive pay because of grassroots outrage over the payments scandal, but institutional investors will use their muscle to prevent a board spill. Australia’s big banks are mostly owned by large institutions, with individual shareholders making up a small portion of their overall share register. Proxy adviser CGI Glass Lewis has said it will support the executive pay proposals while media reports said rival proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is recommending a vote against the proposals. ISS did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Some investors and groups, including the Shareholders Association and several pension funds, have said they will vote against the re-election of Peter Marriott, who has been on the Westpac board since 2013. Westpac declined to comment ahead of the annual meeting. (Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"

The chairman, CEO and compliance chief of Australia’s oldest and second-largest bank have quit since the bombshell disclosure three weeks ago. Investors will likely call for more scalps at Thursday’s AGM as the company braces for a fine most analysts expect will top A$1 billion ($680 million). The company also faces a possible vote against its executive pay for a second year under Australia’s “two strike” rule. If more than a quarter of shareholders vote against a company’s executive pay twice, they can vote to remove the entire board. AUSTRAC, the financial crime watchdog, has accused Westpac of 23 million money laundering breaches, including payments to suspected child exploiters in the Philippines. That has taken off 8% from the company’s shareprice, or A$8 billion of market value. Many in Australia were already hostile to the finance sector after a public inquiry during the past year revealed widespread misconduct. “There’s a lot of anger from, particularly, retail shareholders, and I think the angry retail shareholders will deliver out to the board with a strike,” said fund manager Geoff Wilson, whose company, Wilson Asset Management, holds Westpac shares. Wilson added his company had not finalised voting plans for the AGM but he would not support removing the whole board. Though shareholders can call a “board spill” vote if more than 25% vote against executive pay for two years running, the vote to remove the board requires 50%, so grassroots campaigns routinely achieve a second strike but no spill. Amid the negative headlines of 2018, Westpac was one of four financial giants to get more than a quarter vote against its executive pay that year, alongside wealth manager AMP Ltd AMP.AX, National Australia Bank Ltd NAB.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX. AMP avoided a second strike in 2019. ANZ and NAB have AGMs on Dec. 17 and 18. Some pension funds and proxy advisers said they would oppose the re-election of Peter Marriott, a former ANZ chief financial officer who has been on the Westpac board since 2013. “He should be held to account for what’s occurred in the time that he’s been a director,” said Bill Watson, CEO of First Super, which holds Westpac shares.

-8.086904183611328," Scandal-hit Westpac to refund some buyers of new shares SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX offered to refund people who bought new shares weeks before a lawsuit accusing it of millions of breaches of money laundering laws, a move some investors said was to fend off criticism about its transparency. The country’s oldest and second-largest bank has been in crisis since the financial crime watchdog, AUSTRAC, last week accused it of enabling 23 million payments in violation of anti-money laundering laws, including between known child exploiters. The scandal has already seen out the bank’s CEO, chairman and head of its compliance committee, and large investors and their proxies have called for more heads to roll at Westpac’s annual general meeting on Dec. 12. On Thursday, the lender said it would pay back retail shareholders who bought A$500 million ($340 million) of new stock two weeks earlier, giving no reason for the move other than to say it came after talks with corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). “Following discussions with ASIC, Westpac will provide a withdrawal option for (investors) who applied for shares under the Share Purchase Plan prior to the AUSTRAC announcement on 20 November 2019,” the bank said in a statement. A Westpac spokesman did not return a Reuters call seeking further detail. Investors said the move suggested an effort by the bank to tamp down complaints about its disclosures in the lead-up to the money laundering announcement, including when it asked investors to buy more shares in early November. It also raised A$2 billion from institutional investors, who were excluded from the refund. “It seems to me like they might be trying to get ahead of a class action,” said Rod Bristow, CEO of Clime Asset Management, which holds Westpac shares and participated in the capital raising. ASIC has said it is investigating Westpac, while a law firm has said it is preparing to file a class action lawsuit against the bank accusing it of falling short of its continuous disclosure obligations. An ASIC spokesman declined to comment further. White Funds Management Managing Director Angus Gluskie said Westpac had made disclosures about AUSTRAC’s investigations in its past two annual reports and the refund appeared to be designed to acknowledge that retail investors might have missed the mention in Westpac’s most recent 312-page annual report. “I don’t think any of us like the situation but I can see here that they have made quite a disclosure within their reporting,” said Gluskie, whose company also bought new Westpac shares in the raising. “I would only be concerned if they had additional information that they were aware of that they should have disclosed to us that they hadn’t, or if they had tried to dress it down or paint it in a light that misrepresents the situation,” he added. Westpac said it hired IBM's IBM.N financial consulting unit, Promontory, to run an external review of its financial crime prevention processes. Promontory's local boss, Jeff Carmichael, is a former chairman of banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. “Governments and financial institutions all around the world are grappling with the complexities associated with both monitoring and managing the reporting of suspicious activity given the huge volumes of transactions taking place every day,” Carmichael said in a statement issued by Westpac. Westpac shares closed down 0.4% on Thursday, having lost a total of 7% of their value since the AUSTRAC announcement, or A$6.6 billion in market value."

-6.178764598971661," Australia central bank seen cutting rates twice, introducing QE in 2020: Westpac SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s central bank is likely to cut interest rates twice next year, taking the cash rate to 0.25% by June 2020, and then introduce quantitative easing (QE), Westpac Banking Corp said on Wednesday in a change to its house forecasts. Westpac’s previous forecast was for the policy rate to fall to 0.5%. The cash rate is currently at a record low of 0.75% after three cuts of 25 basis points since June this year. The revised outlook followed a speech by Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe on Tuesday, in which he said he did not expect to have to use QE in Australia, but that it could happen if the cash rate was cut to 0.25%. “The RBA has indicated it is prepared to push the cash rate to 0.25%,” Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said in a report. “Westpac has always argued that monetary easing will be necessary in 2020 but assessed that the RBA would see 0.5% as the effective lower bound.” The Australian dollar eased in afternoon trade to around $0.6770, just above its lows for November. The currency had been on the defensive through the day after markets factored the potential for an extra rate cut. On Tuesday, Lowe outlined a limited range of options for QE, ruling out buying private assets and saying negative interest rates were extraordinarily unlikely. “There may come a point where QE could help promote our collective welfare, but we are not at that point and I don’t expect us to get there,” Lowe told an economists’ dinner. Evans said he expected the RBA would hold its second cut until June 2020 so that it could see the government’s annual budget, which is delivered in May, and to benefit from market expectations of its commitment to ease for as long as possible. That expectation of a second cut meant Westpac had pushed back the timing for the introduction of QE to the second half of 2020, and Evans noted the high hurdles Lowe had set to use it. “However, we expect that with the unemployment rate stuck at around 5.6%, the U.S. Federal Reserve easing rates and no further interest rate flexibility available, Quantitative Easing will surely become an attractive option,” he said."

The campaign suggested efforts by Westpac to curtail outrage over a lawsuit accusing it of enabling 23 million payments in breach of money laundering laws, including between known child exploiters, have fallen short. The country’s oldest bank holds its annual meeting on Dec. 12, and has already said the chairman of its risk and compliance committee, Ewen Crouch, will not seek re-election after the lawsuit from financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC last week. Proxy adviser CGI Glass Lewis said it would also recommend shareholders vote against director Peter Marriott, a former chief financial officer of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX, as he had been on the board since 2013 when the payments at the centre of the scandal began. “Due to the length of his tenure and his banking background ... his accountability for these matters should be enforced (and) his re-election should not be supported,” CGI Glass Lewis said in a note reviewed by Reuters. Another proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), said it recommended voting against Marriott and another Westpac director, Nerida Caesar, on the grounds that Caesar was also on the bank’s risk and compliance committee, according to the Australian Financial Review. Marriott and Caesar were not immediately available to respond to Reuters requests for comment. U.S.-born Chief Executive Brian Hartzer stepped down on Tuesday and Chairman Lindsay Maxsted said he would retire in early 2020, sooner than planned, only days after he had argued that change at the top would destabilise the bank. Hartzer’s departure effective from Dec. 2 made Westpac the third of Australia’s four-biggest banks to lose its top executive in the past 18 months, following a series of scandals and a damaging public inquiry which found systemic industry misconduct. If owners of more than a quarter of an Australian company’s shares vote against its executive pay plans at its AGM, as they did for Westpac in 2018, they can call for the entire board to be removed under Australia’s “two strike” law. CGI Glass Lewis said it would not recommend voting against Westpac’s pay plans because the bank had already taken action over the latest allegations. In the event of a second “strike”, CGI Glass Lewis said it would recommend voting against removing the board on the grounds that this was “an option of last resort”. Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Adrian Orr said he was “very concerned” about the AUSTRAC allegations against Westpac, which has a major presence in New Zealand, as he announced the central bank was ramping up its scrutiny of banks and insurers. The RBNZ had contacted all banks to ask for assurance they were meeting regulatory requirements, and was working closely with Westpac’s New Zealand subsidiary on the issues that had arisen in Australia, Orr told a media conference. “Our recent reviews of banks and life insurers, and the number of recent breaches in key regulatory requirements, reinforces the need for financial institutions to improve their behaviour,” said RBNZ deputy governor Geoff Bascand in a statement accompanying the bank’s financial stability report.

-3.1325342874299658," CEO of Australia's Westpac exits over money laundering scandal SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chief executive of Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp stepped down on Tuesday over a money laundering scandal involving child exploitation, just a day after he told staff it was “not a major issue” and that he intended to stay on. The swift turnaround by U.S. born Brian Hartzer underscored how politically and publicly sensitive missteps by Australia’s big banks have become in the wake of a bruising public inquiry that found rampant profiteering in the industry. Hartzer’s departure from Australia’s second largest lender, effective from Dec. 2, made Westpac the third of the country’s top four banks to lose its top executive in the past 18 months. Regulator AUSTRAC last week launched legal action accusing Westpac of enabling 23 million payments in breach of anti-money laundering laws, including the facilitation of offshore payments relating to child exploitation. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was among those calling for the bank’s board to consider the future of its executives, but chairman Lindsay Maxsted had said over the weekend that a change at the top would be destabilizing for the bank. That all changed on Tuesday, when Maxsted announced both Hartzer’s exit and that his own retirement in the first half of next year. He had said in September he had no intention to retire. “We sought feedback from all our stakeholders ... it became clear that board and management changes were in the best interest of the bank,” Maxsted said in a statement. Maxsted added in a media call that his successor would run a global search for a new CEO and Chief Financial Officer Peter King would take over in the interim. King said he would stay “as long as the board needs me”. Hartzer had told senior staff in a meeting on Monday that the crisis was “not an Enron or Lehman Brothers”, according to The Australian newspaper, referring to the two famous corporate collapses. The newspaper quoted Hartzer, who started as CEO in 2015, as telling staff that “for people in mainstream Australia going about their daily lives, this is not a major issue so we don’t need to overcook this”. A source with knowledge of the meeting confirmed the quotes to Reuters. Maxsted said Hartzer’s reported comments were “very disappointing ... and I and the board do not agree,” although he added they needed to be read in context. Hartzer will depart the two-centuries-old company, which had seemed one of the least damaged by the Royal Commission inquiry, with a year’s base salary of A$2.69 million but no bonuses. “These alleged breaches are of the most serious nature, and there needed to be accountability,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra. The changes leave King with the task of running an investigation into how the bank facilitated offshore payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols for more than half a decade, as alleged by AUSTRAC. The scandal is likely to be front and center at Westpac’s annual general meeting, scheduled for Dec. 12., although Hartzer’s exit might dampen some of the fireworks. Westpac’s shares rose 1.8% by Tuesday afternoon, having slumped 8% over the previous four trading days since the regulator announced its lawsuit, wiping A$7.5 billion off the bank’s market capitalization. “They’d been talking to institutional shareholders this week so it was the only feasible outcome to defuse the situation,” Bell Potter banking analyst TS Lim said. “They have been seen to be doing something.” The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), whose pension fund members are investors in Westpac, said it believed the crisis “warrants further board renewal in the new year.” Maxsted said any breaches were not made “through deliberate neglect” as he accepted that some customers may leave the bank. He noted that AUSTRAC was in regular contact with Westpac, including a meeting with the bank’s board in March, yet did not raise concerns about the offshore payments until September. “We don’t have all the details,” he said, adding it appeared that Westpac had been offered an update to protections for its offshore payments system, LitePay, which it did not adopt. Larger rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX was accused of similar - but far fewer - breaches by AUSTRAC, resulting in a record A$700 million penalty and the early retirement of its CEO.

-3.4193117277807676," 'A free pass to pedophiles': Australian lawmaker slams Westpac (Reuters) - Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX must pay the price for giving ""a free pass to pedophiles"" as the corporate watchdog began investigating the lender over millions of breaches of money laundering laws. Dutton is the third senior elected official to go on the offensive against the country’s No. 2 retail bank after the financial crime watchdog accused Westpac of allowing payments between known child exploiters among 23 million transactions that violated anti-money laundering protocols. After the financial crime agency AUSTRAC made the allegations in a lawsuit against Westpac last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called on the bank’s board to consider the CEO’s future, while Attorney General Christian Porter described the alleged breaches “off the charts”. “It is clear ... that the Westpac Banking bosses, through their negligence, have given a free pass to pedophiles and there is a price to pay for that, and that price will be paid,” Dutton told parliament on Monday. The Australian government had “no more important undertaking ... than to keep Australian children safe (and) it is clear that the Westpac Banking bosses have failed that obligation”, he added. Westpac, which has an annual general meeting scheduled for Dec. 12, has so far resisted calls from politicians and investors for senior executives to be removed over the scandal which has so far wiped A$7.5 billion ($5 billion) from Westpac’s market value. In interviews with local media at the weekend, Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted said firing CEO Brian Hartzer during the crisis would be destabilizing. “For Brian not to be CEO would be an amazing piece of destabilization of a company. But we also understand, on the other hand, there is some destabilizing going on, possibly, by him being here,” he was quoted saying in The Australian Financial Review. Westpac has also said it would close its cross-border payment services that were named in the AUSTRAC lawsuit, and that its executive team would withhold all or part of their 2019 bonuses. It has also said it will spend an extra A$80 million improving financial crime monitoring will in the 2020 financial year. A Westpac spokesman did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Monday. Corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, meanwhile, said it was investigating “possible breaches of legislation it administers” in relation to AUSTRAC’s allegations. Law firm Phi Finney McDonald said it had been asked by institutional investors to consider filing a class action lawsuit against the country’s oldest bank. “Modern institutional investors take corporate governance issues extremely seriously,” said lawfirm director Tim Finney. “The suggestion that a major bank could be so lax with its anti-money laundering systems that it potentially facilitated child abuse and exploitation is about as serious as it gets.” Shares in Westpac closed down 1.3%, dropping for a fourth consecutive session and bringing its cumulative losses since AUSTRAC’s accusations to 8%. “Heads rolling would appease the market short-term and at least show that they are serious about changing the culture which clearly seems to have been at fault,” said Henry Jennings, a senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcus Today."
-1.5596902107418047, Australia's Westpac to close funds transfer platform after AUSTRAC allegations Nov 25 (Reuters) - Australia’s second largest bank Westpac Banking Corp on Monday said it would close an international funds transfer platform as part of an immediate fix in response to allegations raised by financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC. Westpac also said its board had decided to withhold either all or part of the 2019 Short Term Variable Reward for the full executive team and several members of the general management team.
1.9196115218244487," Board of Australia's Westpac 'unreservedly apologizes' over money-laundering SYDNEY (Reuters) - The board of Australia’s second largest bank on Friday apologized unreservedly for 23 million breaches of money laundering laws, but stood by management despite pressure from politicians to review its leadership. Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said its board met to discuss allegations by financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC that it ignored red flags for years, including payments between known child exploiters. Chairman Lindsay Maxsted said the bank would hire unspecified independent experts to run an overhaul of its anti-money laundering systems, including a review of accountability. The bank had also started discussions with community groups about further steps to fight child exploitation. “The notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry. The board unreservedly apologizes,” Maxsted said in the statement. “Our Board, CEO, and management team are fully committed to fixing these issues and we are taking all steps necessary to urgently close any remaining gaps and fix our policies and procedures so that this can never happen again.” The scandal had triggered calls for the resignation of top executives and directors, including Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer, and is likely to be a focus for the bank’s annual meeting next month. SCALE OF WRONG-DOING ‘INCREDIBLE’ Goldman Sachs earlier cut its one-year share price target for Westpac by a tenth, citing potential knock-on effects including fines, class actions, loss of customers and capital concerns. “In all cases, banks underperform peers in the 12 months after the incident by an average of 18%,” the U.S. investment bank said. The downgrade struck another blow to shareholders of Westpac, with shares falling a further 1.6% on Friday, taking the total value of its losses to A$6.4 billion ($4.3 billion)since the lawsuit was announced. The broader share market .AXJO was slightly higher. Bill Bovingdon, chief investment officer of debt fund Altius Asset Management, which manages over A$2 billion, told Reuters the company had cut its credit risk of Westpac to “high” from “moderate” and started reducing its exposure to the bank’s bonds. A day after the prime minister said the Westpac board should review the CEO’s future, Attorney General Christian Porter said the seriousness of the Westpac lawsuit “looks like it’s off the charts”. “You’re obviously looking to ensure that whatever outcome occurs, that the people are held – and the organization is held – responsible in a big way for the size and scale of its misfeasance,” the Australian Financial Review newspaper quoted Porter as saying in an interview. “The size and scale of the wrongdoing here looks to be incredible.” Some of Australia’s big pension funds said they have started reviewing their positions in Westpac. A spokesman for Christian Super, which manages the retirement money of religious organization employees, said the AUSTRAC allegations were “of significant concern (and) our team are currently reviewing the information available and will determine any actions in line with our investment framework”. Pat Hobson, who worked as a Westpac branch and call center salesperson for 28 years and owns a few thousand Westpac shares, said staff were tested on regulatory compliance every six months. “It was more just click the buttons and get it out of the way, get it done, get back on the phones because you had your KPIs to achieve,” Hobson, who left the bank in 2015, told Reuters by telephone. When Hobson heard about the AUSTRAC allegations she said she felt “absolutely gutted for my friends who are still working there, and very let down as a shareholder.”"

0.4730840131296907," Pressure grows on Westpac CEO after massive Australian money laundering scandal SYDNEY (Reuters) - Pressure mounted on the chief executive of Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX on Thursday over the handling of Australia's biggest money laundering scandal, with the prime minister saying the bank's board should reflect deeply on Brian Hartzer's position. Australian regulator AUSTRAC is suing the country’s No.2 bank for 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws including a failure to monitor and report payments between known child exploiters. “These are some very disturbing, very disturbing transactions involving despicable behavior,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Australian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday. Westpac’s board “need to determine themselves” whether Hartzer should resign, he added. “They should be taking this very seriously, reflecting on it very deeply and taking the appropriate decisions for the protection of people’s interests in Australia - their safety,” Morrison said. The prime minister’s voice added weight to a chorus of financial market participants demanding the Westpac board do more to contain a crisis at the top of one of the country’s largest companies ahead of a Dec. 12 shareholder meeting. If owners of more than a quarter of the company’s shares vote against its executive pay plans at the meeting, it will be the second year in a row. Under Australia’s “two strike” law, if investors vote down executive pay two years running, they can call for the entire board to be removed. “We will vote against the directors,” said Dan Gocher, a director of shareholder activist the Australasian Center for Corporate Responsibility, which holds Westpac shares. Financial advisers were being “inundated with clients who are considering (exiting Westpac) unless there’s a substantial change”, he added. Australia’s big banks have been scrambling to rebuild community trust since a public inquiry in February found limited regulatory oversight had allowed the sector to engage in rampant profiteering. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) said the allegations from AUSTRAC were “incredibly concerning (and) doing nothing to rebuild public trust”. “Investors take these matters seriously and will be engaging with the board ahead of the AGM,” said ACSI CEO Louise Davidson. A Westpac representative did not respond to a request for comment. Hartzer said the previous day he accepted most of the regulator’s assertions but “at a senior executive level, for the board, for me personally, in no way have we been indifferent on this”. He said he had been “disgusted and appalled” by the allegations and vowed to “get to the bottom of why this was able to persist”. Westpac had self-reported the breaches to the regulator and had since shut down the service at the center of the complaint which let customers and affiliate overseas banks process payments from Australia, he said. The scandal comes a year and a half since larger Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX paid a record A$700 million penalty here for similar breaches. CBA brought forward its CEO’s retirement in light of its AUSTRAC lawsuit, with his successor leading a broader overhaul of the company’s executive level. Westpac shares were down about 2% by the afternoon, taking the total losses to about A$5 billion of market capitalization in the two days since the lawsuit was announced. The broader market .AXJO was down 0.8%. “Brian Hartzer has been at Westpac for a while and in terms of accountability it will probably lead to an earlier change than expected at the top of the company,” said Anton Tagliaferro, investment director at Investors Mutual Ltd, which owns Westpac shares. “Somebody has to be accountable at the end of the day, and Westpac as an organization has to show they are implementing some changes.” Investor lobby group The Australian Shareholders’ Association said in a statement it was “horrified” by the alleged reporting breaches and wanted to know the board’s response “as a matter of urgency”. The ASA would raise the issue at a meeting with Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted scheduled for the next week."

Financial stocks, which comprise the lion’s share of the benchmark, shed almost 1% to close at a six-month trough, with Westpac Banking Corp finishing at its lowest since Feb. 4. Australia’s financial crime regulator on Wednesday alleged that the lender was involved in money laundering and had breached laws on over 23 million instances. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday that the board of Westpac must review the position of CEO Brian Hartzer, laying further pressure on the company. Investors were wary of the sector as a whole amid speculation that the other lenders might divulge similar breaches, with the remaining three of the “big four” banks ending trade in negative territory. Appetite for risky assets fizzled after U.S.-China trade negotiations hit a snag, following the passing of the pro-Hong Kong rights bill by Congress which President Donald Trump is set to sign. “With China reiterating retaliatory measures over the bill, both sides could be locked in a standoff,” analysts at Mizuho wrote in a note to clients. Australian mining stocks ended more than 1% lower and were among worst hit by the trade tensions, as the uncertainty led to a fall in iron ore prices. Iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group fell about 2.2%, while BHP Group shed 1.5%.

-0.8746284077055629," Australia's Westpac slapped with 23 million money laundering breaches SYDNEY (Reuters) - Regulators accused Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, saying the banking giant ignored red flags and for years enabled payments from convicted child sex offenders and ""high risk"" countries. The oversight failure at Australia’s second-largest bank led to deep systemic non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws, financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC said in a civil court filing on Wednesday. The regulator is pursuing fines of up to A$21 million ($14 million) for every transaction Westpac failed to monitor adequately or report on time in the country’s biggest ever money laundering scandal. In theory, that could add up to whopping A$483 trillion in fines. The lawsuit dwarfs a case AUSTRAC brought against larger Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX which agreed last year here to pay a record A$700 million penalty after admitting to allowing 53,750 payments that violated similar protocols. It also brings fresh scrutiny to an industry still trying to rebuild community trust after a bruising Royal Commission public inquiry. “These contraventions are the result of systemic failures in its control environment, indifference by senior management and inadequate oversight by the Board,” AUSTRAC said in the court filing. Westpac said it had self-reported the breaches to AUSTRAC and had since shut down the service at the center of the complaint which let customers and affiliate overseas banks process payments from Australia. “Like everyone who has read the statement of claim, I am personally disgusted and appalled,” Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said on a call with reporters, adding the bank “should have done better”. Hartzer said he accepted most of the regulator’s assertions but “at a senior executive level, for the board, for me personally, in no way have we been indifferent on this.” The lawsuit sent Westpac shares down 3% by the close, outpacing a broader share market decline of 1.4%, as investors began counting the financial and reputational cost of the lawsuit. Brian Johnson, an analyst at Jefferies, said he expected a “meaningful, painful but not catastrophic civil penalty” in the hundreds of millions of dollars range. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said they saw downside risks for bank capital persisting until fines, penalties and remediation provisions subside. “This development epitomizes the more active enforcement action stance taken by regulators generally in the post Royal Commission era,” they said in a note. The AUSTRAC filing said Westpac knew since 2013 about “heightened child exploitation risks associated with people who made frequent low value payments to the Philippines and South East Asia” but did not set up an automated detection system until 2018. The Sydney-based bank had failed to conduct due diligence on 12 customers who had made frequent low-value transactions over several years which suggested involvement in child exploitation, it said. One customer who had served a prison sentence for child exploitation set up several Westpac accounts. Westpac detected suspicious activity in one account but failed to review the other accounts which were used to send payments to the Philippines, AUSTRAC said. Westpac meanwhile maintained relationships with offshore banks without assessing their business relationships, products, customers or payments, even when those banks disclosed relationships with “high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo”. “The risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system,” AUSTRAC said. Hartzer, the CEO, said he first learned the specifics of the individual bank accounts on Wednesday and was “utterly horrified by what I had read and absolutely determined to get to the bottom of why this was able to persist.” AUSTRAC declined to comment when asked by Reuters if it was conducting similar investigations on the other two of Australia's so-called Big Four banks, National Australia Bank NAB.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX. ANZ declined to comment, while NAB referred Reuters to a Nov. 7 statement that it had reported an unspecified number of breaches to AUSTRAC and was working with the regulator. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which carries out a similar function to AUSTRAC in New Zealand, said it was in close contact with the Australian agency with regards to Westpac. Westpac is one of New Zealand’s biggest lenders. “Obviously it’s appalling and distressing,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Brisbane, when asked about the Westpac lawsuit. “It is a fairly damning indictment about some of the processes and procedures they’ve had in place.”"

Westpac says it self-reported the breaches and has shut down the mechanism used to allow the payments. Here are the accusations made by the regulator, AUSTRAC, against Westpac, Australia’s second largest bank, in a civil court filing published on Wednesday: - Failed to assess and monitor money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with the banking services it provided to customers through other banks around the world. - Failed to carry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and South East Asia for known child exploitation risks. - Failed to report millions of international funds transfer instructions to AUSTRAC or to other banks - Knew since 2013 of heightened child exploitation risks associated with frequent low value payments to the Philippines and South East Asia but only began monitoring in June 2018. - Failed to do appropriate due diligence on 12 customers to identify, mitigate and manage known child exploitation risks despite repeated patterns of frequent low value transactions. - Identified a suspicious payment from a customer convicted of child exploitation then failed to stop the customer sending payments to the Philippines. - Hindered law enforcement efforts and deprived AUSTRAC and tax authorities of information relating to over A$11 billion in international payments for up to six years. - Exposed the Australian payments system to “unacceptable and longstanding” money laundering and terrorism financing risks. - Failed to check partner banks which had relationships with “high risk or sanctioned” countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo."

The S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 1.2%, or 83.3 points, to 6,732.10 by 0124 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.7% on Tuesday. Australia’s financial crime regulator on Wednesday alleged that Westpac Banking Corp had breached laws on over 23 million instances and applied for civil penalties against the lender, sending its shares 2.5% to a more than six-month low. “Twenty-three million counts of breaches is clearly a significant number... It is possible we will see substantial fines for Westpac in due course,” said Henry Jennings, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcustoday Financial Newsletter. Financial stocks tumbled to a more than two-month low with the other “Big Four” banks also recording sizable declines. National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank of Australia shed 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Jennings added Westpac’s issue adds to an ongoing cycle of problems for banks and fanned worries about the wider sector. Further dampening sentiment were comments from U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal was reached to end the prolonged Sino-.U.S. trade war. Meanwhile, a more than 3% drop in crude oil prices amid concerns of oversupply weighed heavily on energy stocks, which fell to their lowest in near two weeks.

Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said it was not reasonable to expect Westpac, the country’s second largest lender, to lower rates for more than a million existing customers to match the discounts used to entice new customers. “We’re essentially trying to balance up the disconnect between the demand for loans and the supply of funding of difference sources, and we seek to try to keep our net interest margin (NIM) ... relatively stable,” Hartzer told a parliamentary hearing. Some analysts estimate the practice adds more than 10% to the earnings of the country’s so-called “Big Four” banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - which account for around 80% of the home loan mortgage market. Lawmakers pressed Hartzer on the issue ahead of a scheduled inquiry by the competition regulator into mortgage pricing. The probe by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will look specifically at the pricing differential between new and existing customers and why the major banks have failed to pass on three official interest rate cuts this year. “Repricing the entire book ... would have a major impact given that a lot of our funding is fixed for different periods of time,” Hartzer said. If the ACCC review results in measures to fully close the pricing gap, or one of the four major banks were to self-disrupt the oligopoly, Morgan Stanley estimates their NIMs would likely fall by up to 15 basis points and their earnings by up to 12%. Westpac has 11.2 million Australian customers, according to its annual report released on Monday when the bank reported a 15% slide in full-year cash earnings. A spokesman said the lender currently has about 1.6 million mortgages. The new inquiry follows hot on the heels of last year’s government-backed inquiry into the financial sector that has so far cost banks more than A$8 billion in compensation charges for customers over mis-selling and related costs."
-6.994282679858715," Australian shares tepid as Westpac Banking drags; NZ dips * Financials set for seventh straight day of losses * Westpac slips a day after resuming trade * Gold stocks fall Nov 5 (Reuters) - Australian shares were subdued on Tuesday ahead of a central bank policy meeting, while losses in Westpac Banking Corp pressured the overall market after the lender flagged weak trading conditions following a lower annual profit. The S&P/ASX 200 index was trading at 6690.3, as of 0149 GMT. The benchmark ended 0.3% higher on Monday. Shares in Westpac Banking, the country’s second-largest lender, slipped to their lowest since May 17, and was one of the biggest drags in the ASX 200 index. The lender on Monday had reported a 15% slide in its full-year cash earnings and cut its dividend for the first time in a decade. It also announced completion of an A$2 billion share placement on Tuesday as it seeks to beef up capital levels amid tougher regulatory requirements. “Westpac has taken some of the gloss off today but that wasn’t unexpected considering the deep discount the placement was done at,” Henry Jennings, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcustoday Financial Newsletter. Among the other “Big Four” banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia advanced 1%, while National Australia Bank , which is due to report results on Thursday, added 1.2%. “We’re obviously expecting to see the same sorts of pressures that we have seen in ANZ and Westpac to play on NAB,” Jennnings said, adding that a dividend cut was a high possibility. Markets were also focussed on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy review due later in the day. Analysts in a Reuters poll expect the central bank to stand pat but cut at least once more early next year to revive inflation and a slowing economy. Energy stocks advanced 0.8%, with Woodside Petroleum , the country’s biggest oil and gas explorer rising 1.2%, while Oil Search added 0.8%. The energy sector was set for a third straight day of gains, helped by strength in oil prices on an improved outlook for crude demand after the United States and China signalled progress in trade negotiations. Trade-sensitive mining stocks also lent support to the local benchmark, with the sub-index rising 0.2%. Major players BHP Group and Rio Tinto added 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Gold stocks dropped 2.5% as increased optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal capped gains for the safe-haven bullion. Newcrest Mining and St Barbara shed 1.8% and 3.7%, respectively. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.1%, or 9.05 points, to 10,792.05. Local shares of Westpac dipped 3.4%. Communications infrastructure services provider Chorus Ltd and electricity retailer Meridian Energy strengthened 1.4% and 0.4%, each."
-6.994282679858715," Australia's Westpac places shares at discount; stock marks biggest fall in a year (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX on Tuesday said it completed a discounted A$2 billion ($1.38 billion) equity placement, and its shares suffered their worst drop in nearly a year, also reflecting a 15% slide in annual profit reported on Monday when the stock was halted. The issue price for the placement was on par with its underwritten level of A$25.32 a share, which was at a 9% discount to Westpac’s closing price on Friday. Westpac shares, which resumed trading on Tuesday, slipped as much as 5.1% to A$26.460, the biggest drop since November 2018. “That’s a big issue, and it was a big discount. I’m sure that some people that took the placement were throwing that stock out into the market to take advantage of the discount,” said Henry Jennings, portfolio manager at Marcustoday Financial Newsletter. Jennings said dilution was playing a part in the share movement, while the earnings drop showed the bank was facing “some serious headwinds.” Along with announcing on Monday annual results and a dividend cut for the first time in a decade, the country’s No.2 lender announced a A$2.5 billion capital raising, as it looks to beef up its capital levels amid tougher regulatory requirements. The capital raising also includes a non-underwritten share purchase plan through which the lender is targeting to raise an additional A$500 million. Westpac's results came just days after its smaller peer Australia and New Banking Group ANZ.AX also missed profit expectations. Australia’s “Big Four” banks are having to hold more capital at a time of record low interest rates, subdued credit growth, increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny after a government-backed inquiry into the financial sector exposed widespread misconduct."

-10.549247717694188," Australia's Westpac raising $1.7 billion as profit slumps, flags weak outlook SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX is looking to raise A$2.5 billion ($1.73 billion) from shareholders after reporting a 15% slide in full-year cash earnings, cutting its dividend for the first time in a decade and flagging weak trading conditions ahead. Australia’s No. 2 lender plans to use the additional funds to meet tougher capital requirements and anticipated legal action related to customer remediation issues that have already led to an almost A$1 billion charge. “2019 has been a disappointing year,” Westpac Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said. “Financial results are down significantly in a challenging, low-growth, low interest rate environment.” Australia’s “Big Four” banks are having to hold more capital at a time of record low interest rates, subdued credit growth and increasing competition. They also have a collective bill of about A$8 billion in one-off charges to compensate customers for wrongful practices exposed by a government-backed inquiry into the financial sector. Hartzer, whose bonus was scrapped this year, said operating conditions “will continue to be difficult,” flagging weaker expected margins, flat lending volumes, lower fees, and slightly higher expenses. The capital raising is the largest by a bank since Westpac’s own A$3.5 billion raising in 2015, according to Refinitiv data. Hartzer said the raising, most of which has been underwritten at A$25.32 per share, a 9% discount from Friday’s closing price, would provide flexibility amid the subdued economic outlook. “We just felt it was getting a little tight in terms of the buffer of where we wanted to be,” he said. Westpac slightly missed analysts’ expectations with cash earnings of A$6.85 billion for the year ended Sept. 30, down from A$8.07 billion a year earlier and below the A$6.89 billion average forecast of six analysts polled by Reuters. Excluding one-off items like the A$977 million hit for customer remediation, Westpac’s cash earnings dropped 4%. Only its New Zealand unit posted a rise, up 3%. Stressed loans increased by 12 basis points to 1.2 percent of loans, the highest level since 2016. Expenses rose 3%, despite a 5% cut to the bank’s workforce. Trading in Westpac shares was halted until Tuesday to allow for a bookbuild process. The stock has gained 13.8% so far this year, recovering much of the value lost during last year’s Royal Commission inquiry that uncovered widespread misconduct in the sector. Westpac’s final dividend was cut by 14.9% to 80 cents per share, marking the first cut since 2009 amid the global financial crisis. “The decision ... was not easy,” Hartzer said. “However, we felt it was necessary to bring the dividend payout ratio to a more sustainable medium-term range given the capital raising and lower return on equity.” Given the weak outlook and share dilution from the larger than expected capital raising, analysts said Westpac could need to cut dividends further in the near term. “It’s pretty clear ... that the dividend will again be under pressure in 2020,” Evans and Partners banking analyst Matthew Wilson said. Fellow ""Big Four"" bank Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX last week cut its dividend franking tax rebate to 70% for the first time in almost 20 years as it also missed expectations with a 3% drop in second-half profit. Hartzer’s short-term bonus of A$1.61 million was scrapped, although he still received A$4.01 million in salary and vested bonuses. Westpac last year received a “first strike” when shareholders voted against executive remuneration. Under Australian corporate rules, a “second strike” at the Dec. 12 annual general meeting could prompt a board spill."

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2% or 15.9 points to 6,685 by 0036 GMT. The benchmark ended marginally higher on Friday. Financial shares, the benchmark’s largest component, slipped 0.8% and were poised for a sixth straight day of declines. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s largest lender, fell 1.4%, while National Australia Bank , which is set to report results on Thursday shed 2.9%. Westpac Banking Corp on Monday reported a 15% slide in full-year cash earnings and cut its dividend for the first time in a decade, as it also set aside more money to meet compliance and compensation costs. Trading in the lender’s shares was halted until Nov. 5 to allow for the pricing process for a new share issue. “Westpac’s results has really upset the market in the banking space,” Brad Smoling, managing director at Smoling Stockbroking said. “The provision from remediation as a resolve to the Royal Commission is being quite impactful on the banking sector and if we do get a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia tomorrow that is going to put further pressure on the margin for bank profitability.” Australia’s central bank is expected to hold its cash rate at a record low of 0.75% at its policy review on Tuesday, but cut it at least once more early next year to help revive inflation and a slowing economy, according to a Reuters poll. Positive developments in the U.S.-China trade war front and stronger-than-expected economic data from both countries supported gains in other sectors. The United States and China on Friday said they made progress in talks aimed at defusing a nearly 16-month-long trade war, while U.S. officials said a deal could be signed this month. Mining stocks were the top performers in early Monday trade, with the sub-index jumping 1.8% to its highest level in nearly a month. The sector is especially vulnerable to developments on the trade front, with China being a key buyer of commodity exports. Global miners BHP Group and Rio Tinto advanced 2.1% and 3.5%, respectively. “When the market sees that there is some progress, it grabs that with both hands on hopes that things will turn out well, but I am not too convinced by that...I think it just ‘hopium’,” Smoling added. Strength in global crude prices lent support to energy stocks, which rose 0.7% to a more than 1-month high. Woodside Petroleum , the country’s largest oil and gas explorer, added 0.8%, while Oil Search gained 1%. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.7% or 70.58 points to 10,832.49. Electricity retailers Contact Energy and Meridian Energy were among the top gainers, rising 2.8% and 2.1%, respectively."

-11.519087991911144," In rare win for regulators, Australia's Westpac loses case over marketing cold calls SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX staff inappropriately gave personal financial advice when marketing pension funds, an Australian court said, overturning an earlier ruling in a rare win for regulators under pressure to crack down on misconduct in the finance sector. From 2013 to 2016, Westpac contacted customers by mail and phone offering to help them shift money from other pension funds to its own, boosting its own holdings by about A$650 million ($440 million), the Federal Court said. By “closing” sales and getting customers to transfer pension money in the same phone call, “there was an implied recommendation ... that the customer should accept the service”, the three judges wrote in a ruling published on Monday. The court gave ASIC and Westpac two weeks to agree on what public declarations the bank must give. If they don’t agree, the matter will return to court to determine penalties for the bank. The decision is a boost for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) which along with other regulators has struggled to land a major court win against banks. A year-long public inquiry that ended in February gave a scathing assessment of the culture at the country’s financial giants, also criticising regulators which it said had allowed the sector to reward overly aggressive, and sometimes deceptive, sales methods. The Federal Court appeal tribunal dismissed a December ruling that Westpac’s advice was only “general” and therefore allowed - in what was then an embarrassing loss for ASIC given it took place while the inquiry was still running. ASIC said the ruling “provides clarity and certainty concerning the difference between general and personal advice for consumers and financial services providers”. Westpac said it was carefully considering the judgment. ASIC lost against Westpac again in August when a court found the regulator had failed to prove the bank approved hundreds of thousands of mortgages without adequate credit checks. Last month, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the country's banking regulator, lost a landmark case against IOOF Holdings Ltd IFL.AX in which it accused the wealth manager's executives of breaking the law by using members' money to top up investment losses. The Federal Court found the action was lawful."

The provisions for customer remediation comes in the wake of a powerful government mandated inquiry into Australia’s financial sector, which found rampant misconduct among top institutions. Besides the charges relating to customer remediation programmes, costs related to the previously announced wealth reset will reduce second-half earnings by another A$36 million, the lender said in a statement. “A key priority in 2019 has been to deal with outstanding remediation issues and refund customers as quickly as possible,” said Westpac Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer.

-9.222616503211627," Australia's Big Four lenders resist pressure to pass on RBA's rate cut in full (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX joined the country's other 'Big Four' lenders in skipping the chance to pass on the central bank's rate cut in full to customers due to ever-thinning margins. Westpac and ANZ’s decision on Wednesday comes despite pressure from the country’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to do so after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its benchmark cash rate to an all time low of 0.75% on Tuesday in an attempt to kick-start the economy. However, analysts have warned that the three rate cuts this year and any further central bank easing may inflict even more pain on Australian banks’ net interest margins. Westpac said it would lower variable home loan interest rates by 15 basis points, while ANZ said it would lower it by 14 basis points. The move follows similar reductions by Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX and National Australia Bank NAB.AX hours after the RBA's cut. The banks have argued that they face a difficult balancing act with rates approaching zero, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of super easy monetary policy. The top four lenders have resisted public pressure in the past to fully pass on the earlier two central bank rate cuts to customers. CBA lowered its standard variable owner-occupier interest rates by 13 basis points, while NAB lowered by 15 basis points."

Westpac has not made a final decision to divest the unit, but it has received some interest and discussions are at a preliminary stage, one of the sources said. The sources declined to be identified because the plans are private. A Westpac spokesman declined to comment. A deal would likely involve a long-term partnership with the buyer, rather than a clean asset sale, that could value the unit at close to A$2 billion ($1.35 billion), the first source said. The Australian newspaper reported earlier this month that insurer American International Group Inc AIG.N was interested in the business and had held talks with Westpac, putting the potential value of a deal at A$1.5 billion to A$2 billion. Representatives of AIG did not immediately return requests for comment. The other three major Australian banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, National Australia Bank Ltd NAB.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX - have all sold most of their life insurance units in a back-to-basics trend towards core mortgage lending. Westpac had A$6.9 billion in life insurance liabilities as of June, and yearly revenue of A$988 million, according to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) statistics. In late December 2017, Zurich Insurance agreed to buy ANZ’s life insurance arm for A$2.85 billion, a deal that was followed by Hong Kong-based AIA Group’s purchase of CBA’s life insurance unit in 2018.

-16.56650425218896," UPDATE 1-Australian regulator appeals against court dismissal of Westpac lending case (Adds background, ASIC Commissioner quote) Sept 10 (Reuters) - Australia’s corporate watchdog on Tuesday said it had lodged an appeal against a court decision dismissing its accusations that the nation’s second-biggest lender Westpac Banking Corp had approved mortgages without appropriate credit checks. Last month, the Federal Court ruled against the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), saying Westpac had obeyed the law when approving 262,000 home loans using an automated system to estimate expenses. The case is widely seen as a test of a government drive toward closer scrutiny of the financial sector after a public inquiry last year found widespread wrongdoing. Westpac did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. In the earlier ruling, Judge Nye Perram found that Westpac did not breach any responsible lending provisions of the Credit Act by using the automated system rather than manually checking each applicant’s living expenses. Citing the judge’s decision that a lender “may do what it wants in the assessment process”, ASIC said the Act also requires lenders to make “reasonable enquiries about a borrower’s financial circumstances” and verify information before deciding whether or not a loan is suitable for them. “ASIC considers that the Federal Court’s decision creates uncertainty as to what is required for a lender to comply with its assessment obligation, nor does ASIC regard the decision as consistent with the legislative intention of the responsible lending regime,” said ASIC Commissioner Sean Hughes. The regulator had initially begun Federal Court proceedings against Westpac in March 2017."
-12.829203177780318," Australia's Westpac faces fee-for-no-service lawsuit SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX has been served a class action lawsuit accusing it of charging thousands of pension fund customers for services they never received, joining a parade of big-ticket litigation arising from a major inquiry into the financial sector. The legal action against Australia’s second-biggest bank, revealed by Westpac to the stock market on Friday, is one of almost a dozen lawsuits resulting from a Royal Commission inquiry that found evidence of widespread misconduct in the financial sector. Westpac said it would defend itself against the civil Federal Court claim, which was filed against two of its subsidiaries by law firm Slater and Gordon Ltd SGH.AX on Wednesday afternoon. Slater and Gordon has already filed similar claims against the country's biggest lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX and financial planner AMP Ltd AMP.AX. The firm did not specify what damages it was seeking from Westpac. It has said it is seeking more than A$100 million against CBA, while it has also not specified damages against AMP. The most recent lawsuit alleges that Westpac’s pension fund, BT, invested customer money in a Westpac-owned investment vehicle, which then kept nearly half the profit before returning the proceeds to pension fund customers. “Superannuation members trusted BT with their retirement savings, but instead of seeking the best returns available for members, it appears BT chose to line the pockets of another entity in the Westpac group at the expense of its members,” said Slater and Gordon lawyer Nathan Rapoport in a statement on Friday. The Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 excoriated the banking industry, along with the broader financial sector, for rampant fee-gouging including widespread charging of fees for no actual service. Even before the inquiry delivered its final report in February, class actions against Australia’s financial giants began to be filed. There are now about 10 class actions stemming from the Royal Commission before the courts. In the court filing against Westpac subsidiaries BT Funds Management Ltd and Westpac Life Insurance Services Ltd, Slater & Gordon said that by failing to invest the retirement money directly, Westpac contravened its legal obligations to seek “the highest obtainable net earnings on the investment ... within an appropriate investment risk profile.” Westpac Life, the investment vehicle which handled the funds, had generated returns of 2.5% a year in recent years but gave only 1.3% back to the pension fund, the filing said. Westpac Life either knew about, failed to make inquiries about, or “wilfully shut its eyes to the obvious” about the fact that keeping so much of the returns amounted to a breach of the fund’s duty of care, it added."

-3.233423212632657," UPDATE 2-Headwinds hitting capital at Australia's Westpac ahead of January deadline * No. 2 bank says minimum capital levels under pressure * Dividend cut on cards to meet capital requirement - analyst * Westpac reports higher 90+ day delinquencies, repossessions (Recasts with capital detail) SYDNEY, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp on Monday said the number of people missing mortgage payments was rising and its capital levels were under pressure, sparking concerns among some analysts about its ability to meet dividend expectations. Australia’s four biggest banks must maintain a minimum core capital ratio of 10.5% from Jan. 1, 2020. Westpac, the country’s second-largest, and its smaller rival National Australia Bank are lagging Commonwealth Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in meeting the requirement. Westpac said its core capital ratio inched down to 10.5% at the end of the June quarter, exactly the level required by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) from January. New accounting rules and an increase to its operational risk capital would reduce its capital ratio by 44 basis points in coming months, convincing analysts the bank must implement capital management initiatives to meet the deadline. “It does reinforce our view that the (second half dividend) will likely be cut to support Westpac’s efforts to meet APRA’s 10.5% ‘unquestionably strong’ minimum” by Jan. 1, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients. Other possibilities could be asset sales, or dividend reinvestment plans offering discounts to investors who reinvest their dividend in shares rather than require cash payments. Westpac also said 90-plus-day delinquencies, the overall percentage of loans that are about three months overdue, were up 8 basis points over the third quarter to 0.9%, amid a soft housing market. That was the highest level among Australia’s top four lenders, which was also partly due to a higher portion of people now due to repay their loans rather than just paying interest. Australia’s housing market has been under immense strain, with housing prices having fallen every month since late 2017. But encouraging signs of higher demand in June from Sydney and Melbourne have spurred hopes that things may be improving. “Softness in property market contributing to an increase in the time it takes to sell a property have contributed to the rise in delinquencies and properties in possession,” Westpac said in a statement. Properties in possession now sit at 550, a jump of 68 over the quarter. Many hope back-to-back rate cuts in the past couple of months may boost consumer sentiment across the housing market, which may also get a lift from recently passed tax cuts. Stressed assets rose in the third quarter by 10 basis points to 1.2%, the lender said in a limited third-quarter update."

-4.622888802465807," Australian regulator loses court battle against Westpac over lending standards SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court on Tuesday dismissed allegations that Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX had approved mortgages without adequate credit checks, dealing a blow to the regulator's efforts to toughen lending standards. The Federal Court ruled against the corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), deciding that Westpac had obeyed the law when approving 262,000 home loans using an automated system to estimate expenses. The case was being watched as a test of the government’s push for stricter oversight of the financial sector, after a public inquiry last year found widespread wrongdoing and lackluster enforcement by feeble regulators. It suggests that legislation may be needed if regulators, newly empowered with greater resources and an explicit mandate to take firm legal action against misconduct, are thwarted by recalcitrant courts. “I’m not sure the courts are, in this instance, in tune with what public expectations might be,” said Thomas Clarke, a professor at the University of Technology, Sydney business school. Judge Nye Perram told ASIC to pay the No. 2 lender’s court costs after deciding it had done nothing wrong by using the automated system rather than manually checking each applicant’s living expenses. The law did not explicitly require banks to check expenses, he said, and he was “unable to discern why, as a matter of principle, the consumer’s declared living expenses must be considered”. “I may eat Wagyu beef every day washed down with the finest shiraz but, if I really want my new home, I can make do on much more modest fare,” he wrote in the judgment. Australia’s four biggest banks use index measures to calculate living expenses and Westpac says more prescriptive lending rules would harm Australia’s already sluggish economy. The bank said ASIC’s lawsuit was an “important test case” and welcomed the “clarity that today’s decision provides for the interpretation of responsible lending obligations”. The ruling comes after a government-mandated inquiry known as a Royal Commission last year heard banks had underestimated borrowers’ spending and in some cases approved loans to people who could not repay them. The former judge presiding over that inquiry, Kenneth Hayne, said then that laws should be changed if courts showed a “deficiency in the law’s requirements to make reasonable inquiries about, and verify, the consumer’s financial situation”. Regulators have since said they want banks to do individual credit checks on borrowers to assess loan affordability, instead of relying on indices that estimate a person’s minimum living expenses based on average Australian incomes. “It does show you how slowly legal and regulatory change takes place. The Royal Commission can fire a number of huge incendiaries into existing practices and legal practices, but the courts carry on as if it’s business as usual,” Professor Clarke said. The judgment comes after the parties had already agreed to a A$35 million ($23.6 million) civil penalty over the allegations, which was rejected by the court. An ASIC spokesman was not available for comment. ($1 = 1.4804 Australian dollars)"

Federal Court Judge Nye Perram ordered the regulator to pay costs after finding that the bank did assess applicants’ expenditure before approving home loans. “I reject this case on the facts,” Perram said in a published judgement. “Westpac did have regard to these declared living expenses.” The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has been trying to introduce more prescriptive lending rules following revelations of improper lending. ASIC had alleged that Westpac, Australia’s oldest bank, had breached laws on up to 262,000 home loans by using an automated process to determine expenses rather that assessing each person’s living costs. The judgement comes after the parties had already agreed to a A$35 million ($23.6 million) settlement, which was rejected by the court.

-2.497924307326543," Australia Westpac fined for late data reporting as regulator toughens stance (Reuters) - Australia's financial watchdog fined Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX and two of its units on Thursday for failing to report data to the watchdog on time, weeks after a government report called on the regulator to take tougher action on misconduct. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said Westpac and its units will have to pay a fine of A$1.5 million ($1.02 million), the maximum payable for the breach. Westpac and its two units were late in submitting data pertaining to financial statistics for the quarter ended March 31, and for the month of March. The units were also late in April, APRA said in a statement. “APRA wants to send a strong message to industry that compliance with our reporting standards is mandatory, and cannot be considered secondary to other business priorities,” APRA Deputy Chair John Lonsdale said. An independent government report last month told the regulator to be more forceful, and added that the body may need more resources to help it. Westpac, in an emailed statement, said it now has processes in place to deliver all required data by the APRA on time and it “regrets” not doing so in the incidents mentioned. APRA’s move highlights the scrutiny regulators have come under recently to take a larger and more proactive role in cleaning up the country’s financial sector after widespread wrongdoing was found by a year-long inquiry."

-0.9072641674561143," Australia's Westpac warns tighter lending rules will harm economy SYDNEY, July 30 (Reuters) - A push by Australian regulators to tighten lending rules risks slowing down Australia’s sluggish economy even further, the chief executive of Westpac Banking Corp said on Tuesday. Financial regulators are reviewing lending rules after an inquiry last year into financial sector misconduct that heard banks had underestimated borrowers’ spending and in some cases approved loans to people that could not repay them. “Banks’ responses to today’s highly prescriptive rules creates a real issue for the future,” Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said at a business lunch in Sydney. A tighter regulatory approach would mean that Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, would turn down loan approvals for some wealthy and loyal customers who had received loans in the past, out of fear of breaking the rules, Hartzer said. “That’s not the bank we want to be for our customers. And that’s not the banking system that Australia needs,” he said. In order to kick-start the economy, which is expanding at its slowest pace since the 2008 global financial crisis, lawmakers and banks needed to find a better balance between consumer protection and financial stability, he said. Australia’s Big Four lenders - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank , Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank - are under pressure from record-low home-loan growth and a new era of enhanced regulatory scrutiny following scathing revelations of misconduct at the Royal Commision inquiry. Their earnings are also getting squeezed by the central bank’s move to stimulate the economy with record-low policy rates. “For banks, economically it’s incredibly challenging,” Hartzer said. “That’s why I think it’s important for us to try to avoid going over a cliff and restore some confidence and get people investing again.” Hartzer also called on government to support credit demand by lowering property taxes, opening up new land, and building infrastructure around it to support it.

0.050353407220254484," Australia's Westpac brings forward RBA rate cut forecast, A$ slips SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp has brought forward the timing of its forecast for the next rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to October, from November previously, chief economist Bill Evans said on Wednesday. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 slipped to a 1-1/2-week trough of $0.6984 after Evans' note, extending losses for a fourth straight day and further drifting away from a recent three-month top of $0.7082. The RBA has chopped the cash rate twice to 1% since June as it awaits a revival in inflation, which has undershot its 2-3% medium-term target for more than three years now. The unemployment rate has also risen in recent months to 5.2% from 4.9% in February. The RBA estimates full employment at 4.5% - the level at which wage pressures could emerge. Evans said the unemployment forecast is going to challenge the RBA. “By October, we expect that the path of the unemployment rate will be sufficiently contrary to the RBA’s plans that they will have appropriate justification to ease policy a little earlier than we had previously expected,” Evans wrote to clients in a note. Westpac’s own forecast for the jobless rate by end-2019 is 5.4% with a range of leading indicators signaling a slowdown in employment growth over the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. Evans said there is a chance the RBA could cut the cash rate to 0.75% in September but the Board will likely wait for more data before moving again. He expects another cut in February 2020 to 0.50%. “Our forecasts of inflation and unemployment emphasize the extent of the challenge faced by the RBA in boosting demand and wages and reaching their own targets. We expect that the RBA will eventually see only one more rate cut, in October, as being an insufficient response.”"

0.3578634617888722," New Zealand watchdog sues Westpac arm over failure to disclose credit card terms (Reuters) - New Zealand's commerce commission has sued Westpac's local arm WBC.NZ for not revealing key terms to thousands of credit card clients, in the latest sign of heightened regulatory scrutiny for Australian banks operating across the Tasman Sea. The move underlines a tougher operating environment for Australian banks in New Zealand as regulators double down on compliance after remedial rules proposed by Australia’s year-long inquiry were considered to have gone easy on these lenders. Just last month, New Zealand's deputy prime minister asked the chairman of the local unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX, among Australia's ""Big Four"" banks, to step down on concerns about how the lender is run. “If you’re looking at the behavior of banks in Australia, it’s no question that investors in New Zealand who have been borrowing from them would be scrutinizing things,” James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut, said. New Zealand’s Commerce Commission said it was seeking return of costs and statutory damages to affected borrowers from the local arm of Westpac, the second-largest lender in Australia. “This case is important for clarifying the scope of lender liability to borrowers, in a situation where thousands of customers were not provided with initial disclosure required under the law,” Commission Chair Anna Rawlings said. The watchdog said in a statement that Westpac reported last year about its failure to disclose key details to 19,000 personal credit card customers when they first took out their credit card between May 2017 and March 2018. A Westpac spokesman said the lender had discovered in March last year that disclosure documents had not been sent to 19,365 new credit card customers due to an error during a systems upgrade and had “proactively notified the Commerce Commission”. “We also refunded fees and interest charges to customers who were in default, and have made changes to make sure this issue is not repeated,” the spokesman told Reuters, declining to comment further as the case is before the courts. The bank’s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, had previously said that Westpac’s culture can slow decision-making and dilute accountability, citing an internal report. Local shares of Westpac were 0.7% lower on Thursday while the broader benchmark .NZ50 was 0.4% higher. Westpac shares in Australia WBC.AX were up slightly."

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said on Tuesday that it will consider cutting interest rates at its meeting next month as growth and inflation waver, its clearest indication yet that it intends to ease policy. That prompted Westpac chief economist Bill Evans on Tuesday to bring forward his forecasts for two cuts to June and August from previous prediction of August and November. Evans said on Friday he believes a third cut could proceed in November as well. “Westpac is now forecasting three cuts in 2019 in June; August and November to push the cash rate from 1.5% to 0.75% and to hold at that level through 2020,” he said in a note published on the bank’s website. “Our forecasts for employment, wages growth, economic growth, inflation and conditions in the housing market are consistent with the need for policy to ease through the full course of 2019,” he said. The Australian dollar fell from around $0.6904 to $0.6884 after Evans’ forecast. Westpac was the first of the four major banks to predict a cut back in February, when the other three were either forecasting steady policy or a hike by 2020. A cut would be the first for RBA Governor Philip Lowe, who has held policy at an all-time low 1.50 percent since taking the central bank’s helm in September 2016.

3.2932954095049363," Australia's Westpac posts worst half-year profit since 2013 SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s second-biggest lender Westpac Banking Corp posted its lowest half-year profit since 2013 on Monday, as interest income shrank along with the housing market, and costs rose as the bank compensated customers for botched service. The result comes as the country’s four biggest lenders, which dominate about 80 percent of the consumer and commercial banking market, grapple with record-low mortgage demand after regulators responded to a property-price boom with lending caps. At the same time, the “Big Four” are spending millions of dollars refunding customers and repairing reputations after a government-ordered inquiry into financial sector business practices exposed widespread wrongdoing. “Regulatory activity is intense, economic growth has slowed, consumer and business demand has softened, house prices have fallen and competition has increased,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer said at an earnings presentation. “All these have put pressure on earnings and given us a list of issues to manage.” Westpac’s result rounds up a downward trend in profitability at the Big Four, which also includes Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB). The four reported a combined cash profit of A$14.5 billion for the first half of each financial year, down 4 percent from the same period a year prior, showed data from KPMG. At Westpac, cash profit fell 22 percent in October-March to A$3.3 billion ($2.3 billion), versus the A$3.52 billion average estimate of six analysts polled by Reuters. Cash profit is a closely watched measure of performance as it strips out unusual items. “This is a disappointing result reflecting weaker business conditions and the bank dealing decisively with outstanding issues, including remediation and resetting our wealth strategy,” Hartzer said in a statement. The two-centuries-old lender, which serves over 14 million people, last week flagged a A$617 million hit to half-year earnings related to refunding fees inappropriately charged, such as for financial advice not rendered. The bank has since ceased offering financial advice. “House prices are likely to remain soft and home building is set to reduce through 2019 and into 2020,” Hartzer said. Westpac expects housing credit to slow to 2.5 percent in its next financial year from a record-low 4 percent at present, he said. Westpac said its net interest margin — the difference between interest paid and interest earned, measuring underlying profitability — fell 16 basis points to 2.12 percent in October-March. Net interest income fell 4 percent. In August, Westpac raised some home loan interest rates to preserve profit margins in the face of higher costs. But the property downturn and tighter lending conditions have left banks wrestling for customers, making it harder to write new loans. Though maintaining a low level of stressed exposure and impairment charges, Westpac also reported a 21 percent spike in properties in possession to 482 - about 0.31 percent of total loans. Westpac shares were 1.6 percent lower in afternoon trade, compared with a 0.9 percent fall in the broader market.

The charge will reduce Westpac’s reported cash earnings for the six months to March by an additional A$357 million, raising the total hit for the half to A$617 million. The No.2 lender in Australia said the provision was related to remediation and potential refunds of service fees charged by its network of self-employed advisers, who received total advisory fees of A$966 million over 2008-2018. “While it is disappointing that we have needed to make these provisions ... our priority was to deal with any outstanding issues and process payments as quickly as possible,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer said. Westpac is due to report earnings on May 6, and analysts have largely priced in the extra charges in their estimates. All major Australian banks have increased provisions related to efforts to remediate customers for banking misconduct, under pressure from regulators after the Royal Commission last year revealed a widespread practice of illegally charging fees without providing services. While lenders have accounted for billions in potential liabilities related to wrongful charges by their employees, they have been slower to estimate the refunds of fees charged by their much larger network of self-employed financial advisers. Analysts believe that once those provisions are accounted for, the bulk of the remediation provisions related to known misconduct should be out of the way. They expect National Australia Bank to add to its A$1.1 billion in remediation provisions to account for its self-employed advisers, while Australia and New Zealand Banking Group is also expected to add to its provisions.

7.757106721635143," Australia's Westpac exits financial advice, takes charge to shake up wealth unit SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp, said on Tuesday it would exit its financial advice business, the last of Australia’s top four banks to do so, as regulators increase pressure on the scandal-ridden financial sector to act in customers’ best interests. Australia’s second-largest bank said it would sell the business to Viridian Advisory and merge the remaining of its BT Financial Group units - private banking, investment platforms and retirement funds - into its consumer and business divisions. It did not provide a deal value for the sale, but said it would take a restructuring charge of up to A$300 million ($213.2 million) that would be partially offset by the proceeds and A$20 million in productivity savings by 2020. “Rising costs and lower fees had meant that the advice business has been unprofitable for some time, and we see how much downside risk there is in terms of remediation and fines when we get it wrong,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer told analysts in Sydney. “We’re realigning our capabilities into the lines of business where it makes most sense based on customer needs.” Westpac’s exit from personal financial advice follows a year-long public inquiry into financial sector greed and wrongdoing which has put pressure on banks and wealth managers to fix serious problems with compliance, governance, ethics and accountability. Among other reforms, the inquiry called for banks to cut high fees paid to financial advisers to sell products such as life insurance regardless of whether they were in the best interests of clients. Last financial year, Westpac booked a A$380 million charge to account for refunds, the costs of remediating wronged customers and higher litigation costs. A number of Westpac’s salaried financial advisers and support staff would transition to Viridian and about 10,000 customers would be offered an option to move, Hartzer said. About 900 people would be made redundant. Westpac’s peers - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, and National Australia Bank - have all progressed plans to exit financial advisory franchises in a bid to cut costs and simplify their structures. Westpac changes were expected to be earnings per share-positive in 2020 with one-off costs from the sale, initially estimated at between A$250-A$300 million, to be spread over fiscal 2019 and 2020.

6.882550484794729," Australia's Westpac cuts teller bonuses to protect customers SYDNEY, March 7 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp said on Thursday it would scrap bonuses for thousands of branch tellers, a move to regain customer trust following accusations at a misconduct inquiry that incentives had led to wrongdoing. Westpac is the first of Australia’s major banks to ban bonuses for bank tellers in the wake of scorching criticism from the Royal Commission inquiry over aggressive sales tactics at financial services firms. From April 1, 2,300 Westpac bank tellers would have their salary lifted by A$500 ($351.65), while a bonus target of A$1,000 would be scrapped, the Sydney-based lender said in a statement. The bank operates the largest teller network in Australia. “A simple fixed-pay-only model takes us a step further to reinforce the importance of putting the customer first and providing our 2,300 tellers with more clarity and fairness around how their work is remunerated,” George Frazis, Westpac group consumer bank chief executive, said. Westpac tellers were currently eligible for the bonus depending on a number of factors, including the features of the products they sell, the location of their branches and customer satisfaction measures, the bank said. The change would apply to tellers at Westpac and its three Australian subsidiaries - St. George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA. Other Westpac retail staff would continue to receive bonuses. Executives from Westpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia are scheduled to be grilled by a parliamentary committee on Friday about how they are responding to the Royal Commission’s recommendations.

The case comes with Australia’s financial services sector under great pressure to reform after a public inquiry uncovered widespread misconduct, including charging customers fees for no service, irresponsible lending and deception of regulators. Westpac had already agreed to pay a A$35 million ($25 million) fine for wrongly approving thousands of mortgages in a similar case filed by Australia’s corporate regulator last year. Under Australian law, banks must check that loans are suitable for borrowers. “This case will seek to prove that Westpac failed to comply with these obligations and that this failure caused substantial losses for many consumers,” said Ben Slade, a lawyer at Maurice Blackburn, the firm that filed the class-action lawsuit. Funding for the case will come from Britain-based Harbour Litigation Funding and covers borrowers who took loans from the bank after 2011. Westpac, the country’s oldest bank and the largest by assets, said it takes its responsible lending obligations very seriously and will be defending the case. A powerful inquiry into Australia’s finance sector excoriated the nation’s lenders and said that poor treatment of customers was driven by greed, although it has not recommended major structural changes to the industry. In its case against the regulator, Westpac accepted that it had breached consumer lending law when its automated loan approval system failed to consider borrowers’ living expenses when deciding if they could repay a home loan. Of 260,000 loans approved over a three-and-a-half-year period from 2011 to 2015, Westpac ignored living expenses for 50,000 and miscalculated another 50,000 borrowers’ ability to repay their debts.

The Sydney-based bank also reported a rise in mortgage customers struggling to pay their loans, another sign of pressure on the engine room of the country’s retail banking sector. The result reflects the back-to-basics strategy of Australia’s big lenders as they raise lending rates and cut costs to weather the biggest property downturn in a generation. That is against a backdrop of a regulatory crackdown on retail lending, fuelled by a misconduct inquiry into the finance sector which ended this month. Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the country’s biggest lender, and fourth-ranked National Australia Bank Ltd, posted weaker than expected earnings in recent weeks . In a limited trading update, Westpac said cash earnings were A$2.04 billion ($1.5 billion) for the three months to end-December. It did not give a comparable result for the same quarter a year earlier, but it made cash earnings of A$4.25 billion for the prior first half, implying a higher quarterly figure of about A$2.13 billion. Its net interest margin, excluding treasury and markets units, rose by an unspecified amount, as its decision to raise mortgage rates without a change in the central bank rate paid off. Westpac shares rose as much as 1 percent before easing to trade slightly higher by midsession, in line with the broader market. “Margins have responded to the repricing which is good ... and they’re keeping expenses under control, given that there’s not much income growth,” said Brett Le Mesurier, senior banking analyst at Shaw and Partners. Citi analysts said in a note that the bank had “continued the recent sector trend of weak profit growth (but) the core banking business appears in-line with our expectations”. Westpac owns Australia’s second-biggest mortgage book after CBA. It said mortgage delinquencies rose four basis points, or 0.04 of a percentage point, over the quarter, and investment mortgage loans grew just 0.8 percent. In a show of the tougher regulatory climate for banks, the country’s corporate regulator also said on Monday that it had filed an appeal against a court ruling which found Westpac staff did not offer “personal advice” to clients during a 2014 promotion."

The move comes as business and banking regulators are under heavy pressure to file suits - and win them - against big banks after a public inquiry excoriated the financial sector for widespread misdeeds and badly treating its customers. Regulators were particularly criticised for allowing that to happen on their watch and for being reluctant to sue, prompting a tougher stance from watchdogs in the sector. Australia’s Federal Court found last year that Westpac and its funds management division had failed to treat customers honestly when it asked them to shift their superannuation savings into the lender’s accounts. But it rejected an argument by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that sales staff at the lender and its subsidiaries had offered “personal advice” to clients during the 2014 promotional drive and so breached licence conditions. “The dividing line between personal and general advice is one of the most important provisions within the financial services laws,” ASIC Deputy Chair Daniel Crennan said in a statement. “It directly impacts the standard of advice received by consumers. This is why ASIC brought this test case and ASIC believes further consideration by the Full Court of the Federal Court is necessary to better inform consumers and industry,” he said.

0.4314936853311993," Australia's Westpac says banks may face problems hitting new capital targets SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's big banks may struggle to raise the amount of extra capital they require under new rules proposed by the country's banking regulator, a senior executive at Westpac Banking Corporation WBC.AX said in an interview published on Monday. The mooted requirements, which the country’s four largest lenders said would mean they need to raise between A$67 billion and A$83 billion over four years ($48 billion to $60 billion) are sound in principle but tough to achieve, Westpac treasurer Curt Zuber told the Australian Financial Review newspaper. “As we go through cycles, it is potentially problematic for the banks to get the volumes they need in an economic way for the system which allows for the balance we want to achieve,” he said. The comments signal the first public push-back from the banks since the proposal - the third such request in as many years - was announced by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) last November. It also comes as the sector braces for tougher scrutiny after a scathing public inquiry into the finance industry uncovered widespread bad behavior and mismanagement. “It is a big number ... the market as it stands today is not big enough to cope with that level of issues,” said Morningstar banking analyst David Ellis. “But as the banks continue to raise tier 2 bonds, their balance sheets become stronger as far as the buyers are concerned,” he said, adding that overall it would probably increase funding costs only modestly. APRA said it wants the country’s four biggest lenders to raise their available capital by 4 to 5 percentage points by 2023 from the current 14.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets. The buffer would bring Australian banks in line with new international standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and adopted by Canada and European Union countries, APRA said Banks could use any form of capital to meet the higher requirements, although APRA anticipated the most economical way to source it would be Tier 2 subordinated debt capital. It is seeking feedback from the lenders until Feb. 8.

13.329316830986338," Australian court dismisses regulator claim against Westpac SYDNEY, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp did not breach its licence during a drive to boost its pension funds, an Australian court found on Friday, dismissing a regulator’s claim even as it chided the bank for failing to treat its customers honestly. The Federal Court found that Westpac’s sales campaign in 2014 that involved contacting customers and asking them to shift superannuation funds into the company’s accounts did not amount to providing financial advice against licence conditions. The ruling is a blow for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which is already under pressure for allowing bad behaviour to proliferate following damaging revelations of misconduct at a recently concluded inquiry into the financial sector. ASIC had brought the case against Westpac and its funds-management arm, BT Funds Management, in 2016 alleging they had broken licence conditions. For Westpac, and its BT division, the dismissal means no fine will be imposed, but the court’s criticism is still an embarrassing admonishment for a big Australian bank after a year of near constant scandal in the sector. Judge Jacqueline Gleeson said she was persuaded that Westpac had failed to act honestly and fairly since the campaign was aimed at benefiting the bank rather than customers. “Westpac focused on its own interests and did not seek to act in the best interests of its customers,” she said. The bank contacted customers by mail and phone offering to help them shift money from other superannuation savings accounts as part of its sales campaign that boosted its own holdings by about A$650 million ($460 million) between 2013 and 2016, Gleeson said in a written judgement. But after reviewing transcripts of 15 phone conversations from 2014 that prompted the case, Gleeson rejected arguments by ASIC that the calls amounted to “personal advice” provided without proper process or qualifications. That scuttled the regulator’s position that the bank had breached its banking licence. An ASIC spokesman said the regulator was reviewing the judgement. Westpac, Australia’s second-biggest bank, had argued its sales team never purported to be offering advice and were only conveying a marketing message. The bank said it was considering the implications of the judgement in a filing. Earlier, its shares closed down 1 percent, in line with the broader market.

3.6452711163634826," Shareholder revolt hits Australia's Westpac bank after a year of pain SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp shareholders voted against its executive remuneration plans on Wednesday, dealing a symbolic blow to Australia’s second-biggest lender after a year in which the finance sector has been rocked by misconduct allegations. Owners of nearly two thirds of the company’s shares voted against its executive remuneration report, at least double the number required to shoot it down, as a host of small shareholders and large pension funds voiced their disapproval at its annual meeting. Under Australian corporate rules, if more than a quarter of shareholders vote against a pay proposal for two years running, they can call for the board to be removed. The vote against Westpac was its first, although larger Commonwealth Bank of Australia received a first “strike” in 2016. “The board acknowledges the significant concerns that you have raised,” Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted told the meeting in Perth. “We’re here to represent your interests and we will think deeply about the concerns that have been expressed.” Billions of dollars have been wiped off the value of Australia’s big banks this year as a public inquiry into the financial sector exposed a greed-driven culture in which staff were incentivized to mislead customers. In one case, a blind pensioner told the inquiry Westpac had made her sign a form she could not read to guarantee her daughter’s pool maintenance business, and then went after her house when the business failed. Maxsted told shareholders Westpac had already cut short-term executive bonuses by 25 percent even though not all wrongdoing exposed at the inquiry was representative of the bank. But Louise Davidson, CEO of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) which represents 39 large funds, said shareholders had sent a “loud message” that Westpac’s pay practices needed to change. “Investors’ view is that reducing bonuses by 25 percent just didn’t cut it,” she told Reuters. ACSI, which says its members own about 10 percent of each of Australia’s top 200 companies and the biggest pension fund, would vote against the executive pay proposals of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank Ltd at their meetings in coming weeks. CBA held its meeting in November. Westpac shares shares rose 1.7 percent on Wednesday, in line with a broader market. The Royal Commission inquiry is due to hand in its final report by February."

-1.2169311796333693," Australian court rejects regulator's record fine against Westpac SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court refused on Tuesday to approve a record A$35 million ($25 million) fine imposed on Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX by the corporate regulator for using inappropriate calculations to determine if customers could afford home loans. The decision is a further blow to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), after a public inquiry into the financial sector found it had failed to stop systemic wrongdoing by the major banks. ASIC’s announcement in September that Westpac had agreed to pay the fine was seen as a badly needed victory for the regulator as it attempts to rebuild its reputation as a tough cop on the beat. But Federal Court Judge Nye Perram declined to allow the penalty on the grounds that ASIC had failed to prove the bank’s wrongdoing and had not demonstrated how it had calculated the fine. “It is unworkable to assess the reasonableness of the penalty if it is not known what is to be penalized,” Perram said in a written judgment. “The court should not be expected to approve a record penalty without being told why. I accept the need for the court to encourage settlements in this area but the desirability of doing so does not permit the court to become a rubber stamp.” An ASIC spokesman said the regulator was reviewing the judgment and declined to comment further. A Westpac spokesman was not immediately available for comment. On Nov. 9, in a separate matter, another federal court judge rejected ASIC’s argument that Westpac should be fined A$58 million for inappropriately handling negotiations of a key bank rate. The judge in that case said Westpac should pay just A$3.3 million, the amount the bank had offered to pay. Westpac shares were down 5.4 percent on Tuesday morning, in a weaker overall market, after trading ex-dividend."

-1.921090239578835," Australia's Westpac fined $2.4 million in rate case, fraction of penalty sought SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX won vindication of its decision to fight accusations its conduct in handling of a key rate was unconscionable as an Australian court fined it A$3.3 million ($2.4 million), far less than the sum sought by a regulator. A federal court judge largely cleared Westpac in May of accusations it interfered with negotiations for an important internal price-setting measure called the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), but said its actions still amounted to unconscionable conduct. The bank and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) have since been haggling in court over Westpac’s fine, and on Friday the judge rejected the regulator’s argument that the bank be made to pay A$58 million. “I have to apply the law as it was at the time, not what it should have been,” the judge, Jonathan Beach, wrote in his judgment. The relatively small penalty for the A$95 billion market capitalization company brings a rare bright spot to an industry facing a daily drumbeat of negative publicity as a public inquiry into financial misconduct grinds on. The inquiry has also drawn criticism about the effectiveness of Australia’s financial regulators, putting pressure on ASIC to show it can rein in the industry. For the BBSW case, ASIC brought lawsuits against all of the country’s Big Four lenders alleging they rigged the rate but Westpac was the only one of the four to defend the case. The other three, Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX and National Australia Bank Ltd NAB.AX, agreed to settle before the matter went to hearings, and pay fines totaling A$125 million. Justice Beach said ASIC’s argument that Westpac should pay A$58 million for 58 instances of wrongdoing had “all the irreconcilable atonality of a Schoenberg composition”, an apparent reference to the 20th century expressionist composer Arnold Schoenberg. A Westpac spokesman declined to comment on Friday. An ASIC statement quoted Commissioner Cathie Armour welcoming the decision, and saying: “ASIC’s actions have led to these successful court outcomes, and also contributed to new benchmark manipulation offences being enacted by Parliament”."

2.9290828741436297," UPDATE 2-Australia's Westpac says profit hurt as legal costs, refunds mount * Westpac reports flat annual earnings, H2 down 10 pct * Profits hurt by costs of remediating customers, lower margins * Westpac CEO says house prices to cool further (Adds details on H2 performance, CEO comments on outlook, inquiry costs, background, shares) SYDNEY, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Australia’s second-biggest lender Westpac Banking Corp reported flat annual cash earnings growth on Monday, missing expectations, as refunds and legal costs soared in the wake of a damaging public inquiry. Westpac said higher costs for remediation and mortgage-funding hurt profit after the inquiry into financial-sector misconduct exposed widespread wrongdoing and poor governance across the industry. “While the economic environment remains supportive, this result reflects the tough operating conditions for banks, with higher regulatory, compliance, and funding costs, and increased competitive pressure,” Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said in a statement. Cash earnings for the year to Sept. 30 were A$8.07 billion ($5.8 billion), dragged down by a 10 percent decline during the second half as Westpac began compensating wronged customers and borrowing costs crimped margins. The result was lower than an average estimate of A$8.18 billion from six analysts polled by Reuters. Cash profit, a measure that excludes one-offs and non-cash accounting items, is closely watched by investors. The powerful inquiry known as a Royal Commission has heard that banks were lending without doing basic customer checks, took fees from customers’ accounts without providing them with services, and incentivised staff to commit fraud. In one case, Westpac admitted to signing up a legally blind pensioner as loan guarantor for her daughter’s business without warning her of the risks, and then threatened to evict her when the business failed. Westpac said it had booked a A$380 million charge to account for refunds, the costs of remediating wronged customers and higher litigation costs. It also spent an extra A$62 million in expenses associated with the inquiry. Earlier in the year, Westpac admitted it had acted “unconscionably” when it attempted to manipulate a key money market rate, and agreed to pay a A$35 million fine for wrongly approving thousands of mortgages. Net interest income during the second half fell three percent, hit by lower markets income, subdued growth in home loans and higher funding costs. “We expect house prices to cool further, and investor demand to remain weak,” Hartzer said. He said consumers are likely to be more cautious in the face of flat wages growth and a soft housing market amid uncertainty ahead of a federal election due by May 2019. Property consultant CoreLogic last week said home prices nationally had fallen for a 13th straight month in October, leading to an annual fall of 3.5 percent, the weakest since February 2012. Net interest margin - a barometer of profitability - from its flagship consumer lending arm fell 26 percent during the half, hurt by higher short-term interest rates and remediation costs. That was in line with falls at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank, which reported lower full-year profit last week, dragged by remediation costs and lower margins. Westpac shares were 0.08 percent higher on Monday trading at A$26.48, while the broader market was 0.37 percent lower.

The mea culpas from the heads of Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp, encapsulated the apologetic tone of a sector which was defiant until the explosive inquiry began in February. It has since aired accounts of banks mistreating customers by charging fees without providing service, taking charges from dead people’s bank accounts and paying bonuses for selling products people did not need. “It’s very clear with all the things that have come out ... that the Royal Commission has been a very valuable process,” Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer told a parliamentary hearing, referring to the quasi-judicial inquiry. CBA boss Matt Comyn told the same Senate committee hearing the bank was wrong to oppose a Royal Commission. Australian bank bosses are required to appear for regular public questioning by parliament but have not faced public interrogation by the Royal Commission’s barristers. Comyn was the first to appear before the Senate committee since the Royal Commission commenced in February. The commission has stunned the corporate sector of the world’s No. 14 economy, which is bracing for the fallout in the form of tougher regulation, stiffer penalties, higher compliance costs and fines. The valuations of the country’s top money managers are down A$64 billion ($45 billion) this year. Last month the judge running the inquiry slammed banks’ focus on profit over customers in an interim report. Westpac’s Hartzer said the report was “searing (and) pointed out a lot of things that we need to do better.” Comyn said incentives had helped create the corporate culture which permitted abuses, and that the bank had cut A$100 million a year in incentives. Asked why it took the Royal Commission to make the bank fix its culture, Comyn said: “I don’t think there’s an acceptable explanation ... other than to say we have been too slow to get to the root cause.” He said the bank had fired 41 staff for misconduct this year, while nine more had resigned under investigation for matters likely to result in termination. Not all were directly linked to the Royal Commission. Shares in CBA and Westpac were down about 2.7 percent, in line with global declines.

-4.146054983209703," UPDATE 2-Australia's Westpac fined for bad mortgage system amid bank inquiry * Westpac admits failing to check mortgage applications properly * Inquiry is putting pressure on regulator to act * Analysts say financial impact from ASIC fine “immaterial” (Recasts on regulator crackdown, adds shares, analysts) SYDNEY, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp agreed to pay a record A$35 million ($25 million) fine for wrongly approving thousands of mortgages, in a sign regulators are taking steps to tame the financial sector amid damaging revelations from an inquiry. With this settlement, two out of three lawsuits brought this year by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission against the nation’s No.2 lender have been resolved. The ASIC has previously also taken action against units of Goldman Sachs and wealth management giant AMP Ltd, while charging Citigroup with rigging a capital raising. Westpac’s ASIC settlement comes at a time when Australia is beefing up scrutiny and control of its A$100 billion financial services sector as an inquiry airs allegations of widespread misconduct, including charging customers fees for no service, irresponsible lending and deception of regulators. “This is a very positive outcome and sends a strong regulatory message to industry that non-compliance with the responsible lending obligations will not be tolerated,” ASIC Chairman James Shipton said in a statement, of the Westpac fine. Analysts, however, said the financial impact from the fine would be “immaterial” given it was only a fraction of Westpac’s latest A$8 billion annual profit. Shares of the lender slipped 0.8 percent on Tuesday, in line slight losses in the broader market. “Given this settlement appears to cover off on a relatively wide range of loans ... this should somewhat alleviate the market’s concern around the regulatory risk relating to WBC’s responsible lending requirements,” Goldman Sachs said in a note. ASIC said the country’s oldest bank had breached consumer lending law when its automated loan approval system failed to consider people’s declared living expenses when deciding if they could repay a home loan. Of 260,000 loans approved over a three-and-a-half-year period from 2011-2015, Westpac ignored living expenses for 50,000 and miscalculated another 50,000 borrowers’ ability to repay their debts. The bank should not have approved about 10,500 loans, it added, or four percent of the total. The A$35 million fine, which still must be approved by a court, is the highest for a breach of consumer lending laws, ASIC said. Westpac accepted ASIC’s allegations in a statement. The inappropriately approved loans have performed similarly to other loans, it said, adding it was monitoring them. “Westpac takes its responsible lending obligations very seriously and this action does not relate to our current lending practices,” said its consumer bank CEO, George Frazis. Earlier this year, Westpac was found to have the riskiest mortgage-book among the four banks dominating about 80 percent of the Australian market, according to UBS analysts. ASIC also sued Westpac in June over a financial planner it alleged gave poor advice for years. The regulator has come under pressure to prove its effectiveness with the inquiry airing sometimes daily allegations of wrongdoing. Last month, the chairman of the country’s sovereign wealth fund accused it of being “not awake at the wheel”. The regulator also lost one of its cases against Westpac when a court accepted the bank’s defence that it did not intentionally rig a key bank trading rate. According to CLSA banking analyst Brian Johnson, the fine amounts to “being beaten around the head with a feather duster”. TS Lim, a banking analyst at Bell Potter, however, pointed out that while the settlement was “not material”, the fact that Westpac was taking steps to remediate the issue was a positive.

-5.656201640538142," UPDATE 2-Australia's Westpac hikes mortgage rates; shares climb * To raise rates by 14 basis points, from Sept. 19 * Decision out of lockstep with the central bank * Westpac shares close 2.7 pct higher at A$28.88 (Recasts lead, adds industry context, stock’s closing level) SYDNEY, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp became the nation’s first major lender on Wednesday to raise its key mortgage rates in an effort to preserve its profit margins amid higher wholesale funding costs. Westpac, Australia’s No.2 lender, said its variable home loan rates would rise by 14 basis points from Sept. 19, sparking speculation other banks would follow suit. Investors cheered the move, sending Westpac’s shares 2.7 percent higher. The decision is out of lockstep with the country’s central bank which has kept the official cash rate at a record low 1.50 percent since 2016 and signalled a steady path for some time. The move knocked the Australian dollar lower as traders wagered the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) might be forced to keep policy stimulatory for longer in the face of a de-facto tightening in the market. With four out of every five loans in Australia priced in variable interest rates, the impact of Westpac’s move will be felt by a large number of households. “This is a tough decision,” George Frazis, Westpac’s head of consumer bank, said in a statement. The Bank Bill Swap Rate, a key wholesale funding rate used to price mortgages and other products, jumped about 25 basis points between February and March and has since remained elevated, Frazis said. The spike in the funding costs had prompted several analysts to predict mortgage rate hikes by banks earlier this year. But faced with public anger over a series of malpractices, the country’s major banks had refrained from passing on the cost. The “Big Four” - Westpac, ANZ, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank - together control about 80 percent of the country’s deposit and home loan markets, and are some of the world’s most profitable lenders. “We initially hoped that this increase would be temporary, and therefore we have incurred these costs over the last six months,” Frazis said. “The rate changes announced today will not recover these costs.” Just last week, Westpac reported an eye-watering 11 basis point drop in its net interest margins, the difference between interest paid and earned, to 2.06 percent for the quarter ended June. The bank’s variable mortgage rate for owner-occupier properties will increase to 5.38 percent per annum for customers with principal and interest repayments, from Sept. 19 The rate for residential investment properties will go up to 5.93 percent, the bank said. The 14 basis-point increase will add A$35 ($25.6) to the monthly interest cost of an average mortgage of A$300,000, Westpac said while noting about 68 percent of its home loan customers were ahead of their repayments. The median price for a home in Sydney, Australia’s biggest city, has topped A$1 million in the past couple of years, forcing new borrowers to take out much larger loans. Sydney and Melbourne comprise about 60 percent of Australia’s housing market by value and 40 percent by number. Westpac’s shares jumped to the day’s high of A$29.02 before closing at A$28.88, up 2.7 percent."

The drop in net interest margin (NIM), a key gauge of profitability for banks, comes at a time of subdued credit growth in the country, where tighter lending and hikes in short-term interest rates are squeezing housing loan earnings. Westpac said its NIM, the difference between interest paid and earned, shrank 11 basis points to 2.06 percent in the quarter ended June, compared to 2.17 percent at the end of the six months to March and the lowest since the first half of 2015. Shares of the lender fell almost 3 percent to its weakest in two months in a broader market that was mostly steady. “The NIM outcome is disappointing,” Morgans banking analyst Azib Khan said. “They are really calling out the negative here,” he said, adding that higher funding costs were hurting the broader banking sector. Growth in Australian home loans fell to a four-year low of 5.6 percent in June, while short-term funding costs had more than doubled from their levels in August 2017. According to Moody’s Investment Service, many small and midsize banks have raised their home loan rates in the face of higher wholesale costs and slower loan growth. But Australia’s four major banks, which dominate about 80 percent of the home loan market, have held off so far, partly due to intense public scrutiny amid a powerful national inquiry that has led to damaging revelations of widespread misconduct in Australia’s financial sector. Two of the ‘Big Four’ – Commonwealth Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Corp - have in fact lowered some mortgage rates to attract borrowers. Credit ratings agencies have warned that borrowers, hit by the rising costs of living, could struggle to cover principal and interest payments for a record amount of home loans taken out in 2014-2015 that are set to become due soon. Westpac noted delinquencies were rising across most states, with the overall percentage of loans that are 90-days overdue three basis points higher during the June quarter. It also flagged higher stressed exposures in its corporate property and retail portfolio over the same period. Westpac’s home loan book, however, grew at 6 percent for the 12 months June, faster than the other three major banks. “Whilst the NIM outcome is weak there is an offsetting outcome which is the strong loan growth,” Khan said. Westpac said total stressed assets fell slightly in the third quarter and it also reported lower impairments in its smaller mining and New Zealand dairy portfolios. Its common equity Tier-1 capital ratio dipped to 10.4 percent at the end of June from 10.5 percent at end-March. It did not disclose profit or revenue numbers in its disclosures. The bank will report full-year results in November. (Additional reporting By Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Himani Sarkar)"

-8.287291560571104," Australia's Westpac to lend A$100 million to drought-hit farmers SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp said on Thursday it would disburse A$100 million ($74.2 million) in cheap loans to farmers as a record dry spell hits parts of the nation, while the country’s lenders fight to regain public trust amidst an ongoing misconduct inquiry. The drought in Australia’s east, one of the worst on record, is impacting every area of rural life, often with global trade and price implications. Already many cattle graziers are being forced to sell stock they can no longer feed. Westpac will offer some affected farmers loans at “heavily-discounted” rates and would also give impacted customers the option to defer their loans for up to 12 months, Australia’s second largest lender said in a statement. “This is the first time in Westpac’s 200-year history that we have set aside such an amount to provide immediate and long-term financial relief to our agribusiness customers,” National Agribusiness Manager at Westpac said. The Sydney-based lender said it had expended its agribusiness team by 15 percent to offer options to customers such as financial relief from deferred debt repayments and fee wavers. It did not specify the discounted rates on offer. Farm banking in hot, dusty Australia has long been tough and although it is a small component of overall books, rural loans are some of the riskiest and most politically sensitive. Last month, Westpac’s smaller rival, National Australia Bank, moved to soothe public anger after a major misconduct inquiry showed it dealt harshly with rural borrowers in distress, saying it won’t penalize farmers for loan defaults due to the drought. The other two members of Australia’s powerful banking oligopoly controlling about 80 percent of the market - Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - have also moved in recent weeks to offer farmers some relief. CBA offered offset accounts on their mortgages, while ANZ said it would suspend loan repayment for up to three months, waive restructuring fees and committed not to increase interest rates to distressed customers. Neither of Westpac’s three competitors quantified the cost of their drought-relief measures."

-3.066050368596991," Australia's Westpac to forgo all conflicted product commissions SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second-biggest lender, Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX, said on Wednesday it would stop paying its staff commission for selling its own products, a practice at risk of being banned following a banking inquiry. Laws introduced in July 2013 let banks reward their financial advisers with commission for recommending their own investment and insurance products, provided the clients hired the adviser before that date. But an independent inquiry has revealed banks have relied heavily on the so-called grandfathered provision to charge ongoing fees to clients, thousands of whom have not received the advisory services they paid for. Lawyers running the quasi-judicial Royal Commission inquiry have suggested the country’s largest banks put an end to the practice, a sign they may make a formal recommendation to ban it when the inquiry reports to the government in early 2019. On Wednesday, Westpac said more than 140,000 customer accounts were exposed to the conflicted commissions and that it would stop the payments from Oct. 1. “We have considered this position from both a customer and a stakeholder perspective and decided that it is the right time to draw a line under these past arrangements and eliminate them as far as we are contractually able,” Westpac said in a statement. The lender said it would honor existing arrangements to pay commission to external financial advisers who recommend Westpac and BT products relying on the legacy rule. The move comes ahead of significant reforms expected to be recommended by the powerful misconduct inquiry into Australia’s A$100 billion financial services in February. The inquiry has already exposed widespread misconduct in the advice and wealth management units of the largest banks and financial services companies such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX and AMP Ltd AMP.AX, which also rely on rolling product commissions. Westpac announced the change less than a week after the corporate regulator filed a lawsuit against it for a financial planner who gave poor advice to customers or charged them fees without giving any advice, while employed by the bank. In a submission to the inquiry, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX argued against the removal of the provisions allowing legacy product commission. The bank, which has sold the bulk of its advisory network to IOOF IFL.AX, said in May it would stop paying bonuses to financial planners for selling its products in response to the widespread misconduct in the sector unmasked by the inquiry."
-3.7754255379809734," Australian regulator sues Westpac for staffer's poor financial advice SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian regulator filed a lawsuit against No. 2 lender Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX over a financial planner it alleges gave poor advice for years, upping its scrutiny of a sector already under fire amid an embarrassing public inquiry. Australia’s A$5 billion ($3.7 billion) financial planning sector has provided some of the most damning evidence at an inquiry into finance sector misconduct, ordered by the government after a string of banking scandals including fraud. Amid the backlash, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Friday said it filed a Federal Court lawsuit alleging that Westpac was liable for a financial planner in its employment failing to act in the best interests of customers, as well as for the planner’s inappropriate financial advice and failure to prioritize the client interests. Court documents made public by ASIC showed the regulator was seeking fines plus declarations the bank failed to do everything necessary to provide financial services “efficiently, honestly and fairly”. ASIC said the country’s Corporations Act came with a maximum penalty of A$1 million ($746,400) for each wrongdoing, without specifying how many instances of wrongdoing its lawsuit alleged. Westpac said it was reviewing the case and would cooperate with the regulator to resolve proceedings as soon as possible. It said it identified compliance concerns with, and fired, the planner in question in 2014, then “proactively initiated remediation to identify and compensate affected customers”. The year-long inquiry into the financial sector, called a Royal Commission, has heard evidence of fraud and allegations of board-level misconduct since it began in February, including misleading a regulator about allowing financial planners to charge for advice without giving it. The chairman, chief executive and several directors of the country's biggest wealth manager, AMP Ltd AMP.AX, have stood down over accusations of financial planner wrongdoing, while the country's third-largest lender, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX, has said it would stop paying planners bonuses for selling its products. The former Westpac planner has not appeared at the Royal Commission. However, another parliamentary hearing in 2017 heard the planner charged 177 clients over six years without providing advice. While the latest lawsuit stemmed from one former planner, the regulator said the bank breached part of the law “which requires Westpac to do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by its license are provided efficiently, honestly and fairly, and to comply with financial services laws”. The lawsuit is the regulator’s second against Westpac in a year. Last month, the bank was cleared by a court of allegations leveled by ASIC that it rigged a key rate to boost profit. Australian bank shares have been hammered by the Royal Commission, losing more than A$50 billion in market value since hearings began. On Friday, Westpac shares closed 2 percent higher along with the broader market .AXJO, but are still down 11 percent since the inquiry started. The regulator said the matter would have its first court hearing on July 19."

-5.631166528695601," Australia's Westpac cleared of rate rigging but bank inquiry sword stays (This version of the May 24 story corrects first name of judge to Jonathan from David in paragraph 6.) SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX was cleared by a court of accusations it rigged a key rate to boost profit, but the win on Thursday against a regulator was dampened by an additional finding of unconscionable conduct by the bank. The mostly favorable ruling for the No. 2 Australian lender was a rare bright spot for an industry facing daily allegations of malfeasance and fraud in a year-long public inquiry that has wiped billions of dollars from companies’ market values. It also puts pressure on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which brought the case against Westpac, to step up its policing. The regulator has faced criticism in the same inquiry for failing to rein in the country’s biggest financial industry participants. In a series of civil lawsuits, ASIC accused the country’s “big four” banks of rigging the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) - a benchmark interest rate in Australia used to price trillions of dollars of assets - to inflate profit. Westpac, which was accused of rate rigging from 2010 to 2012, was the only bank to defend the action after the other three - Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, National Australia Bank NAB.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX - settled before hearings began. “In summary, I have rejected ASIC’s case,” Federal Court judge Jonathan Beach said. However, he noted that while Westpac did not break the law its actions amounted to “unconscionable conduct and misleading or deceptive conduct”. The bank also contravened its financial services obligations through “inadequate procedures and training”, the judge added. “This is a very significant and positive outcome for the integrity of Australia’s financial markets,” an ASIC spokesman said. ASIC had argued that communications within the bank and with outside traders that included expletive-ridden exchanges captured in email records and telephone recordings showed them boasting about how much money they had made from BBSW fixes. But those messages were “open to competing interpretations, particularly when understood in context”, the judge said. “Westpac is committed to working with regulators in a constructive manner including when we have a genuine difference of opinion,” the bank said in a statement. Its shares were down 0.4 percent after the verdict, in line with the broader market .AXJO, but are down 10 percent since the so-called Royal Commission began in February. “This looks to be a win in that there wasn’t much actual impact from their actions but a moral loss in that they did do the wrong thing,” said a fund manager referring to Westpac. The investor, who owns Westpac shares, asked not to be identified because of rules in Australia that restrict commentary on court matters. Spokespeople for CBA, NAB and ANZ declined to comment. Australia's neighbor New Zealand is also scrutinizing its financial industry, which has a significant presence of big Australian banks and its top wealth manager AMP AMP.AX. Thomas Clarke, a professor at University of Technology, Sydney’s business school, said Thursday’s court verdict was unlikely to ease the public pressure on banks and ASIC. “It’s a small win for Westpac and a small win for ASIC in amongst a catastrophic series of revelations for the big four banks and AMP, from which they will not recover very readily,” Clarke said. AMP has lost its CEO, chairman and several board members over the inquiry. “The focus is also on ASIC for seeming to treat the big banks with a velvet glove,” added Clarke."

-0.37069712288053736," Australia's Westpac pushed pie shop owner to repay loan, inquiry told SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX repeatedly phoned and texted the owner of a failed pie shop to demand repayment of a loan, the shop owner said on Tuesday, as a financial inquiry focused on abuses in small business lending. The testimony by former Pie Face kiosk owner Marion Messih was the second time this week Westpac faced criticism at the inquiry over how it approved loans to small businesses. Australia’s “big four” lenders have already admitted to misconduct in their submissions to the inquiry’s third round of public hearings, which focus on small business lending. Messih, a bookkeeper by trade, told the inquiry she wanted to change jobs and decided to buy a Pie Face store in 2012. She said the franchisee offered her a kiosk in a shopping mall complete with sales projections, and told her to move her home and investment property mortgages to Westpac “as a requirement with Pie Face”. Messih said she shared the loan with her brother’s wife. When the 80-store Pie Face chain collapsed in 2015, Westpac sent her weekly text messages and phoned to demand repayment of the A$362,500 loan, Messih said. With no income, Messih sold her investment property and expected the bank to put the proceeds into her savings account. “The day before settlement, I get an email saying ‘no, we are not going to do that, we are going to take 100 percent owing on the business loan from the sale of the property,” Messih said, pausing at times with emotion. The bank recouped the entire loan from the property sale and Messih’s sister-in-law was now paying her back in weekly instalments, she said. “To continually get phone calls from institutions about ‘where’s your payment’ was something that I’m not used to,” Messih said. “I still owe money when I should be retired by now. But I still owe money,” she said, without explaining further. “MORE FORM THAN SUBSTANCE” Kenneth Hayne, a retired judge, is leading the year-long Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. Hayne said he has been deluged with public submissions and wants to use case studies to highlight broader problems in the financial sector, which contributes $100 billion a year to Australia’s economy. Speaking before Messih’s testimony, Westpac’s head of commercial banking, Alastair Welsh, said he agreed with Hayne’s comment that the bank’s procedure for approving business loans was “more form than substance”. The big four banks - Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank - have admitted to other transgressions, including fraudulent loans and overcharging customers. On Monday, the inquiry heard from a woman who said Westpac ordered her to sell her house because she had guaranteed her daughter’s business loan without knowing she was risking her home. Less than halfway into its year-long investigation, the Royal Commission has prompted the banks to impose stricter lending conditions on borrowers, triggering fears the economy will experience a new era of subdued credit growth. Several senior executives at wealth manager AMP and Commonwealth Bank have lost their jobs as boards across the industry attempt to rebuild public trust. The government has also pledged to boost the powers of the corporate watchdog, double maximum prison terms and boost fines for corporate crime.

0.3239063029936984," Westpac made blind pensioner a guarantor without risk advice, inquiry hears SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp admitted on Monday to signing up a legally blind pensioner as loan guarantor for her daughter’s business without warning her of the risks, then threatened to evict her when the business failed. The testimony, given to a powerful inquiry into the country’s financial sector, came as Australia’s “big four” lenders all admitted to misconduct in their submissions to a third round of public hearings that focuses on loans to small businesses. Other transgressions included fraudulent loans and double-charging interest, the inquiry heard, a further hit to the sector’s reputation after previous rounds of hearings uncovered widespread abuses in Australia’s financial planning industry. Carolyn Flanagan, a pensioner who also has difficulty hearing, testified that Westpac did not advise her to get independent legal and financial advice when her daughter took her into a branch in 2010 and asked for her to be made guarantor for a loan to buy a pool services business. “They just point to where I should sign. Sometimes he goes up the page, sometimes he goes down,” Flanagan said via videolink because she was too sick to travel to Melbourne for the hearing. When the business failed, Westpac ordered Flanagan to sell her house to recoup its loan. Flanagan eventually kept her house with the help of a public lawyer. Westpac’s head of commercial banking, Alastair Welsh, told the inquiry the bank followed its formal processes with Flanagan but agreed the bank manager who approved her arrangement should have taken special care considering her disabilities. “You’d expect that any person would be very thoughtful about that and make sure that she did understand what she was doing,” Welsh said in the witness box. In other submissions to the inquiry by the banks, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said it was aware that 47 fraudulent business loans had been extended last year, said Michael Hodge, senior counsel assisting the inquiry. Commonwealth Bank of Australia admitted to systematically double-charging interest to some business customers over many years and failed to tell the regulator about the problem in a timely manner, he also said. National Australia Bank had also admitted to overcharging customers due to incorrect calculations of interest rates and double-charging fees, he added. Media representatives for the banks told Reuters that it would not be appropriate to comment out of respect for the proceedings. Kenneth Hayne, the former judge presiding over the Royal Commission, also said on Monday he had been swamped with more than 5,500 submissions detailing misconduct by banks, 11 percent of which were related to small and medium-sized businesses. Less than halfway into a year-long investigation, the commission has prompted the banks to impose stricter lending conditions on borrowers, triggering fears the economy will be the victim of a new era of subdued credit growth as a result. Several senior executives at AMP and CBA have lost their jobs as boards across the industry attempt to rebuild public trust. The Australian government has also pledged to boost the powers of the corporate watchdog, double maximum prison terms and massively increase financial penalties for corporate crime. Shares in the big four banks and AMP have lost a combined A$37 billion ($28 billion) in market value since the hearings began in February. AMP has been the biggest loser by percentage, tumbling 24 percent, followed by CBA which has fallen 12 percent."

Among other flagrant abuses spanning the entire industry, the inquiry heard that Westpac had given a bonus to an employee for work he did with a retired couple who lost their home as a result of following his advice. “It’s clear that in a number of instances we have been too slow in resolving genuine customer issues,” Westpac Group Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer said in a statement. “This is not good enough. Customers have a right to expect fair, timely, and effective resolution if they believe they have a concern or complaint.” The bank promoted its corporate affairs manager, Carolyn McCann, to a new role of “group executive, customer and corporate relations”, a move it said would ensure any customer issues “stay front and center” at the bank. The inquiry switches focus next week from financial planning to banks’ treatment of small businesses. No. 4 lender National Australia Bank Ltd NAB.AX also went on the publicity offensive, with CEO Andrew Thorburn telling CNBC the inquiry had made him ""ashamed to be a banker"". “I don’t know whether it is truly representative, I don’t believe it is, of what really happens at a bank, nevertheless it is true, we need to be accountable for that and we need to fix it,” Thorburn told the network. NAB is expected to face questions about its market-leading business loan book when the inquiry resumes next week. Executives have already told the inquiry NAB handed cash in envelopes to non-staff people for introducing home loan customers, a possible violation of responsible lending rules. [nL3N1R51ZN ] “They’ve not only broken internal policies, they’ve broken the law, it’s like they’ve committed fraud and they need to be punished, found and punished and held accountable,” Thorburn said. The Australian government has pledged to boost the powers of the corporate watchdog, double maximum prison terms and massively increase financial penalties for corporate crime in light of the wrongdoing exposed by the inquiry. Several senior executives at wealth manager AMP Ltd AMP.AX and Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX have lost their jobs as boards across the industry attempt to rebuild public trust."

1.7102288607229459," UPDATE 2-Australia's Westpac warns of slower mortgage growth * Westpac sees lower mortgage volumes * Reports A$4.3 bln in cash earnings, beats forecasts * Bank reports higher margins offseting soft growth in mortgages * Stressed assets to total loans increased slightly (Recasts, adds CEO comments, portfolio manager) By Paulina Duran SYDNEY May 7 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp flagged lower mortgage volumes on Monday as it reported better-than-expected half-year earnings, saying the cooling housing market and tighter lending standards would squeeze growth. Westpac echoed comments last week by smaller rival Australia and New Zealand Banking Group that mortgage growth would slow due to regulation and more cautious lending practices amid an inquiry into financial sector wrongdoing. “With the changes that have come through in the last year we may see that growth rate fall a bit,” Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said in an interview published on its website on Monday, referring to tighter credit and loan approval policies. “But what that represents is an orderly slowdown in the housing market, which shouldn’t be confused with a reduction in the housing market.” Home prices across Australia’s major cities eased for a seventh straight month in April, according to property consultant CoreLogic. Australia’s financial sector has been rocked by the government-ordered inquiry’s almost daily revelations of wrongdoing, including fraud, deception of regulators and charging customers without providing services. The inquiry is raising costs as banks prepare for tougher oversight of their lending practices and wealth management divisions. Hartzer said the inquiry, which is due to last a year, provided a “critical opportunity to restore customer trust”, and Westpac was “already well advanced” in making reforms. Westpac, Australia’s No. 2 lender, reported a cash profit of A$4.25 ($3.2 billion) for the half-year ended March 31, 6 percent higher than a year ago and slightly better than the average A$4.17 billion expected by four analysts polled by Reuters. Cash profit, a measure that excludes one-offs and non-cash accounting items, is closely watched by investors. Higher margins after interest rate rises at the peak of the housing boom last year were offset by softer mortgage volumes, with home lending growth at two percent compared with three percent in the previous half. Net interest income rose 8 percent to A$8.3 billion, while net interest margin - a key barometer of profitability - was up 11 basis points to 2.16 percent. “The result is a good result driven by considerable margin expansion and lower bad debts,” said Omkar Yoshi, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management, which owns Westpac shares. Westpac shares were 1.5 percent higher at A$29.54 at 0326 GMT while the rest of the market was up 0.5 percent. Stressed assets as a percentage of total loans were four basis points higher at 1.09 percent compared with the end of September, the bank said. The metric was lower than the 1.14 percent reported this time last year, suggesting loan quality was improving gradually. Last month, Westpac was forced to defend the quality of its mortgage book, as documents it provided to the quasi-judicial inquiry raised doubts about its lending standards. On Monday, it said it had reviewed a number of concerns raised by the banking regulator and tightened controls of its loan application processes."

5.451973931561245," Australia's Westpac defends mortgage book as inquiry reveals poor controls * Westpac says mortgage book continues to do well * Shares touch 2-yr low on UBS “sell” report, first in decades * Inquiry hears industry associations complicit in wrongdoing SYDNEY, April 26 (Reuters) - Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp was forced to defend the quality of its mortgage book on Thursday as documents it provided to a judicial inquiry into financial sector wrongdoing raised doubts about its integrity and sparked a share sell-off. A report published by UBS said that mininum income verifications had not been completed for almost 30 percent of a sample of 420 loans made by Westpac in the year to September 2016. In two thirds of the cases, itemised living expenses had not been collected, UBS said in the report, which delved into reams of mortgage data and documents provided to the independent judicial inquiry, known as a Royal Commission. “This data raises questions regarding the quality of WBC’s A$400 billion ($302.8 billion) mortgage book,” UBS said in the report, which also downgraded the broker’s recommendation for Westpac to “sell” for the first time since at least 1998. Analysis of Westpac’s 2016 mortgage data showed its debt-to-income level was much higher than UBS had initially believed, the Swiss bank added. “Since these reports in mid-2017 Westpac has started to tighten underwriting standards. However, we believe there may be much further to go before the concerns of the Royal Commission are addressed,” UBS analysts said in the report. Westpac shares fell as much as 4.4 percent to A$27.90 after the report, to their lowest since July 2016, while other banks were also lower. The stock closed 3.6 percent lower at A$28.10. Nine out of 10 controls to ensure borrowers provided accurate financial information to the bank were graded “ineffective” in either design or implementation by a confidential report addressed to the bank’s board in May last year, according to documents subpoenaed by the inquiry. In a statement to the exchange, Westpac noted the “control observations and qualifications” in the independent report should not be interpreted as a breach of regulations. “Westpac’s mortgage book continues to perform well,” Westpac Chief Financial Officer Peter King said in the statement. “Our mortgage delinquencies and losses remain low both relative to historical and industry averages.” The Royal Commission has revealed the country’s top banks routinely and repeatedly breached laws when issuing home loans, credit cards and other consumer loans. Its final recommendations could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation on the financial sector, including Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia , National Australia Bank, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In another internal document from July last year, a Westpac executive tells the board the banking regulator had raised concerns over the health of the bank’s residential mortgage portfolio and its position as a “significant outlier” it its proportion of high-risk lending. Westpac this month moved to tighten living expense assessments of new home loan customers, in order to make sure they could afford to service the debt. From April 17, it is also requesting online banking details of potential borrowers, to check their income and spending habits. The inquiry, which is in its fourth week of public hearings, on Thursday heard that the financial planning industry associations had turned a blind eye to widespread misconduct by advisers with the big banks and other large companies. The Financial Planning Association and the Association of Financial Advisers were complicit in keeping misconduct secret and had failed to expel some members who had been banned by the corporate regulator, the inquiry heard."
