-3.4238963400322606," Gap misses profit estimates on higher costs from online shift (Reuters) - Gap Inc fell short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday as a pivot to online sales fueled a surge in marketing and shipping costs, sending the apparel retailer’s shares down about 11% in extended trading. The company also forecast fourth-quarter sales to be flat or slightly higher than last year, and warned of pressure on margins from elevated shipping costs, including air freight, as retailers rush to move merchandise ahead of the holiday season. Online sales surged 61% in the third quarter as stuck-at-home customers shopped for comfortable joggers, yoga pants and tops from its Old Navy and Athleta brands, helping Gap report a surprise rise in comparable sales. But that came at a cost, with operating expenses rising about 8% in the quarter. Gap, which has launched digital campaigns such as “Stand United” and “Be the Future”, will continue to make marketing investments, Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said. “With this COVID environment and really a lot of the weaker players seeing significant amount of disruption, we see this as an important time to be investing in our brands for demand generation,” Syngal told analysts. Comparable sales rose 5%, trouncing the average estimate for a 0.62% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Store sales declined 20% in the third quarter, and Gap reiterated its intention to close several hundred Gap and Banana Republic stores globally, while opening profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores. The San Francisco-based retailer reported a net income of $95 million, or 25 cents per share, for the three months ended Oct. 31, down from a profit of $140 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn 32 cents per share."

21.493818657879945," Gap looks at closing stores in some European countries (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N is considering closing stores in some European countries, as the apparel retailer looks to save cash while dealing with a sales slump brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and competition from fast-fashion companies. The San Francisco-based company, which had 129 Gap brand stores in Europe at the end of July, said late on Tuesday options being explored include the possible closure of outlets in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland and Italy by mid-2021. The move comes as Gap struggles with out-of-fashion styles, which has pushed shoppers towards apparel brands like Zara and H&M. The coronavirus crisis has compounded troubles by stifling sales at brick-and-mortar sales across the globe. However, online sales of Gap Inc’s Old Navy and Athleta brands have surged since the start of the pandemic. The company also said it was reviewing its warehouse and distribution model and its Gap and Banana Republic-owned e-commerce operations in Europe. (bit.ly/2FN0R6d) Parts of Gap’s European business could be transferred to third parties in a partnership model, the company said. Earlier this year, Gap said it planned to close over 225 unprofitable Gap and Banana Republic stores globally as a part of a restructuring plan."
12.982643272235725," Gap to hire virtually for fulfillment, customer centers this holiday season (Reuters) - Gap Inc said on Thursday it will virtually hire seasonal staff for the busy holiday months to help the apparel retailer fulfill online orders and man its customer contact centers as consumers shop heavily online due to the pandemic. The company said to make its hiring process safe and easy, it will allow candidates to apply online for any role in three minutes or less. Retailers are preparing for a holiday season that would mostly include sales from online shopping as consumers try to avoid large crowds in stores due to the COVID-19 health crisis. Gap, which also owns the Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta chains, said it added 3.5 million new customers through its online channels in the second quarter. Last year, the company laid out plans to hire as many as 5,000 staffers for the holidays, but it did not specify a number for this year. Target Corp also said it would double its staff for contactless services and hire more seasonal employees for distribution centers this holiday season."

People working or studying from home have been stocking up on comfortable “stay at home” clothes including fleece and activewear, boosting demand for the company’s budget-friendly Old Navy brand, athleisure label Athleta as well as Gap clothing. Same-store sales rose 13%, compared with analysts’ forecast of a 20.97% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The San Francisco-based retailer said it nearly doubled its e-commerce business for the quarter ended Aug. 1, with about 50% online penetration, and added about 3.5 million new customers. “We won in the value space with Old Navy, and we won in the premium space of Athleta,” Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal told analysts, adding that the company sold about $130 million worth of masks alone. While the company expects demand for the two brands to fuel sales, it plans to close over 225 unprofitable Gap and Banana Republic stores globally as a part of its restructuring plan. The back-to-school season, one of the busiest periods for the company, could extend longer and Gap is ready with the “right assortment” for kids whether they are learning at home or in a classroom, Syngal said. Gap reported second-quarter net loss of $62 million, or 17 cents per share, compared to a profit of $168 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier.

Aimed at young shoppers, the Yeezy-Gap line, which will offer items such as hoodies, basics, T-shirts and joggers, is expected to appear in Gap stores and on Gap.com in 2021, the two parties said. West will keep sole ownership of the Yeezy brand. Financial details were not disclosed, but Gap said Yeezy would receive royalties and potential equity based on sales results. Yeezy said the brand is valued at $2.9 billion. German sportswear company Adidas ADSGn.DE also partners with West, selling Yeezy footwear designed by West. As a teen, West, 43, worked at a Gap store in the Chicago area. “We are excited to welcome Kanye back to the Gap family,” said Mark Breitbard, the Gap brand global head, describing West as “a creative visionary, building on the aesthetic and success of his Yeezy brand” with the new Gap line. A Gap spokeswoman said the deal “is an example of leveraging the brand power that Gap has and thinking in a new way about how we can introduce the brand to new customers, new audiences,” she said. The news of the collaboration, announced through the rapper’s Twitter account, got the brands trending on the social media platform and sent shares of Gap to its highest since early March before the pandemic battered the industry.

44.31630579370035," Gap records nearly $1 billion in losses on coronavirus-led store closures (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N on Thursday reported a quarterly loss of nearly $1 billion as the apparel retailer was forced to close its stores due to the coronavirus outbreak, sending its shares down about 8% after market hours. Retailers that sell non-essential goods such as clothing have been crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic as they were forced to restrict their businesses to online operations and curbside pickups. San Francisco-based Gap, which operates nearly 2,800 stores in North America, said 55% of its company-operated stores in the region were now open and sales from online operations were booming. The company’s more expensive brands Gap and Banana Republic did not do well as customers opted for casual clothing as they stayed at home during the lockdowns, Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said. However, its affordable clothing brands, Old Navy and Athleta, were seeing signs of strong demand, Syngal added. The retailer, which is streamlining its fleet of retail stores, said it would prioritize closing some Gap stores and seek rent concessions for well-positioned stores that cannot support the current rent structures. “While our economics in our Old Navy and Athleta fleets are strong, our specialty store fleet (Gap and Banana Republic) has not been as profitable as we need it to be,” Chief Financial Officer Katrina O’Connell said in a conference call with analysts. Net loss came in at $932 million, or $2.51 per share, for the three months ended May 2, which included a $484 million writedown on store and operating lease assets and a $235 million charge on excess inventory. Net sales fell 43% to $2.11 billion from $3.71 billion. Analysts had forecast a loss of 67 cents per share and revenue of $2.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

76.19049436069632," Gap rushes in more robots to warehouses to solve virus disruption SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. apparel chain Gap Inc GPS.N is speeding up its rollout of warehouse robots for assembling online orders so it can limit human contact during the coronavirus pandemic, the company told Reuters. Gap reached a deal early this year to more than triple the number of item-picking robots it uses to 106 by the fall. Then the pandemic struck North America, forcing the company to close all its stores in the region, including those of Banana Republic, Old Navy and other brands. Meanwhile, its warehouses faced more web orders and fewer staff to fulfill them because of social distancing rules Gap had put in place. “We could not get as many people in our distribution centers safely,” said Kevin Kuntz, Gap’s senior vice president of global logistics fulfillment. So he called up Kindred AI, the vendor that sells the machines, to ask: “Can you get them here earlier?” Sourcing parts in time for the eight-foot-tall robotic stations was not simple or cheap, said Kindred’s Chief Operating Officer Marin Tchakarov. But the venture-backed startup was able to deploy 10 of them to Gap’s warehouse near Nashville, Tennessee and 20 near Columbus, Ohio, with plans to finish the rollout to four of Gap’s five U.S. facilities by July, months ahead of schedule, he said. Each machine handles work typically performed by four people, Kuntz said. Neither the deal to triple the number of robots, nor the expedited installations, have been previously reported. The news illustrates how the pandemic may speed up automation in the retail industry. Companies including Gap and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O have long used such systems for a range of tasks, like moving items across warehouse floors. Various new technologies are capable of supplanting some cashier, box packing and item picking roles that employ millions of U.S. workers, and the pandemic is giving vendors a chance to make their case. The firm RightHand Robotics, for instance, has helped its customer Walmart Inc WMT.N manage more online orders through greater use of its picking machines that had been deployed at several of the chain's facilities, a person familiar with the matter said. Walmart did not answer requests for comment. Vince Martinelli, RightHand’s head of product and marketing, declined comment on the deployment but said as a general matter, “If you’re going to have limited people in the building, the last thing you want them to do is a simple task that can be automated.” Amazon is also relying more in the pandemic on automation for sorting items that warehouse workers have unpacked, sparing staff from having to walk by each other frequently as the more manual process once required, the company said. It is looking to roll out the technology more widely in its buildings. Kindred, RightHand and robotics firm Berkshire Grey told Reuters they are seeing a rise in inquiries from prospective retail clients, though travel restrictions and the need to limit human contact make new installations a challenge. The interest is no surprise: researchers from the Brookings Institution have said spurts of automation often follow economic shocks, a phenomenon they said could be replayed as retailers’ sales plunge. “At these moments, employers shed less-skilled workers and replace them with technology and higher-skilled workers, which increases labor productivity as a recession tapers off,” the think tank’s March report said. ‘THEY NEVER TAKE BREAKS’ Pressure to make distribution networks more efficient is likely to increase for retailers because of their financial woes during the pandemic. Gap last month said it faced a cash shortage, prompting it to borrow $2.25 billion. Three-quarters of its revenue its last fiscal year came from over 3,300 physical stores, most of which it has closed for weeks. While Gap has kept shops in China in business and has started the re-opening of 800 others this month, its e-commerce operation has been a lifeline for sales. Gap, based in San Francisco, did not disclose the financial terms of its deal with Kindred, or its base pay for staff. The company said it has around 6,500 warehouse employees, who are receiving higher wages because of the health crisis. It is limiting numbers in facilities because of U.S. health guidance. Kindred’s “SORT” machines help Gap assemble multi-item purchases from customers. Goods from various online checkout carts fall down a chute and into a large basin that’s part of one of the machines. A robotic arm above then picks each unit through suction and a physical grip, scans its bar code and places it in a bin in an adjacent cubby. Once all the items in a customer’s order are in, a worker puts the bin on a conveyer for packing and delivery. Kindred, with headquarters in San Francisco, is one of several startups selling artificially intelligent robots that aim to grasp almost any item quickly and without breakage. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. retail workers perform this task, and Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has said the tech is years away from taking over that work. Still, retailers can use robots to pick narrower sets of products. Kindred’s Tchakarov said, “Our robotics systems, they never get tired. They never take breaks.” Kindred and Gap say they aim for the technology to complement workers, not replace them. At its warehouses, Gap is still scouting for new hires - and potentially new machines. “Should we do even more?” Kuntz asked. “How quickly can a Kindred build those machines?”"

83.66198190994044," Gap warns of cash shortage, suspends rent payments (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N warned on Thursday it may not survive the next 12 months intact and would need to borrow more funds in the face of widespread coronavirus shutdowns that have crippled the business of clothing retailers globally. The apparel retailer also said it had suspended rent payments for shuttered stores, and was in talks with landlords to defer payments, change lease agreements, or in some cases terminate the leases and permanently close some stores. (bit.ly/2Y0ZxDk) Gap said the suspended rents in North America would have amounted to about $115 million per month. Brick-and-mortar retail chains are facing an unprecedented sales downturn as the coronavirus shutdowns drag on, forcing them to cut costs and tap credit lines to stay afloat. Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, Reuters reported on Sunday, while other department store operators are battling to avoid the same fate. Like many in corporate America, Gap has already withdrawn its full-year targets, suspended dividend, furloughed employees and drawn down its existing credit lines. The retailer, which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy, said it expects to have $750-$850 million of cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of short-term investments, at the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2. In order to have sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months, the company said it would need to tap the debt market, cut jobs, defer capital expenditures and cut back on orders from vendors. “There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have ... and the steps we may need to take to address those impacts, are highly uncertain,” Gap said."

70.08084462628807," Macy's, Kohl's, Gap turn to mass furloughs as virus crisis deepens (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers Macy's Inc M.N, Kohl's Corp KSS.N and Gap Inc GPS.N said on Monday they would furlough tens of thousands of employees, as they prepare to keep stores shut for longer to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Kohl’s also said it would suspend its share repurchase program, evaluate its dividend plan and draw down $1 billion from an existing credit line, joining a growing list of companies seeking to shore up their cash reserves to weather the financial hit from the health crisis. Macy’s and Gap have suspended their dividends and have also tapped into their credit facilities. Gap said the furloughs will affect its store employees in the United States and Canada. The company had about 129,000 employees at the end of last year. The action will impact a majority of its about 130,000 employees, Macy’s said, while all workers at store and store distribution centers, as well as some corporate office associates will be affected, according to Kohl’s. Shares of Kohl’s, which had about 122,000 employees in 2019, closed down nearly 9%. Macy’s stock ended nearly 3% lower. “Given these extraordinary circumstances, we are taking difficult and decisive actions to strengthen our financial liquidity,” Kohl’s Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said in a statement. Gass said she will not take a salary. Widespread lockdowns to arrest the spread of the outbreak in the United States have hammered sales for brick-and-mortar retailers as most stores remain closed, despite their online business staying up and running. President Donald Trump on Sunday extended his stay-at-home guidelines until the end of April, dropping a hotly criticized plan to get the economy up and running by mid-April after a top medical adviser said more than 100,000 Americans could die from the outbreak. The pandemic, which has killed about 34,000 people across the globe, has compounded sales pressure for retailers already facing stiff competition and a shift to online shopping. Kohl’s said furloughed employees would continue to get health benefits. Macy’s specified that employees enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage, at least through May. Macy’s said it would maintain the “absolute minimum” workforce needed to maintain basic operations across its Macy’s, Bloomingdales and Bluemercury brands. The retailer added there would be fewer furloughs in its digital business, supporting distribution centers and call centers, while Kohl’s said it would start buy online and pick up-at-store services later this week."

The Canadian company, known for its luxury parkas, said on Wednesday it would make scrubs and patient gowns, which are in short supply, and will begin distributing them to local hospitals free of cost next week. The production will start in two of its plants in Toronto and Winnipeg, with about 50 employees per facility working with an initial goal of manufacturing 10,000 units. U.S. retailer Gap also announced similar plans late Tuesday and said it would pivot resources so that its factory partners can manufacture masks, gowns and scrubs for healthcare workers on the frontline of the outbreak. The company said in a post here on Twitter that it would connect its vendors with some hospitals in California for the supply of personal protective equipment. Last month, Canada Goose had forecast a hit to its annual profit and revenue as the outbreak in China hurt store traffic.

The disruptions due to the health crisis is the latest headache for newly named Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal as she tries to revive demand for its apparels in a competitive retail market marked by slowing traffic in malls. Separately, Gap named Old Navy’s finance chief Katrina O’Connell as its next chief financial officer, who will take charge along with Syngal later this month. “With the U.S. cases that are just emerging, we started to see some impact on traffic here,” outgoing Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll, told analysts in a conference call.

It seems like that is starting to work,” said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners. On an adjusted basis, Gap earned 58 cents per share, 17 cents above expectations. However, it reported a net loss of $184 million compared with a profit of $276 million, due to an impairment charge related to the closure of its flagship store in New York. Excluding the hit from the outbreak, Gap forecast earnings of between $1.80 per share and $1.92 per share for fiscal 2020. Analysts had forecast $1.68 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

-59.000537036970826," Gap pulls plug on Old Navy spinoff to focus on turning around sales (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N on Thursday scrapped its plan to spin-off Old Navy and said it would instead work to stem dropping sales, while fewer discounts during the holiday season helped full-year earnings, sending its shares up about 4%. The move came as a surprise as just two months ago the company had stuck to its plan to separate despite several analysts calling for the strategy to be canned due to weak sales and the abrupt exit of Chief Executive Officer Art Peck. Peck unveiled the plan in February last year when Old Navy was a bright spot for the company, which was struggling with out-of-fashion apparel at its Gap brand. However, sales for Old Navy have slowed in recent quarters, raising doubts about the brand’s value as a separate entity. “Old Navy’s business has not been good. With the CEO out of the way, this is the right move,” said Jane Hali, at research firm Jane Hali & Associates. “Instead of thinking of spinning off companies, they should get back to the basics of giving customers what they’re asking for.” The company on Thursday also said that Mark Breitbard, head of Banana Republic, will lead the Gap brand on interim basis after the departure of Chief Executive Officer Neil Fiske. “The work we’ve done to prepare for the spin shone a bright light on operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement,” Gap interim CEO Robert Fisher said. The company is searching for a permanent CEO, whose primary task, according to Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners, will be to fix the big three brands - Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic. “Launching an independent Navy when none of the big brands is ready for prime time would be a bridge too far,” he said. Gap said same-store sales for 2019 would be at the higher end of its prior outlook, but would still drop from a year earlier as brick and mortar retailers lose holiday shoppers to online competition. It forecast adjusted 2019 earnings to be moderately above its prior outlook of $1.70 to $1.75 per share. Gap shares were up at $19.44 in extended trading."

6.5957867358635305," Gap's quarterly profit beats; says working on plan to split Old Navy (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N edged past lowered expectations for quarterly profit on Thursday and reiterated its plan to separate Old Navy from the namesake brand, days after the retailer cut its annual forecast and replaced longtime chief executive officer. Shares of the company, which have lost more than a third of its value this year, rose nearly 2% in extended trading, as the apparel retailer said it was well prepared for the holiday season. Gap replaced CEO Art Peck with Robert Fisher, a member of the founding family, as its interim head nearly two weeks ago and cut its full-year profit forecast. Following the announcement, Wall Street lowered its third-quarter earnings estimates by nearly 5 cents. The San Francisco-based retailer has been struggling to revive sales at Gap and Banana Republic due to declining mall traffic, a rise in online retailing and competition from fast-fashion brands including Inditex's ITX.MC Zara and H&M HMb.ST. In February, Gap plotted a plan to separate its better-performing Old Navy brand, giving investors hopes that the standalone company would be able to show better results than the namesake brand. “While I am confident about our future, I’m also realistic about the challenges ahead,” Fisher told analysts in a post-earnings conference call. “Our brands are underperforming today and have been pressured by uneven execution.” Fisher backed the spinoff plan and said he would set up an executive committee constituting heads of Old Navy and Banana Republic. “The split is key. Everything else is noise,” said Eric Schiffer, CEO of Patriarch Organization, a private equity firm. For the busy shopping season, Gap said its latest designs like plaids and Jingle Jammies pajama sets, a partnership with a Netflix Inc's NFLX.O holiday movie, Clause, new ad campaigns and a store-collect option are expected to drive sales. Net sales fell 2.2% to $4 billion in the third quarter ended Nov. 2, but beat the analysts’ average estimate of $3.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, it earned 53 cents per share, 2 cents more than expectations. It had earlier set a target of 50 cents to 52 cents per share."

Trump, in remarks to reporters at the White House, poured cold water on the idea of rolling back the tariffs, something that he said Beijing would like him to do. On Thursday, officials from both countries said that the United States and China had agreed to such a deal. “Markets are getting tired” of the back-and-forth on the trade front, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. “It’s gone from the deal is close, to no, it’s not, and we’ve been through this before.” Helping to boost the S&P 500, Walt Disney Co gained 3.6% a day after it reported quarterly results that showed it spent less than it had projected on its online streaming service, Disney+.

Gap also slashed its full-year earnings forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

8.456114726214823," Gap commits to Old Navy split; CEO exit won't impact holiday shopping season (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N said on Friday it was sticking with plans to spin off its Old Navy brand into a separate company, as Wall Street analysts questioned its commitment to the project following the surprise exit of Chief Executive Officer Art Peck. Gap shares fell 5.5% on Friday after Thursday’s shock announcement, which came along with another weak batch of forecasts for quarterly sales and full-year earnings. The abrupt change in leadership comes just before the year’s main holiday shopping season, with merchandise already ordered and stores stocking up ahead of the unofficial kickoff over the late November U.S. Thanksgiving weekend. But analysts said the change in leadership would not impact the company either way. Peck, who held the top job since 2015, planned to split the better-performing Old Navy brand from Gap and Banana Republic, and Gap in an email to Reuters said, “The board continues to believe in the strategic rationale for the planned separation, and the preparation for separation continues as planned.” It added that there would be a regularly scheduled meeting of its board next week and that any additional details on the company’s attitude to the spin off would be provided in an earnings call on November 21. Several Wall Street brokerages said the deal should be canned. “It makes little sense to spin Old Navy until, at least, its sales have stabilized,” David Swartz, an analyst with brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients, adding that Old Navy represented most of Gap’s enterprise value as a company. Robert Fisher, the son of Gap’s founders, has taken over as interim chief executive officer of the retailer. Fisher, who also serves as the company’s chairman, is Gap’s largest shareholder with a 12.5% stake, according to Refinitiv data. For an interactive graphic, click here: tmsnrt.rs/32t4cN3 The Gap brand, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and Khaki cargos, has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Inditex's ITX.MC Zara and H&M HMb.ST and has experienced several years of falling sales. While the retailer has invested heavily in some of its most iconic categories like denim, its product assortments are still viewed by many as lacking newness and Gap needs to market more effectively to younger consumers as competition stiffens, analysts said. Peck’s successor will not be able to make needed change in time to holiday sales this season, several industry experts said. “It’s already too late, all the plans are set, everything’s etched in stone, nothing’s changing,” said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of consultancy Storch Advisors. “If you brought in the most spectacular person imaginable and they had all the answers, they still couldn’t change anything until probably as late as next fall.”"
8.456114726214823," Gap CEO exiting as forecast cut casts doubt on turnaround (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N said on Thursday Chief Executive Officer Art Peck will leave the company, a surprise exit in the middle of a restructuring that comes as the apparel retailer slashed its full-year earnings forecast, sending its shares down 7%. Since taking the helm in 2015, Peck has tried to re-energize sales at the Gap brand, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and Khaki cargos, but it has recently struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Zara and H&M. On Thursday, the company estimated a 4% drop in third-quarter same-store sales, with declines across all its key brands including Old Navy. The drop comes as the Gap brand also has heavily discounted in a competitive retail environment. “Gap’s whole portfolio is having a brand erosion crisis that we expect to only deepen with the current leadership vacuum,” said Camilla Yanushevsky, research analyst at CFRA. Earlier this year, Gap said it will separate its better-performing Old Navy brand and shutter about 230 stores of its namesake apparel business, a process likely to be completed by 2020. Peck, who was to head the new Gap Inc, is credited with developing the company’s “omni-channel” strategy that uses its retail stores and its digital platform to fulfill orders. “Peck deserves a lot of credit for decisive corrective action and starting to rationalize the retail store base and deserves credit for streamlining the supply chain in a challenging international environment,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group. “Where he missed was their marketing and merchandising and pricing and promotional program.” Robert Fisher, a member of the founding family behind Gap and its non-executive board chairman, will become the chief executive officer on an interim basis, effective immediately, the company said. But the company’s dismal forecasts indicated that Peck’s efforts are yet to yield results. Gap also now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.75, down from its previous forecast of $2.05 to $2.15. The quarter was “challenging”, Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said, adding macro impact and slower traffic deepened the hit from product and operating challenges across key brands. “(The) results also reiterate our skepticism that the spin-off of touted stronghold Old Navy can unlock value,” analyst Yanushevsky said.

Fisher, who serves as the company's chairman, replaced 15-year Gap veteran Art Peck, under whom sales of the company's eponymous brand have tumbled due to out-of-fashion styles and competition from retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch ANF.N and Europe's H&M.

However, he remained a board member and became chairman in 2004 when his father stepped down. ** Fisher, a Stanford and Princeton alum, is Gap’s largest shareholder with a 12.5% stake, according to Refinitiv data. ** A San Francisco native, Fisher also serves on California’s Strategic Growth Council."
8.456114726214823," Old Navy spin-off in doubt after Gap's Peck departs -analysts Nov 8 (Reuters) - Shares of Gap Inc fell nearly 10% on Friday, as the surprise departure of Chief Executive Officer Art Peck and persistent declining sales, threw the apparel retailer’s planned spin-off of its Old Navy brand into question. Peck, who joined the company in 2005 and has held the top job since 2015, planned to split Old Navy into a separate public company as he strove to revitalize Gap with the addition of Athleta athleisure wear, provide more online offerings and close unprofitable stores. Old Navy’s spin-off was predicated on its out performance of Gap’s other brands, but Peck’s departure, after recent poor sales in a flooded market, had Wall Street wondering whether the split could be delayed or abandoned altogether. “We think the Old Navy spin should be scrapped ... it makes little sense to spin Old Navy until, at least, its sales have stabilized,” Morningstar analyst David Swartz said. Swartz noted that Old Navy has carried Gap for years and likely represents most of its enterprise value. “We see little future for a Gap without Old Navy ... it is difficult to see how Gap can attract a top-flight CEO to fix the company if it is going to be stripped of Old Navy, its best asset,” Swartz said. The Gap brand, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and Khaki cargos, has recently struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Zara and H&M. On Thursday, the company estimated a 4% drop in third-quarter same-store sales, with declines across all its key brands including Old Navy. J.P.Morgan analyst Matthew Boss wrote that Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll, on a follow up, said it was a board decision for Peck to step down, adding the timing coincides with the 2020 planning process. Gap shares have more than halved in value in Peck’s four years in charge. “We have to think this new development will make the original timeline of the planned Old Navy separation extremely difficult,” Evercore SI analyst Westcott Rochett said, calling Peck’s departure “definitely shocking.” (Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr)"

7.10334217379069," Gap to hire fewer workers for holiday season (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N said on Thursday it plans to hire more than 30,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday season, lower than the 65,000 target the apparel retailer had set for 2018. The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year, is the busiest time of the year for retailers and brings in a majority of their total sales. A Gap spokeswoman said total seasonal hiring is lower this year to give current employees the opportunity to pick up more hours. Hiring plans often indicate sales expectations of retailers and come against the backdrop of a softening retail environment and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has threatened to increase costs for retailers. Big-box retailer Target Corp TGT.N said earlier this month that it planned to hire more than 130,000 store employees for the holiday season, a roughly 8% rise from last year, but much lower than the 20% increase in 2018 and a 43% jump in 2017. Retail jobs contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit their lowest since January 2016, which hinted at softer U.S. consumer spending going into the Christmas season. Gap said on Thursday it would host a one-day event on Oct. 5 at all its stores, as well as select distribution and customer centers across the United States and Canada to hire as many as 5,000 work associates as part of the holiday hiring plan.

-9.94099769209782," Gap's Old Navy plans to nearly double its store count after split (Reuters) - Gap Inc's GPS.N Old Navy brand plans to nearly double its store count in North America as the apparel retailer readies itself to split from the parent company next year. As a standalone company, Old Navy, which offers more affordable clothing and accessories, plans to open 860 stores in North America and said it would focus on opening outlets in smaller markets and off-mall locations. bit.ly/2m8YvUR Old Navy, which recorded net sales of about $8 billion in 2018 and ended the year with 1,140 locations, said with the new store openings it plans to reach more than $10 billion in annual sales in the long term. Earlier this year, Gap announced that it would spin off the Old Navy brand, a bright spot for the struggling retailer, into a publicly listed company. Gap, Athleta, Banana Republic and the remaining brands will be part of the new Gap Inc. “What separation does for us is allows us to have the focus that we need to deliver with confidence this strategy which we know is the right one,” Old Navy Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said on an investor call held to provide an update on the planned separation, expected to be completed by 2020. Old Navy’s plans to open new stores comes as Gap and other brick-and-mortar players have been shutting underperforming locations bowing to pressure from online sellers, fast-fashion retailers and ever-changing consumer trends. For the Gap brand, the company said it plans to focus on the denim category, while also working towards improving margins. “We’re going to gain share in denim and that is going to be the fuel that powers (a) turnaround,” Gap Inc CEO Art Peck said on the investor call. Gap also expects $400 million to $450 million in one-time separation expenses and $300 million to $350 million in capital-related costs between 2019 and 2021."
5.391733423643851," From Ikea to Gap, firms aim to use scarce water more wisely STOCKHOLM (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Putting on a pair of jeans or drinking a beer has a cost beyond the pricetag, with billions of tonnes of water used globally each year to manufacture them and other consumer goods, companies said at an international water conference on Monday. But with population growth and climate change making water a scarcer and more precious resource, using water wisely is now a key to remaining profitable, they said. From growing cotton for textiles to manufacturing drinks and ensuring consumers have enough water as well, efficient water use is high on the agenda, representatives of popular brands said during opening events at World Water Week in Stockholm. “Gap Inc. sees water as a human right,” Lisa Hook who works on sustainable innovation for Gap Inc. told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We can’t do business where there is no water.” Cotton is a thirsty crop and it takes about 1,000 gallons of water to make one pair of jeans, Hook said. The global apparel industry also contributes about 20% of the pollution in fresh water sources around the world from its laundries, mills and other facilities, she added. Many businesses now operate in regions facing high water stress, from India to Vietnam and California, company representatives said. By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). For Dutch brewer Heineken, water is obviously a vital ingredient, said Jan-Willem Vosmeer, corporate social responsibility manager for the firm. But many breweries are located in increasingly water-stressed areas, and limited or irregular supplies could impact both communities and corporate bottom lines, he said. Finding ways to conserve water and use it responsibly “makes absolute business sense”, Vosmeer said. “Diminishing availability of water poses operational, social, reputational and legal risks for all businesses. It should be high on the agenda” for companies, he said. Like many other food and beverage businesses, the largest part of Heineken’s water “footprint” comes from agriculture, as it grows key ingredients such as barley, he said. To save water, Coca-Cola is turning to new technology such as using air rather than water to clean bottles, said Liz Lowe, the company’s British sustainability manager. It is also better monitoring water use in factories and harvesting rainwater for toilet flushing at its plants - one way to act as a better water steward, she said. As well, in an effort to replenish natural water supplies, the global drinks giant is creating new wetlands and working with communities internationally to try to put the equivalent of all the water it uses in manufacturing back into nature and communities by 2020, Lowe said. “Water is the absolute heart of our business. If we don’t have water, we don’t have a business - full stop,” she said. Population growth, climate change, economic and agricultural expansion and deforestation are all placing greater pressures on the world’s limited supplies of water, scientists say. For Swedish furniture store Ikea, consumer choice is also an important motivation for improving water practices. “There is a clear customer demand” for greener products, said Kajsa-Stina Kalin, Ikea’s “healthy and sustainable living” leader. The reality, she said, is that “climate change is no longer a distant threat” and “as a big global brand we know we are part of the problem but we really want to be part of the solution.” The company, which had a billion visits to its stores in 52 countries last year, aims to reduce and reuse water in all its operations in a bid to attract environmentally aware customers. “We know that people are increasingly choosing to not shop at companies and brands that have no active sustainability work,” said Kalin."

-22.328184110569," Gap cuts profit forecast after 'extremely challenging' quarter; shares slump 11% (Reuters) - Gap Inc cut its 2019 profit forecast and posted the biggest drop in same-store sales in at least three years at its Gap brand, underscoring its struggles to compete with fast-fashion retailers in the face of changing customer preferences. Shares of the company, once a trendsetter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and khaki cargos, fell 11% in after-hours trading on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Art Peck called the quarter “extremely challenging” and cited unusually cold weather in February, late spring breaks, a delayed Easter and lower tax refunds as reasons for the dour performance. Unseasonably cold weather has been a drag for most U.S. apparel retailers in the first few months of 2019, with Gap Inc’s Old Navy especially hit as most of its apparel is tailored toward warmer weather. However, analysts were unconvinced and felt the absence of in-fashion products was weighing on Gap brand’s turnaround efforts. “Every quarter management claims that products are improving and that the (Gap brand) is responding to changing consumer demand,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “And yet every season, Gap churns out the same bland range of undifferentiated product which has barely changed over the past 20 years.” On a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll acknowledged the lack of strong products at both Old Navy and Gap in the first quarter and said the company had held back on marketing until designs and assortments improved. Sales at established Gap brand stores fell 10% in the three months ended May 4, steeper than the 4% decline analysts had estimated. Peck replaced Gap brand’s head last year and hired a new marketing chief, in efforts to turn around the unit with more appealing products, shorter response times in bringing designs from sketchpad to stores and better advertising. But those efforts are yet to succeed. Quarterly same-store sales at the brand have risen only once since the start of 2016, according to Refinitiv data. Adding to the worries, Old Navy, a bright spot for the company in recent years and which is being separated as a publicly listed company, reported a surprise drop in same-store sales. Peck said he remained confident in Gap’s plan to separate into two independently companies in 2020 and had hired a dedicated team to manage the separation. Overall same-store sales fell 4%, bigger than the 1.2% drop analysts had expected. The San Francisco-based company cut its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $2.05 to $2.15 per share, from a previous range of $2.40 to $2.55."

-36.11203424713259," Gap shares surge 24 percent as Wall Street praises split (Reuters) - Gap Inc shares surged as much as 24 percent on Friday as a number of Wall Street analysts lauded the company’s decision to separate its better-performing Old Navy brand. The company, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies to Khaki cargos, has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Zara and H&M. Old Navy has been the only bright spot for the company in the past few years, cushioning it from the weak performance of its namesake Gap and Banana Republic brands, where sales have also taken a hit from fewer additions of new designs. “Separating Old Navy to a standalone company is what we have argued for over the past few years. Doing so allows the market to properly value Old Navy for its high margins and strong cash flows,” Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said. Konik said separating Old Navy, which is the primary driver of profit for Gap, would also make the budget brand as attractive as off-price retailers such as TJX Co Inc and Ross Stores. “We are buyers,” Konik said. The gains in the stock set it up for its best day in more than 10 years and added about $2 billion to the company’s market capitalization. Gap said on Thursday that Old Navy would be spun off to its shareholders, while the other entity will consist of the Gap brand, Athleta, BR, Intermix and Hill City. “Santa didn’t bring the sales but brought Old Navy spin instead,” RBC’s analyst Kate Fitzsimons said. At least four brokerages raised their price target on the stock, with Telsey making the most bullish move by raising its price by $6 to $40, well above the median of $30. The company also said it would close hundreds of underperforming Gap stores in the next two years and would increase investments in its online business as they try to adapt to a more modern retail environment. It has already shut its massive flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York earlier this year. On a post-earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Art Peck said the company would focus on quality, fit and style of apparel that today’s consumer needs, with special focus on denim to boost the Gap brand. The company also said it plans to invest more in fleece for spring, summer and fall seasons. At Old Navy, the fashion is already more resonant with the latest styles, with blouses and dresses priced as cheap as $30. “You can have confidence that we definitely boil the ocean in looking at all the combinations and permutations here ... We settled on this largely due to the business logic at the end of the day,” Peck said referring to the split. While analysts were encouraged by Thursday’s announcement, some said concerns around the company’s money-losing Gap brand would remain. “While we are encouraged by the decision, we would note the company’s brands continue to face intense competitive pressure, particularly in the U.S.,” Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul said. Gap’s shares lost a fifth of their value in the past 12 months, while the broader S&P 500 Apparel Retail index rose 13 percent."

-36.11203424713259," Gap to separate Old Navy brand, close stores; shares soar 25 percent (Reuters) - Gap Inc will separate its better-performing Old Navy brand and shutter about 230 stores of its struggling namesake apparel business, in one of its biggest restructuring efforts to energize sales, sending shares surging 25 percent on Thursday. The company has struggled with contrasting performances of its brands. Old Navy has been a bright spot as its wide range of budget apparel made it more attractive to a broader base of customers, while its specialty Gap brand struggled in the face of competition from fast-fashion retailers and changing trends. “It’s clear that Old Navy’s business model and customers have increasingly diverged from our specialty brands over time,” Gap’s Chairman Robert Fisher said in a statement. The 230 Gap specialty stores the company planned to close over the next two years, along with the 68 already shut, represents nearly half of its stores, the company said. The company also said it would boost spending on marketing and developing new products for the Gap brand, but Chief Executive Officer Art Peck stopped short of saying that the brand was in a turnaround. “I’ve called the turn before. And I’ve eaten my words. I’m not calling a turn again. What I’m looking forward is period-over-period improvement, and I’m quite confident and comfortable with what I’m seeing.” Gap, Athleta, Banana Republic and the remaining brands will be part of a yet-to-be-named company. The separation of Old Navy into a publicly listed company, which Gap said will be tax free to investors, is likely to be completed by 2020. Peck will hold the same position in the new company, while Old Navy CEO Sonia Syngal will stay on as head of the standalone firm. Old Navy has annual sales of about $8 billion, while the other brands have a combined revenue of $9 billion. “Although the proposed spin at Old Navy will enable a sharpened strategic focus on its business priorities, it reduces the diversification the brand provides to the overall entity,” said Moody’s analyst Christina Boni. The company’s shares were up 24.8 percent at $31.70 in extended trading. Separately, Gap reported a surprise drop in overall same-store sales for the holiday quarter, down 1 percent compared with analysts’ average estimate of a 0.3 percent rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Ironically, lack of same-store sales growth at Old Navy hurt fourth-quarter overall sales. The company blamed an absence of new products and macro-economic issues for a drop in traffic to the Old Navy stores during the crucial December shopping season. Gap also warned that it expects the first half of 2019 to be more challenging than last year, due to a cold start to the year that weighed on all its businesses, particularly Old Navy."

-3.1045117922800176," Gap's comparable sales miss as namesake brand struggles (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N reported quarterly same-store sales below analysts' estimates on Tuesday, dragged down by another weak performance in its namesake brand, indicating that the apparel retailer needs to double down on efforts to reduce excess inventory and to revive sales. The Gap brand, struggling with a switch by young shoppers to fast-fashion from rivals such as such as H&M HMb.ST and Inditex ITX.MC Zara, has in recent quarters faced a spike in inventories, largely due to older styles. To clear the inventories, Gap has been discounting heavily and that has weighed on sales and margins. Same-store sales at the Gap brand fell 7 percent in the third quarter, much bigger than the 4 percent drop analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Based on current projections, we would expect Gap brand to show sequential progress but still be down for the year,” Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said on a post-earnings call. Chief Executive Officer Art Peck has also shut Gap brand stores and named a new head for the unit earlier this year in a bid to shore up sales. Peck on the call said “early reads of fourth-quarter product flows are encouraging”. “The problem is that the turnaround is taking a long time and it still is a significant misstep on their part,” said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consultancy A line Partners. Old Navy, Gap’s more affordable brand and a bright spot, also missed comparable sales estimates by a small margin. Sales rose 4 percent, while analysts had expected a 4.65 percent increase. The brand has topped estimates in six of the past eight quarters. Business casual clothing brand Banana Republic topped analysts’ estimates for same-store sales, posting a 2 percent rise compared with average estimate of 0.72 percent gain. Overall company same-store sales were flat in the three months ended Nov. 3, missing analysts’ average estimate of a 1.09 percent rise. Excluding items, Gap earned 69 cents per share, beating the average estimate by a cent. Net sales rose 6.5 percent to $4.09 billion, slightly above the average estimate of $4 billion. The company cut the top end of its full-year profit forecast to $2.60 per share from $2.70, retaining the lower end at $2.55. Shares of the San Francisco-based company, which declined 3 percent in regular trading, dropped as much as 2 percent after the bell. They have fallen 27 percent so far this year."

-11.54065609010602," Gap shares tumble as flagship brand shows no sign of recovery (Reuters) - Shares of Gap Inc GPS.N fell 8 pct in premarket trading on Friday, a day after the company's namesake brand posted another bigger-than-expected drop in comparable sales, raising concerns around the unit's turnaround plan. Gap typically offers big discounts to entice shoppers to buy last season’s designs, but the company cut back on promotions as it prioritized profit margins over sales in the latest reported quarter, leading to disappointing results at its main brand. The Gap brand is expected to weigh on the company’s gross margins in the current quarter as it works through its inventory issues, B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson said. Anderson, who cut her price target on the company’s stock by $2 to $33, said she would remain on the sidelines until the brand showed consistent positive comparable sales. Sales at Gap branded stores open for more than a year fell 5 percent in the fiscal second quarter, more than the 2.55 percent decline forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Other analysts saw positives in strong performance at company’s other key brands - Old Navy and Athleta. In a note titled “Dear B.O.D. of GPS... Please Change Name of Company to Old Navy”, Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said the company’s better-than-expected profit and reaffirmed guidance show that the Gap brand does not matter as long as Old Navy remains solid and Athleta continues to grow. The Gap brand posted its worst same store sales miss in three quarters. Analysts expect sales to fall in the current quarter as well, with an average estimate of a drop of 2.6 percent. “We think Gap will continue to lose share to fast-fashion and off-price peers,” Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said, adding that the company had no clear execution on a plan to stave off losses in key segments."
-19.148595431269," Sales at Gap brand stores worsen, shares fall (Reuters) - Gap Inc's GPS.N namesake brand reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly same-store sales on Thursday, sending shares down nearly 7 percent in after-hours trade even as the apparel retailer beat Wall Street profit expectations and posted strong revenue. The results signaled the San Francisco company still must work to revive its Gap brand, which has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as H&M HMb.ST and Forever 21 and tackle the dominance of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. Reaffirming its forecast on Thursday, Gap Inc battled rising inventory during the quarter, especially that of Gap brand, as older styles and some summer basics remain on the shelves. The company earlier offered huge discounts on Gap-label apparel mainly to clear inventories but which ended up hurting sales and margins. Gap executives said on Thursday the focus has turned toward improving margins. “Obviously, we’re not pleased with this performance,” Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll told analysts on a conference call, but added, “it reflects the conscious choice to prioritize margin dollars over comp growth as we continue to move through the inventory issues in the brand.” List-Stoll expects some improvement in the fall and through the holidays. But Gap brand’s assortment continues to look boring, with little effort being made to create newness, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said on Thursday. “It discourages people from visiting and purchasing ... It means Gap struggles to charge full price and has to resort to continuous discounting to try and stimulate sales,” Saunders said in emailed comments. Gap Chief Executive Art Peck said an improved supply chain remains a focus. “There’s no question that this is an important factor of powering Old Navy’s consistency, Athleta’s growth and Banana’s continued turnaround,” Peck said on the same call, referring to Gap’s other brands. Old Navy, which offers lower-priced apparel, again performed well. Same-store sales rose 5 percent, topping analysts’ estimate of 4.5 percent growth. Sales at Gap brand stores open for more than a year fell 5 percent in the fiscal second quarter, more than the 2.55 percent decline forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gap Inc’s net sales rose 7.5 percent to $4.09 billion in the second quarter ended Aug. 4, beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.01 billion. Excluding certain items, Gap earned 76 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 72 cents. Gap shares were down 6.6 percent at $30.30 in after-hours trading."

-17.138394484075263," U.S. hedge funds bet on retail, tech in second-quarter as economy sizzled (Reuters) - Prominent hedge fund managers appeared to make big second-quarter bets that the U.S. economy would continue to expand despite increasing concerns about a broadening trade dispute between the United States and China, regulatory filings showed Tuesday. Third Point added new positions in payment companies PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O and Visa Inc V.N, both of which are up more than 19 percent year to date. Greenlight Capital, run by billionaire investor David Einhorn, added new positions in low-to-middle income retailers including Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O, Dollar General Corp DG.N, Gap Inc GPS.N, and TJX Companies Inc TJX.N, the parent company of discount retailers TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. Activist fund Jana Partners added shares of broad-based exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 indexes and took new positions in Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and food delivery company GrubHub Inc GRUB.N. The flurry of new positions in cyclical companies came during a quarter in which U.S. gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, nearly double the 2.2 percent rate of the first quarter of the year, according to Commerce Department estimates. A rally in cyclical companies would help boost hedge fund industry returns at a time when many fund firms are under pressure from investors to lower their fees or improve their performance. Hedge funds, on average, are up 1.5 percent since the start of January, according to research firm Hedge Fund Research, well behind the 6.2 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same time. “Everyone is comparing everything to the S&P 500 and that’s a very difficult hurdle for the last few years,” said Sol Waksman, president of research firm BarclayHedge. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of learning what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm’s stock holdings. Large hedge fund managers cut their positions in some of the so-called FAANG stocks - the moniker given to Facebook Inc FB.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O - that led the market higher last year. Third Point sold all of its stake in Alphabet and divested 1 million shares of Facebook, reducing its position in the company by 25 percent. At the same time, it increased its stake in Microsoft Corp MSFT.O by nearly 310 percent, buying 1.7 million shares. Omega Advisors, meanwhile, sold all of its position in Netflix and added new holdings in biotechnology companies including Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Inc MDGL.O and Deciphera Pharmaceuticals Inc DCPH.O. A number of prominent fund managers sharply cut their stake in Apple only weeks before it became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be worth more than $1 trillion. Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital slashed its stake by 77 percent, while Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management got rid of 95 percent. Advisory firm Diamond Hill Capital Management cut its stake by 27 percent. Other big holders, including Sanders Capital and Adage Capital Partners, trimmed only small amounts in the second quarter."
-2.1793338348126197," H&M, Gap to probe violence and sex abuse in Asian factories LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fashion giants H&M and Gap Inc vowed on Tuesday to investigate reports that Asian garment workers who supply their high-street stores routinely face sex abuse, harassment and violence. Based on interviews with some 550 workers in 53 H&M and Gap supplier factories in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, rights groups said women were at “daily risk” of violence, and faced retaliation if they reported the attacks. The coalition has investigated the factories for several years as efforts mount to push Western brands into improving safety along their supply chains and render them slave-free. Clothes stitched by low-paid Asian workers - part of a complex global supply chain - end up on high-priced Western high streets, with some 4,750 H&M stores located in 69 countries and about 3,700 Gap shops operating in about 90 nations. Sweden’s H&M - the world’s No. 2 clothes group after Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC) - said it would review the findings of the recent report by the civil society groups and unions. “We will go through every section of the report and follow up on (a) factory level with our local teams based in each production country,” a company spokesman said in a statement. “All forms of abuse or harassment are against everything that H&M group stands for.” U.S. retailer Gap said it was “deeply concerned about the troubling allegations raised by this report”. “Our global team is currently conducting our due diligence to investigate and address these issues,” a spokeswoman said. The charities said they had found widespread sex harassment, verbal and physical abuse - such as slapping - and threats of retaliation when women refused sexual advances from bosses. A separate report published last month by the coalition of rights groups found similar abuse of women at supplier factories in Asia for U.S.-based Walmart, the world’s largest retailer. Walmart said last month that it was reviewing the “concerning” accounts cited in the report. The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), a group of trade unions, firms and charities of which both Gap and H&M are members, said it expected the retailers to work with the suppliers to ensure that women have swift access to remedy. “These allegations are deeply concerning,” said Debbie Coulter of the ETI. “Gender-based violence is unacceptable under any circumstances, and brands need to make sure that women working in their supply chain are protected.” Campaigners told the Thomson Reuters Foundation last month that the level of pressure and harassment faced by the workers in the three separate reports was approaching forced labor. “Any time you have retaliation against workers, and coercion and control ... you are coming close to the line of forced labor,” Jennifer Rosenbaum of Global Labor Justice (GLJ), a network of worker and migrant organizations, said last month. The reports have been published amid meetings hosted by the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO) to work on the first global convention against workplace harassment after the #MeToo campaign thrust the issue into the spotlight."

-9.30005791785493," Gap stumbles as namesake brand's struggles continue (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Gap Inc GPS.N reported quarterly same-store sales on Thursday that missed analysts' estimates as its namesake brand struggled to clear excess inventory in a quarter marred by an unusually long winter. Shares of the company, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, fell 8 percent in extended trading after the company’s first-quarter profit fell well below expectations. The results signaled that the company is still some way away from reviving the Gap brand, which has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as H&M HMb.ST and Forever 21 and tackle the dominance of Amazon.com AMZN.O. Though Chief Executive Officer Art Peck has pushed hard to bring styles to stores faster like fast-fashion chains, the company has failed to capture the imagination of shoppers like it had done a decade ago. Peck fired GAP brand President Jeff Kirwan earlier this year for poor operating performance and is yet to find a permanent replacement. “The quarter did present some challenges. Some are largely expected like the Gap brand operating issues, and others were less predictable, like the unseasonably cold and snowy weather,” Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said Sales at Gap branded stores open for at least a year sunk 4 percent, widely missing analysts expectations of a 0.4 percent drop, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Even its strong performing Old Navy business posted a lower-than-expected 3 percent rise in same-store sales, missing estimates for the first time in four quarters. Inventories in the quarter rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to Gap merchandise stuck on shelves and in warehouses. “(Gap) inventory is not perfect. But we took a significant one-time correction to get it done and get it behind us,” Peck said on a post-earnings call. Gross margins dropped 120 basis points, excluding new accounting rules, in the quarter. The company, however, expects pressure on margins to ease in the current quarter. Overall same-store sales rose 1 percent in the three months ended May 5, while analysts were expecting a 1.67 percent increase. Net income rose to $164 million, or 42 cents per share, in the reported quarter from $143 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 42 cents per share, 4 cents below Wall Street estimates. Total revenue rose to $3.78 billion and beat the average estimate of $3.61 billion, due to strength in its Banana Republic brand."

0.4388844858380138," Gap apologizes for selling T-shirt with 'incorrect map' of China SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Gap Inc GPS.N apologized on Monday for selling a T-shirt which it said had an incorrect map of China, adding it would implement ""rigorous reviews"" to prevent a repeat mistake. The apology came after a person posted pictures of the T-shirt on Chinese social media network Weibo, saying that Chinese territories, including south Tibet, the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea, were omitted from the map. The user said the photo of the T-shirt was taken at an outlet store in Canada. “Gap Inc. respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. We’ve learned that a Gap brand T-shirt sold in some overseas markets failed to reflect the correct map of China. We sincerely apologize for this unintentional error,” it said in a statement posted on its Weibo account on Monday evening. It added that the products had been pulled from the Chinese market and destroyed. Gap's apology comes as China has been ramping up efforts to police language used to describe Chinese-claimed territories such as Taiwan. Other U.S. companies which have issued apologies for similar incidents include Delta Air Lines DAL.N and Marriott International Inc MAR.O. Earlier this month, the White House sharply criticized China’s efforts to force foreign airlines to change how they described Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau on their websites as “Orwellian nonsense.”"
4.751462822812568," UPDATE 3-Euro zone bond yields at 1-month high as oil surges * Oil highest in over 3 year highs * German 10-year bond yield at 1-month high, others follow * Euro zone yields up 5-7 bps * Italy/German yield gap at tightest since August 2016 (Updates price action) By Fanny Potkin and Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields jumped to one-month peaks on Thursday as oil prices climbed to their highest level since late 2014, raising the prospect of upward pressure on inflation. Oil prices rose as U.S. crude inventories declined and after sources told Reuters that top exporter Saudi Arabia aims to push prices even higher. Sustained higher energy prices could feed through into higher inflation, potentially speeding up a tightening of monetary policy in the euro zone. Combined with new bond supply from France and Spain, the rise in oil prices gave investors an incentive to sell bonds after recent strong price gains. Ten-year bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to the price, rose 5-7 basis points in late trade with those in Germany, France, Austria and Ireland all rising to around one-month highs. Germany’s 10-year bond yield jumped to 0.60 percent and was set for its biggest one-day jump since September. French yields rose to 0.84 percent and were poised for their biggest one-day rise since September. A key market gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the euro zone meanwhile rose to its highest level in five weeks, to about 1.7 percent. “Oil has an impact on the yield segment, on Bunds, but it’s still rather moderate,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenk. New bond supply from France and Spain added to upward pressure on yields. France sold around 7 billion euros of debt, while Spain auctioned 4.6 billion euros of bonds. “The volume of issuance today also explains the move in a quiet market,” said Rabobank fixed income strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor. In late trade, Swiss bonds also came under pressure after the Swiss franc fell to its lowest level against the euro since the central bank removed a currency cap in January 2015. The gap between Italian and German borrowing costs narrowed further to 117 bps, its tightest since August 2016. Italy has reached a political impasse in the wake of an inconclusive election, but the market has taken some solace from the fact that a populist coalition looks unlikely to be formed. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement on Wednesday challenged the far-right League to abandon its electoral allies by the end of the week and form a joint government, but it was unclear whether the League would agree to such a move. Analysts said the lack of progress on a coalition between the two was reassuring to markets; both are hostile to EU budget rules and the anti-immigration League also wants to leave the euro zone.
