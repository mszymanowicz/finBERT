0.03226872038342366," Campbell revenue surges in run-up to 'heart of soup season' (Reuters) -Campbell Soup Co beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as supermarkets bulk-purchased its soups in preparation for winter sales and an extended coronavirus-led home confinement saw more people dining at home. Consumers are looking for healthy snacks and quick fixes as they cook more at home, reaching out for cans of soups at supermarkets or ordering them online in more numbers. Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said retailers were stocking up for the holidays and “the heart of soup season”, leading to a 21% surge in sales of soups alone in the United States. Sales at the meals and beverages unit, which makes Pacific Foods soups and broths and Prego pasta sauces, rose 12%. However, snack sales were up just 1% on muted demand for Lance sandwich and Goldfish crackers. For the current quarter, the company forecast sales to grow between 5% and 7%, compared with analysts’ average expectation of a 6.5% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Adjusted profit is expected to be between 81 cents and 83 cents, just short of the estimate of 84 cents. Net sales rose 7.2% to $2.34 billion in the first quarter ended Nov. 1, beating analysts’ average estimate of $2.32 billion. Net earnings attributable to the company rose to $309 million, or $1.02 per share, from $166 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of 91 cents on a per share basis. Shares of the company were down about 1% before the bell."

1.161560453487768," Campbell Soup expects sales to fall as lockdowns ease; shares fall (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N on Thursday forecast first-quarter revenue largely above market estimates due to pandemic-buying, but said it expects sales to drop off in the second-half of its fiscal year as people start dining out again, sending shares down 5.5%. The packaged food industry has seen an unprecedented wave of demand since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with people on lockdown stocking their pantries and eating more at home. At Campbell, for instance, fourth-quarter U.S. soup sales rose 52%, despite having struggled to grow for several years. [For a graphic, click here: here] But it is unlikely the company will be able to sustain the sales growth it has seen since the start of March for its Prego pasta sauces and Goldfish crackers. New Jersey-based Campbell expects lower fiscal second-half sales, but said demand will not entirely revert back to pre-COVID levels because the pandemic has put its cookies, potato chips and sauces in the pantries of households that did not previously buy them. Given how many food companies are reporting very strong numbers with extremely positive tones, Campbell’s commentary was slightly shy of expectations this morning, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. Elevated demand has put pressure on Campbell’s inventory levels, expenses and supply chain this year. Campbell said it spent $50 million on fourth-quarter COVID-related costs, and that it expects expenses to continue in the first half of this fiscal year at a “moderated level compared to the fourth quarter.” Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said she questions whether Campbell will be able to retain its new customers in a post-COVID world - particularly those currently buying packaged soup - due to longstanding concerns about tinned food and sodium content. Campbell forecast current-quarter net sales to rise between 5% and 7%, and adjusted profit to be between 88 cents and 92 cents per share. Analysts on average expected Campbell to earn 90 cents per share and its net sales to rise 5.2%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Campbell said net sales rose to $2.11 billion in the fourth quarter, ended Aug. 2, from $1.78 billion, a year earlier, beating expectations of $2.08 billion. Excluding one-time items, Campbell earned 63 cents per share, compared with analysts’ expectation of 60 cents per share."

0.10912930986782181," Campbell Soup raises 2020 forecasts on strong sales in pandemic (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N raised its 2020 outlook after beating expectations for third-quarter results as consumers stocked up on soup and sauces during the pandemic. Campbell’s shares, which have outperformed the S&P 500 index by more than 12 percentage points since the market began falling after February 19, fell 3% on Wednesday, however, after the company discussed troubles it had meeting the surging consumer demand. Also, Campbell’s implied forecast for the current fourth quarter was shy of Wall Street estimates, said JP Morgan analysts. Demand for packaged foods soared during lockdowns, as shuttered restaurants forced people to eat more at home. Campbell expects several pandemic-born trends to continue - quick cooking from scratch, online shopping, a need for more in-store inventory and a focus on value. The company saw a 6% quarterly increase in the number of households buying its products and said it was working to hold on to new consumers with increased marketing. In its namesake soup business, U.S. quarterly sales rose 35 percent, but Campbell’s market share was hurt by being out of stock at times. “We didn’t get everything perfect in regard to product availability,” Campbell said in a transcript of a presentation on its website. It expects to be in a stronger position over the next couple months, as demand eases and summer approaches. If consumer demand remains unusually elevated, that may take longer, it said. Campbell Soup shares have previously outperformed peers reut.rs/3dxuKTB in crises, during the 2008 recession and in the aftermath of the Sept 11, 2001 attacks. The maker of Prego pasta sauce and Goldfish crackers raised its fiscal 2020 forecasts to $2.87 to $2.92 for adjusted earnings per share and 5.5% to 6.5% for net sales growth. Net sales were $2.24 billion in the third quarter, ended April 26, beating estimates of $2.22 billion. Excluding one-time items, Campbell earned 83 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average expectation of 75 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares were down 2.7 percent at $50.62."

-6.794471728135868," Campbell Soup boosts guidance as profit beats forecasts; shares jump (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N on Wednesday raised its fiscal full-year earnings forecast and posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales due to strong demand for soups and snacks, and its shares rose 5% in early trade. The 150-year-old company has sought to revitalize its canned soup business, rolling out new recipes, eliminating preservatives and amping up marketing to lure back health-conscious customers who favor freshly-made salads and sandwiches. Campbell’s investments drove higher demand for condensed soups and broths in the quarter, boosting sales at its U.S. soup unit by 1%. “We showed marked improvement and executed well in what was the most important quarter for soup,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said on a post-earnings call. Campbell’s stock has gained about 24% since late 2018 when Clouse was hired to turn the company around in the wake of a prolonged proxy battle with hedge fund Third Point LLC. Campbell, which makes Prego pasta sauces and Pepperidge Farm cookies and Goldfish crackers, has also boosted investments to address changing consumer tastes in its snacks business. Organic sales at its snacks division rose 2%, due to higher demand for Goldfish crackers, Kettle Brand and Cape Cod potato chips. Campbell sold its fresh food and certain international snack brands last year so it could focus on growing its U.S. soup and snacks businesses. The company said the divestments helped it reduce debt and it now expects fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings of $2.55 to $2.60 per share because of lower adjusted net interest costs. Campbell’s new forecast is 5 cents more than previous guidance. Net earnings attributable to the company was $1.21 billion, compared to a loss of $59 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts’ expectation of 66 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said net sales fell marginally to $2.16 billion in the second quarter ended Jan. 26, but beat analysts’ expectations of $2.15 billion."
-6.794471728135868," As Americans hoard food, Campbell Soup speeds up ingredients orders CHICAGO (Reuters) - Campbell Soup CPB.N said it is ordering more ingredients to ensure it can keep enough soups, sauces and snacks on hand to meet growing demand from retailers as U.S. consumers hoard food in preparation for potential coronavirus quarantines. Over the weekend, a few retail customers began stepping up orders, Campbell Chief Executive Mark Clouse told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. The company had already begun building inventory for ingredients that are usually stockpiled during natural disasters, including canned soups, snacks and Prego pasta sauces. “We’re working very closely with folks to make sure that we keep them in stock,” Clouse said, adding that “honestly before this weekend we had not seen much” higher demand. The outbreak has killed more than 3,000 people globally and is in nearly 80 countries and territories. In the United States, people have been stocking their pantries in case they cannot leave their homes. A few state health departments have urged residents to stock up on non-perishable foods, prescription medications and sanitary supplies. Some worry supply chains could be strained and store shelves of major retailers such as Walmart WMT.N and Kroger KR.N. U.S. retailer Target Corp TGT.N said on Tuesday it was seeing a surge in store traffic due to the virus. Data firm Nielsen has reported that demand for some consumer products - such as pretzels and fruit snacks - was up 5-7% in January and February. Clouse said sales growth over the last couple of weeks was comparable, but that he did not know if this would continue. “There’s no question that we’re seeing some uptick - it’s just hard for me yet to know the level of sustained need,” Clouse said. SpaghettiOs canned pasta and Swanson canned chicken are also seeing higher demand, he added. On Tuesday, Campbell reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit. The 150-year-old company has been working to revitalize its canned soup business, rolling out new recipes, eliminating preservatives and ramping up marketing to lure back health-conscious customers. Campbell’s stock has gained about 24% since late 2018 when Clouse was hired to turn the company around. The company is looking for alternatives to ingredients it buys from places where supply chains are being disrupted. Yet Clouse, who sold the fresh food unit and some international brands to focus on the U.S. business, noted that the company is far less exposed to global supply chain disruptions than it was before. “Only about 10% of our total ingredients come from outside of North America, with China under 2%.”"

9.558791691155903," Late Thanksgiving cools Campbell soup sales as grocers delay shipments (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N on Wednesday missed quarterly sales estimates after a late Thanksgiving delayed soup shipments, and lowered its fiscal 2020 sales forecast to account for the sale of its European chips business. As consumers grow increasingly health-conscious, Campbell has been trying to jumpstart its struggling canned soup business by rolling out products that contain fewer preservatives. The 150-year-old company, which makes Prego pasta sauce and Goldfish crackers, has been divesting some businesses so it can focus on core brands. Grocers delayed stocking up on condensed soups and broths this year due to a late U.S. Thanksgiving, typically an important holiday for Campbell’s soup sales. The meals and beverages unit, which makes soups and sauces, reported a first-quarter sales decline of 3% to $1.2 billion. Campbell has suggested that 2% of sales in the meals and beverages business were moved into the second quarter, J.P.Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. He called Campbell’s overall results “lukewarm,” saying the quarter didn’t change Campbell’s story either way. Net sales fell about 1% to $2.18 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 27, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.19 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. In October, the company sold its European chips business, which included UK-based Kettle Foods, to Valeo Foods for 66 million pounds. Campbell said it now expects 2020 net sales in the range of a 1% fall to a 1% gain, compared with its prior forecast of a 1% to 3% rise. Underlying organic sales expectations were unchanged, Campbell said. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 78 cents per share, 7 cents above expectations, helped by a 2% decrease in selling and marketing costs. The Camden, New Jersey-based company’s shares, which have risen 44.2% this year, were up 2% in early trade."

To better focus on its mainstream soup and snack businesses, Campbell has been streamlining its operations by disposing its international and fresh businesses, including Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa. The company has introduced new soup recipes with added chicken and tomatoes and eliminated preservatives to also draw in health-conscious customers. “It was great to see growth in soup. It’s the first time in quite a number of years that we’ve been able to drive growth on the business,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse told analysts on a call to discuss earnings. Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell, which also makes Prego pasta sauces, Kettle potato chips and Perpperidge Farm cookies, reported its best gross margin in six quarters. Shares rose 8.2% to $46.87 in morning trading. The quality of Campbell’s fourth-quarter results was strong and the outlook for the rest of the year was better than feared, given the impact of divestitures, J.PMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said. “Momentum is on Campbell’s side right now, and we expect a solid season of soup shipments ahead.” Campbell said it expects net sales for fiscal 2020 to grow by 1%-3%, adjusted earnings per share to increase by 9%-11%. Last month, Campbell said it would sell Kelsen Group, a unit known for Royal Dansk cookies, to a Ferrero affiliated company for $300 million.

10.748449386897969," Campbell confirms sale of Australian snacks unit Arnott's to KKR for $2.2 billion (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N on Friday confirmed that it signed a deal to sell its Australian snacks unit Arnott's and some of its international operations to KKR & Co Inc KKR.N for $2.2 billion as the U.S. company works on reducing debt. Campbell and KKR will enter into a long-term licensing arrangement for the exclusive rights to use certain Campbell brands, including Campbell’s, Swanson, V8, Prego, Chunky and Campbell’s Real Stock, in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and other select markets, the company said. “This was a thorough and complex process in which we considered many options,” Campbell Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said. “By applying almost $3 billion of divestiture net proceeds to reduce debt, Campbell’s balance sheet will be stronger and capable of supporting our plan to grow our focused and differentiated portfolio,” he said. KKR & Co said last week it was buying Campbell’s Arnott’s that will give it ownership of top-selling biscuit brands such as Tim Tam. Campbell put its international unit and ‘Fresh’ unit up for sale last year as it wanted to focus on its core North American businesses and reduce debt. It was also under pressure from investors to improve profitability and stock performance. In July, U.S. packaged food company said it would sell its Danish unit Kelsen Group to an affiliate of Nutella maker Ferrero SpA for $300 million."
17.06557895253615," KKR devours Tim Tam biscuits maker in $2.2 billion deal with Campbell SYDNEY (Reuters) - KKR & Co KKR.N said it is buying Campbell Soup Co's CPB.N Australian snacks unit Arnott's that will give it ownership of top-selling biscuit brands such as Tim Tam, in a deal local media reported was worth $2.2 billion. “I can confirm that KKR’s offer for Arnott’s was accepted by Campbell’s late last night,” an Australia-based spokeswoman for the New York-headquartered buyout firm said in an email, without specifying the price or commenting further. The Australian Financial Review reported earlier without citing sources that the agreed sale price was $2.2 billion, less than the over $3 billion the seller reportedly wanted for the asset. A Campbell Soup spokeswoman declined to comment on the report and said the unit had not yet been sold. “The process to divest Arnott’s and the rest of our international operations is ongoing,” the spokeswoman for the U.S. food company said in a statement. The sale marks the second change of offshore ownership of a large Australian food and drink brand in a week, after Belgian beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR agreed to offload its Australian operations - with best-selling labels like VB and Carlton Draught - to Japan's Asahi 2502.T for $11 billion. In 2016, Philippines-based Universal Robina Corp URC.PS paid $460 million for the maker of some of Australia's best-known salty snacks, including CC's, Kettle chips and Thins, from local interests. Two years before that, Universal Robina paid $470 million for New Zealand’s top snack maker Griffin’s Foods Ltd from Australian private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners (PEP). Companies like Arnott’s and the AB InBev unit “have a long history in Australia, and therefore have a degree of customer loyalty that can be harnessed to create value for these companies and expand their market share,” said Matthew Reeves, an analyst at IBISWorld. “Being located in the Asia-Pacific, close to many developing economies, Australia is a springboard to expand into these countries,” he added. Though Australians are used to Arnott’s being owned by foreign interests - Campbell bought it in 1997 - the sale gives KKR control of assets that have been synonymous with snacking in the 12th-largest economy for a century and a half. Arnott’s also makes Iced Vovos, SAO, Wagon Wheel, Monte Carlo and Mint Slice biscuits. Australian media had reported PEP bid for Arnott's. Mondelez MDLZ.O was also cited by Australian and other media as interested in the business, which the U.S. company has declined to comment on. Representatives for PEP declined to comment.

The 150-year-old food company, struggling with slowing demand for the soups which made its name, has been doubling down on its snack segment, increasing marketing investment, product launches and acquisitions. Last year, Campbell Soup acquired snacks maker Snyder’s Lance for $4.87 billion, adding brands such as Cape Cod and Lance to its portfolio. The company also launched marketing campaigns for Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels and Kettle chips while introducing the Epic Crunch line of nachos and crackers under its Goldfish brand. Sales in global biscuits and snacks jumped 37% to $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Campbell’s meals and beverage category, the biggest and most profitable segment that includes the soup business, also showed signs of improvement in the quarter. Organic sales growth in the segment was flat compared to declines in the last nine quarters. “Change will not happen overnight, but we are building confidence that we can win in soup again,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said. For the full year, Campbell expects adjusted profit between $2.50 and $2.55 per share, compared with prior forecast of $2.45 and $2.53, factoring in strong results, the impact of its fresh business divestitures and lower interest expense. Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said he expected full-year costs to rise by $2 million-$4 million, if the proposed tariffs on imports from Mexico were levied on the ingredients and packaging items it imports from the country. Excluding items, the company earned 56 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 9 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total combined net sales, including the discontinued fresh food segment, climbed 12% to $2.39 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $2.37 billion. “We view today’s print as a clear positive,” J.P Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.

3.6646326582247966," Campbell to sell Bolthouse Farms for $510 million (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co said on Friday it would sell its Bolthouse Farms business to an affiliate of private equity firm Butterfly Equity for $510 million, in the U.S. food company’s first major sale as part of its plan to reduce debt. With the completion of deal, expected by July 2019, Campbell will have divested its entire fresh division, it said. In February, it agreed to sell salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet to a unit of Fountain of Health USA, which makes hummus, dips and prepared salads. Butterfly said its operating partner Jeff Dunn will take the role of chief executive officer at Bolthouse Farms, where he previously served as president and CEO between 2008 and 2015. Campbell bought Bolthouse, known for its fruit juices and packaged carrots, in 2012 for about $1.55 billion in a push to add healthier products to its portfolio. The business, however, has struggled in recent years, with issues ranging from farming missteps to the recall of 3.8 million bottles of protein shakes due to possible spoilage. The fresh food unit along with Campbell’s international business, has been up for sale since August after the company was pressured by investors to boost its profitability and stock performance. “The sale of Bolthouse Farms supports our strategy to focus on our two core North American businesses, Campbell Snacks and Campbell Meals and Beverages,” CEO Mark Clouse said. The packaged foods maker said the proceeds from deal would help reduce debt by about $570 million and that the transaction is not expected to impact the company’s fiscal 2019 forecast."

Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents a share in the second quarter ended Jan. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of 70 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Campbell’s shares jumped 5 percent in premarket trading. Net sales rose 24 percent to $2.71 billion, while organic sales were flat. In 2017, Campbell agreed to buy pretzels and Cape Cod chips maker Snyder’s-Lance Inc for $4.87 billion, and organic soup maker Pacific Foods for $700 million. Like other packaged food companies, Campbell has been struggling to attract young, increasingly health-conscious consumers. It has tried to make its portfolio healthier, and launched a cost-cutting and divestment plan in August. Campbell reported a net quarterly loss, hurt by higher restructuring costs and a $346 million writedown of its troubled fresh food business. This is the fourth time Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell has written down the value of its fresh unit since September 2016, knocking about $1.35 billion off its value in total. The unit, which was put up for sale in August after a months-long strategic review, includes Bolthouse Farms. The business has struggled in recent years, with issues ranging from farming missteps to the recall of 3.8 million bottles of protein shakes.

The development boosts Campbell Soup’s chances of divesting its international portfolio, which includes its Australian cookie brand Arnott’s and Danish baked snacks maker Kelsen Group, with one deal, two sources said on Sunday. Both Kraft Heinz and Mondelez are interested in the assets so they can expand their global footprint.

Nutella maker Ferrero SpA, which had previously also expressed interest in the assets, is currently in talks with Campbell Soup over whether it will remain involved in the auction process, the sources added. Campbell Soup could wrap up the auction for its international business in the first quarter of 2019, the sources said, asking not to be identified because details of the process are confidential. Campbell Soup, Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Ferrero, Bain, KKR and FinTrek Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under pressure from investors to boost its profitability and stock performance, Campbell Soup announced in August it would make preparations to divest its international portfolio as well as its “fresh” business, which includes Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet. This will allow it to reduce its $8 billion debt pile and focus on its core North American market, as well as its snacks, meals and beverages businesses. Most of the debt weighing on Campbell Soup is the legacy of its $6.1 billion acquisition in March of snack maker Snyder’s-Lance Inc. Last Thursday, Campbell Soup named Mark Clouse, the former CEO of Pinnacle Foods, as its new chief executive, in another key step in the company’s efforts to regain market share and boost profits. The pick had the backing of Campbell Soup shareholder Third Point LLC. In November, Campbell Soup settled a proxy contest against Third Point by agreeing to add two of the activist hedge fund’s nominees to the food company’s board, and giving the investor a say in selecting Campbell Soup’s next CEO."
7.013847856878142," Incoming Campbell Soup CEO Clouse to be paid up to $7.4 million in 2019 CHICAGO (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N said on Friday that incoming Chief Executive Mark Clouse, a food industry veteran, could be paid as much as $7.4 million in compensation for fiscal 2019. Clouse, the former chief of frozen food maker Pinnacle Foods, was named Campbell’s new CEO on Thursday after a seven-month search to replace former CEO Denise Morrison, who left abruptly in May. Campbell said in a filing that Clouse’s pay-packet included a base salary of $1 million and a potential bonus of $1.4 million. On Jan. 22, the day he starts working at Campbell, Clouse will also get a long-term incentive award of $5 million. At Pinnacle Foods - where Clouse’s tenure was marked by a 54 percent rise in stock value - he earned $5.22 million in 2017 and $14.1 million in 2016. Clouse, 50, began working in the food industry over two decades ago. His appointment comes just weeks after Campbell and activist hedge fund Third Point LLC settled a bitter proxy contest. Campbell has reported years of weak earnings, trailing the rest of the food industry. “Campbell needs someone who can shake up the way the company is run, clean house and reinvigorate the brands,” Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said on Thursday. Under Clouse's watch earlier this year, Pinnacle was sold to ConAgra Brands Inc CAG.N for $8.1 billion. On Thursday, Conagra CEO Sean Connolly said since buying Pinnacle, he realized the business would be “significantly” less profitable than initially expected. Connolly said Pinnacle’s problems were to do with innovation at its top brands, including Birds Eye and Duncan Hines. That “muddies Clouse’s track record a little, but he’s had a good track record for years and he’s still an ideal candidate for Campbell,” Weissman said. Shares in Campbell fell 5.1 percent on Friday and have tumbled about 26 percent this year."

Clouse has a reputation as a seasoned food industry operator. Shares in Pinnacle Foods surged 54 percent during his tenure as CEO, widely outperforming packaged food peers, most of which have lost share value in recent years as they struggle to grow sales among increasingly health-conscious shoppers. Reuters reported the news earlier on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter who said Clouse’s appointment would be announced imminently. He has the support of Campbell Soup shareholder and activist hedge fund Third Point LLC, which has been hoping Campbell Soup will eventually be sold, according to the sources. Clouse led Pinnacle as CEO between 2016 and earlier this year, when that company was sold to ConAgra Brands Inc CAG.N for $8.1 billion. A military veteran who served in the U.S. Army after having graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Clouse began working in the food industry more than two decades ago. He had been chief growth officer at Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O and previously worked in marketing at Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O. Clouse will start at Campbell on Jan. 22. By picking Clouse, Campbell Soup has made good on its promise to name a new CEO before the end of the year. It operated for months with an interim chief, Keith McLoughlin, after former CEO Denise Morrison left in abruptly in May. McLoughlin will remain a director, Campbell said. The exact details of Clouse’s compensation package as Campbell Soup CEO could not be learned. In 2017, Clouse earned $5.22 million as Pinnacle Foods CEO. In 2016, he earned $14.1 million. Campbell shares were down 1.1 pct aftermarket at $37.27. The company has been struggling for some time, trailing other food companies, as its stock price tumbled 20 percent in the last 52 weeks. Its foray into fresh foods faltered, its soup sales shrunk and Wall Street questioned the company’s aggressive acquisitions, led by former CEO Morrison, that failed to lift profits and saddled the company with fresh debt. “Mark was the board’s top choice due to his success leading organizations through significant transformations,” Campbell said in a statement, adding that Third Point provided input into the CEO search process and supported Clouse’s appointment. The news of the new CEO comes just weeks after Campbell and Third Point settled a bitter proxy contest. Third Point initially proposed sweeping out all 12 Campbell’s directors and then ended up settling for two board seats. As part of the settlement, two Third Point nominees, marketing expert Sarah Hofstetter and food industry veteran Kurt Schmidt, were added to the board and a third director will be chosen later. The hedge fund was also given an opportunity to weigh in on who the new CEO would be, according to the settlement. Campbell’s board, including three heirs to John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran Campbell’s a century ago, conducted a strategic review earlier this year and agreed to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units.

A deal between Campbell Soup and billionaire investor Daniel Loeb’s Third Point would end one of the most acrimonious U.S. proxy battles only days before investors were scheduled to vote on Thursday at Campbell’s annual meeting. Under the deal being negotiated, Campbell Soup would expand its board, naming two Third Point nominees, the sources said. These people will provide input on appointment of another director, expanding the board to 15 members. The hedge fund would promise to refrain from running a proxy contest in the next year, the sources said. Through the directors it nominates, Third Point will have a say in naming the company’s next CEO. Denise Morrison stepped down from the post last May. Campbell Soup director Keith McLoughlin has filled the vacancy on an interim basis and has said he does not want the position permanently. The company aims to name a permanent CEO before year end. Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini is one contender, sources have said, but Third Point has said an insider would be unacceptable. The hedge fund has been courting its own candidate, according to a source familiar with the matter. The proxy fight between Loeb and Campbell Soup has been one of the year’s most bitter. Third Point, which owns about 7 percent of Campbell Soup, was lining up support from other investors, but it was becoming increasingly clear the fund could not beat a bloc of heirs to the Campbell fortune who control 41 percent of the company and have three board seats. The potential settlement looks similar to an offer Campbell proposed to Third Point earlier this month. Third Point had rejected the company's offer to name as directors marketing expert Sarah Hofstetter, president of Comscore Inc SCOR.O, and former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt, who brings operational experience. The two are now expected to join the board. Campbell Soup and Third Point did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential settlement earlier on Sunday. Third Point surfaced as an investor in Campbell Soup over the summer, criticizing the lagging share price and spree of costly acquisitions and asking management to explore a sale. Campbell’s stock has lost about a third in value over the past two years. One of Third Point’s main criticisms has been the board’s lack of succession planning to replace Morrison, who pushed for acquisitions, including the purchase of Snyder’s-Lance, which added to Campbell’s debt load. When Third Point launched the proxy contest, its first since taking on Sotheby’s four years ago, it sought to oust Campbell Soup’s entire board, including three descendants of John Dorrance, inventor of condensed soup who ran Campbell’s a century ago. It allied itself with Campbell heir George Strawbridge. Third Point later scaled back its demands and got backing for its five nominees from proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. This year activist investors have launched 42 proxy contests at U.S.-based companies and 13 have been settled, data from Activist Insight show. Third Point pushed to put one of its partners on the board, saying Campbell needed financial expertise. As part of the settlement, it will now make periodic presentations to the board on financial matters, a person familiar with the negotiations said. After Morrison departed, Campbell Soup went through a strategic review and announced in August plans to sell its international and refrigerated foods business and explore the possibility of a full sale. McLoughlin said the company had lost focus within its brands and did not do enough to keep its soups business relevant to modern consumers. Campbell had maintained that Third Point lacked a smart plan to improve the company’s fortunes. On Tuesday, the company’s hand looked stronger when it reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly earnings. Also last week, McLoughlin met with Loeb in an effort to reach a deal, one of the sources said."
-16.456541239462847," Campbell Soup nears deal with Third Point to end board challenge-source Nov 25 (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co and Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC are close to an agreement over composition of the U.S. food company’s board of directors that will end a proxy contest that was due to come to a head this week, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. Under the deal being negotiated, Third Point will have two of its nominees appointed to Campbell Soup’s board and will be given a say over who will be the company’s new chief executive officer, the source said. The two Third Point nominees to join Campbell Soup’s board would be Comscore Inc president Sarah Hofstetter and former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt, the source said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the potential settlement, also said a third director, agreed upon by Third Point and Campbell Soup, could potentially join the board.

-12.332133475951526," Campbell Soup quarterly profit beats estimates, shares jump CHICAGO (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly earnings, sending shares of the embattled soup maker up 4 percent in premarket trading. Campbell, which has struggled for years to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies, launched a dramatic cost-cutting and divestment plan at the end of August. Excluding items, the 149-year-old company earned 79 cents a share in the first quarter ended Oct. 28, beating analysts’ average estimate of 70 cents, according to Refinitiv data. “We’re getting traction in our soup business, integrating in Snyder’s-Lance, divestitures are well underway, we’re driving out costs,” Interim Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told Reuters in a phone interview. McLoughlin, who has been a Campbell board member since 2016, was tapped to fill in temporarily when CEO Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down in May. The company, which reported weak corporate earnings for years under Morrison, has said it will name a new CEO before the end of the year. Campbell, owner of the Prego pasta sauce and Goldfish cracker brands, also said it had begun the process of divesting its international and fresh food businesses. The company said the units, which were put up for sale in August, have both attracted strong interest from potential buyers. Campbell, whose stock has lost about a third in value over the past two years, has been embroiled in a bitter proxy fight with activist shareholder Third Point LLC. The hedge fund, run by billionaire Daniel Loeb, has campaigned aggressively to replace some members of Campbell’s board. Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell did not provide an update on its CEO search or fight with hedge fund Third Point. “We are open to a solution (with Third Point) that makes sense and doesn’t compromise our ability to deliver the plan,” McLoughlin said. Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $194 million, or 64 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Oct. 28, from $275 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were hurt by “significantly” higher costs for steel and aluminum, as well as a rise in freight and logistics expenses, McLoughlin said. Costs for butter, wheat and grains also rose. Campbell, which uses steel and aluminum to make its iconic soup cans, has struggled this year with surging commodities and transportation costs. Some of this inflation has been exacerbated by global trade tensions, hurting earnings across the consumer goods industry. The company also said earnings were hurt by start-up challenges at a new distribution facility in Findlay, Ohio. McLoughlin said these problems had not continued into the second quarter. Net sales jumped about 25 percent to $2.69 billion, boosted by Campbell’s recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Organic sales fell 3 percent."

-10.134893149929933," Third Point gains ISS, Glass Lewis support in Campbell proxy fight NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backed a push by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund to make changes at Campbell Soup Co CPB.N, including replacing some board members. ISS recommended that investors elect all five of Loeb’s Third Point LLC board nominees, giving a boost to the activist firm, which is fighting a high profile proxy battle with the company. “The dissident slate seems well qualified to contribute to the company’s turnaround by providing relevant industry expertise, fresh ideas, and a greater sense of urgency,” ISS said in a report, adding “As such, votes FOR all dissident nominees are warranted.” Days ago Loeb backed off his call to replace the entire 12-person Campbell board. Investors are expected to vote on directors at the Nov. 29 annual meeting. ISS is generally seen as being reluctant to recommend ousting all board members. In its report, ISS backed former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt and former Hostess Brands Inc CEO William Toler as well as ComScore Inc president Sarah Hofstetter and former Uber Technologies executive Bozoma Saint John. It also recommended support for Third Point partner Munib Islam. However, Glass Lewis was not as whole-hearted in its support of Third point, recommending only three of its nominees. “We believe shareholders would be best served by supporting changes to the board intended specifically to increase the number of directors who have applicable, recent operating and branding experience in the packaged food industry,” Glass Lewis said. The firm added that the appointment of a Third Point representative to Campbell’s board would not be warranted at this time. Third Point has said its nominees can provide operational, marketing and branding as well as financial expertise to help turn around Campbell’s lagging stock performance. The company has been hurt by falling soup sales plus its fast paced acquisitions spree. In August, it announced plans to sell its fresh foods and international units. Campbell responded to the ISS and Glass Lewis reports by urging shareholders to support its full slate and said again that it had offered to expand the board to include two Third Point nominees, Schmidt and Hofstetter. It again voiced its objection to having a Third Point employee on its board. Third Point said in a statement that the findings of the two advisory firms conveyed a clear message to shareholders ... “the time has come to refresh the recipe in Campbell’s boardroom.” ISS said Campbell’s underperforming total stock return and weak fundamentals are linked to its acquisition strategy and poor execution on mergers as well as a lack of focus on its core business. “In light of these factors, the dissident has presented a compelling case that change at the board level is warranted,” the report said. Third Point owns roughly 7 percent of Campbell’s stock and it has allied with George Strawbridge, a descendant of John Dorrance who invented condensed soup and ran the company about a century ago. Three Dorrance heirs currently serve on the Campbell board and they plus another family member control roughly 40 percent of the shares, making Loeb’s proxy contest all the more difficult. At the outset, Loeb was pushing for a sale of the company but later backed away from that and more recently recommended splitting the company to make it more attractive to potential buyers. It also warned the company against hastily hiring a new chief executive during the proxy contest. The company had criticized the hedge fund for not having a concrete plan to turn around the company. ISS said it may make more sense for the company to improve its operations instead of pursuing a sale right now. “The dissident’s seemingly premature focus on a sale may have caused some investors to worry that a dissident-controlled board might not thoroughly explore all strategic options,” the report said."

-11.085527151182385," Campbell Soup offers to add two Third Point nominees to board (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N, which is in the midst of a proxy battle with Third Point LLC, said on Friday it offered to add two of the hedge fund's nominees to its board, after a similar proposal was rejected by the activist investor. The soup maker had proposed adding Kurt Schmidt and Sarah Hofstetter from the hedge fund’s slate to the board following its annual meeting. However, Third Point had rejected the offer, Campbell said. “Nonetheless, we believe it is important for all of our shareholders to know that we are offering to add ... Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Hofstetter,” the company said. Earlier on Friday, Third Point, the $17 billion hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, cut the number of nominees to the company’s board to five from 12. Loeb's smaller slate of five includes Third Point executive Munib Islam, Comscore's SCOR.O Sarah Hofstetter, pet food maker Blue Buffalo's CEO Kurt Schmidt, Hostess Brands' TWNK.O former CEO William Toler and Bozoma Saint John, a former Uber executive. The investment firm has accused the 149-year-old packaged food company of mismanagement and destroying shareholder value. Both Campbell and Third Point have sparred over plans for the company’s future as it struggles with falling soup sales and higher debt in the wake of its Snyder’s-Lance acquisition. In September, the hedge fund had nominated 12 directors, including an heir of Campbell’s controlling family, to replace all board members at the company’s upcoming Nov. 29 shareholder meeting. Heirs of the Dorrances, one of America’s richest families, have long controlled Campbell and currently sit on its board. The heirs have said they intend to vote their 41 percent ownership stake in favor of Campbell’s current board. Third Point owns a roughly 7 percent stake in the company."

-6.3689183281140895," Third Point says buybacks allowed Campbell heirs to build power CHICAGO (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC criticized Campbell Soup Co's CPB.N board on Monday for allowing the grandchildren of the company's former chairman to quietly build voting power through the soup maker's share buybacks in recent decades. Third Point, which owns 7 percent of Campbell’s stock, has been campaigning to oust its entire board at a shareholder’s meeting on Nov. 29, alleging that the company has been mismanaged for years. Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance, two Campbell heirs who sit on the company’s board and own about a third of its stock, have pledged to vote against Third Point along with several other Dorrance family shareholders. Share buybacks have given Malone and Dorrance “almost total control” of the company, Third Point said in a letter to shareholders. Other investors could effectively have no say in the company’s most important transactions because Campbell’s charter requires two-thirds of shareholder votes to approve major deals, the hedge fund said. “The collective Dorrance family ownership — including a variety of family members not mentioned by Third Point — has continuously been above the 33 percent threshold and has been publicly disclosed for years,” Campbell said in a statement. The company, which has repurchased about $11.2 billion of shares in the past 28 fiscal years, said the buybacks reflect a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and maximizing their long-term value. Third Point said Campbell’s buybacks since 1988 have shrunk its outstanding stock, helping Dorrance and Malone grow their percentage ownership of Campbell from about a fifth of shares in 1996. Filings show that the siblings have sold some Campbell stock since then. Campbell and Third Point have been embroiled in a contentious proxy fight since early September. The soup and snack maker has said Third Point’s proposed board is not qualified to oversee Campbell and that the hedge fund has failed to present new ideas to improve the company. Third Point sued Campbell late last month, alleging its board misled investors about the competence of its directors and the way it carried out a recently completed strategic review. On Friday, Third Point’s motion for expedited discovery was denied. The maker of Prego pasta sauces and Goldfish crackers has been hurt by tumbling sales and a higher debt burden from the Snyder’s-Lance deal. Its former chief executive, Denise Morrison, left abruptly in May and has been replaced by board member Keith McLoughlin on an interim basis."
-7.802639378121161," Third Point, Campbell spar over plans for company's future (Reuters) - Investment firm Third Point LLC and Campbell Soup Co CPB.N squared off over plans for the company's future on Tuesday, with the hedge fund pushing for hiring a ""highly qualified"" chief executive officer and the company saying it was already searching for a permanent chief. Third Point, the $17 billion hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, unveiled a 100-day plan that includes reviewing the company’s recently concluded strategic review and reevaluating its planned divestitures, hiring a “world-class permanent CEO” and refreshing the company’s core legacy products. The company said the hedge fund “simply and effectively copied and pasted the actual plan outlined by Campbell”, adding that the plan was not thoroughly thought out. “Vote for us and we’ll think of something,” the company said about Third Point’s plan. Loeb has nominated 12 directors, including an heir of Campbell’s controlling family, to replace all board members at the Nov. 29 annual meeting, in what will be the season’s most contentious proxy battle. But he faces a high hurdle with other heirs controlling roughly 40 percent of the company. Loeb and his nominees are set to make their case to influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Tuesday that will issue a report in several weeks. Campbell has been hurt by falling soup sales and a higher debt burden in the wake of its Snyder’s-Lance acquisition. Its former chief executive, Denise Morrison, left abruptly in May and has been replaced by board member Keith McLoughlin on an interim basis. The company said on Tuesday it was already searching for a permanent chief, with Third Point saying the proxy contest would make it difficult for Campbell to attract top talent. The hedge fund said Bill Toler, a member of its slate and CEO of Hostess Brands, would be prepared to step in as interim CEO if needed. Third Point last week sued Campbell in a New Jersey court alleging that the company misled investors with incorrect statement. A ruling could come as soon as Friday which could potentially allow the hedge fund’s lawyers to question Campbell board members Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance."
-5.800578680856686," Third Point sues Campbell Soup, accuses it of misleading investors NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Third Point LLC sued Campbell Soup Co CPB.N on Thursday, alleging the soup and snack maker's board misled investors about the competence of its directors and the way it carried out a recently completed strategic review. The lawsuit is the latest move in a bitter proxy contest in which billionaire investor Dan Loeb and his Third Point hedge fund wants to replace Campbell’s 12-member board so it can appoint its own directors and try to revitalize the company’s growth. “We are vigorously contesting the Third Point lawsuit,” Campbell said on Thursday. In a lawsuit filed in state superior court in Camden, New Jersey, which is Campbell’s hometown, Third Point said Campbell and its board “breached their fiduciary duties to Campbell’s stockholders by withholding material information critical to stockholders assessing how to vote at the company’s annual meeting.” It asked the court to prevent Campbell from holding its annual meeting on Nov. 29 until the board corrects what Third Point called its misstatements. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Three heirs of condensed soup inventor John Dorrance, who ran the company a century ago, sit on the board and are seeking re-election. Together they control 37 percent of Campbell’s stock. Third Point has asked the court to postpone shareholders’ votes on the board until the company corrects what Third Point described as misinformation by the board. The lawsuit said the company failed to disclose critical information about its directors, including Dorrance’s grandchild Bennett Dorrance. It accused the company of not making adequately clear what Dorrance’s business ventures and investments were, among other things. Dorrance did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment. The company’s shares closed down 1.1 percent at $37.95 on Thursday, down more than 20 percent since the start of the year. ‘SUPERFICIAL UNDERSTANDING’ Earlier on Thursday, Campbell’s board chairman wrote a letter to investors saying that Third Point’s proposed directors were not qualified to oversee the company and that Third Point had not presented any new ideas or specific strategic plan. “Third Point has, at best, a superficial understanding of the food industry and the company, as evidenced by its non-substantive plan filled with platitudes and business school buzzwords,” the letter to shareholders said. Lawsuits are not uncommon in proxy battles as both sides seek every advantage. Third Point said in the suit that it needed the court’s help to wage a “meaningful proxy contest” and for investors to make fully informed decisions. Such cases are difficult for activist investors to win, said Kai Liekefett, a partner who heads law firm Sidley Austin’s activist defense practice. But merely bringing the case could offer advantages. “Third Point might be hoping to obtain damaging and embarrassing documentation such as emails during discovery. This worked well for them in the Sotheby’s proxy contest,” where the hedge fund was given three board seats in 2014, he added. Third Point said in its lawsuit that shareholders did not have enough information to assess the company’s strategic plans, which includes selling some divisions and finding a permanent chief executive to replace Denise Morrison, who left in May. “Without further information about its strategic plan that the board has withheld, and that is unknowable to stockholders without further disclosure, the Nov. 29 director election will be a sham,” the lawsuit said."

-2.2018481853174365," Campbell, Third Point battle heats up, no concessions on the table CHICAGO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb and Campbell Soup Co CPB.N hardened their positions in the battle over the soup maker's future on Thursday as the hedge fund manager tried to woo retail shareholders and the company's interim chief executive told Reuters that Loeb had left no room for compromise. Campbell has been embroiled in a proxy fight since early September with Loeb’s Third Point LLC, which wants to replace the entire board of the 149-year-old company, accusing it of mismanagement and destroying shareholder value. Keith McLoughlin, interim chief executive of the company, which has flatly rejected Third Point’s arguments, told Reuters on Thursday that Third Point seemed uninterested in compromise. “Right now, I don’t know exactly what we would talk about with Third Point if their position is either sell the entire company or replace the entire board,” McLoughlin said in his first interview since Campbell announced a strategic review at the end of August. “Those are two kind of dramatic actions; I’m not sure how to talk about that,” said McLoughlin, a board member who took over after longtime CEO Denise Morrison stepped down abruptly in May. Third Point did not immediately respond to a request for comment after McLoughlin’s interview. McLoughlin said he had not spoken with the New York-based hedge fund since Loeb unveiled plans to unseat the company’s 12-person board in September. “We’re interested in engaging with all shareholders,” McLoughlin said, adding that he had not heard from Loeb since Aug. 30. That is unusual, given that even in the bitterest proxy contests, there are often conversations between the activist and the target company. Third Point, which had initially pushed for a sale or breakup of the company, owns about a 7 percent stake. Heirs of the Dorrance family, who have controlled the company for decades, sit on the board and some said on Wednesday that they will vote their 41 percent stake for the current board. George Strawbridge Jr., another heir who owns a 2.7 percent stake, is siding with Loeb. Retail investors, who own between 10 percent and 15 percent of shares, could be the deciding factor. Third Point released a video on Thursday specifically aimed at persuading retail investors to back the $18 billion hedge fund at the Nov. 29 annual meeting. The four-minute long video presents many of the arguments Third Point has made in mailings and on its website, set to a version of the familiar Campbell Soup jingle. (bit.ly/EmptyTheCan2018) Third Point says in the video that fixing the company will take more than just adding some salt or gluten-free noodles. It calls for changing the board - ""all of them"" - and says current directors have destroyed shareholder value. It said one dollar invested in Campbell 20 years ago would be worth $1.19 now while a dollar invested in the S&P 500 index .SPX would be worth $4.06. Campbell, whose stock has lost about a third in value over the past two years, said in a separate statement that it has taken “swift action” and changed senior management, launched a now-completed strategic review and laid out a plan to spin off some businesses and cut costs. “We are focused on the core issues at hand,” the company said, adding that Third Point’s video lays out no plan and that the hedge fund is “attempting to mislead Campbell shareholders.”"

-2.2018481853174365," Third Point video urges retail investors to replace Campbell Soup board BOSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb turned up the heat on Campbell Soup Co on Thursday with a video aimed at persuading retail investors to vote with his hedge fund Third Point LLC to replace the food company’s entire board of directors. The 3-minute, 57-second video makes many of the same points that Third Point has made in mailings and on its web site. But it uses the familiar Campbell Soup jingle and tailors its arguments to reach retail investors, often neglected in activist shareholder campaigns that mostly target pension funds and other institutional shareholders. (bit.ly/EmptyTheCan2018) Retail investors make up between 10 percent and 15 percent of Campbell Soup’s shareholder base and Loeb needs to persuade them if he is to win the hotly contested proxy fight. Third Point owns roughly 7 percent of Campbell shares and heirs of the company’s founder who support the current board own 41 percent. Analysts have said every vote counts, making it important for Loeb to reach retail investors. The video starts with Campbell’s signature jingle “Mmm Mmm good” but then turns to “Mmm Mmm Bad” and chastises the board for the company’s sluggish stock price and former Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison’s $60 million pay package. It argues that the board made bad business deals and failed to hold top leaders accountable. On Wednesday, several heirs of the family that has controlled Campbell Soup for decades and who hold about 41 percent of the company’s stock said they support the current board. They did not give an explicit reason for their support on the statement the company put out on Wednesday. Still, their stance could make it tough for Loeb to gain enough investor votes at the Nov. 29 annual meeting to unseat all 12 directors. George Strawbridge Jr., another family heir who owns a 2.7 percent stake, is siding with Third Point. In the video, Third Point said fixing the company takes more than just adding some salt or gluten free noodles to the recipe. It calls for changing the board, “all of them,” and says current directors destroyed shareholder value. It cited a statistic that one dollar invested in Campbell’s 20 years ago would be worth $1.19 now while a dollar invested in the S&P 500 index would be worth $4.06.

-0.452611945493516," Campbell heirs to vote for own board, Third Point calls move a 'stunt' CHICAGO (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N said on Wednesday that four key shareholders, all descendants of the company's former chairman John Dorrance, have formally aligned themselves against hedge fund Third Point LLC's plans to oust the embattled soupmaker's entire board. Third Point, which owns 7 percent of Campbell’s stock, fired back hours later, accusing the heirs of trying to frighten smaller shareholders by suggesting that the outcome of a vote next month has been decided before it even takes place. Campbell said Bennett Dorrance, Mary Alice Malone, Archbold van Beuren, Charlotte Weber and some other family members - who own a combined 41 percent stake in the company - plan to vote in favor of its existing board at a shareholder’s meeting on Nov. 29. This suggests it could be very difficult for Third Point, run by billionaire activist investor Daniel Loeb, to win board seats. “This group of billionaire heirs and heiresses are attempting to intimidate smaller shareholders by flaunting their inherited voting bloc as an impenetrable moat,” Third Point said in a statement. Given that Dorrance, Malone and van Beuren serve on Campbell’s board, it was widely expected that they would clash with Loeb’s campaign, which alleges that the company has been mismanaged for years. Shares in Campbell were down 3.9 percent in morning trading. Third Point said the drop suggested shareholders were unhappy with these heirs’ decision to back the current board. The $18 billion hedge fund proposes replacing all directors with a 12 person-slate that includes George Strawbridge, another descendant of John Dorrance, who invented condensed soup and ran Campbell nearly a century ago. Former Hostess Brands CEO William Toler and Third Point partner Munib Islam as well as marketing experts have also been nominated. Each side is now fighting for shareholders’ votes. Campbell has said it does not endorse any of Third Point’s nominees and is urging investors to re-elect its entire board, while Loeb is blaming the board for the stock’s underperformance and is urging investors to back him. The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies."

Campbell reiterated last week that it is searching for a full-time replacement for former Chief Executive Denise Morrison, who left abruptly in May, and said on Wednesday that it expects to complete its search by year end. Third Point said in a letter sent to Campbell’s board seen by Reuters that it is not appropriate to search for a new chief executive during a proxy contest when shareholders will be asked to vote on a new board at the meeting on Nov. 29. “We think it is entirely uncontroversial to insist that the next permanent CEO be selected by the newly elected Board,” Third Point wrote. Third Point asked Campbell to defer any decision about a new CEO until after the upcoming annual meeting. Campbell responded by saying that it will pick its next chief when it finds the best candidate. “It has always been the board’s intention to select the company’s next CEO upon finding the best candidate, which we expect to do by the end of the calendar year,” the company said in a statement. Search firms have helped the company review candidates for months. CNBC first reported that Third Point wrote to the board. The New York-based hedge fund is stepping up pressure on Campbell as it tries to line up support from other shareholders for its slate of 12 directors. Third Point, which owns nearly 7 percent of the company, has criticized the board for making poor decisions that pushed the stock price lower over years. Campbell’s stock traded at $32.22 on Wednesday, off 17.56 percent since the start of the year. Campbell has said its board, including several heirs of the man who ran the company a century ago, is best placed to pursue the best strategies for the company and shareholders. Reuters reported last month that Campbell is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender. With the annual meeting approaching, Third Point said Campbell would have a tough time recruiting top external candidates who might not serve a long time if new members join the board. Third Point has previously criticized the company for failing to have a plan in place for when a CEO leaves."
-6.764885221383931," Third Point tells Campbell Soup not to hire new CEO before meeting NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Third Point LLC warned Campbell Soup Co.’s board on Wednesday against picking a new chief executive before next month’s annual meeting, where the hedge fund wants to oust all current directors.

-10.869652870497138," Exclusive: Third Point demands Campbell Soup board records (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC has demanded access to a trove of records from Campbell Soup Co, ranging from board meeting minutes to financial documents, as it ratchets up a campaign to replace the company’s board of directors, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Third Point’s move offers an example of the legal tools shareholder activists are increasingly using to boost their chances of winning proxy contests against corporate boards. Such maneuvering could prove crucial in this case, given Third Point, which owns 5.65 percent of the canned soup maker, faces challenges in wooing some key shareholders. Descendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined 42 percent stake in the company, representing a major hurdle. Third Point gave the U.S. company five days to provide it access to several, typically confidential, documents, pertaining to its recently completed strategic review, its mergers and acquisitions activity, and succession planning for its chief executive, according to Third Point’s “demand letter,” dated and delivered to Campbell Soup on Wednesday. In the letter, the hedge fund cites a New Jersey statute that gives shareholders the right to review company documents, provided they demonstrate a “proper purpose” for looking at the records. This sets the stage for a legal battle with Campbell Soup, should it refuse access to the records. Campbell Soup, based in Camden, New Jersey, did not respond to a request for comment on how it would respond to Third Point’s demands. In a press release it published on Thursday to urge shareholders to back its board, the company said that it “strongly objects to Third Point’s aggressive and short-sighted tactics”. Third Point declined to comment. Campbell Soup shares were up 1.2 percent at $36.94 in early morning trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $11.1 billion. Last month, Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees to replace all twelve of Campbell’s directors, alleging the company has been mismanaged for years. The company’s share price is now 30 percent lower than it was 20 years ago, Loeb said, adding that executives failed to explore all strategic options, including the sale of the company. Campbell has disputed this, arguing that its recently concluded strategic review considered every possibility. The company has said it currently plans to sell only its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, as it focuses on improving its operational performance. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Jeff Dunn, the former president of Campbell’s fresh food unit, is leading a consortium of investors that is in talks to buy that division for between $500 million and $700 million. Third Point said it needs to see Campbell documents to determine whether board directors or employees violated their fiduciary duty. In its letter, Third Point seized on comments made last month by Campbell’s interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin. McLoughlin, who took over when CEO Denise Morrison exited abruptly in May, had said the firm relied too much on acquisitions and lacked a culture of accountability, that led to poor execution. “These admissions demonstrate that shareholders are entitled to the records of the company’s decision-making processes to investigate this unquestionable mismanagement and further instances of wrongdoing,” according to Third Point’s letter. Among the things Loeb wants to find out is how the company went from saying that its $6 billion acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance would be accretive to earnings only to reverse itself and say it would be modestly dilutive to earnings. “It is unfathomable that Campbell management could improperly represent to shareholders that the largest acquisition in the company’s history would be accretive and just five months later admit that they blew it,” the letter said. Third Point is also asking for details about what the board planned to do after Morrison stepped down, including hiring a headhunter and any information on potential CEO candidates. “Given Ms. Morrison’s disastrous performance, the board should have been acutely focused on trying to identify a qualified replacement well before her separation,” the letter said. Campbell, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies. It is not clear if any company would buy Campbell in its entirety. Kraft Heinz Co has considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, sources have told Reuters, but there is no sign of any recent approach from the company. Third Point’s records request also covers any information related to board director Bennett Dorrance, who has held his seat since 1989 and was granted a waiver to stay after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 72. Third Point is interested in finding out why Dorrance, a grandson of former company chief John Dorrance, has not moved more quickly to reduce the loans he took for which he pledged roughly $500 million of his Campbell shares as collateral. Pledging or loaning out shares creates questions about whether the shares can be voted and if “directors’ interests are truly aligned with those of shareholders,” the letter said. Campbell said on Thursday it will hold its annual shareholder meeting, where investors will vote on the board directors, on Nov. 29. It is not clear whether any legal dispute over Third Point’s demand for company documents would be resolved by then. Investors who hold Campbell shares as of Oct. 9 will be eligible to vote at the shareholder meeting, the company said."
-10.395874561150158," Loeb calls Campbell attractive takeover target, ratchets up pressure BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, who is seeking to replace the entire board at Campbell Soup Co CPB.N, on Monday called the company an ""iconic asset"" and attractive takeover target that could fetch as much as $58 per share. The hedge fund manager whose Third Point LP owns roughly 6 percent of Campbell also urged the company to consider selling non-core brands like Pop Secret and Pepperidge Farm Frozen Cakes, according to a new presentation. Campbell launched a strategic review after its chief executive Denise Morrison left in May and said in August that it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units. It left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale. Loeb is now stepping up the pressure on Campbell and is taking his case for change directly to investors who will be asked to vote on board members in the coming weeks. Descendants of John Dorrance, who ran Campbell a decade ago, are split in their loyalties with some serving on Campbell’s current board and one siding with Loeb and asking investors to elect him as well as 11 others on Loeb’s slate. On Monday, Campbell again said that its plan is the best path forward. “Management is focused on implementing the plan and setting the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond,” Campbell said in a statement, adding “the Board remains committed to evaluating all strategic options to enhance value in the future.” Campbell has been losing market share and management has been distracted with bad deals and missing key trends in the its core soup business, Loeb said. He also said the company has been without at permanent chief executive at a critical time and blamed the board for having “overseen a series of strategic and operational blunders over many years that have driven extreme underperformance in Campbell shares.” When Loeb first unveiled his ownership stake in August, he called for a sale of the company. He recently appeared to have backed away from that stance, but on Monday he laid out the case for a full sale. He also urged more divestments on top of what the company has already pledged. In the presentation, Loeb said the company could “attract multiple buyers and could fetch 14-15x EBITDA, implying $52 to $58 per share.” That would mark a 58 percent premium over Friday’s closing share price. “The dismal stock performance is a report card on the Company’s leadership, which has made a series of blunders,” Loeb wrote in a letter that was released at the same time as the presentation. “We believe the past year has been particularly disastrous.” One dollar invested in Campbell, 10 years ago is worth $1.34 today, Loeb wrote noting that a dollar invested in rival Hormel! at the same time would now be worth $16.37."

Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, launched a proxy fight last week to replace Campbell’s 12-member board. Loeb’s $18 billion hedge fund, which owns a 5.65 percent stake, said at the time that the soup-maker was in a “mess” and faulted its board for failing to take corrective action. His move came a week after Campbell announced the results of a broad strategic review and said it would sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units. Third Point’s 12-person slate includes William Toler, former chief executive of Hostess Brands, Munib Islam, a partner at Third Point, and George Strawbridge, a grandchild of chemist John Dorrance who invented condensed soup and ran Campbell nearly a century ago. Campbell, which is pushing for its board to remain intact, said it did not endorse any of Third Point's board nominees.

-2.0900076456800263," Third Point launches proxy fight for full Campbell board (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC is launching a proxy fight to remove the entire sitting board at Campbell Soup Co, charging the American food company with being in a “mess” and faulting the board for failing to take corrective action. Loeb’s $18 billion hedge fund, which owns a 5.65 percent stake, is nominating 12 people, according to a letter sent to Campbell’s board on Friday. The slate includes executives from the hedge fund, a descendant of the inventor of Campbell soup, and experts in marketing, operations, and transactions. Loeb’s move comes one week after Campbell unveiled a strategic review, deciding to sell two businesses. Previously Third Point has said that under the current management team and board, the company should put its entire business up for sale. But its stance has shifted somewhat to suggest that other outcomes might be possible with a new board. Investors had expected Loeb to ask for board seats, but pushing to throw out all sitting directors is a rare step in the industry and especially for Third Point, which usually asks for only a few board seats. Third Point said it took the step because the board failed to “understand the depth of the Company’s crisis” and failed to take “bold action.” Loeb said the board stood by as the company went on an acquisition spree and said $7 billion in value was destroyed since 2016. Campbell’s stock price is now 20 percent lower than it was 20 years ago, Loeb said, criticizing the board for failing to have a CEO succession plan in place. This year the stock price has lost 17 percent. “At this point, it would be simply reckless to leave the Board that caused this mess in charge of fixing it,” Loeb said. Campbell said in a written statement in response to Loeb’s move that the board determined the best way forward is “to optimize the company’s portfolio, divest certain businesses and pay down debt.” It also said it was open to evaluating all strategic options in the future. As Third Point seeks to remake the board, it has allied itself with George Strawbridge, a grandchild of chemist John Dorrance who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago. Strawbridge previously sat on the Campbell’s board and may now be called on to convince the family, which jointly owns roughly 41 percent of the shares, that updating is needed at the company. The Third Point slate also includes William Toler, former chief executive of Hostess Brands, and Munib Islam, a partner at Third Point. And it includes three women: lawyer Franci Blassberg, marketing executive Sarah Hofstetter and Bozoma Saint John, who had been chief brand officer at Uber. However, Loeb could face an uphill struggle for control of Campbell Soup, given the large stake owned by Dorrance descendants and the fact two grandchildren and a great grandchild currently sit on the board. Third Point last ran a proxy contest four years ago and reached a settlement for three seats on the board of auction house Sotheby’s. Unseating an entire board is rare but it was accomplished when hedge fund Starboard Value replaced all directors at Darden Restaurants in 2014. Third Point has hired Okapi Partners as its proxy solicitor, which also worked for Starboard on Darden."
-6.061479440296032," Exclusive: Campbell Soup steps up CEO search, COO a contender - sources (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co's CPB.N board is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender, as the company seeks to fend off a proxy challenge from Daniel Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said. Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell’s 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale and criticizing its lack of a succession plan after Chief Executive Denise Morrison left in May. Morrison’s departure came after several years of weak corporate earnings. Campbell board member Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison’s departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis. That has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month. Despite Morrison’s exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources. Mignini, 55, joined Campbell five years ago and was promoted in April to be its COO, putting the Italian-educated executive in charge of the U.S. company’s snack and meal businesses, in addition to U.S. sales and global development. Morrison also held the COO position before she took the top job in 2011. Investors who met with McLoughlin and Campbell Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro in recent days told Reuters that Mignini joined the meetings, in a sign the company was seeking to raise his profile. Mignini did not usually attend such meetings in the past, the investors said. CNBC reported in May, at the time of Morrison’s departure, that Mignini was a likely candidate for the CEO seat. The board is also preparing to interview candidates from outside the company, although nobody external has been contacted yet, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangements. Campbell’s board, which includes three heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago, will review a list of external candidates at its next meeting at the end of September, the source added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on whether Mignini was the top internal candidate and said the board had been working with executive-search firms to assess both internal and external candidates. Third Point declined to comment. Campbell Soup shares were up 0.5 percent at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion. Third Point’s board challenge could complicate the CEO selection process, given that shareholders could choose to replace board members who will be making that decision, in a vote that could be scheduled as early as November. The turmoil could discourage some of the consumer industry’s top executives from applying, the sources said. Third Point faces an uphill struggle in any battle for control of Campbell Soup, given that descendants of Dorrance own a combined stake of about 42 percent in the company. A board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell, however, to explore a sale with more urgency. Third Point, which manages $18 billion in assets, has played a role in bringing new CEOs to several companies, including Jose Almeida to Baxter International Inc BAX.N, Tad Smith to Sotheby's BID.N, and Marissa Mayer to Yahoo. One external CEO candidate Campbell Soup's board is expected to consider is Mark Clouse, chief executive of Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N, who will soon be without a full-time job after his company agreed in June to sell itself to ConAgra Brands Inc CAG.N for $8.1 billion. Clouse, 49, is an industry veteran, having also held senior positions at Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O and Kraft Foods Inc. It is not clear if Clouse would be interested. He could not be reached for comment. Campbell said on Aug. 30 it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale in the future, snubbing a call from Third Point to do so urgently. The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies. Campbell’s latest foray into fresh food has faltered, while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt at the same time as costs increased."

0.29694231586194164," Exclusive: Third Point seeks to tap Campbell Soup board challengers - sources (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC is speaking to consumer industry executives as it seeks to fill a slate of nominees to challenge Campbell Soup Co’s board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter. Third Point, which holds a 5.65 percent stake and has been pushing for a sale of Campbell Soup, is not convinced the company has adequately explored that option, the sources said. On Thursday, Campbell Soup said it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale down the line, as it focuses on improving its operational performance. Food industry veteran Douglas Conant, who was chief executive officer of Campbell Soup for a decade until 2011, and William Perez, a former CEO at Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company who also previously served on Campbell Soup’s board, are among the people Loeb is holding discussions with, the sources said. Third Point is hoping it can replace the entirety of Campbell Soup’s 12-member board, the sources said. The hedge fund is expected to finalize its slate in the next two weeks, before a mid-September deadline for board director nominations, according to the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Third Point declined to comment, while Conant and Perez could not be immediately reached for comment. The company said it does not comment on rumors or speculation and said it considered all options in its now-completed strategic review. “The Board remains open and committed to evaluating all strategic options to enhance value in the future,” the company said in a statement. Campbell Soup shares rose as much as 1.7 percent on Friday and were up 0.7 percent at $39.42 in afternoon trade, giving the company a market value of $11.9 billion. “We believe investors are pinning their hopes on Third Point taking a more aggressive activist campaign against the company and the board,” Stifel analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday. “Investors should brace for a likely proxy campaign against the board.” Loeb, who runs the $18 billion Third Point hedge fund, has not commented publicly on his next move after announcing in early August that he views a sale of the 149-year-old maker of soups and snacks as “the only justifiable outcome” of the review. He faces an uphill struggle in any battle for control of Campbell Soup, given that descendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined stake of about 42 percent in the company. However, a board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell Soup to explore a sale more actively. Loeb could also nominate George Strawbridge, a Dorrance grandchild who is now working with Loeb and is calling for a sale, as a director, according to the sources. Strawbridge could not be reached for comment. Two other Dorrance grandchildren, Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance, as well as great-grandson Archbold van Beuren, currently sit on Campbell Soup’s board. Other directors, including Randall Larrimore and Les Vinney, have served since the early 2000s. “Loeb will want fresh perspectives from people he can trust,” said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, which often advises companies being targeted by activists. It is not clear who could buy Campbell Soup at this stage. Kraft Heinz Co has considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, sources have told Reuters, but there is no sign that the company has made a new approach. Once known as one of Wall Street’s toughest rabble rousers who relished writing humiliating letters to chief executives, Loeb has recently toned down the rhetoric, maturing into a more disciplined investor, say investors who know him. The last time Loeb ran a proxy contest to challenge a board was at Sotheby’s, the art auction house. He settled for three Sotheby’s board seats four years ago, joining the Sotheby’s board himself. To stay relevant and continue putting up top performance numbers in his fund - he has delivered an average annual return of 18.3 percent - Loeb has tried new approaches and branching out his business, investors said. Campbell Soup, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.

1.0654944593551046," Campbell to sell fresh, international units, complete sale an option NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co CPB.N said on Thursday it plans to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units and left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale, following a months-long review and pressure from a hedge fund to sell itself outright. It is not clear if the plan will appease activist investor Dan Loeb, whose Third Point LLC announced a 5.65 percent stake on Aug. 9 and immediately pressed for a sale of the entire company to a competitor as “the only justifiable outcome.” If dissatisfied, Loeb could escalate his attack into a proxy fight and nominate a slate of directors within the next few weeks to be voted on at Campbell’s annual meeting later this year, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. Third Point declined comment on Thursday. Campbell’s Interim Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin said the board considered the option of a complete sale during its review and ended the process “with a completely open mind.” Selling the two smaller units could make Campbell a more attractive takeover target by turning its focus back to its core soup and salty snacks businesses. “The board concluded that this current plan right now is the best one to maximize value,” McLoughlin told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. “Having said that, the board remains open to alternatives that could create more value for the shareholder.” Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC his Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N would not buy the company and said it is ""very hard to offer a significant premium for a packaged goods company."" On a conference call with analysts McLoughlin sidestepped questions about investor pressure for a sale and declined to comment on whether any activists, such as Loeb’s Third Point, would be given board seats. Shares of Campbell, which has a market value of about $12 billion, fell 2.6 percent to $38.95 shortly after midday. Alongside the results of its review, Campbell also forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2019 below Wall Street’s average estimate, as its costs continue to rise. The 149-year-old company which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies. Campbell’s latest foray into fresh food has faltered while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt while costs are increasing. Its shares have fallen by a third over the past two years. The company said on Thursday it would use the proceeds of the unit sales to reduce its debt and also increased its cost savings target by $150 million to $945 million by the end of fiscal 2022. Retreating from the international and fresh-food businesses marks a reverse from the strategy of former Chief Executive Denise Morrison, who wanted Campbell to have a wide-ranging portfolio with a focus on health and well-being. Morrison stepped down abruptly in May after a string of poor results. On the same day, the company announced its sweeping review and named McLoughlin as interim CEO. “Simply put, we lost focus,” said McLoughlin on Thursday. “We aggressively pursued the important consumer mega-trend of health and well-being without having clarity on our source of uniqueness ... and we depended too much on M&A, to shape our business strategy,” he said. Campbell is still looking for a new permanent CEO. McLoughlin said on Thursday he was not a candidate to take the job. The company also said it was rescheduling its annual investor day from October to spring next year. The two businesses put up for sale currently bring in about $2.1 billion in annual sales, about a quarter of Campbell’s overall revenue. Campbell International includes Australian biscuits brand Arnott’s and the Kelsen Group, along with the company’s manufacturing operations in Indonesia and Malaysia and its businesses in Hong Kong and Japan. Campbell Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and the company’s refrigerated soup business. The company has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Centerview Partners to sell the units. Under Morrison, Campbell arranged its products into three parts in 2015, setting up the new Campbell Fresh business. The unit was meant to tap into consumers’ booming appetite for healthier foods but the business struggled, resulting in a two-year decline in organic sales. Historically, the company has resisted big changes, being effectively controlled by the heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and went on to run the company a century ago. Dorrance’s grandchildren Mary Alice Malone, who raises horses in Pennsylvania, and her brother Bennett Dorrance, a real estate developer in Arizona, between them control 33 percent of Campbell’s shares. They have fended off periodic calls over three decades for the company to sell itself. In the past, the family has been able to rely on supportive, long-term shareholders. But in the past few months - most notably in the second quarter of 2018, when the company announced its review - a number of hedge fund investors have bought positions and are looking for more sweeping measures, including a sale. For fiscal 2019, Campbell forecast earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.53 for fiscal 2019, not including the effect of the planned unit sales, below Wall Street’s average estimate of $2.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 25 cents, just ahead of the Wall Street’s average estimate of 24 cents."

The Camden, New Jersey-based company has been struggling with falling profit as younger consumers drift away from Campbell’s namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies. Its share price is down by a third over the past two years. Wall Street has questioned the success of its acquisitions of juice and smoothie maker Bolthouse Farms and salty snack maker Snyder’s-Lance. Chief Executive Denise Morrison, who headed Campbell for seven years, left as the company announced poor quarterly results on May 18. On that day, the company said it would conduct a review of all its business plans and portfolio of brands to find ways to improve its financial performance. “Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows,” Interim CEO Keith McLoughlin told investors at the time. The result of the review will be announced on Thursday. Historically, the company has resisted bigger changes, being effectively controlled by the heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and went on to run the company a century ago. Dorrance’s grandchildren Mary Alice Malone, who raises horses in Pennsylvania, and her brother Bennett Dorrance, a real estate developer in Arizona, have fended off periodic calls over three decades for the company to sell itself, and have shown no sign of changing their minds this year. Malone and Dorrance, who between them control 33 percent of Campbell’s shares, could not be reached for comment. Archbold van Beuren, John Dorrance’s great-grandson who is Campbell’s third-biggest holder with 8.6 percent of its shares, also could not be reached for comment. In the past, the family has been able to rely on supportive, long-term shareholders. But in the past few months - most notably in the second quarter of 2018, when the company announced its wide-ranging review - a number of hedge fund investors have bought positions and are looking for more sweeping measures, including a sale. “Everyone’s dream is for the company to give up looking for a permanent CEO and put the company up for sale,” said one investor not permitted to speak publicly. If that does not happen, the investor said the best course would be for the company to sell Bolthouse Farms, name a new CEO, and talk with Loeb “about putting two or three new people on the board.” Steven Schonfeld’s Schonfeld Group Holdings and Jamie Zimmerman’s Litespeed Management made big new purchases of Campbell Soup shares during the second quarter, filings show. Och-Ziff, now known as OZ Management, and Hudson Bay Capital Management also bought shares. The hedge funds declined to comment. “There has clearly been a lot of crowding into Campbell stock by event-driven investors” seeking to make money off share price moves around corporate events like a sale, said Simnan Abbas, a managing director at investment data firm Symmetric.io. That crowding “does not happen all the time and has changed the makeup of the shareholder base pretty significantly.” Campbell’s new hedge fund investors are likely allies for Loeb, who in August joined forces with another of Dorrance’s grandchildren, George Strawbridge Jr., in calling for a sale. Loeb’s $18 billion fund is now Campbell’s fifth-largest investor. It and Strawbridge between them hold 8.4 percent of Campbell’s shares. Despite the increased pressure for change, Campbell’s board shows little sign of shifting course dramatically. It recently turned away at least one company that approached it about buying parts of its portfolio, a person familiar with the matter said. It has, however, weighed selling off brands including its Arnott’s Australian cookie business, another person familiar with the matter said. As hedge fund investors move in, longstanding shareholders such as trust company Bessemer Trust and mutual fund company Fidelity Investments have pared back their holdings, according to filings. Neither company would say why they cut their stakes. That means Malone and Dorrance could face more demanding and outspoken investors at this year’s annual meeting, if not an outright proxy fight. “This company has really slowed down since 2016 and I don’t see a major way for them to innovate quickly,” said investor David Dreman whose Dreman Value Management bought shares several years ago. “How can a company with a diversified product line in a low-growth industry turn itself around quickly?”"
1.0654944593551046," Breakingviews - Campbell lukewarm sale pitch is begging for a cook DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Campbell Soup’s lukewarm sales pitch is begging for a real cook. The $12 billion canned food and snack company is trying to sell its fresh and international brands while stepping up cost cuts on its stagnant core business. It is leaving the door open for a sale, but that’s unlikely to appease activists like Third Point’s Dan Loeb. The New Jersey-based prepared foods outfit has had a difficult run. Chief Executive Denise Morrison quit abruptly in May after leading a string of questionable acquisitions, and the company launched a strategic review under an interim CEO. Meanwhile its main businesses are suffering. The company on Thursday reported that sales in the division holding Campbell’s Soup and V8 juice declined 1 percent year-over-year in the quarter ended July 29. It also tempered expectations for the coming year. To help appease investors, the company plans to offload businesses like Kelsen cookies in China and Bolthouse Farms beverages and carrots. Morrison saw them as vehicles for reviving growth but the company hasn’t been able to integrate them well. A sharper focus on core operations should drum up an additional $150 million in annual savings by the end of 2022. Yet Campbell is proceeding without a long-term head chef in the corporate kitchen. The company is conducting a CEO search and interim chief Keith McLoughlin told analysts he is not a candidate. Loeb, who has agitated for a sale of the company, has other hedge funds he could bring on his side for a possible proxy battle, including Schonfeld, Litespeed Management, and Och-Ziff Management. The board is exposed. Some members, including three family insiders that together control roughly 40 percent of shares, approved some of the acquisitions the company is now unwinding. Drumming up a bidder won’t be easy. Kraft Heinz is the most logical buyer, but on Thursday Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is the largest Kraft shareholder, told CNBC that it would be “very hard” for anyone to justify paying a significant premium. Still, a full auction process should flush out bidders and allow shareholders to decide if they want to sell their stock in the face of turmoil. Campbell’s current stale recipe makes that look like the best option."

Campbell’s stock fell 11 percent in morning trading, hitting a more than five-year low and putting it on track for its worst one-day decline since 1999. Shares of B&G Foods, General Mills and Kraft Heinz also slipped after Campbell said it anticipates higher import tariffs and freight costs to weigh on profit margins until its fiscal year 2019 ends in August next year. Morrison, 64, departs the company after seven years at the helm. Campbell provided no reason for her departure, but said board member Keith McLoughlin, 61, would replace her in the interim immediately. The company also said it would conduct a thorough, critical review of all its business plans and portfolio composition over several months to improve its financial performance. “Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows,” McLoughlin said on a conference call with analysts. Packaged food companies like Campbell have been pressured as consumers increasingly move away from processed food toward healthier options. These shifting consumer tastes are partly to blame for four straight years of declines at Campbell’s U.S. soup business, a period during which Morrison was in command. Other parts of the business such as juices and its Campbell Fresh division have also struggled, resulting in a two-year decline in organic sales. “This news comes as a surprise. Morrison has faced some missteps as CEO (declining soup sales and Campbell-Fresh execution issues) and the sudden departure likely reflects ongoing execution issues,” Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said he expects the Campbell Fresh unit, which sells baby carrots and high-end juices, to be a top-priority candidate for review. The unit had sales of $251 million in the third quarter ended April 29. On Friday, Campbell Soup posted a loss of $393 million or $1.31 per share for the third quarter, compared with a profit a year ago, mainly due to a $619 million charge related to Campbell Fresh. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 70 cents per share, 10 cents above analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 15 percent to $2.13 billion. Campbell said the acquisition of snacks maker Snyder’s-Lance, a deal it closed just eight weeks ago, would reduce adjusted earnings in fiscal year 2019. The company expects earnings per share to fall between 5 percent and 6 percent, compared with its earlier forecast for a rise of 2 percent to 4 percent. The prior forecast did not include the impact from Snyder’s-Lance. (Reporting by Nivedita Balu and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel, Bernard Orr)"

-6.965495545123032," Loeb's Third Point calls for Campbell Soup sale: filing (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb and fellow Campbell Soup Co CPB.N shareholder George Strawbridge on Thursday called for a sale of the iconic U.S. food company best known for its canned soups, according to a regulatory filing. The joint effort, first reported by Reuters earlier on Thursday, could prove difficult as descendants of former Campbells Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined stake of about 41 percent in the company. Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund and Strawbridge together own a 8.42 percent stake in the 150-year-old company, with Third Point holding 5.65 percent, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Third Point said it believed a strategic review underway at Campbell would create “significant value” for shareholders if conducted properly. Third Point also said it may seek board seats if it feels that Campbell’s directors have failed to do their job appropriately. Campbell said its board “remains dedicated to delivering a go-forward strategy that will drive value for all shareholders,” and that it would make its plans public later this month. Campbell shares rose as much as 4 percent on the news that Loeb, whose fund occasionally pushes management of its portfolio companies to perform better, is involved. The stock closed up 0.7 percent at $42.28. Since January, it has dropped 12.7 percent. The 56-year-old investor bought his stake in Campbell after Chief Executive Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down in May. She left after the company gave a bleak forecast for the year and said it would embark on a review of its many brands. Rival activist shareholder Carl Icahn also considered an investment in Campbell, but decided against it because the family dynamics would make it tough to press for big changes, according to a source familiar with the matter. Icahn’s office declined to comment. Campbell’s annual meeting was held early last November, which means that Third Point would have a relatively short period of time to nominate potential directors if Loeb plans to mount a board challenge later this year. Loeb's $18 billion hedge fund has a history of making investments in food companies, including most recently Nestle SA NESN.S, where it has been pressing management to spin off some units and streamline the portfolio. Campbell in 2015 reorganized into three divisions, creating the Campbell Fresh unit after combining what was a packaged fresh division with soups sold to supermarket delis. But Campbell Fresh struggled, resulting in a two-year decline in organic sales. Analysts have said that the most logical path for the company may be to separate its profitable but debt-laden snack business from its slower-growing soup business. While Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, it is not currently exploring a bid, according to a source familiar with the matter. Kraft Heinz did not respond to a request for comment."

Morrison, 64, departs the company after seven years at the helm. Campbell provided no reason for her departure. It named board member Keith McLoughlin, 61, a former CEO of vacuum maker Electrolux, as interim CEO. Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said the company would conduct a critical review of its portfolio over several months. “Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows,” he said on a conference call with analysts. Campbell expects to discuss the review outcome when it reports fourth-quarter results in late August, DiSilvestro said in a statement. The company has not yet retained financial advisers to assist with the review, according to a person familiar with the matter. JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said Campbell Fresh, which sells baby carrots and high-end juices, could be a top priority. The unit had sales of $251 million in the third quarter. “We are all disappointed with the results of C-Fresh, and we acknowledge that they are unacceptable,” DiSilvestro said. Early last month the company announced the Campbell Fresh business would be put within a new accelerator unit focused on driving long-term growth, and headed by Ana Dominguez. Dominguez, who was previously president of Campbell Canada, is expected to continue in the new position, the person familiar with the matter said. In April, the company also elevated Luca Mignini, the head of the unit that makes Goldfish Crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies, to chief operating officer, underscoring its shifting emphasis from soups to snacks - and potentially putting him in line for the top job. DiSilvestro blamed tariffs as contributing to Campbell’s rising costs. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum to help the domestic steel industry on March 20. [nL1N1S80QP] “The issue is primarily one of cost inflation and we’re seeing and expecting an acceleration on the rate of inflation across a number of ingredient and packaging items,” DiSilvestro said. “For example, we expect double-digit increases on steel and aluminum. A lot of that is driven or all of it’s driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs.” Excluding one-time items, the company earned 70 cents per share, 10 cents above analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
