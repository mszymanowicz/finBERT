6.563710073710081," Chief executive of Japan's Honda to step down, hand reins to R&D chief TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s second-biggest automaker by sales, Honda Motor Co, said on Friday its chief executive, Takahiro Hachigo, would step down and be replaced by Toshihiro Mibe, its head of research and development, on April 1. Mibe, 59, who has worked with Hachigo to push through structural reforms, has been president of the R&D unit since 2019, following stints in engine development and the drive-train business after joining the company in 1987. “We would consider using external insight or potential alliances among other actions to make decisions without hesitation,” Mibe told a news conference at which he called for Honda’s “major transformation at great speed”. His appointment, first reported by Reuters this week, comes as Honda races to catch up in the field of all-electric cars and faces competition from new entrants and tech giants such as Tesla, Apple and Amazon. “He has been looking into the future, a direction that Honda should be taking,” Hachigo told the conference, attributing Mibe’s expertise in environmental technology and energy and his attentiveness to changes as reasons for the choice. Hachigo will remain on the company board, Honda said in a statement. Traditionally known for its fuel-efficient internal-combustion engines, Honda launched its first mass-produced all-battery vehicle last August. It has said it wants new-energy vehicles such as plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars to contribute two-thirds of sales by 2030. But analysts say Honda has a lot of catching up to do with competitors, in the arena of elecrification. “With the CEO change to Mr. Mibe, someone who is bright on electrification technology and has dealt in negotiations with global automakers, I think it is a good opportunity for Honda to accelerate electrification,” said industry analyst Takaki Nakanishi, chief executive of the Nakanishi Research Institute. During his six years as chief executive, Hachigo sought to simplify the vehicle development process by combining some operations for cars and motorcycles. He also slashed costs by streamlining Honda’s model line-up and consolidating factories at home and overseas. Hachigo also expanded a partnership with General Motors Co to include cooperation in developing electric and autonomous vehicles. To focus on zero-emission technology, Honda has said it will stop participating as an engine supplier in the FIA Formula One World Championship at the end of the 2021 season."

6.306616504995945," Japan's Toyota, Honda can likely cope with global chip shortage: Fitch (Reuters) - The global semiconductor chip shortage is not likely to significantly affect the financial profiles of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp or Honda Motor Co, ratings agency Fitch said in a statement on Wednesday. The automakers have enough financial flexibility to absorb more costs and maintain significant rating headroom, even if the shortage persists till the second half of 2021, according to the statement. The automobile industry has been grappling with a shortfall in chip supply since the end of last year, driven by coronavirus lockdowns in Southeast Asia and bulk-buying by U.S. sanctions-hit Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, among other reasons. The shortage prompted top U.S. automaker General Motor Co to extend production cuts at three North American plants last week, while Honda Motor and Nissan Motor were set to sell a combined 250,000 fewer cars in the current financial year. Meanwhile, Toyota shrugged off the issue in its quarterly report last week and said it has up to a four-month stockpile of chips, with no immediate hit to production expected. “We believe the shortage should ease or even be resolved in the second half of 2021 as suppliers boost production for automotive clients,” Fitch said. Top economic and national security officials in the White House have launched a new effort to help the U.S. auto industry fight the chip shortage, a White House official said on Thursday. The issue could impact nearly 1 million units of global light vehicle production in the first quarter, according to data firm IHS Markit."

4.382332643202207," UPDATE 1-Motor racing-Red Bull to use Honda-based F1 engines from 2022 * Red Bull to take on Honda-designed engines from 2022 * Energy drink company to form own powertrain company * Deal will run until 2025 * Honda are leaving F1 at the end of 2021 (Adds quotes, details) LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Red Bull have formed their own powertrain company and will continue to race from 2022 with engines using Honda technology, the Formula One team said on Monday. Honda, who are engine partners to Red Bull Racing and Italy-based sister team AlphaTauri, announced last year they would be leaving the sport as a power unit manufacturer at the end of 2021 to focus on zero-emission technology. Monday’s announcement comes after Formula One teams and manufacturers agreed last week to “freeze” power unit development from the start of 2022. The agreement with Honda covers the duration of the freeze, which will run until the sport introduces the next generation of power units in 2025. “We were understandably disappointed when Honda made the decision to leave the sport as an engine manufacturer...but we are grateful for their support in facilitating this new agreement,” said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner. “Honda has invested significantly in hybrid technology to ensure the supply of competitive power units to both teams.” Red Bull Powertrains Limited will be based at the Red Bull factory in Milton Keynes, England. Both Red Bull-owned teams won races last year and Honda, who have restored their reputation after a dismal previous stint with McLaren, have promised to develop their engines further before they depart. Red Bull are hoping to make a serious title challenge to Mercedes’s long domination of the V6 turbo hybrid era this year with Dutch youngster Max Verstappen and experienced Mexican Sergio Perez. AlphaTauri have Frenchman Pierre Gasly, who won at Monza last year, and Honda-backed Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda in their lineup. The engine freeze was a vital part of the puzzle for the former champions, who had said they would not have been able to afford the costs of continuing to develop the Honda power unit to stay competitive. The alternative would have been Renault, whose engines powered Red Bull to four successive drivers’ and constructors’ championships with Sebastian Vettel from 2010-13 at the end of the V8 era. Red Bull fell out with Renault before switching to Honda engines for 2019 and were reluctant to go back to the French manufacturer, who supply only their own team and would have capacity. The move means Formula One will still have four different engines competing next year -- Mercedes, Ferrari, Renault and Red Bull’s. “The establishment of Red Bull Powertrains Limited is a bold move by Red Bull but it is one we have made after careful and detailed consideration,” said Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko in a statement.

5.600540000018219," Toyota hikes profit forecast 54%, shrugs off global chip supply issues TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it has an up to four-month stockpile of chips and was not immediately expecting a global chip shortage to hit production, as it jacked up its full-year earnings forecast by a bigger-than-expected 54%. Unlike other automakers, including Japanese peers Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Honda Motor Co Ltd, that have had to cut production because of semiconductor shortages, Toyota raised output for the fiscal year ending March. Shares in Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker by vehicle sales, closed up 1.7% after hitting their highest level since July 2015. “For the near term, we do not see any decrease in production volume due to the chip shortage, but we do see risks of a chip shortage,” Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon said during a briefing. Kon said Toyota had heard chip shortages globally might continue until the summer, though the situation might resolve itself earlier. Asked about why the automaker is seeing limited impact compared with competitors, Kon said Toyota has been constantly providing its short-term and long-term production volume plans to suppliers. The automobile industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, which has in some cases been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration’s sanctions on Chinese chip factories. But the maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and Prius hybrid said it expects to sell 9.73 million vehicles this year, up 3.3% from a previous forecast of 9.42 million yet still down from last year’s 10.46 million. “The fact that Toyota isn’t largely affected by the chip shortage now is an encouraging catalyst,” said Hideyuki Suzuki, a general manager of investment research at SBI Securities. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Toyota now expects record operating profit of 2 trillion yen ($19.13 billion), far higher than an earlier projection of 1.3 trillion yen, and well above an average 1.542 trillion yen profit forecast based on estimates from 23 analysts, Refinitiv data showed. The automaker now expects the yen to trade at 105 yen against the U.S. dollar, versus a previous forecast of 106 yen. Toyota said operating profit rose to 987.9 billion yen in the three months ended Dec. 31 versus an average 565.51 billion yen profit from nine analysts surveyed by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

5.600540000018219," Honda and Nissan to sell a quarter of a million fewer cars because of chip shortage TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s second and third largest automakers, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, will sell a combined 250,000 fewer cars in the current financial year as a global shortage in semiconductor chips hits production. The automakers made the announcement as they unveiled brighter outlooks for the financial year ending March 2021 as automobile markets, led by China, rebounded from a coronavirus-induced slump. Honda and Nissan also reported better-than-expected results for the October-December quarter. But Honda cut its sales target by 100,000 vehicles, or 2.2%, on Tuesday to 4.5 million cars, while Nissan lowered its target by 150,000 vehicles, or 3.6%, to 4.015 million units as a chips shortage forced both companies to curb output. “Popular models that sell well were hit hard by semiconductor shortage,” Seiji Kuraishi, Honda’s Chief Operating Officer said during an online press briefing. “We needed to swap around and adjust production plans. But that wasn’t enough,” he added. The global automobile industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, which has in some cases been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration’s sanctions on Chinese chip factories. Asian chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co are expanding production to make up for shortages, but have warned that it may take some time to crank up output. Some companies such as Japan’s Renesas Electronics are also seeking price hikes for semiconductors that control engines, sensors and other automotive systems. Honda’s Kuraishi predicted that the shortage would ease in the first half of 2021. His company last month cut output by about 4,000 units, mainly its Fit and Jazz models, and is also reducing output of five models at five facilities in the United States and Canada. China’s GAC said its joint venture with the automaker had received warnings on supply of certain models. Nissan said it is reducing production of its best-selling Note compact car, featuring new hybrid technology, at its Oppama plant in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. It is also making short-term output adjustments at its North American operations, including three non-production days on the truck line at its Canton, Mississippi, facility.. “We are mitigating the impact if the semiconductor shortage and doing our best to minimize the negative impact,” Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said during a livestreamed media briefing. Nissan, which is pulling back from the global expansion pursued by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn, on Tuesday cut its operating loss forecast by more than a third helped by China sales and cost cuts. It now expects an operating loss of 205 billion yen ($1.96 billion) in the year ending March 31 compared with an earlier 340 billion yen loss prediction. Nissan’s revised operating loss is smaller than a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of a 230.1 billion yen loss drawn from analysts. China’s auto market grew by 6.4% in December as it continued to lead the industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitsubishi Motors Corp, a junior partner in the three-way alliance that includes Nissan and Renault SA, also cut its operating loss forecast on Feb. 2. The Nissan-Renault pair were among the weakest global automakers going into the coronavirus crisis, lacking a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology. The latest full-year operating profit forecast from Honda, which is also benefiting from the demand rebound in China and elsewhere, is for 520 billion yen, up from the 420 billion yen profit it predicted three months ago.

5.600540000018219," Honda raises full-year profit forecast helped by car sales rebound, cost cuts TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co on Tuesday hiked its full-year operating profit forecast 23% to 520 billion yen as demand in China and elsewhere gained momentum and it trimmed costs. The sales rebound led by China, the world’s biggest auto market, comes as driver demand for new models including electric vehicles and autonomous drive cars grows. A global shortage of semiconductors, however, is forcing Honda and its global peers to trim vehicle production. Honda’s latest profit forecast is up from the 420 billion yen profit it predicted three months ago and higher than an average 463.6 billion yen forecast from 21 analysts, Refinitiv data shows. “Automobile sales results exceeded the same period last year since October due mainly to the launch of new N-ONE,” Seiji Kuraishi, Honda’s COO said at a press briefing, referring to the company’s micro city car. The Japanese carmaker cut production last month by about 4,000 units, mainly affecting its Fit and Jazz models, due to the semiconductor chip shortage. It also reduced output of five models at five facilities in the United States and Canada. China’s GAC said its joint venture with the automaker had received warnings on supply of certain models. Sources told Reuters the automaker will also reduce its domestic output this month. Honda said expects to sell 4.5 million cars globally in its business year to March 31 compared with a previous forecast of 4.6 million vehicles China, one of Honda’s biggest markets, grew by 6.4% in December as it continued to lead the industry’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.. Honda is accelerating its shift to electric cars and other zero-emission vehicles, aiming for two-thirds of its output to be new-energy vehicles by 2030. Last year it launched its first mass-produced all-battery car and also plans to begin selling new autonomous drive vehicles. The maker of the CR-V SUV crossover also posted a better-than-expected 67% jump in operating profit for the three months to Dec. 31 to 277.7 billion. That result was better than an estimated average of 176.72 billion yen from eight analysts surveyed by Refinitiv SmartEstimate."

The automaker will lower production in February of models such as the Fit subcompact and the N-series mini-vehicle, by around 2,500 and 5,000 units, respectively, the sources said. Honda, like its global peers, is facing a shortage of semiconductors. It is running short on chips used in the Fit’s vehicle stability assist system and in the N-series’ safety- and driver-assist technology, sources said. A Honda spokesman said that the automaker plans to adjust productions next month as it did this month, but did not disclose which car models would be affected or the scale of the cut. “We are continuing to take measures to minimise the effect,” he said. Honda cut its production earlier this month by about 4,000 units, mainly affecting its Fit and Jazz models.

Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI), the country’s second-largest manufacturer of two-wheelers, said it planned to realign its production strategy to improve operational efficiency and ensure long term business sustainability. “The Indian auto industry is going through an exceptionally challenging phase from the past three years considering the prolonged demand slowdown and overall economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic,” the company said in a statement. While automakers globally have been battered by the pandemic, companies in India have also been hit by slowing demand since 2019. The move comes weeks after the Japanese automaker said it would shutter one of two car plants in India due to slowing demand. HMSI made the scheme available to its employees’ union through a letter dated Jan. 5, which was reviewed and reported by Reuters earlier on Wednesday. The letter said the scheme was open to permanent employees who have completed 10 years of service or are over 40 as of Jan. 31, 2021. Depending on the number of years of service, a senior manager or vice president could be eligible for a payout of 7.2 million rupees ($98,488), the letter showed. While it was not immediately clear how many employees would qualify, the letter said the first 400 people to opt for retirement would get an additional 500,000 rupees. HMSI had more than 7,000 employees across its four plants in India as of March 31, 2020, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Between April and November, the first eight months of the current fiscal year, HMSI’s sales plummeted 32% to 2.4 million units, with sales of motorcycles and scooters falling 25%, industry data showed. The automaker has capacity to manufacture 6.4 million motorcycles and scooters a year in India, according to its website. The company continues to see a strong potential to develop India as Honda’s global export hub in the mid-term and its investment plans for future products and technology remain unchanged, it said."

1.4655760054533051," Verstappen snatches pole for Abu Dhabi finale (Reuters) - Max Verstappen denied Mercedes a final front-row lockout of the season by snatching pole position in the dying seconds of Saturday’s qualifying for the year-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The Dutchman steered his Honda-powered Red Bull around the 5.5km-long Yas Marina circuit in one minute, 35.246 seconds edging Mercedes’ provisional pole-sitter Valtteri Bottas by just 0.025 seconds. World champion Lewis Hamilton, back in the car after his COVID-19-enforced absence at last week’s Sakhir Grand Prix, was third but only 0.086 seconds off the pace. “I said before I went into qualifying, it’s going to be the final send of the season and we did that,” said Verstappen after taking his third career pole and first this season. “The whole year when you’re behind getting closer, it’s getting sometimes a bit frustrating.” Verstappen’s dazzling display under the floodlights means it will be only the second time in 17 races this season that Mercedes haven’t started from the front. It was also the first non-Mercedes pole position of the season with Lance Stroll’s qualifying-topping effort in Turkey set in his Mercedes-powered Racing Point, and only the fourth time this season that Hamilton and Bottas haven’t locked out the front row. “The main issue was we couldn’t really get the soft tyres to work properly as it should,” said the 31-year-old Bottas. “The balance was not quite perfect.” Hamilton, who has taken 10 of Mercedes’ 15 poles this season, said he still wasn’t back to full fitness after only just having recovered from COVID-19. “It’s definitely been a difficult weekend,” said the 35-year-old Briton. “It just felt like you’ve lost that momentum and really struggled so far with the balance this weekend.” Verstappen had headed a Red Bull one-two from Alexander Albon in Saturday’s final practice session. But Mercedes were expected to strike back come the qualifying hour. Hamilton led Bottas in the first two parts of qualifying, with the pair looking like favourites for a front-row lockout. Verstappen, however, showed his speed as the final shootout got underway, splitting his Mercedes rivals after his first run, before posting the lap that deposed Bottas and Hamilton from the top of the timesheets. Lando Norris was an impressive fourth for McLaren, winning the team mate qualifying battle at McLaren against Ferrari-bound Spaniard Carlos Sainz who was sixth. Charles Leclerc was ninth for Ferrari but the Monegasque will drop three places on the grid due to a penalty for causing a collision at the last race in Sakhir. Sebastian Vettel was knocked out in the second phase of his final qualifying session for Ferrari. The German, moving to Racing Point which is rebranding to Aston Martin next year, was 13th. Sergio Perez, making way for Vettel at the Silverstone-based team, will start at the back of the grid. The Mexican, who became F1’s newest winner last weekend in Sakhir, is carrying engine-related penalties and did only a warm-up lap in the second phase of qualifying."
-0.6738544474393507," Honda warns UK output could be temporarily halted due to supply problems LONDON (Reuters) - Honda said on Tuesday potential parts shortages might result in the Japanese automaker needing to temporarily halt production at its British factory, where it builds the Civic car, due to transport-related delays. “Whilst a number of measures are being taken to mitigate any disruption, there could be a temporary pause to production to enable any supply issue to be resolved,” the company said in a statement. Spokesmen for the company did not immediately say whether the issue was related to Brexit. Talks between Britain and the European Union to strike a free trade deal by the end of the year have been unsuccessful so far with companies warning about the risk of severe disruption if there is no agreement. Transport between Britain and mainland Europe is likely to face some disruption even if there is an agreement before the transitional arrangements expire at the end of the year. Honda’s southern English Swindon factory built just under 110,000 cars last year but is due to close permanently next year."

The Spaniard fractured his humerus in the season-opening Spanish Grand Prix in Jerez in July, then had a second operation after damaging a plate in his arm while opening a window at home. He underwent another eight hours of surgery on Thursday for a new plate and bone graft. Honda said hospital doctors had deemed Marquez’s post-operative situation to be satisfactory. “However, the cultures obtained during the pseudarthrosis surgery have confirmed that there was a previous infection in the fracture, which will see Marquez undergo specific antibiotic treatment in the coming weeks,” the team added. It said he will remain at the hospital in Madrid. Honda have not said how long the Spaniard is likely to take to recover but media reports have suggested he could miss the start of next season in March."

The Spaniard fractured his humerus in the season-opening Spanish Grand Prix in Jerez in July and had a second operation after damaging a plate in his arm while opening a window at home. He ended up missing the rest of the season, failing to score a single point. Honda said the latest surgery was due to the slow healing of the humerus “which has not improved with specific shock wave treatment.” The procedure lasted eight hours, they said, and was uneventful. Honda did not say how long the Spaniard’s recovery might take but motorsport.com suggested he could be out for six months, which would mean missing the start of next season.

-3.7565217391304286," Ferrari will support engine freeze, says team boss MANAMA (Reuters) - Ferrari will support a freeze on Formula One engine regulations starting in 2022, team principal Mattia Binotto said on Thursday, which would enable Red Bull to use their Honda power units even after the Japanese manufacturer leaves the sport. Honda, which exclusively supplies Red Bull and sister team AlphaTauri, is set to bow out of Formula One at the end of the 2021 season leaving the two outfits looking for a new supply. Red Bull’s preferred option is to acquire the intellectual property of the Honda power unit and continue using it for its two teams. But they have said that would only be financially viable if expensive engine development was frozen. Ferrari had been against the move to freeze engines even as rivals Mercedes, who have won every championship since the current engine rules were introduced in 2014, have supported it. But after meetings in recent days with the sport’s commercial rights holder and the governing FIA, Binotto said the Italian manufacturer had changed their mind provided the introduction of the next power unit, whose details are yet to be worked out, is brought forward a year from 2026 to 2025. “As Ferrari we understand the situation,” Binotto told reporters at the Bahrain Grand Prix in a video conference from Ferrari’s headquarters in Maranello. “We’re... supportive in trying to anticipate by one season, one year, the freezing of the engines. That will mean as well trying to anticipate to 2025 the new regulations for the power units.” Binotto, whose power unit is seen as the weakest of the four manufacturers, said the sport was discussing putting in place a mechanism that would allow any engine makers lacking performance to catch up. Like Ferrari, Renault had also been opposed to an engine freeze. But on Friday the team’s executive director Marcin Budkowski said the French manufacturer had always supported the idea of halting development in the build-up to a rules change so as to avoid running two programmes simultaneously. He said in the past it was Honda who had been against halting engine development. Renault were open to a “reasonable compromise”, added Budkowski, as long as any decision to freeze engine development was taken for the good of the sport and not for Honda or Red Bull. “Let’s find the right thing for the sport, let’s find the right engine formula for the future, and at the right time to introduce it,” he said."

The Note’s first full model change in eight years is part of a plan by the carmaker to revamp an aging vehicle line up and return to profitability as it pulls back from the expansion pursued by former Chairman Carlos Ghosn to focus on sales in Japan, China and the United States. The Note will feature “e-Power” hybrid technology, which uses a gasoline engine to charge a battery that powers the vehicle. New autonomous drive functions will help drivers slow down on curves using data from the car’s navigation system. Nissan, which expects to post a record operating loss of 340 billion yen ($3.25 billion) in the year to March 31, is cutting production capacity and model numbers by a fifth and aims to slash operating expenses by 300 billion yen over three years. At the same time, it has promised to launch a slew of vehicles in Japan, China and the United States, including new electric vehicles to lure increasingly environment-conscious drivers. In Japan, the Note, which uses a platform designed with French alliance partner Renault SA, will compete With Toyota’s Yaris and Honda’s Fit. A Nissan spokeswoman said the automaker has not made any decision on selling the redesigned vehicle in other markets."
4.301829890626583," Honda says will be first to mass produce level 3 autonomous cars TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Honda Motor Co said on Wednesday it will be the world’s first automaker to mass produce sensor-packed level 3 autonomous cars that will allow drivers to let their vehicles navigate congested expressway traffic. “Honda is planning to launch sales of a Honda Legend (luxury sedan) equipped with the newly approved automated driving equipment” before the end of March 2021, Honda said in a press release. The race to build self-driving cars is a key technology battleground for automakers, with technology companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc also investing billions of dollars in a field expected to boost car sales. Japan’s government earlier in the day awarded a safety certification to Honda’s autonomous “Traffic Jam Pilot” driving technology, which legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road. “Self driving cars are expected to play a big role in helping reduce traffic accidents, provide transportation for the elderly and improve logistics,” said Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. There are six levels of vehicle autonomy, from 0 to 5, ranging from manual cars or those with simple functions such as cruise control to fully self-driving vehicles that would not need steering wheels, or brake and acceleration pedals. Level 2 cars, which are currently on public roads, can control their own speed and steering, but must have an alert driver able to take control at all times. In July, U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc said it was “very close” to achieving level 5 autonomous driving."

6.942336610685251," Toyota more than doubles profit outlook as China sales rebound from pandemic TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp more than doubled its full-year operating profit forecast on Friday, as vehicle sales rebound in China from a coronavirus pandemic squeeze earlier this year that contributed to a 24% slide in second-quarter earnings. Japan’s top automaker said it now expects an operating profit of 1.3 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) for the year through March, 2021, up from the 500 billion it predicted previously. Operating profit for the previous financial year was 2.47 trillion yen. That topped the 1.25 trillion yen average estimate for full-year profit from 26 analysts polled by Refinitiv. For the second quarter, from July to September, operating profit fell to 506 billion yen from 662.4 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to Reuters’ calculations, as sales dipped amid the coronavirus impact globally. Still, the numbers already showed progress compared with April-June, Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon said. “If you compare the second quarter to the first you can see a dramatic recovery,” Kon said, speaking during an online press briefing. Reaction from investors was muted, with shares up just 0.5% near the close of trading in Tokyo, while the Nikkei benchmark index rose 0.9%. “Investors are looking at how Toyota is faring overseas and given the yen’s appreciation (versus the dollar) and a resurgence of the coronavirus, we have to consider the (profit forecast) revision cautiously,” said Kazuo Kamiya, a fund manager at Nomura Securities. A strong yen reduces the value of sales booked in the United States. The maker of the RAV4 sports utility vehicle (SUV) crossover and the Prius gasoline hybrid now expects to sell 9.42 million cars this year - up 3.5% from a previous forecasts of 9.1 million this year, but still well below last year’s sales of 10.46 million. Although still weaker than last year, demand has bounced back, particularly in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Toyota and rivals are pinning recovery hopes on winning business there as China recovers from the pandemic faster than other countries. Overall vehicle sales in China in September increased 12.8%, a sixth straight monthly gain, although sales were still 6.9% lower than the same time a year earlier. Toyota has seen demand in China increase for its electric cars and Lexus luxury brand. A senior Toyota executive in China said in September that annual global sales of electrified vehicles could reach 5.5 million in 2025, five years earlier than initially planned. ($1 = 103.5700 yen)"

Japan’s third-biggest automaker said it now forecasts a full-year operating profit of 420 billion yen ($4.06 billion) up from a previous prediction of a 200 billion yen profit. That was well above an average estimate for a 254.6 billion yen profit compiled from 19 analysts polled by Refinitiv. For the second quarter, operating profit came in at 283 billion yen, up from 220 billion yen in the same period a year earlier. The upgrade came after a similar move by peer Toyota Motor Corp earlier on Friday. Honda and peers like Toyota are focusing more on China, the world’s biggest auto market, as it leads a rebound in global demand that was hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. For the full business year, Honda said it expects to sell 4.6 million cars. That’s up from a previous forecast of 4.5 million, but still below the 4.79 million sold the previous year. Like other automakers, Honda is also accelerating a shift to electric cars and other zero-emission vehicles, a change in strategy that was behind its decision last month to end its participation as an engine supplier in the FIA Formula One World Championship. Honda last month launched its first mass-produced all-battery car this month - the Honda e - and wants two-thirds of its output to be new-energy vehicles by 2030. In the United States, meanwhile, Honda is looking to win a bigger market share with redesigned sports utility vehicles (SUVs) as it chases a shift in consumer demand for larger, all-wheel drive models. In September Honda unveiled plans to deepen its partnership in North America with General Motors Co to jointly develop low-emission vehicles that would allow them to share technology and costs..

9.883012913149935," UPDATE 1-Motor racing-Mercedes back Red Bull plan to take on Honda's engine * Red Bull want to take on Honda engine after Japanese leave F1 * Mercedes supportive of plan (Recasts with Mercedes comments) Oct 24 (Reuters) - Red Bull won the support of Mercedes on Saturday for a call to freeze Formula One’s engine rules so they might continue using Honda’s power unit after the Japanese have left at the end of 2021. “The more we look, there really only is one option that works,” Red Bull boss Christian Horner told Sky Sports television at the Portuguese Grand Prix. “And that would be to try and agree something with Honda where we could take on the IP (intellectual property) for the Honda engine, but of course that would have to be dependant on the regulations.” Horner said the plan only made sense for an independent outfit if the astronomical costs could be removed by freezing development. Formula One’s next engine has yet to be finalised but is scheduled for introduction in 2026. The sport is otherwise due for a major rules overhaul in 2022, having postponed it from 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mercedes, who have won every championship in the V6 turbo hybrid era that started in 2014, have ruled out supplying Red Bull but motorsport head Toto Wolff told reporters he would support a freeze. “I totally understand where Red Bull is coming from,” he said. “They have the capability of tweaking it (the Honda engine) and maybe optimising it and maybe there are a few things in the pipeline from Honda giving them confidence that there is more performance. “I think we should be doing everything to give Red Bull that opportunity,” said the Austrian. Without the Honda option, Renault would be obliged to supply Red Bull as the manufacturer supplying fewest teams -- a move neither side would welcome. Red Bull won both titles for four years in a row with Renault from 2010-13 but fell out with the French manufacturer in the new era. “It’s a big wake-up call for Formula One to have a major manufacturer like Honda walk away from the sport at the end of 2021,” said Horner. “That leaves only three engine suppliers, and that’s a very precarious place for the sport to be. “The governing body really need to take control of this.” Asked about a Plan B, Horner said the full focus was Plan A. “Renault don’t really want to supply us,” he added. “It’s inconvenient to supply a team like Red Bull, we’re not a standard customer team. We’re not a small team.” Horner said it would be “criminal” to see the Honda engines otherwise left languishing “on a shelf somewhere in a Japanese warehouse.” Honda have won twice this season with Red Bull and sister team AlphaTauri, making the Japanese company the first engine maker to win with two different teams in the V6 era.

It would just be impossible to fund the kind of development spend that currently goes on with these engines.” Champions Mercedes have said they do not have the capacity to supply Red Bull, leaving only Renault and Ferrari as the alternatives to the Honda engine. Red Bull won both titles for four years in a row with Renault from 2010-13 but has fallen out with the French manufacturer in the V6 turbo hybrid era that followed and has been dominated by Mercedes. Ferrari’s engine is the weakest of the four this season.

13.865381453663092," Honda reaches $5 million defective air bag settlement with Arizona (Reuters) - Arizona reached a $5 million settlement with Honda Motor Co Ltd’s U.S. units Wednesday in a probe into defective Takata air bag systems, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich said. The settlement follows an $85 million settlement announced in August with nearly all other U.S. states. Arizona said the Honda settlement includes $1.65 million in restitution for state consumers, a $2.13 million repair incentive program, $750,000 for consumer outreach and a $500,000 payment to Arizona. Faulty air bag inflators have been tied to at least 15 U.S. deaths in Honda vehicles, including an August death in Mesa, Arizona in a 2002 Honda Civic. The inflators can explode with excessive force. Honda said it had not acknowledged any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Honda has to date replaced more than 16 million defective Takata air bag inflators in its vehicles and made more than 294 million individual attempts to contact owners and urge them to have their recalled Takata airbag inflators replaced. Honda is providing funding for public service announcements in Arizona to highlight the risk caused by defective Takata air bag inflators. More than 15,000 eligible Arizonans, who between September 2012 and November 2015, purchased in Arizona a Honda or Acura vehicle with the Takata air bag subject to recall, will receive a $100 check. Cash-equivalent gift cards of up to $150 will be mailed to approximately 40,000 Arizona consumers with a defective air bag inflator, but they can only be activated after consumers take vehicles to a Honda dealership for the free airbag replacement. Takata pleaded guilty in 2017 to U.S. criminal fraud charges for deceiving automakers over the safety of its air bag inflators. More than 290 injuries tied to faulty Takata inflators and at least 26 deaths worldwide, including two U.S. deaths in Ford Motor Co vehicles."
