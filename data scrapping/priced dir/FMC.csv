In its first forecasts factoring in the impact of the pandemic, the company said it expected adjusted net income this year within a range of down 4% to up 1% from last year, and revenue growth of 3-6%. That compares with previous forecasts for growth of 1-5%, and 4-7%, respectively. The company’s shares were down 4.2% at 1320 GMT. “Our base case is that a major second COVID-19 wave in our relevant markets can be prevented. Instead, we should continue to see local and regional outbreaks,” Chief Executive Stephan Sturm said in a conference call. The pandemic has been a mixed blessing for healthcare companies, bringing increased demand for selected products and services but also delays in treatments and extra expenses. While the number of post-acute treatments should gradually recover, postponed site inspections will cut Fresenius’ 2020 product launches by about 30% and project delays may last well into the second half, Sturm said. Fresenius’ second-quarter net income came in at 410 million euros ($483 million), down 13% year-on-year but above analysts’ mean forecast of 398 million euros in a company-provided poll. The company pointed to easing demand for painkillers and sedatives to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients after a surge in the first quarter, and a slower-than-expected recovery in China after its coronavirus outbreak was brought under control. Fresenius Medical Care, the group’s separately listed dialysis unit, confirmed its 2020 targets, citing a strong underlying performance and receding pandemic effects, after reporting second-quarter net income 8% above consensus."

13.992601046828387," UPDATE 3-Fresenius beats Q3 forecasts with strong sales of home dialysis treatments * Fresenius and FMC beat Q3 consensus, confirm outlook * Home dialysis growth offsets ESCO effect at FMC * Fresenius highlights infusion drugs unit growth in emerging markets (Adds details from conference call and analyst comments, updates share price) Oct 29 (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius beat third-quarter revenue forecasts on Tuesday, citing a solid performance by its infusion drugs unit in emerging markets and strong growth in home treatment at its separately listed dialysis business. The group said both Fresenius Medical Care, the world’s largest provider of dialysis treatments, and drugmaker Kabi saw strong organic growth in Asia and Europe, more than offsetting weak U.S. markets. Fresenius confirmed its full-year guidance after third-quarter revenues rose by 8% to 8.9 billion euros ($9.86 billion) in the third quarter, compared to 8.7 billion euros in a company-compiled consensus. Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe said the results showed “a strong underlying business, which should help regain trust after a 12-month period with rather mediocre results.” Shares in Fresenius were up 2.7%, while Fresenius Medical Care were up 4.7% at 1350 GMT, topping Germany’s blue-chip index . Fresenius’ Helios unit, which runs private hospitals in Germany and Spain, also reported good growth. The hospital operator is monitoring a consolidation trend which appears to be gaining momentum in the German hospital market and will “take a closer look at any suitable opportunity,” Fresenius CEO Stephan Sturm said during a conference call. Helios will also open a new mid-sized hospital in Barcelona by 2022 after opening two outpatient centres in the Spanish cities of Toledo and Algeciras this year, Sturm added. Analysts said investors were relieved that a summer slowdown at Helios and a further negative impact from a U.S. dialysis treatment coordination programme known as ESCO had not materialized. “Our businesses developed solidly in the third quarter, keeping Fresenius on track to deliver the results that we promised earlier this year,” Sturm said in a statement. Fresenius Medical Care reported a 9% rise in its third-quarter revenue, driven by record growth in home dialysis in North America as its investment in NxStage, a U.S. maker of home-use dialysis machines FMC acquired earlier this year, started to pay off. Shares in FMC, which remains exposed to changes in U.S. healthcare policy with 70% of its revenue coming from North America, had lagged the European health sector index since July when President Donald Trump’s administration set goals to move more kidney disease treatment out of dialysis clinics and into patients’ homes. While this could hurt FMC’s business of running the clinics, the company stands to benefit from its investment in home dialysis systems, softening the potential impact, analysts have said. Analysts at Berenberg said in a note that the dialysis company’s revenues and EBIT were “better than they look” since they “included an €84m headwind related to an ongoing billing dispute (we suspect with the US Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Thus on an underlying basis revenues were actually around 2% better than we and consensus had expected.” FMC’s earnings came in slightly above expectations despite a negative adjustment for income from the ESCO programme, established to coordinate the care of dialysis patients. The “ESCO effect” reduced third quarter revenue and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by 46 million euros, and made a 33 million euro dent in net income, the company said. In the second quarter, FMC lowered the range for an expected ESCO programme lump-sum reimbursement by 41 million euros. FMC’s third-quarter sales totalled 4.4 billion euros, a touch above analysts’ average forecast of 4.3 billion euros in a company-compiled consensus. Fresenius Medical Care confirmed its 2019 guidance of adjusted revenue growth between 3% and 7% at constant exchange rates, and adjusted net income change to be in the range of between 2% higher and 2% lower than last year. For 2020, the company expects adjusted revenue as well as adjusted net income to grow at a mid to high single digit rate."
7.768987127354167," UPDATE 4-Fresenius slides as weakness in dialysis unit offsets improved outlook * Fresenius expects FY 4%-7% revenue growth at constant currency * Fresenius highlights strong emerging markets growth * Concerns about U.S. cost savings weigh on FMC (Updates share prices, adds CEO M&A comments) July 30 (Reuters) - Shares in German healthcare group Fresenius slid on Tuesday after its dialysis unit FMC reported smaller than expected cost savings and said full-year earnings growth would likely come in at the lower end of guidance. That assessment overshadowed an increase in Fresenius’s full-year revenue target following strong generic drug sales in emerging markets. Fresenius shares were down 2.9% at 1450 GMT, while those of dialysis unit Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) slid 5.2%, making it the second biggest loser on Germany’s blue-chip DAX index Analysts said the market was focusing on FMC’s updated assessment of its participation in a U.S. government programme for kidney disease care, ESCO, which sparked a 41 million euro ($45.70 million) drop in revenue in the second quarter. FMC Chief Executive Rice Powell said it had cut the savings ratio for the programme, which it uses to calculate sales and earnings “as a precautionary measure”, though it maintained its overall outlook. “The savings rate is lower than we had anticipated and hoped for,” Powell told analysts in a call, adding the adjustment was not part of the company’s planning when it issued full-year guidance in February. As a result, FMC believes it will be closer to the lower end of its adjusted net income growth guidance for 2019, Powell said. Asked whether there was a risk of more substantial corrections linked to the programme, financial chief Mike Brosnan said: “That 41 million euro adjustment was substantial, so I’d like to think the worst is behind us.” The update weighed on the margins of the company’s coordinated care business, JP Morgan said, adding that FMC had also been hit by lower product sales in Europe. Fresenius, FMC’s parent, meanwhile highlighted continued strong growth of its generic infusions unit Kabi in markets including China, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, while noting increased competition and easing shortages in the United States. The group could consider small and medium acquisitions opportunities for Kabi, Fresenius chief executive Stephan Sturm told analysts, adding he did not rule out bigger ones. Fresenius said it now expected full-year revenue growth of between 4% and 7% at constant currency rates, up from a previous range of 3% to 6%. Its outlook included the effects of its February acquisition of U.S. home dialysis firm NxStage. “We are reporting a good second quarter 2019, with healthy organic growth in all four business segments,” Sturm said in a statement. “We are very confident about the second half and the coming years.” Fresenius Medical Care maintained its 2019 targets, but JP Morgan said the revenue target would require significant acceleration in the second half of the year. The unit reported adjusted second-quarter revenue of 4.28 billion euros ($4.77 billion), below the 4.35 billion euros expected on average by analysts in a Refinitiv poll. Fresenius said its hospitals division Helios, which had long acted as a drag on its results due to decreasing admissions and staff shortages in Germany, recorded strong organic sales growth in its home market. Sturm said with that business now stabilized, Fresenius could revisit the idea of expanding beyond Germany and Spain, where it now operates, into a third European market in 2020 and beyond. He said he was open to acquisitions in the hospital market, particularly in Spain. He would also look at opportunities in Latin America if they arose, he said, and selectively consider options in Germany. Fresenius said its comparable group second-quarter core operating profit (EBIT) fell by 7% in currency-adjusted terms to 1.08 billion euros, while currency-adjusted revenue rose 6% to 8.8 billion euros, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations."

Shares rose 3.3 percent to $17.49 on Tuesday morning. The stock has see-sawed since last month’s IPO, and Graves said he expects that to continue until the sale. “It’s highly likely we’ll continue to have a share price that bounces around,” Graves said. “By the end of 2019, we should have the right shareholder base for Livent.”"

The results served to underscore Wall Street’s ambivalence surrounding the lithium sector as concerns about market oversupply of the white metal offset bullish expectations for electric cars. Lithium is used to make electric car batteries. Livent Chief Executive Officer Paul Graves told Reuters last month the Philadelphia-based company stood by FMC’s prior forecast for 2018 lithium sales of $430 million to $460 million. On Monday, Livent said it now expects 2018 sales of $440 million to $450 million. Livent posted third-quarter net income of $30 million, compared to $25.5 million in the year-ago quarter. A comparable per-share net income figure was not immediately available. Excluding one-time items, Philadelphia-based Livent posted earnings of 22 cents per share, meeting Wall Street’s expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. FMC, which owns about 86 percent of Livent’s shares, said on Monday it plans to report lithium division results as part of its own results through the fourth quarter, effectively keeping Livent as part of its own reporting structure for the rest of the year. FMC said it also plans to sell its stake in Livent by next March. Such a step will keep Livent closely aligned with its parent through 2019 at the earliest, limiting its ability to make independent decisions in the fast moving lithium sector. Still, Livent expects demand for lithium to spike in coming years, in what the company hopes will be a positive harbinger for its shares, which dropped after last month’s IPO. “We will continue to focus on strengthening partnerships with our customers through increased investment in additional capacity and developing new lithium-based technologies,” Livent CEO Graves said in a statement on Monday.

FMC cut its earnings target for the year in mid-October, citing slower growth in dialysis services in North America, its largest market. “We anticipate the impact from the current level of growth and less acquisitions to continue in the fourth quarter,” Chief Executive Rice Powell said in a statement on Tuesday. “We have identified countermeasures and have begun implementation.” FMC plans to expand and improve the services it offers, courting private health insurers to increase the number of patients on higher paying insurance schemes. It also wants to increase sales in emerging markets. FMC confirmed third quarter sales fell 6 percent to 4.06 billion euros ($4.61 billion) while adjusted net income was down 2 percent to 310 million euros. “Weaker volumes in North America, higher patient & occupancy costs, as well as challenges in select Emerging Markets such as Argentina weighed on 3Q and are expected to persist in 4Q,” said Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest. Shares in FMC, which dropped 19 percent when the company announced its guidance cut, were trading down 1.1 percent at 69.68 euros by 0858 GMT.

-0.9543266901643498," Exclusive: Lithium producer Albemarle eyes buying rival if IPO stumbles - source (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp ALB.N, the world's largest lithium producer, could buy FMC Corp's FMC.N lithium division if the smaller rival's initial public offering stumbles this fall, a senior executive told investors at an event in June, according to a source who attended. The comments, which have not previously been publicly reported, come at a time of rapid growth and cutthroat competition across the lithium sector as Albemarle seeks to tap into surging demand for high-tech batteries like those used in Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Model X and other electric vehicles. Shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle fell less than 1 percent to $95.86 on Wednesday, in line with broader markets. The company’s stock has lost about 27 percent of its value this year. Philadelphia-based FMC, primarily a pesticides maker, said in February it would launch a $500 million initial public offering in October of a stake in its lithium business. The new company will be named “Livent Corp,” a play on the chemical symbol for lithium, “Li.” Livent’s stock multiple, which will reflect how the stock trades compared to its expected earnings, will be closely watched by Wall Street as the company would be the first major U.S. lithium producer to go public. Albemarle executive Eric Norris, who heads the company’s global lithium business, told investors at a private June dinner in Las Vegas that a successful Livent IPO would be good news for Albemarle by showing strong investor appetite in the sector. “If the multiple is high, good for Albemarle,” he said, according to the source who attended. But he added: “If it is low, we can buy FMC” lithium operations, according to the source. Norris added that Luke Kissam, Albemarle’s chief executive, shared his opinion, according to the source. Albemarle could buy Livent by approaching the new company’s board with an offer, by taking its plan directly to shareholders or by pursuing other paths. FMC declined to comment, citing the pending IPO. Shares of FMC rose slightly to $83.19 in morning trading. David Ryan, Albemarle’s vice president of corporate strategy and investor relations, would not confirm or deny any acquisition plans. He said the company would be interested in how the market values a stand-alone lithium producer. “As Mr. Norris, who attended the investor dinner, has stated previously, we maintain the FMC IPO is an interesting and important milestone for the industry because it will establish a valuation for a stand-alone lithium company,” Ryan said in a statement to Reuters. “Like any potential acquisition, Albemarle would evaluate a target considering multiple data points and market conditions at the time.” Albemarle, which produces more than 65,000 tonnes annually of lithium, has said publicly in the past that it would be interested in growing through acquisitions, but never mentioned FMC or Livent publicly by name. Adding Livent to its portfolio could help Albemarle stay ahead of rivals, including Chile's SQM SQMa.SN and China's Tianqi Lithium Corp 002466.SZ, by pumping up its production. FMC, which saw lithium sales jump 46 percent in the second quarter to $107.9 million, operates a lithium facility in Argentina, near Albemarle’s own lithium operations in Chile and expects to produce roughly 21,000 tonnes this year. “It is not uncommon in the U.S. markets for competitors to watch each other’s IPOs,” said Hillary Holmes, an attorney with the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. Albemarle’s Norris left FMC in January to join Albemarle as chief strategy officer. Earlier this summer he was promoted to head of Albemarle’s lithium division. Albemarle has also been seeking to remain the lithium market’s top producer by investing millions of dollars to engineer specialized types of the product for electric car batteries. Roughly 500,000 electric vehicles were sold globally in 2016, a figure that is expected to jump sevenfold by 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
-6.8529201850185," FMC says lithium pricing rising on strong electric car demand Aug 2 (Reuters) - FMC Corp, which is spinning off its lithium division as a publicly traded company later this year, said on Thursday that prices for the light metal continue to rise on strong demand from electric vehicle battery makers. There are growing worries about oversupply in the lithium sector, with several new production facilities under construction around the globe. Philadelphia-based FMC on Wednesday posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, helped in part by a 20 percent increase in sales of lithium hydroxide and carbonate, the two most common derivations of lithium used by battery suppliers for Tesla Inc and others. “We are seeing sequential pricing as well as very strong year-on-year pricing,” FMC Chief Executive Pierre Brondeau said on a conference call with investors. Spot market prices in China for lithium have plunged this year due in part to the oversupply concerns, though the Chinese spot market is relatively small. FMC, like competitor Albemarle Corp, has annual contracts with customers that it renegotiates annually. The company is able to charge more under those contracts as demand rises for the metal, a critical battery component, Brondeau said. FMC, which also produces agricultural chemicals, plans to spin off its lithium division in an initial public offering in October under the “Livent Corp” name. For 2018, FMC expects lithium sales of $430 million to $460 million, in what would be at least a 20 percent increase from last year, though executives noted that not all of that is spread out equally among all quarters. FMC’s main lithium production facility is in Argentina, where the country’s peso currency has been dropping in value to the U.S. dollar this year due in part to weakness in emerging markets and uncertainty about the local economy. That devaluation actually boosted exports from the lithium division in the second quarter, Brondeau said. Shares of FMC fell 2.6 percent to $85.99 on Thursday as U.S. markets were mixed.

Akorn is suing Fresenius for walking away from a $4.7 billion takeover agreement in April and the uncertainty over the outcome of the trial is hanging over the stock. Chief Executive Stephan Sturm told analysts Fresenius stood by its decision to pull out of the deal after uncovering data integrity breaches at Akorn which he says were systemic. Akorn disagrees with the allegations and says Fresenius soured on the deal for financial reasons. Analysts say the outcome of the trial is too close to call. Fresenius said closing arguments in the case will take place in a Delaware Court on Aug. 23 after which the judge will have 90 days to come to a verdict. An appeal by the losing party to the Delaware Supreme Court is also possible, it said. “The Delaware Chancery Court is known for its efficiency,” Sturm said. “We expect this matter to be finally resolved by early next year,” he added. Investors were rattled by the prospect of the dispute dragging on into next year and sent the shares down 3.7 percent to trade at 66.4 euros by 1325 GMT Fresenius, which also operates hospitals and dialysis clinics, said adjusted net income rose 3 percent to 472 million euros ($554 million) in the second quarter, slightly ahead of the average forecast in a Reuters poll. Adverse moves in the U.S. dollar and Chinese yuan pushed sales down 2 percent to 8.4 billion euros, in line with the consensus forecast. Currency headwinds also held back sales growth at Fresenius SE’s separately listed kidney dialysis business, Fresenius Medical Care, where revenue fell 6 percent in the quarter to 4.21 billion euros.[F9N1H000R] Fresenius confirmed its overall group guidance and lifted its earnings forecast for its Kabi unit, which performed strongly in the quarter and was further boosted by a European decision not to ban hydroxyethyl-starch (HES), a drug which is administered intravenously following sudden blood loss. It now forecasts earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) growth for Kabi in the range of -2 to +1 percent when adjusted for currencies.

5.469159069500399," Fresenius Medical sells U.S. Sound Inpatient for $2.15 billion BERLIN (Reuters) - German dialysis specialist Fresenius Medical Care FMEG.DE is selling its majority shareholding in Sound Inpatient Physicians Holdings for $2.15 billion, it said on Saturday. The sale to an investment consortium led by private equity firm Summit Partners is expected to close in late 2018 and will bring a pretax book gain of about 800 million euros ($983 million) for the German company. Fresenius Medical Care, which says it is the world’s largest provider of dialysis products and services, bought the stake in Sound Inpatient for about $600 million in 2014 as part of a drive to offer additional services linked to kidney dialysis. Sound Inpatient provides services such as emergency medicine and critical care. FMC said the investment had enabled it to gain insight in value-based care programs in the U.S. and that it was now in a position where it could divest Sound Inpatient and use the proceeds for other investments. In 2017, Sound generated revenues of around 1.25 billion euros and EBIT of around 90 million euros with 3,500 employees. FMC’s financial targets for 2018 and 2020 do not include the effects of the Sound Inpatient sale or the acquisition of NxStage Medical, it added. FMC is due to publish first quarter results on May 3.
