72.34782608695653," Brazilian residents sue Braskem in Dutch court over salt mines LONDON (Reuters) - Residents of Maceio have filed a lawsuit in a Dutch court against Brazilian petrochemicals company Braskem SA over cracks and sinking ground near salt mines in the Brazilian city, their legal representatives said on Monday. The case is the latest attempt by local communities to seek compensation from large commodities companies in European courts after the UK Supreme Court on Friday allowed Nigerian residents to sue Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) in England over years of oil spills. “This is, sadly, yet another case of a giant corporation that is more than happy to exploit the natural riches of an area but has had little consideration for those who live in it,” Gabriella Bianchini, partner at global law firm PGMBM, said in a statement “The families affected in Maceio have had to flee their homes. The streets are littered with cracks and sinkholes. The very earth has been removed from beneath people’s feet.” Braskem, the European subsidiary of which has offices in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. A federal study in Brazil has previously found that Braskem’s salt mines were the cause of cracks that destabilised homes, though Braskem has said the study is flawed. The damages have affected more than 9,000 homes, requiring the relocation of about 17,000 residents, according to deal reached in January between the company and Brazilian prosecutors. Representatives of PGMBM told Reuters a total figure for the compensation claims had yet to be calculated but could be in billions of Brazilian reais. Braskem in December said it had reached a 9.1 billion reais ($1.75 billion) deal to settle lawsuits over the damage from the Maceio mines in the northeastern coastal state of Alagoas.

106.61687299893279," UPDATE 1-Brazil's Braskem estimates $1.85 billion in provisions due to Alagoas disaster (Adds information on provisions, chlorine soda plant, company background) SAO PAULO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Braskem SA will record approximately 10.1 billion reais ($1.85 billion) in provisions related to an ongoing environmental disaster in the state of Alagoas and will restart operations at a PVC and chlorine soda plant in the state this quarter, the petrochemical producer said on Monday. The company said in a presentation to investors that 8.8 billion reais of those provisions would be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020, while approximately 1.2 billion reais had already been outlaid or re-classified. In 2019, federal authorities said salt mines operated by the company in the city of Maceio threatened the structural integrity of more than 9,000 homes, a claim the company has disputed. In January 2020, the company announced a deal with prosecutors to provide 1.7 billion reais over two years to relocate and compensate 17,000 residents. But those figures have steadily risen over time, putting pressure on Braskem’s shares. Eventually, the company reached a 9.1 billion-reais settlement with authorities in December. In the Monday presentation, the company said it expected to disburse 4.1 billion reais in payments in 2021 and another 4.8 billion reais from 2022 through 2025. The disbursements should not affect the company’s operational cash flow, executives said in comments accompanying the presentation. Operations at the PVC and chlorine soda plant, which was dependent in part on the now-shut salt mines, will restart this quarter, they added. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Braskem were up 5.3% in afternoon trade, while Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index was up 1.8%.

Federal and state prosecutors in the state of Alagoas had written to the company, alerting it of the need to move the residents, Braskem said in a filing. It was in talks to define possible measures to be adopted by mutual agreement, considering it was not automatically obliged to support the evacuations, it said. Prosecutors have alleged that a Braskem mine caused large cracks in the ground and serious damage to real estate in the city of Maceió, which was backed up by a report by the Brazilian geological service in May. Braskem has disputed this. In January, the company announced a deal with prosecutors to provide 1.7 billion reais ($387.4 million) over two years to relocate and compensate 17,000 residents, though it did not admit blame for the damage. The evacuations referred to on Thursday indicate that the scope of liability is expanding for the company. Braskem said it expected the cost of moving the additional residents would be 850 million reais, with another 750 million reais for additional measures relating to the permanent closure of salt extraction activities in Maceió.

The company said financial expenses grew to $1.332 billion in the quarter ended March 31 from $243 million a year ago, given the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. In April, Braskem revised its capital expenditure forecast in 2020 to $721 million from around $600 million, as part of its strategy to preserve cash. Its operating performance measured by recurring earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) declined by 34% compared with the first-quarter of 2019 to $294 million, excluding extraordinary expenses related to the geological disaster in Brazil’s Northeastern state of Alagoas.

30.271084337349407," Brazil's Braskem eyes drawing down of US$1bn revolver: sources NEW YORK, March 31 (LPC) - Brazilian petrochemicals company Braskem is evaluating whether to draw down on its US$1bn revolving credit facility, according to a banking source and others. The move to withdraw a portion or its entire credit facility comes as companies shore up their cash balances to withstand the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Concerns over the respiratory virus have sent financial markets into a frenzy over the last month as many businesses have closed their doors and ceased operations on government orders, while people around the world are self-isolating to limit the spread of the virus. Braskem is evaluating the option to withdraw its dollar-denominated credit facility, but no decision was final yet, the company said in an email communication with Refinitiv LPC. The Brazilian company has also formed a crisis committee to establish procedures for the health of its staff and the continuity of operations, Braskem said in a statement to its shareholders on March 20. If Braskem were to draw down, it would join a host of other companies globally that have drawn from their credit lines in recent weeks as they too cope with the devastating impact of the coronavirus. Mexican peer Orbia, formerly known as Mexichem, drew down US$1bn from its US$1.5bn credit line, the company said in a press release on March 27. Earlier this month, Brazil’s state-owned oil producer Petróleo Brasileiro also said it has drawn on US$8bn in dollar-denominated revolving loans and disbursed 3.5bn Brazilian reais in local currency credit lines. Brazilian miner Vale has also borrowed US$5bn from two facilities, while Mexican baker Grupo Bimbo and Mexican media company Televisa have also tapped existing revolving credit lines, the companies have said in press releases this month. Braskem raised its US$1bn revolving credit facility in May 2018. Braskem’s five-year facility pays 125bp over Libor. If the company draws on more than 33% of the revolver, but less than 66%, the margin will increase by 15bp, but if it withdraws more than 66% of the facility, then the margin will increase by 30bp, sources said. ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Citigroup, Santander and SMBC arranged the transaction.

-8.293075684380028," Brazil's cracked city leaves corporate heavyweights on the hook MACEIO, Brazil (Reuters) - A sudden, violent tremor knocked José Rinaldo Januario to the floor of his kitchen one Saturday afternoon two years ago - a mystery given the Brazilian city of Maceio had little history of seismic activity. After seven seconds or so, when the shaking stopped, the bar owner and his 21-year-old son Arthur raced out onto the street, fearing the house might collapse. “It was like a volcano exploded,” said Januario, 47. Cracks in his home, which he had long assumed to be construction defects, widened in the months after the tremor in March 2018. His family was forced to abandon the house last year, part of an exodus of thousands of people being evacuated from the sweltering seaside city to keep them safe. Last May, federal authorities identified a culprit: petrochemical giant Braskem. The authorities said nearby salt mines operated by the company threatened the structural integrity of more than 9,000 homes. The saga, little known outside northeastern Brazil, has enraged many residents and officials in the state of Alagoas, the nation’s second-poorest. It represents a serious financial risk for Braskem and its two largest investors, bankrupt construction group Odebrecht and state-run oil firm Petrobras, Latin America’s biggest company. Braskem believes the federal study that determined the reasons for the cracks in Maceio is methodologically flawed and inconclusive, and has commissioned studies of its own. Nonetheless, in January the company announced a deal with prosecutors to provide 1.7 billion reais ($387.4 million) over two years to relocate and compensate 17,000 residents, though it did not admit blame for the damage. Its Brazil-listed shares shot up on investor hopes the accord would draw a line under a multi-billion-dollar question mark. However seven state and federal prosecutors involved in the case told Reuters that the 1.7 billion reais - a cost estimate by Braskem - was a minimum initial payment and that the company may have to pay more out. “That’s a floor, not a ceiling,” said Ricardo Melro, head of the Alagoas public defender’s office, the most explicit public indication from officials that Braskem’s compensation and relocation costs could exceed the figure flagged in January. Melro said he believed the company would end up paying about 2.3 billion reais, about a third more. In response to Reuters queries, Braskem representatives said they were confident in their estimate. The company has an extra 2 billion reais available in the unlikely event costs run over, they added. Federal prosecutor Niedja Kaspary, however, said Braskem would also likely be required to compensate 23,000 other residents in adjacent neighborhoods as a result of a 6.7 billion reais federal lawsuit launched against the company last year. Unlike the 17,000 people, those residents are not deemed in imminent danger, but authorities warn their homes could be vulnerable in coming years. (Graphic: Braskem Disaster - ) “They’re suffering losses because their homes are worth less, they’re scared (of a collapse),” Kaspary told Reuters. “That gives them a right to compensation.” All the prosecutors said Braskem would likely have to pay out a significant amount in that case, with Melro estimating close to 2 billion reais. A decision or potential settlement is not expected for at least several months, prosecutors say, while any appeal could take years. Braskem has not formally provisioned for any potential costs related to that case as its outcome remains “very uncertain,” a representative said. Petrobras, which owns 36.1% of Braskem, and Odebrecht, with a 38.3% stake, declined to comment. On the ground, the frustration among residents is palpable. Some said financial compensation was beside the point. “So many people have had their homes here for so long. They’ve lived here for so long, and they have stories to tell,” said Silvania Carmo Machado, 67, who moved 35 years ago into her hilltop house, which overlooks surrounding countryside. While authorities want her to leave, and Braskem is set to offer 81,500 reais for her home, she has pledged to stay put. Since the 1970s Braskem, Latin America’s largest petrochemical producer and a household name in Brazil, has dug more than 30 salt wells in Maceio, many next to the Mundau lagoon, a scenic estuary popular with boaters. The salt is pumped to a nearby Braskem plant, where it is transformed into chlorine-based products that eventually become PVC piping and other consumer goods. Above ground, the mining operations are inconspicuous, with little more than a large metal tube above each well. Yet slowly, authorities say, the mines have hollowed out a layer of the earth about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the surface. As the ground has settled, they say cracks have emerged in homes in four neighborhoods that harbor everything from expensive apartment blocks to hillside shanty towns. Januario, the bar owner, was among the many residents whose walls and ceilings had been cracking for several years. But the fissures were initially small and easily fixed. That changed with the 2018 tremor, which followed a heavy rainstorm a month before, residents told Reuters. The cracks began to expand, prompting local and federal authorities to investigate. In May 2019, Brazil’s federal geological survey issued a report, saying Braskem was to blame. Ana Laura Sivieri, Braskem’s marketing and communications chief, told Reuters there could potentially be other causes for the tremor and cracking, however, including water damage, the type of soil in the region or a geological fault. “Outside those other causes, Braskem is singled out by the geological service as one of the principal causes. Braskem has raised doubts about this,” she said. ‘WE WANTED TO STAY’ Braskem, which has closed all its salt mines in Maceio, said it had not laid anyone off at its chlorine plant, where it has halted production. Its operations employ hundreds of people and account for 3% of the state’s economic output. During a Reuters visit to the plant, dozens of workers could be seen performing maintenance tasks such as raking leaves and cleaning the premises. Braskem is considering importing salt to allow it to restart production. With billions of reais on the line, major shareholders are watching the situation in Maceio closely. In December, the then-CEO of Braskem was dismissed, partly because Petrobras was dissatisfied with how the company was dealing with the case, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Braskem and Petrobras (Petroleo Brasileiro SA) declined to comment about the circumstances of the former CEO’s dismissal. The former CEO, Fernando Musa, could not be reached for comment. Braskem said it would execute the January deal with speed and compassion. It has hired dozens of professionals, from real estate agents to psychologists, to help those displaced. For displaced residents like Januario, the wrench of leaving their homes is tough to overcome. Januario’s family now lives 22 miles away in a nondescript district next to an airport. He had to abandon his bar, and is now helping out at a transportation firm. His children have switched schools. His mother and wife have both been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression. “We wanted to stay in our neighborhood,” he said. “That doesn’t have a price.”"

-62.476068921506055," UPDATE 3-Brazil's Braskem to pay nearly $700 mln for salt mining damages (Adds comments from Braskem executive regarding settlement details) SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian petrochemical producer Braskem SA has agreed to a 2.7 billion reais ($667 million) settlement with federal and state authorities in the northeastern state of Alagoas to cover damage caused by a salt mining project there. Preferred shares in the company surged as much as 8% on the news, to a five-month high and on track for their biggest one-day gain since May 20, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the amount of damages to be paid was not higher. The rise goes some way to reversing losses of 35% suffered by the stock last year. According to a securities filing on Friday, 1.7 billion reais is for financial compensation and relocation of some 17,000 people in the state capital Maceio, while 1 billion reais will be used to close the company’s rock salt wells in the city. Prosecutors had alleged the mine caused large cracks in the ground and serious damage to real estate in the city, which was backed up by a report by the Brazilian geological service in May. Braskem disputed this. Marcelo Arantes, the company’s vice-president for communications and sustainable development, told Reuters that the agreement does not mean the company is taking responsibility for all of the ground issues in the city. Andrade said the company is still working on technical analysis of all the wells it operates in the area in order to better understand the possible connection to areas where the ground has collapsed. The company has two years to relocate people and pay compensations, Andrade said, adding he believed there was only a “minimal” chance of the agreed costs increasing. When Braskem proposed to the National Mining Agency in November the steps it would take to close the Maceio salt wells, it estimated that around 400 buildings and 1,500 people would be affected, while the city of Maceio’s estimates were more than 9,600 properties and over 40,000 people. In Friday’s securities filing, Braskem also said the authorities accepted its request to free up 3.7 billion reais that had been frozen since June. Braskem’s preferred shares rose to 32.81 reais, the highest in five months, strongly outperforming the wider Bovespa index of leading Brazilian shares which spent most of Friday trading between 0.5% and 1% lower.

-22.309899569583926," Petrobras seeks swift sale of Braskem, smoother offshore auction process LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) said on Friday he wants to sell the company’s stake in petrochemical company Braskem SA within a year. At the London leg of an international investor roadshow, top Petrobras officials presented plans to sell tens of billions of dollars in assets to reduce a hefty debt load. However, creditors of corruption-ensnared construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA, which also has a large stake in Braskem, are in advanced talks to delay the sale of the crown jewel asset for another two to three years, Reuters reported on Monday. “It’s a very long period of time to sell a company,” Petrobas CEO Roberto Castello Branco said during the meeting with investors in London. “We understood this as a signal of someone who at the end of the day doesn’t want to sell anything.” Branco also said that the process by which Brazil offers offshore oil blocks must be refined, with the current bidding system allowing Petrobas a privileged position. Last month, no major global oil firms committed to participate in an auction for the blocks in a major blow to the South American exporter’s ambitions to develop the sector. “It’s very important to have a significant change...toward the adoption of a more pro-market (regulatory) regime, eliminating all the complexities which at the end of the day reduce the attractiveness of Brazil,” Branco said. Asked if the firm would make a pledge similar to that from Spain’s Repsol to slash net carbon emissions to zero by the middle of the century, Branco told reporters: “It’s too early ... each company has its own views”. Petrobras’ refining and natural gas chief Anelise Lara said the company had completed a feasibility study with China’s CNPC over refining operations in Rio de Janeiro. She added that Petrobras was also looking to reduce the amount of gas it imports via a Bolivia-Brazil pipeline from a contracted 30 million cubic meters per day to 15 million following discussions with Brazil’s anti-trust regulator. Petrobras agreed a deal with the regulator earlier this year to foster competition in gas imports and encourage new participants in the market."

On Monday, Reuters reported that creditors of corruption-ensnared construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA, which also has a large stake in Braskem, were in advanced talks to delay a sale for up to two years. “To me, it means they do not want to sell anything,” CEO Roberto Castello Branco said during a meeting with investors in London."
-14.896755162241899," Brazil's Petrobras says it may divest billions more than forecast NEW YORK/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras could add several billion dollars of assets to its already ambitious five-year divestment plan, executives said on Wednesday, underlining the state-run oil company’s rush to reduce its hefty debt load. In the company’s 2020 to 2024 business plan released last week, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said it would look to sell $20 billion to $30 billion of assets during that period, including eight refineries spread around Brazil. In a separate Wednesday presentation, released during Petrobras’ New York Investors’ Day, the company said it may add its Bolivian assets to the divestment program, as well as its stake in petrochemical firm Braskem SA, legacy deepwater oilfields and its remaining stake in fuel distribution firm, Petrobras Distribuidora SA, commonly known as BR Distribuidora. Talking to analysts and journalists, executives said they may sell parts of the Marlim oilfield, one of Brazil’s largest, as well as its majority stake in the smaller Papa-Terra field. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco estimated a piece of Marlim could fetch around $2 billion to $4 billion, while Chief Financial Officer Andrea Almeida said the potential sale of its BR Distribuidora stake could bring in $2 billion to $3 billion. Petrobras has already failed previously, though, to sell its Braskem stake independently from controlling shareholder Odebrecht, but was not successful. Odebrecht and its creditor banks plan to keep the Braskem stake for at least more two years, Reuters reported earlier this week. “The extra assets that are not included in the plan are BR Distribuidora, Braskem and other (exploration and production) assets,” Almeida told journalists. “It adds to the $20 to $30 billion plan” The comments indicate Petrobras is still laser-focused on selling off assets in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on Brazil’s deepwater “pre-salt” area, a geological formation where billions of barrels of oil are trapped underneath a layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. In the presentation, Petrobras estimated it would boost its equity value by roughly 45% by 2021. Capital expenditure from 2020 to 2024 will be concentrated in the pre-salt, with a special emphasis on its Buzios field, the company said. Some 59% of $75 billion in forecast capital expenditure over the next five years will be geared toward the pre-salt formation. Around a quarter of total capital expenditure will go to Buzios, considered one of the world’s most promising oilfields. Petrobras also said it sees some $1 billion in “potential gains” in 2020 versus 2018 via increased sales of bunker fuel, which is generally used to power ships. International regulators are lowering the maximum allowed sulfur content in bunker fuel, which is seen as favorable for Brazil, as the nation’s crude is naturally low in sulfur. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras closed up 1.6% on Wednesday."
-7.105459985041132," Exclusive: Brazil's Odebrecht in talks to stave off Braskem sale, keep payout - sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Creditors of Brazil's Odebrecht SA are in advanced talks to let the corruption-ensnared conglomerate keep its crown jewel asset, listed petrochemical company Braskem SA BRKM5.SA, for another two years, retreating from their prior demand for a quick sale, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. In a further victory for Odebrecht, which is trying to restructure 51 billion reais ($12.2 billion) in debt, its bank creditors will let it keep receiving most of Braskem’s dividends - now virtually Odebrecht’s sole revenue source - during that period. The engineering and construction company, implicated in a series of graft scandals across Latin America, will submit its debt proposal to a creditors’ meeting on Wednesday, but representatives of creditors whose debt is secured by Braskem shares have informally agreed to it, the sources added, asking for anonymity to disclose private talks. Still, a final decision depends on approval by the banks’ internal loan committees, the sources added. Odebrecht and the bank creditors did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Under Odebrecht’s proposal, none of its outstanding debt would be repaid during a 24-month period during which the banks would also concede nearly 80% of Braskem’s dividends to Odebrecht, the sources said. After that period, banks could potentially agree on extending the standstill period for another 12 months. For its part, Odebrecht would be required to give up any questioning in Justice of the right of banks to take possession or sell shares in Braskem, the group’s crown jewel. Earlier this year, Odebrecht argued in bankruptcy court the Braskem stake was an essential asset that could not be sold. Although the plan falls short of banks’ expectations, it is a temporary solution to avoid a fire-sale of Braskem. Loans from leading banks such as Banco do Brasil, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA and development bank BNDES are secured by Braskem shares. If the banks sold Odebrecht’s stake in Braskem at current market prices, it would barely cover the group’s 12.6 billion reais in debt with these creditors. Shares in Braskem are down more than 38% this year. The petrochemical company may have to pay for relocation of thousands of people in the northeastern Brazilian city of Maceio due to environmental damage caused by its mining activities near the city. It is unclear yet how much it will cost the company. LyondellBasell Industries LYB.N broke off talks to acquire Braskem last June. On Monday, Odebrecht’s lawyers were still analyzing a decision by an appeal court in a request by state-owned lender Caixa Economica Federal requiring that creditors vote on the consolidation of debts of more than 20 companies controlled by the conglomerate. It was not clear how it may impact the group’s restructuring plan."
7.265917602996259," Ex-CEO of Brazil's Braskem arrested on U.S. corruption charges NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former chief executive of Brazilian petrochemical company Braskem SA BRKM5.SA was arrested on Wednesday in New York on charges that he took part in a scheme to pay millions of dollars in bribes to officials to secure government contracts. Jose Carlos Grubisich was charged with conspiracy to violate a U.S. foreign corruption law and with a money laundering conspiracy in a newly unsealed indictment in federal court in Brooklyn. Grubisich was arrested Wednesday morning at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport and entered a plea of not guilty in federal court in the afternoon, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for the office of U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue. A hearing on whether Grubisich will be released on bail is expected at a later date, but has not yet been set. Grubisich’s lawyer, Daniel Stein of the firm Mayer Brown, could not be reached immediately for comment. The prosecutors said in a court filing that Grubisich should not be released on bail because he poses a high risk of fleeing the country. Grubisich led Braskem from about 2002 to 2008 and went on to hold various positions with its affiliated construction company Odebrecht SA. He later became CEO of pulp maker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA, which he left in 2017. In the indictment, prosecutors said Grubisich and other Braskem and Odebrecht employees took part in a conspiracy to divert about $250 million into a secret slush fund, which was used in part to bribe officials. The scheme ran from about 2002 to 2014, according to the indictment. As CEO of Braskem, Grubisich helped cover up the scheme by falsifying the company’s books and signing false certifications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, prosecutors said. Braskem and Odebrecht agreed in 2016 to pay a combined $3.5 billion in a settlement with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities to resolve bribery allegations. The U.S. Justice Department said at the time that about $2.6 billion would come from Odebrecht and $957 million from Braskem, and that most of the money would go to Brazil. Both companies pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal charges as part of the deal, which emerged from a three-year corruption investigation in Brazil dubbed “Operation Car Wash.” The investigation, which centered on payments made to state-owned oil company Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., known as Petrobras PETR4.SA, led to dozens of arrests and political upheaval in Brazil, contributing to the 2016 ouster of President Dilma Rousseff."
27.021276595744688," Petrobras floats exiting Braskem via share sale RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA is studying exiting its stake in Braskem SA BRKM5.SA via a share offering, an executive said on Friday, the latest in a series of proposals to separate itself from the petrochemical firm. Anelise Lara, head of Petrobras’ downstream division, divulged the potential share offering, which she said was being considered alongside more traditional M&A options, at a press conference after the company’s third quarter results. Petrobras, as the company is widely known, has long been trying to reduce its stake in Braskem as part of a wider push to sharpen its focus on offshore oil production. But its plans have hit a number of snags, as Braskem battles regulatory and legal issues. Under the possible plan, Lara said Braskem shares would be consolidated into one class. Those shares would then migrate to the Novo Mercado segment of the Sao Paulo stock exchange, which demands higher governance standards, but generally fetches a premium for its constituents. Petrobras, which holds a nearly 40% stake in the firm, would then unwind its stake in the company via a share offering, similar to Petrobras' privatization of fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA in July, Lara said. Preferred shares in Braskem jumped over 3%, but quickly erased most gains. Shares were down 0.14% in afternoon trade. Braskem did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday evening, Petrobras hit third-quarter margin estimates, and said production costs in a key oil-producing zone known as the “pre-salt” had fallen 20% compared to the previous quarter to $5.03 per barrel. Later, in a call with analysts, Exploration and Production Director Carlos Alberto de Oliveira said costs at the coveted Buzios field could fall to less than $4 per barrel. He added, however, that costs could be slightly higher next quarter thanks to the ramp-up of the P-70 platform and other one-off factors, likely bringing costs back near $6 per barrel. Still, analysts were encouraged by the cost savings and overall financial results. Analysts at Banco BTG Pactual SA BPAC3.SA called the production cost figures ""impressive,"" adding that the firm's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization beat their estimates by 13%. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras were up 3.7% in afternoon trade, after jumping 4% earlier in the day, their biggest intraday gain in over a month."

Latin America’s biggest petrochemical company on Wednesday reported net income of 129 million reais ($32.5 million), down 76% from a year ago despite good results in Brazil and the United States. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of cash generation known as EBITDA, declined 49% to 1.61 billion reais ($405.7 million). The company said in a securities filing that its U.S. petrochemical plants performed better and it enjoyed higher sales of chemicals in the Brazilian market, while spreads for chemicals remained high internationally. Braskem is jointly owned by Brazilian engineering and construction conglomerate Odebrecht and state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, better known as Petrobras. Braskem had about 3.8 billion reais frozen by a Brazilian court to cover potential compensation for damages to the environment and buildings caused by its mining activities near Maceió, the capital of Alagoas, where it produces raw material for making PVC. Braskem said the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has scheduled for Oct. 17 a hearing related to the company’s appeal against the decision to suspend trading and start delisting its American depositary receipts, a way foreign companies can list on U.S. exchanges, after failing to file an annual form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The new injunction, granted on Wednesday in favor of Brazil's largest lender, Itau Unibanco Holding SA ITUB4.SA, overturns a ruling banning any sale or possession of Braskem shares by banks. State-controlled lender Banco do Brasil has filed a similar request. Odebrecht filed for bankruptcy protection in June, aiming to restructure 51 billion reais ($13.57 billion) of debt, in what would be one of Latin America’s largest-ever in-court debt restructurings, after the group was caught in a sweeping political corruption investigation. In its bankruptcy filing, Odebrecht asked the judge to bar banks from taking possession of shares in the group’s crown jewel, its controlling stake in Braskem, pledged as collateral to creditors. Odebrecht has a 38.3% stake in Braskem, but 50.1% of its voting shares. The conglomerate said Braskem would be essential to its restructuring, as it was Odebrecht’s main source of revenues in 2018. In his decision, Judge Alexandre Lazzarini said that Braskem shares had been pledged as collateral to loans through a lien, and therefore cannot be considered as Odebrecht’s assets. Still, he also said this stake is “essential” to the group. If Lazzarini’s decision is upheld, banks would be allowed to sell Braskem shares immediately if they want to. A source close to Odebrecht said the group expects to file an appeal next week. Itau did not immediately comment on the matter. Odebrecht declined to comment."

In the lawsuit, the state asks a local court to block any attempt from Braskem’s controlling shareholder, the Odebrecht conglomerate, to spin off the business based in Alagoas to facilitate a possible deal to sell the petrochemical company. Odebrecht, which is struggling to restructuring its 80 billion reais ($20.63 billion) in debt, had plans to sell a controlling stake in Braskem. Local newspaper O Globo said this week that the construction group could separate the business in Alagoas as a way to facilitate a deal. The Alagoas government says Braskem’s mining activities in the state have caused hundreds of residences and commercial buildings in three villages to present cracks. State prosecutors gave the lawsuit a value of 30 billion reais. “Braskem cannot be sold in parts. They cannot spin off the Alagoas part and let it be the sole party responsible to compensate families and the state for the damage caused,” Alagoas’ governor, Renan Filho, said in a statement.

The three people requested anonymity to disclose private discussions. The conglomerate was counting on Braskem dividends to service its debt. But a court order in April related to environmental damages by the petrochemical company’s operation’s in the Brazilian northeastern state of Alagoas froze dividend payments. LyondellBasell said on Tuesday it ended talks with Odebrecht SA to buy Braskem “after careful consideration” but did not elaborate further. Shares in the Brazilian petrochemical producer were down 17% in late afternoon trading in Sao Paulo. A deal to sell its stake in Braskem could also have provided a cash windfall to the conglomerate. In a statement, the conglomerate said a bankruptcy protection filing “is not Odebrecht’s goal.” A fourth source, familiar with Odebrecht’s strategy, said the conglomerate believes the Braskem deal failure will give an incentive to creditors to engage in a more organized way in a debt restructuring. After concluding the restructuring, the construction group would be able to organize a new process to sell its stake in Braskem. Odebrecht is Braskem’s controlling shareholder with a 38% stake and the majority of voting stock. Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA holds a 36% stake. Currently, Odebrecht has few streams of revenue. It relies on Braskem’s dividends, which are blocked, and asset sales. Some creditors, specially Brazilian state banks, that have avoided going to court to give Odebrecht time to restructure in recent years are not willing to wait longer. Odebrecht has been restructuring its debt with local banks for the last three years. Two of Odebrecht’s units are restructuring debt with creditors. Ethanol unit Atvos filed for bankruptcy protection last week and Odebrecht construction unit OEC is in talks with bondholders after defaulting earlier this year. The deal to sell Braskem to LyondellBasell, which had been in discussion for a year and a half, could have provided a windfall to creditors and to Odebrecht. Initially, the conglomerate wanted to trade its full stake in Braskem, which is now pledged as collateral to some Brazilian banks, for Lyondell shares. But pressured by creditors, Odebrecht agreed to trade part of its stake for cash to repay them. A year ago, Brazil’s two largest private banks, Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA, reached an agreement with Odebrecht to give it a joint loan of 2.6 billion reais in what was expected to give the group a two-year relief. At the same time, both banks improved collaterals to their debts. Currently, Odebrecht’s stake in Braskem is pledged entirely as collateral to some local banks. According to Brazilian bankruptcy law, its stake would have to be excluded from a bankruptcy protection proceeding. If the collateral is not challenged, Braskem will be owned by the local banks if Odebrecht files for bankruptcy. The debt finance also involved Banco do Brasil SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA and development bank BNDES, which agreed to changes to collateral but did not agree to extend new loans. Under the terms of the agreement, Odebrecht also used 100 million reais from the new loan to repay Banco do Brasil. In the last two years, Brazilian banks have been increasing provisions to tackle problems with struggling Odebrecht, but not all banks improved their collateral."

The sprawling corruption investigation known as Car Wash uncovered a web of political kickbacks and bribes involving overpriced engineering and construction firm contracts with state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras. Braskem said the agreement with Brazil’s comptroller general’s office and the government’s solicitor general covered the same facts that were the subject of a global settlement reached in 2016 with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Swiss Office of the Attorney General to resolve international charges involving payoffs to Petrobras. Braskem and engineering group Odebrecht, which jointly owns the petrochemical firm with Petrobras, pleaded guilty in 2016 in U.S. federal court to conspiring to violate a U.S. bribery law, and agreed to pay U.S., Swiss and Brazilian authorities $3.6 billion to settle the case, the largest penalty ever in a foreign bribery case. Following that settlement, a U.S. judge sentenced Braskem, Latin America’s biggest petrochemical company, to pay a $632.6 million criminal fine.

Trading of its Braskem's American depositary shares (ADS) has been suspended and holders can ask the Bank of New York Mellon to exchange each of their shares for two underlying preferred Class A shares, which are traded on the Brazilian Stock Exchange, the company said bit.ly/30jnQLI in a delayed filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The delayed SEC filing was one of the main hurdles to the completion of an $11 billion takeover of Braskem by LyondellBasell Industries NV, Reuters reported previously. Braskem Chief Financial Officer Pedro Freitas said earlier this month that the delays in the filing are related to an analysis of the effectiveness of his company’s internal controls. Braskem was caught up in a massive corruption scandal centering on its controlling shareholder, Odebrecht SA, and signed a global leniency accord with U.S., Swiss and Brazilian authorities in December 2016.

-22.276267942100546," UPDATE 1-Braskem looks at options for possible Alagoas mining stoppage -CEO (Adds context, details on the report, deal discussion with LyondellBasell) SAO PAULO, May 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian petrochemical company Braskem SA is preparing alternatives in the event the company is forced to stop its mining activities in the northeastern state of Alagoas, its chief executive officer said on Thursday. A report by the country’s Geological Service released on Wednesday blamed mining by Braskem in the city of Maceio for damages to local real estate. State prosecutors requested last month that 6.7 billion reais ($1.7 billion) of Braskem funds be frozen to pay for the damages. The matter is being considered by a Brazilian court. Braskem CEO Fernando Musa told journalists the company is reviewing the report and considering alternatives to mining in the region, which supplies raw material for the production of PVC. Preferred Braskem shares were down 4 percent in mid-morning trading in Sao Paulo, at 41.94 reais. The company’s first-quarter results, released on Wednesday, showed net income fell 2 percent over the same period a year ago to 1 billion reais. The environmental problems in Alagoas are one more hurdle to a deal that has been under discussion with LyondellBasell. The deal has been slowed by the delay in a SEC filing by Braskem, which Reuters reported in March. If the company does not file its 2017 20-F form next week, its shares may be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange"
