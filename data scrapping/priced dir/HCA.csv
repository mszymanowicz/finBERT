23.619546935286326," HCA sees higher COVID-19 hospitalizations in first half of 2021 (Reuters) - Hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc said on Tuesday it expects higher COVID-19 hospitalizations in the first half of the year as the United States battles to control a pandemic that has claimed nearly half a million lives domestically. The company, which beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit, recorded 56,000 COVID-19 inpatients, a 40% jump from the previous quarter. “We anticipate our COVID volume to be heavier in the first half of the year and then hopefully will decline in the second half, as broader segments of the population receive a vaccination,” said HCA Chief Financial Officer William Rutherford. The company’s profits took a hit last year when patients put off discretionary healthcare procedures due to the fear of contracting the novel coronavirus infection. Fewer admissions and weak demand for elective procedures, however, were nearly offset in the fourth quarter by revenue from more severe admissions requiring costlier care. “It appears that total volumes are down from baseline, but revenues up as COVID is likely at higher prices than some avoided services,” Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes said in a client note. Revenue per same-facility equivalent admission, a measure of sales per patient staying overnight at a hospital and those treated on an outpatient basis, rose 14.1% from a year earlier due to increases in acuity of patients treated. The ongoing increase in the acuity profile of the patients has a significant influence from COVID-19 hospitalizations and from sicker patients being treated in hospitals, whereas we see lower acuity individuals deferring hospital treatments for pursuing care in other settings, said Stephens analyst Scott Fidel. The company forecast 2021 revenues to be between $53.5 billion and $55.5 billion, while analysts on an average estimate $54.33 billion, according to Refinitiv data."

10.447651207783268," HCA Healthcare posts surprise profit as elective surgery demand improves (Reuters) - HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N reported a surprise quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the U.S. hospital operator saw a gradual pickup in demand for elective surgeries amid easing of coronavirus-led restrictions in some parts of the country. Shares of the industry bellwether rose nearly 10% in early trading, boosting rivals Tenet Healthcare THC.N, up 8.7%, and Community Health Systems CYH.N, which gained 4.5%. The company on Wednesday also recorded an $822 million government stimulus income related to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. HCA’s quarterly results were much stronger than feared across the board, despite the company recording a lower CARES benefit than modeled, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said. The largest for-profit U.S. hospital operator said patient volumes across most service lines gradually improved in May and June from April lows, as states began to reopen and allow for non-emergent procedures. Earlier this month, health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N and medical device maker Abbott Laboratories Inc ABT.N also confirmed that deferred elective care rebounded in May and had approached pre-crisis levels by June end. HCA’s adjusted earnings per share was $1.50, excluding government stimulus income of $1.73, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 39 cents. Revenue per same-facility equivalent admission, a measure of sales per patient who stays in the hospital overnight and those treated on an outpatients basis, rose 10% in the quarter, while same facility equivalent admissions declined 20.1%. Inpatient and outpatient surgeries fell 15.7% and 32.6%, respectively, on a same-facility basis.

3.6598099270496425," HCA Healthcare suspends dividend, buybacks as COVID-19 delays surgeries (Reuters) - Hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N on Tuesday pulled its 2020 forecast and suspended its dividend and share buyback program, as it prepares for a steep decline in patient visits and surgeries at its hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The largest for-profit U.S. hospital operator, with about 186 hospitals predominantly in Florida and Texas, has been treating thousands of coronavirus patients and is a recipient of a part of the government’s $100 billion in aid. But the crisis has halted lucrative elective procedures such as surgeries and kept many other patients at home as they wait out the crisis. Intensive respiratory treatments are less profitable for hospitals than elective procedures. Shares of the first big U.S. operator to report for the quarter ended March 31, fell 3.7%. HCA, on a conference call, said it has seen a 70% drop in outpatient surgeries at its hospitals in April so far, from the prior year period, while inpatient admissions declined 30%. HCA expects the impact to its business to be most pronounced during the current phase of the pandemic, after which it sees certain restrictions on procedures being lifted by the second half of the current quarter. “The recovery period is really difficult to determine at this point. We don’t know what the full effects and the damage to the economy are going to be,” Chief Financial Officer William Rutherford said on a conference call. The company had received a majority of $4 billion in accelerated Medicare payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, signed by President Donald Trump last month. It had also received $700 million of funds distributed to hospitals from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency fund, HCA executives said on call. Rival Tenet Healthcare Corp THC.N put about 10% of its workforce on furlough, Reuters reported last week. “Impressively, HCA has not let go or furloughed any employees,” said Mizuho analyst Ann Haynes. In the first quarter, inpatient and outpatient surgeries declined 1.8% and 5.9% respectively, on a same-facility basis. Net income attributable to HCA fell to $581 million from $1.04 billion, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $2.33 per share, missing analysts’ estimates of $2.64 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

7.8458859605835425," Hospital operator HCA raises forecast on higher patient admissions (Reuters) - U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N raised its full-year earnings forecast as higher-than-expected patient admissions lifted second-quarter profit by 25 percent, sending its shares up 7 percent. The upbeat results and forecast, coming from the largest for-profit U.S. hospital operator, lifted shares across a sector that has been pressured by weak patient volumes amid rising out-of-pocket medical costs. HCA said same-facility equivalent admissions, which include patients who stay in the hospital overnight and those who are treated on an outpatient basis, rose 2.8 percent in the second quarter. This beat the consensus estimate of 1.5 percent, according to Evercore ISI. While patient volumes increased in the previous quarter as well, thanks to a particularly strong flu season, many analysts said that was a one-time benefit. “The fact that the trends are continuing without the flu benefit leads us to believe there is an underlying positive shift in demand,” Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes said. HCA's shares surged as much as 7.4 percent to $116.20. Tenet Healthcare THC.N rose 6 percent, while Community Health Systems CYH.N was up 2 percent. Revenue per same-facility equivalent admissions, another key metric, rose 3.6 percent, HCA said, topping expectations of a 3.1 percent rise. This could be due to increased advanced care required by patients admitted to HCA’s hospitals, Leerink analyst Ana Gupte wrote in a note. Net income attributable to HCA rose 24.8 percent to $820 million, or $2.31 per share, above analysts’ estimates of 2.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

33.87568697243089," Hospital operator HCA spends big to keep nurses on board NEW YORK (Reuters) - HCA Healthcare HCA.N is raising the stakes in a fiercely competitive labor market, pledging $300 million for employee benefits that are largely designed to attract nurses, company executives told Reuters. The nation’s largest publicly-traded hospital chain said in January that it would invest much of its windfall from a U.S. tax overhaul to offer tuition reimbursement, student loan repayment and extra family leave to all of its employees in the next three years. Company officials provided Reuters with new details on their spending plans, saying a top priority of the program is to keep nurses in its wards. The retention push is vital to HCA plans to grow in states like Florida and Texas, and comes as a worsening labor shortage forces U.S. hospitals collectively to spend billions of dollars more on nursing staff. A generation of Baby Boomer nurses are retiring, while younger staff can choose from many job opportunities outside hospitals that offer higher salaries and better hours. HCA and smaller rival Tenet Healthcare THC.N are particularly vulnerable in fast-growing Texas and Florida, where up to 40 percent of nurses will retire in the coming years, according to healthcare worker groups. Half of HCA's hospitals are located in those states and account for 48 percent of revenue. HCA faces stiff competition for these nurses, however. Reuters interviews with more than a dozen rival hospitals in those two states found that many already offer similar benefits to what HCA plans to introduce. “What we are trying to do is become the employer of choice,” Jane Englebright, HCA’s chief nursing executive, said in an interview. “Investing in nurses pays dividends in so many ways. This additional funding coming our way is allowing us to take this to a new level.” HCA has already worked to reduce use of more expensive contract nurses and rates of nurse turnover, which hit 22 percent in 2016 and is now closer to 17 percent. But some Wall Street analysts worry HCA will face rising costs as the labor shortage intensifies in the next three to four years. “Are they going to start offering more, and will that hit their margins?” said Michael Newshel, healthcare analyst at Evercore ISI. HCA is viewed as one of the strongest for-profit hospital operator in the country. Seeking new growth, the company plans to spend $10.5 billion in the next three years to expand and upgrade its facilities. Keeping them adequately staffed with nurses is key to that expansion. In January, as it devised the benefits plan, HCA surveyed millennial nurses, who account for almost half of its 87,000 nurses. Their answers on workplace priorities helped shape the benefits most likely to help nurses, such as reimbursing up to $5,250 in employee tuition annually and covering certifications for nursing specialties, such as surgery. Until now, such benefits had been offered in a limited number of HCA hospitals, to a small group of employees. For example, about 1,100 HCA nurses last year received specialty certification after passing the relevant exam. Englebright expects that number to triple now that HCA will cover study materials, exams and certification dues. Millennial nurses also requested additional training, equipment, advancement opportunities and a voice in the organization, Englebright said. One of HCA’s responses is to build 13 new centers to provide recent graduates with hands-on training. It currently has one such training center. Englebright said that other benefits and policies are meant to convince late-career nurses to delay retirement, such as paying college tuition for employees’ children and offering less physically demanding work in call centers. Many hospitals have offered some of these benefits for a while now. About half of nurses are offered educational funds, according to a survey conducted last summer by American Nurse Today, the journal of the American Nurses Association. Tenet offers tuition assistance and signing bonuses of $10,000 to $15,000 for experienced nurses in some locations, including Florida. One-time bonuses can be as high as $25,000 in places where competition is fiercest, such as California, the company said. In Texas, Baylor Scott & White, the largest not-for-profit hospital network in the state, has been focusing on the shortage for years, providing tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 to more than 2,000 nurses last year. Many organizations cap the tuition at $5,250, the maximum benefit before an employee would pay tax. A decade ago, Ashley Kent, 33, decided to work there as a patient assistant because of such benefits. The program allowed her to complete a nursing degree in 2014. Now a manager, Kent is scheduled to graduate in May with a masters degree, which the hospital also helped pay for. “I didn’t have parents who could help support me through college,” said Kent. “I knew I was paying for it myself out of pocket.”"
29.934551785933074," HCA Healthcare results beat on high-margin patient admissions (Reuters) - U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N posted quarterly profit and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, as it earned more from the admission of patients needing advanced care to its hospitals. These patients helped drive a 3.9 percent rise in revenue per equivalent admission, which was well above analysts’ estimates of 2.5 percent, according to Evercore ISI. “A piece of that (revenue per equivalent admission) is pricing, part of it is coming from mix in the type of patients that we’re getting,” HCA President Samuel Hazen said, adding that more commercial insurers were also using the company’s services. Commercially insured patients are more lucrative to hospital operators than those who use government insurance. The company, the largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, said the flu season in the United States added about 29 percent to its overall patient admissions, and about 50 percent to its overall emergency room visits. Smaller rival Tenet Healthcare Corp THC.N posted a surprise profit on Monday, partly helped by growth in urgent care visits due to the flu season. Net income attributable to HCA rose 73.6 percent to $1.14 billion, or $3.18 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31. Excluding items, the company earned $2.33 per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $2.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
