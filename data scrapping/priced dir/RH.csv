-51.32255318762573," Left's Citron hedge fund posts 43% gain in first year BOSTON (Reuters) - Andrew Left, who has long targeted companies that he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors on Monday that his new hedge fund returned 43% after fees in 2019, its first year in business. Left also made a prediction that home furnishing company RH, one of his winners last year, may make a tempting takeover target for someone. “In 2019, our first full year of operation, Citron Capital, LP (“Fund”) generated a gross return of 56.4% and net return of 43.3%,” Left wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. While the fund bet that certain stocks would climb, Left also bet that certain ones would drop, writing “the Fund’s average exposure during 2019 was 75.8% long and 80.3% short.” Left said that winners on the long side included Bausch Health BHC.TO, RH RH.N, and Snap SNAP.N and on the short side included Ligand Pharmaceuticals LGND.O, Jumia Technologies 4JMAy.F, and Grand Canyon Education LOPE.O. After investing only his own wealth for roughly two decades,Left in 2018 began laying the groundwork for Citron Capital, his hedge fund. By raising outside capital, Left has more firepower to go after some of the biggest U.S. companies. Citron has not disclosed the size of its hedge fund. For this year, Left said RH, whose stock price closed at $212.77 on Monday, may be bought. “We believe the company has matured to a point that we might see it acquired in 2020.” He also said he is sticking by his bet that shares in Peloton Interactive, whose stock closed at $29.75 on Monday, will fall. “Citron put a one-year price target of $5 and we stand by it as $5 makes this still a $1.5 billion company.” Neither RH nor Peloton responded immediately to emails seeking comment. Left also gave investors lessons that he learned last year; reminding himself and others to stay away from what he calls “big story ‘cult stock’” companies and sticking with what he does best: exposing fraud. He also said that this year will be a year of growth and that he is looking to expand beyond his home base in Los Angeles."

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the world’s two largest economies were getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing about ending a 16-month trade war. On Friday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there would be a call between U.S. and Chinese officials later in the day as both sides continue to hammer out a phase one trade pact, but added U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could still start Dec. 15. “We have been here so many times where the market gets its hopes up and then it gets crushed,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “But certainly with an election coming up next year, you would want to have all these things behind you, so a mini-deal or a trade truce makes a lot of sense.” Shares in chip gear maker Applied Materials Inc jumped 6.6% in premarket trading after it forecast first-quarter results above estimates, as it expects more clients to upgrade their equipment ahead of the 5G rollout in key markets. Chipmakers have been among the victims of a long-running trade war between Washington and Beijing, as they rely on China for a huge portion of their revenue. However, signs of progress on trade have helped drive the Philadelphia Semiconductor index to record levels.

Shares in J.C. Penney Co Inc soared 10% on Friday after the embattled retailer reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, benefiting from lower advertising expenses and an increase in margins. Data showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season. Another set of data expected at 9:15 a.m. ET is likely to show industrial production declined in October. Wall Street’s main indexes have been powered recently by hopes of a trade deal, a largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings season and a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the world’s two largest economies were getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing about ending a 16-month trade war. Kudlow’s comments eased nerves after reports that talks had hit a snag over how and when to reduce tariffs, and what level of agricultural purchases could be expected from China as well as statements by President Donald Trump saying he could impose new tariffs on China if no deal was reached.

26.375546100835436," Buffett's Berkshire invests in Restoration Hardware, whose shares rise (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N on Thursday disclosed a new investment in RH RH.N, boosting shares of the luxury furniture and home furnishings chain once known as Restoration Hardware. Berkshire owned about 1.21 million RH shares worth $206.3 million as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stocks as of that date. RH shares rose 6.7% in after-hours trading following the disclosure, after closing up 1.3% at $175.22. The Corte Madera, California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Analysts have said RH has boosted sales and profit margins, in part by expanding its membership program and improving the experience for shoppers in its roughly 70 galleries, though it remains exposed to downturns in the high-end housing market. RH’s share price has more than doubled since the end of May. Berkshire also said it owned 7.47 million common shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N on Sept. 30, less than two months after purchasing $10 billion of preferred stock to help that company buy rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire announces new or increased stakes, reflecting investors’ regard for Buffett and the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he has run since 1965. Investors monitor Berkshire’s quarterly filings for signs on where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value. Thursday's filing includes investments by all three but does not say who bought and sold what. Combs and Weschler normally make smaller investments, while Buffett directs big investments such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Bank of America Corp BAC.N. The filing reflected Berkshire’s, and Buffett’s, inability to deploy the conglomerate’s cash hoard, whether through acquisitions or equity investments, as U.S. stock indices traded near or set record highs. Berkshire has more than 90 units including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and namesake energy, real estate brokerage and auto dealer businesses. But it ended September with $128.2 billion of cash and equivalents, 6.4 times the minimum $20 billion that Buffett has said Berkshire needs. Berkshire also reported lower holdings of Apple, oil refiner Phillips 66 PSX.N, broadcaster Sirius XM Holdings Inc SIRI.O and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N as of Sept. 30 compared with three months earlier."

44.49275419029613," Factbox: U.S. companies warn on Trump's tariffs (Reuters) - A host of U.S. consumer companies have warned that costs related to tariffs on goods imported from China will hit their profits. The United States increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% in May. President Donald Trump has also threatened an additional round of tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods that would cover nearly everything imported from China to the United States. BEST BUY CO INC: “The impact of tariffs at 25% (proposed to be enacted) will result in price increases and will be felt by U.S. consumers,” CEO Hubert Joly said. HOME DEPOT INC: If the latest round of tariffs hold, it would increase annual cost of goods sold by $1 billion, on top of a $1 billion hit that the home improvement chain has taken from tariffs imposed in 2018. The impact from new tariffs would still be manageable as it would make up less than 1% of total sales, said Edward Decker, executive vice president of merchandising. J.C. PENNEY CO INC: “We do anticipate a more meaningful impact on both our private and national brands if the potential fourth tranche of tariffs does go into effect,” CEO Jill Soltau said. KOHL’S CORP: Tariffs will primarily hit China-sourced merchandise in home and accessories business but apparel and footwear are not impacted at this point. The department store chain said about 20% of its merchandise is sourced from China. WALMART INC: “Higher tariffs will lead to higher prices for customers,” CFO Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview last week. He said the company, known for lower prices, will try to minimize the effect of the levies on the company and its customers. MACY’S INC: “The increase of the third tranche from 10% to 25% on May 10 does have some impact, particularly on our furniture business. However, the team anticipates that this can be mitigated,” CEO Jeffrey Gennette told investors on a conference call on Wednesday. “It’s too early to comment on what we think that’s going to mean in terms of potential price increases and what categories are going to be more affected than others,” he said. RALPH LAUREN CORP: “The tariffs enacted to date have a limited impact on our business, but our teams are prepared for multiple scenarios and have accelerated the diversification of our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of any potential tariff outcomes,” CFO Jane Nielsen told investors on a conference call last week. CROCS INC: Footwear maker estimates an impact of about $5 million in 2019 assuming a 25% tariff takes effect. Co also expects the amount of U.S. product sourced from China to be below 10% for 2020, it now imports about 30%. “Our current sourcing mix reflects our need to balance ramping up incremental supply to meet the growing demand for our product and continuing our multi-year effort to reduce our sourcing from China,” The company said in a statement. DEL MONTE FOODS INC: “It’s not just tariffs. Transportation costs are up, labor costs are up,” CEO Greg Longstreet told Reuters at a conference in New York last week. “It’s an inflationary environment. A lot of that’s going to have to be passed on. The consumer is going to have to pay more for a lot of critical goods.” Del Monte has already raised prices on many products, including mandarin oranges that it imports from China, and will do so again with tariffs rising, he said. RH: The home furnishing retailer said it selectively increased prices of its products, while moving certain production and development of new products out of China and expanding manufacturing facilities in the United States to offset the impact of tariffs. OXFORD INDUSTRIES INC: Tommy Bahama-owner said it plans to hike prices selectively. The company is also negotiating on price reductions with factories and shifting production out of China, besides accelerating the delivery of its Fall products. AT HOME GROUP INC: The home decor retail chain said it would not raise retail prices to offset the 25% tariff on goods like furniture, resulting in an increase in costs that would dent the company’s profit margins this year. “With tariffs now raised to 25%, we have an even sharper focus on collaborating with our product partners to mitigate cost,” CEO Lewis Bird said. CALERES INC: “We are actively working through contingency plans, which includes potentially shifting additional production out of China, working with our factory partners to reduce costs and exploring price increases,” CEO Diane Sullivan said. “While we are trading these issues with the same sense of urgency we’re applying across our entire business, we are taking nothing for granted.” AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS INC: “If tariffs are expanded to apparel, there would be an adverse effect on our financial results,” CFO Robert Madore said. Madore said the company was working with its sourcing partners to “significantly” mitigate any potential impact from additional tariffs. DOLLAR GENERAL CORP: The company said it expects increased tariffs to lead to higher prices even though it was working with vendors to mitigate the impact. HUDSON’S BAY CO: The Canadian department store operator, which operates over a hundred stores in the United States, said it expects to use aggressive inventory and supply chain management to offset a potential further round of American tariffs on Chinese goods. WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES INC: The motorhome maker said it expected “double digits of millions of dollars or more than that of the previous tariffs combined” impact on fiscal 2020 costs from the latest tariffs and proposed duties. La-Z-Boy Inc: The American furnishing retailer said a further rise in U.S. tariffs would lead to higher raw material costs in fiscal 2020 and may likely force it to raise prices. The company said China accounts for almost all of its leather cut-and-sewn sets and fabrics and 25% of its casegoods (wood furniture) products."
48.15997929924017," Furniture retailer La-Z-Boy says more U.S. tariffs may lead to price hikes (Reuters) - American furnishing retailer La-Z-Boy Inc said on Tuesday a further rise in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would lead to higher raw material costs in fiscal 2020 and may likely force it to raise product prices. The United States has threatened tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, after hiking levies on $200 billion worth of imports last month, including on furniture. The company, whose shares fell 9% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly sales, said it currently gets almost all of its leather cut-and-sewn sets and fabrics as well as 25% of its casegoods (wood furniture) products from China. “We expect that certain raw materials and parts may be subject to higher duties and tariffs in fiscal 2020,” the company said in a regulatory filing, adding that it was working to shift sourcing out of China. “In response to these increases, we may increase our selling prices to our customers or assess a material or duty surcharge during periods...” La-Z-Boy’s sales in the fourth quarter rose 8% to $453.8 million, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $456.8 million, mainly due to weaker demand in its wholesale upholstery and casegoods segments. “With the hangover of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty, it is unclear if these business conditions will continue further into our fiscal 2020,” Chief Executive Officer Kurt Darrow said in a statement. Last week, home furnishing retailer RH unveiled steps to offset the impact of tariffs, including selective price hikes and moving certain productions out of China."
57.97470537804731," Wall St. climbs as oil jumps after Gulf tanker attacks NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after two days of declines, as energy shares rebounded with oil on concerns of a supply disruption following attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States has assessed that Iran is responsible for the attacks, which occurred near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil consumption passes. Oil futures settled more than 2% higher, while the S&P 500 energy index gained 1.3%, the most of the 11 major sectors. “We’re meandering here with strength in the oil sector because that’s where the market-moving news is today,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. While the gains in energy shares helped the market, the tanker attacks added to potential worries for investors. “There are still concerns over geopolitical risk,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Stocks have had a strong run in June so far on hopes the Federal Reserve will act to counter a slowing global economy due to the escalating trade war with China. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up about 5% so far for the month. But caution ahead of the Fed meeting next week and the Group of 20 summit at the end of the month limited the day’s advance. Markets have been anticipating an interest rate cut at some point this year. “The market is waiting to hear from the Fed... and whether they will deviate at all from their latest stance - and I call it an active dovish position - and to see if they continue to lay the groundwork for a rate cut perhaps later in the summer,” Krosby said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 101.94 points, or 0.39%, to 26,106.77, the S&P 500 gained 11.8 points, or 0.41%, to 2,891.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.41 points, or 0.57%, to 7,837.13. Walt Disney Co shares gained 4.4%, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost, after Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for Disney Plus subscriber growth. On the trade front, there were doubts of any improvement in what President Donald Trump called “testy” trade relations with China in the run-up to the G20. Several companies including furniture chain RH cited the potential impact of higher tariffs on their businesses in reports after the bell Wednesday, though RH said it has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs and raised its outlook for the year. Twitter Inc shares fell 3.1% after brokerage Moffett Nathanson said it expects the social media company’s costs to rise and revenue growth to slow. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 64 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.99 billion shares, compared to the 6.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."

78.22741783356958," Retailers RH, Oxford Industries plan price hike to soften China tariff impact (Reuters) - Home furnishing retailer RH and apparel retailer Oxford Industries Inc revealed major steps, including shifting production out of China and raising prices, to cushion the impact of the tariff hike on Chinese goods. Shares of RH surged about 25%, while those of Oxford Industries rose 9% after both companies reported strong quarterly results. RH said it selectively increased prices of its products while moving certain production and development of new products out of China and expanding manufacturing facilities in the United States to offset the impact of tariffs. “Long term, we do not believe the current trade climate will impair our ability to achieve our stated financial goals,” RH Chief Executive Officer Gary Friedman said in a statement. Tommy Bahama-owner Oxford Industries, which reaffirmed its full-year outlook, said it plans to hike prices selectively, if proposed tariff hike on remaining Chinese imports are introduced. Oxford Industries is also negotiating on price reductions with factories and shifting production out of China, besides accelerating the delivery of its Fall products. Ever since the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in the wake of trade dispute between Washington and Beijing last year, retailers have been adopting various strategies to mitigate the impact. Retailers like Walmart Inc and Best Buy Co Inc had warned of higher prices after Washington dramatically escalated the trade war last month with threats of new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of U.S. imports from China after hiking levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Separately, mattress fabrics maker Culp Inc said on Wednesday the tariffs had caused “significant disruptions” throughout the furniture industry supply chain. Culp also noted that the expectation of additional tariffs led to advance customer purchases in its upholstery segment in previous quarters, resulting in higher inventories that partly hit its sales in the fourth quarter. Culp said it was taking steps to adjust its supply chain, including partnering with sources for cut and sew kits in Vietnam, in response to the latest round of tariffs."
78.22741783356958," Furnishing retailer RH hikes prices to offset China tariff, raises outlook June 12 (Reuters) - Home furnishing retailer RH said on Wednesday it selectively raised prices of its products to mitigate the impact of tariff hike on the goods from China. The company also reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its forecasts for the year, sending the company’s shares up 25% after the bell. Washington dramatically escalated its trade war with Beijing last month by hiking levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% and U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened new tariffs on remaining $300 billion worth of U.S. imports from China.

-40.512719236487825," Retail stocks set to bypass tariff woes but face aftershock risk NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. retail and consumer goods companies appear set to emerge largely unscathed from the trade dispute between the United States and China. But the conflict could leave behind negative effects on the supply chains of some companies in the industry, which could narrow their profit margins and eventually weigh on their stock prices. The current U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports were scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent if a trade deal were not reached by March 1. Last week U.S. President Donald Trump announced an extension of that deadline, and the United States and China have reportedly moved close to a deal that would roll back the tariffs altogether. Only certain categories of consumer goods, such as furniture and accessories like handbags and luggage, are subject to the 10 percent tariffs. Apparel and footwear, for now, are excluded. So far this year, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index, which includes shares of retail and consumer goods companies as well as restaurants and leisure companies, has reflected optimism on trade as data have pointed to the overall strength of the U.S. economy. The index has risen 11.2 percent, slightly ahead of the 10.6 percent rise for the S&P 500 as a whole. “Companies continue to do well from a (consumer) discretionary perspective,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “Once President Trump said he was extending the deadline for the tariff jump, the overhang over the market was lifted.” A significant portion of U.S. consumer goods, including 72 percent of footwear and 84 percent of accessories, originate from China, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Yet companies have made preparations to blunt the effects of current and possible future tariffs. In conference calls, companies including footwear maker Steven Madden Ltd, furniture retailer RH and Rubbermaid housewares maker Newell Brands have said they have offset cost increases by moving some manufacturing to other countries or negotiating discounts for their production in China. “Companies have been incorporating tariffs in their guidance for a year,” said Charles East, equity strategy analyst at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, who covers retailers. “It’s a known quantity.” Yet even with a rollback of tariffs, lingering effects on the production, shipment and storage of goods could eventually weigh on consumer stocks. Retailers have ramped up shipments of imported items in anticipation of potential increases in U.S. tariffs. According to the National Retail Federation, major U.S. ports handled 1.97 million containers in December, a 13.9 percent year-over-year increase. For the first half of 2019, U.S. ports are forecast to handle 10.7 million containers, a 4.1 percent increase from the first half of 2018. The advance shipments could lead to an uptick in warehousing costs, cutting into companies’ profit margins, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation in Washington. If retail sales were to soften, retailers could be stuck with excess inventory. Data from the U.S. Commerce Department for December showed retail sales posting their biggest drop in more than nine years and warehouse inventories increasing by the most in more than five years. Department stores such as Macy’s Inc have already been grappling with inventory issues, said Simeon Siegel, senior equity analyst at Nomura Instinet in New York. Macy’s shares plunged 17.7 percent on Jan. 10 when the retailer cut its fiscal 2018 forecast and have not recovered those losses despite rising last week after the company announced a restructuring. In its earnings conference call last Wednesday, TJX Companies Inc hinted at the potential for an uptick in discounted goods, saying that disruptions resulting from changes in shipments and production could lead to opportunities for the company. The shift in production away from China could also lead to price increases as demand grows for factories in countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, said Rick Helfenbein, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association in Washington. In December, Calvin Klein parent company PVH Corp warned of such an adverse impact during an earnings conference call. “When you get that bump, factories will raise the prices,” Helfenbein said. “It’s going to happen throughout the supply chain.” Likewise, shoe company Crocs Inc stated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday that “it may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.” Such risks could catch equity investors off guard, market watchers said, given the sanguine outlook on trade. “They’ve priced in a trade deal,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. “All the risks are to the downside now.”"
-28.10287297467347," Trade war puts new strains on America Inc's factories in China SHENZHEN, China/SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Larry Sloven arrived in southern China three decades ago, just as the region was taking off as the low-cost manufacturing center of the world. Since then, he has exported millions of dollars of goods, ranging from power tools to LED lights, to some of America’s biggest retailers. That era may now be coming to an end. For years, Sloven has seen profits whittled away by rising costs, tighter regulations and Chinese government policies aimed at building a more sustainable and services-oriented economy that have squeezed lower-end manufacturers. But the final straw may be the prospect of tariffs stemming from a trade war between the United States and China, and a world of more protectionism. “It’s been step, by step, by step. And it’s been getting more and more expensive to produce products in China,” said Sloven, president of Capstone International HK Ltd, a division of Capstone Companies, from Deerfield Beach, Florida, a maker of consumer electronics goods. Manufacturers have been feeling the squeeze as China shifts its priorities from lower-end manufacturing to high technology industries as part of a broader bid to upgrade its economy. But with tariffs looming, “everybody finally woke up to the extent that ‘maybe I should face reality’,” he said. Manufacturers were increasingly worried that “the next group of tariffs would be the killer”. Sloven is now stepping up efforts to trim his exposure to China, diversifying into growing manufacturing centers like Thailand. “Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia are countries that have potential opportunities,” he said. “However, it’s not going to be as easy as many may think. And you don’t know what’s coming next in China.” Interviews with over a dozen manufacturers from medical device makers to agricultural equipment firms illustrate how companies exporting to the United States are now rethinking their calculations about making goods in China. “Before the tariffs came on board, we were looking to move about 30 percent of our production from China to the United States,” said Charles M. Hubbs, European director at Premier Guard, a medical products manufacturer, citing reasons such as rising wages, a shrinking workforce and soaring costs. “With the latest tariff development, assuming those tariffs will go into effect, we’ll probably be moving about 60 percent of our manufacturing out of China to the United States.” Other companies are closely reviewing their options. “In the current tariff environment, it’s only natural for companies like ours and others to be internally reassessing the impact and taking steps to mitigate that,” said a senior China-based executive with a major U.S. manufacturer. Moves could include “limiting additional sourcing from China, shifting sourcing to other countries, or bringing work back to the United States”. Mid-level officials from the two countries are set to hold trade talks this week in Washington, although the gap between the two sides over U.S. demands for greater market access remains wide. The escalating tit-for-tat trade war between the United States and China, with President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese-made goods, could have huge implications for heavily integrated and globalized supply chains. For some, the impact has been obvious and direct. Georgia-based AGCO Corp AGCO.N told the United States Trade Representative that tariffs would make the farm equipment it makes in Changzhou, a city in China's Jiangsu province, ""price uncompetitive"" in the United States. Maroon Group, a chemical maker from North America, said it would be ""priced out of the market"", a concern echoed by Goodman Global, a unit of Japan's Daikin Industries 6367.T that assembles air conditioners in Houston from Chinese-made parts. Some firms have already made their moves. The furniture makers At Home Group Inc HOME.N and RH RH.N have said they will cut back production in China. Others are trying to adjust supply chains. DSM China Ltd, part of the Dutch nutrition firm Royal DSM, is looking to replace U.S. soybeans with new ingredients such as pea powder it can source locally to avoid Beijing’s retaliatory import duties. Rising risk from the trade tensions “gave us good impetus to check out how we look at the whole business”, said Bernard Cheung, director of global strategic marketing at DSM China. For some, the response has been dictated by where they sit in the supply chain. U.S.-based GMM Nonstick Coatings has moved some production to India after a 30-40 percent drop-off in China orders for advanced chemicals used to coat American household kitchenware brands such as George Foreman and Baker’s Secret as those clients move some production out of China. “This tariff thing is adding extra friction to being in China and it’s making the decision” to shift production “quite easy for U.S. sourcing departments,” said Ravin Gandhi, GMM’s chief executive. There are still plenty of manufacturers staying in China for now, especially those targeting the huge domestic or regional market, Gandhi said. China still has the best infrastructure, supply chain networks and engineering talent, a major hurdle for potential rivals seeking to lure firms away with lower costs, according executives interviewed by Reuters. In terms of scale, China cannot be easily replaced: it has a manufacturing output of around $2 trillion, according to a Brookings Institution report in July, the world’s largest. Bird, a Santa Monica, California-based scooter start-up, wrote in a submission to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in June that it was “unaware of any U.S. producer of electric scooters that can manufacture to Bird’s scale and needs”. Keith Siilats, the head of Bytelogics, another U.S.-based scooter start-up that manufactures in China, said it was hard to shift production from China. Instead, he expects to absorb the higher costs for the moment and plans to develop European operations less vulnerable to tariff pressure. China’s manufacturing sector will not vanish overnight, but a shift is inevitable, said Dan Krassenstein, Shanghai-based director of Asia operations at ProconPacific, which makes around 3 million specialized industrial shipment bags. He said manufacturing was moving to South Asia and Southeast Asia in search of cheaper labor costs and as Beijing discourages polluting, lower-margin sectors. The tariff escalation “is just going to accelerate it”, he said. Five years ago his company made all its products in China. Now, a quarter are made in India and 5-10 percent in Vietnam. In Southern China’s Pearl River Delta, the cost of renting industrial and commercial space has surged around 80 percent in the past eight years, while companies have complained of soaring labor costs. “Production costs are cheaper in the U.S. than in China,” said Yuan Juyou, deputy head of marketing at Wonderful Group, a ceramics maker. “Even though labor costs are more expensive, we have automated a lot of processes. Plus electricity, land, these kinds of costs are cheaper than China.” Wonderful, a unit of the Chinese manufacturer Marco Polo, began shipping products from its new factory in Tennessee in June. Regional rivals are also starting to sense an opportunity to step up and into China’s competitive space. Thailand is actively promoting itself as a regional manufacturing hub, offering incentives such as an exemption of up to eight years on corporate income tax for certain industries and exemptions on import duties for some raw materials. The country’s corporate income tax rate of 20 percent also ranks it as the second-lowest among countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to Thailand’s Board of Investment. Thailand is already a major center for some electronics and components, and the government plans a series of industrial zones to push development of target industries. A China-ASEAN free trade deal also helps mitigate the trade-war risk for companies trading with both the United States and China. “The Thai government is making it very easy now to move down there,” said Sloven. “The Chinese government embraced manufacturing back in the day. But now, they’re not looking for growth in the product business. They’re looking for high-tech,” he said. “It’s a bit like when a wife comes to a husband and says, ‘I don’t love you anymore’.”"

-12.994688231029409," Factbox: Impact of U.S.-China trade tariffs on U.S. companies (Reuters) - U.S. companies are putting in place measures to cushion the impact of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. The world’s two largest economies have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s imports. In his latest threat to the Asian nation, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports. The following is a list of recent comments made by U.S. companies: - Caterpillar Inc CAT.N said U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to increase its material costs by about $100 million to $200 million in the second half of the year. The heavy machinery maker plans to offset most of the higher costs with mid-year price hikes. - General Electric Co GE.N estimated that new tariffs on its imports from China could raise its costs by $300 million to $400 million overall, before steps to lessen the impact. - Detroit automakers General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N lowered their full-year profit forecasts due to escalating tariffs. - Boeing Co BA.N is concerned about the impact of possible trade tariffs on the cost of running its supply chain, but has not yet seen any impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions on its business, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said. - U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc HON.N said it would increase the use of supply chain sources from non-China countries to counter growing costs related to a tariff war between the world's two largest economies. - Home furnishings chain At Home Group Inc HOME.N said it would make adjustments to its supply chain to mitigate the impact of the proposed tariffs on goods imported from China. - Home furnishing retailer Pier 1 Imports PIR.N says the company does not expect financial results in fiscal 2019 to be materially affected by proposed tariffs. About 59 percent of the company's fiscal 2019 net sales are expected to be derived from merchandise produced in China. Of the 59 percent of 2019 sales from Chinese merchandise, about half is expected to have products subject to proposed tariff. - U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N said it expected incremental costs of about $15 million to $20 million for the remainder of the year from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Trump. It also says it will take further hits from retaliatory moves from the European Union. - Polaris Industries Inc PII.N, which makes Indian motorcycles, raised its 2018 cost estimates related to tariffs to $40 million from $7 million, and said it expected to ramp up motorcycle production in Poland for European market in 2019 to offset higher costs. - Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M Co MMM.N said it expects an impact of about $10 million, or 1 cent per share, on an annualized basis from the tariffs passed so far. The company also said it was prepared to make changes to supply, sourcing and pricing in response to any further tariffs. - Paper and packaging company International Paper IP.N Chief Executive Officer Mark Sutton says the company has so far not had any direct impact from tariff disputes. - Otis elevator maker United Technologies Corp UTX.N said based on tariffs which have been enacted so far it expects to see 5 cent per share impact in 2018. The company expects to see a much bigger impact in 2019. - Medical device maker Boston Scientific BSX.N said it buys a ""very small portion"" of components from China and that it has the ability to substitute with other suppliers outside of China since it does not manufacture in the country. - Upscale home furnishing chain RH RH.N expects to reduce significantly the amount of goods sourced from China in its 2019 fiscal year to mitigate the impact of proposed new tariffs by the United States. - Gentex Corp GNTX.O, a maker of aircraft windows and rear-view mirrors, said it expected cost increases of between $5 million and $8 million for the second half of 2018 related to its planned purchases of raw materials from China. - Meat Processor Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N cut its full-year profit forecast, citing the uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs that have hurt domestic and export prices of meat. - Toymaker Hasbro Inc HAS.O said it was moving more production out of China as a result of the tariffs, adding 30 percent of its manufacturing was now done elsewhere. - Danaher Corp DHR.N, which develops technology for the dental, life sciences, diagnostics and environmental industries, said it expected an earnings impact of 1 cent per quarter, and that it would look to modify manufacturing locations. - U.S. pipeline operator Plains All American Pipeline PAA.N said the tariffs were tolerable for the company, but it applied for exemptions. However, the company added that if it could not get the exemption or the required quota of steel, ""it would just basically extend and delay growth."""

RH is one of the first U.S. companies to react to the new tariff proposal that includes day-to-day consumer goods such as pet food and handbags. Until now, tariffs had only focused on capital goods such as steel and aluminum. RH’s said its plan to lower its share of imports from China would help it reduce the impact of tariffs on its fiscal 2018 and 2019 financial results. Its scale in the luxury home furnishing market will help raise prices if needed, RH said, adding it would work with its vendors to evaluate sourcing alternatives. The company’s stock rose nearly 5 percent to $139.31 in early trading, recovering from Wednesday’s losses after a Goldman Sachs note said the new tariffs would hurt gross margin of home furnishing retailers and force them to raise prices. RH sourced about 77 percent of its products from Asia in 2017, of which the majority of it came from China, according to a filing."

-6.779655970591156," China vows to hit back over U.S. proposal for fresh tariffs BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China accused the United States of bullying and warned it would hit back after the Trump administration raised the stakes in their trade dispute, threatening 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in a move that rattled global markets. China’s commerce ministry said on Wednesday it was “shocked” and would complain to the World Trade Organisation, but did not immediately say how Beijing would retaliate in the dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. In a statement, it called the U.S. actions “completely unacceptable”. The Chinese foreign ministry said Washington’s threats were “typical bullying” and described the dispute as a “fight between unilateralism and multilateralism”. U.S. officials on Tuesday issued a list of thousands of Chinese goods to be hit with the new tariffs. The top items by value were furniture at $29 billion of imports in 2017, network routers worth $23 billion last year and computer components to the value of $20 billion. The list is subject to a two-month public comment period. Some U.S. business groups and lawmakers from President Donald Trump’s own Republican Party who support free trade were critical of the escalating tariffs. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 88-11 in favour of a non-binding resolution calling for Congress to have a role in implementing such tariffs. Republican U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the U.S. announcement “appears reckless and is not a targeted approach.” Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan accused China of unfair trade practices but added, “I don’t think tariffs are the right way to go.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has supported Trump’s domestic tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulation of businesses, but does not back Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. “Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. Imposing taxes on another $200 billion worth of products will raise the costs of every day goods for American families,” a Chamber spokeswoman said. Among the potential ways Beijing could hit back are “qualitative measures,” a threat that U.S. businesses in China fear could mean anything from stepped-up inspections to delays in investment approvals and even consumer boycotts. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed Chinese officials, said Beijing was considering holding up licenses for U.S. companies, delaying approvals of mergers involving U.S. firms and stepping up border inspections of American goods. China could also limit visits to the United States by Chinese tourists, a business that state media said is worth $115 billion, or shed some of its U.S. Treasury holdings, Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. Investors fear an escalating Sino-American trade war could hit global growth and damage sentiment. The $200 billion far exceeds the total value of goods China imports from the United States, which means Beijing may need to think of creative ways to respond to such U.S. measures. It also highlights how dependent U.S. businesses and consumers are on Chinese goods. In Trump’s first round of tariffs, China accounted for 20 percent of total U.S. imports, meaning that substitutes were readily available. In this round, China accounted for more than half of the imports. There was a price to be paid by American companies as government policies legislated winners and losers. Home furnishing retailers are expected to be hit particularly hard because China supplies 65 percent of U.S. furniture imports, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. The prospect of a 10 percent tariff on Chinese furniture imports sent shares of online home store WayFair Inc W.N down 2.9 percent, while shares of Restoration Hardware RH.N tumbled 4.3 percent. Auto parts retailers, which would also be affected by the latest tariff threats the U.S. lobbed at China, fell more steeply than the broader market. Shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc AAP.N were down 1.1 percent, Autozone Inc AZO.N fell 1.6 percent and O'Reilly Automotive Inc ORLY.O dropped 1.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed down 0.88 percent, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 0.71 percent and the Nasdaq was off 0.55 percent. The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 1.1 percent, while the main indexes in Hong Kong .HSI and Shanghai .SSEC recovered somewhat after falling more than 2 percent. Trump has been following through on pledges he made during his 2016 presidential campaign to get tough on China, which he accuses of unfair trade practices including theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer that have led to a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China. The U.S. president has said he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. U.S. financial analysts said Trump appeared to believe there was a political benefit to waging a trade war, although that could change quickly amid economic fallout. “It is now much more likely that the dispute will continue for a prolonged period of time and that we will see ratcheting up of protectionist measures,” said Elena Duggar, an associate managing director at Moody’s, the credit rating agency."
