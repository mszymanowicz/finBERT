8.940239143242108," Pernod Ricard banks on China and U.S. to help sales return to growth in full year PARIS, Feb 11 (Reuters) - French spirits group Pernod Ricard said it expected its sales would return to organic growth in full year of 2020/21, thanks to strong demand for its premium cognac and whisky in the key U.S. and Chinese markets. Pernod, which is the world’s second-biggest spirits group behind Diageo, cautioned against continued uncertainty and volatility as the COVID-19 crisis weigh on duty-free sales and on alcohol consumption in bars and restaurants. Pernod, the maker of Martell cognac, Mumm champagne and Absolut vodka, reported weaker but nevertheless better-than-expected first-half profits and sales, thanks to tight control over spending. Double-digit sales growth in China and solid demand in the United States by people staying at home and consuming products and drinks also propped up Pernod’s results. Pernod’s fiscal year starts on July 1. First-half profit from current operations in the six months to Dec. 31 reached 1.595 billion euros ($1.93 billion), an organic decline of 2.4%, which was nevertheless better than analysts’ expectations for a 7.9% decline. Sales reached 4.985 billion euros, representing an organic decline of 3.9%, which was better than analysts’ expectations for a 5.4% decline."
15.466670359383471," East African Breweries sees recovery gaining pace in second half NAIROBI (Reuters) - East African Breweries expects sales to recover from a coronavirus-induced slump in its second half to June, its outgoing chief executive said, as nations in the region relax measures to curb the spread of the virus. The brewer, which is controlled by Britain’s Diageo Plc, posted on Thursday a 3% drop in net sales for its first half to end December as sales were pummelled by the closure of bars. Post-tax profit plunged by a third. Net sales will start to grow again, Andrew Cowan, EABL’s outgoing chief executive, told a virtual investor briefing on Friday. “We do believe the restrictions we have in East Africa are time-bound,” he said, adding that the expected arrival of COVID-19 vaccines and fairly low cases of new infections in Kenya will also aid a rebound. The company, which dominates the regional alcohol market with Tusker beer and Johnny Walker Scotch whiskey among other brands, turned to electronic commerce last year to prop up sales. It set up an online distribution platform where consumers could order drinks, and partnered with delivery firms like Glovo to deliver them straight to their homes. The share of that distribution channel has grown 10 times from pre-pandemic levels, Cowan said, without sharing actual numbers. Electronic distribution, along with a shift to more canned drinks and disposable glasses, was likely to keep growing as bars in Kenya have re-opened with shortened hours and consumers are still opting to buy online, he said. EABL, which operates in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, posted strong sales growth in Tanzania and Uganda in the first half, helping to offset a steep drop in Kenya, which accounts for two-thirds of sales. It also reported rapid growth in its spirits category, driven by high demand for gin. “Gin is exploding across East Africa,” Cowan said. The demand for the spirit is driven by a growing base of young urban consumers, said incoming group CEO Jane Karuku."
12.53125215288582," Breakingviews - Corona Capital: GDP, Corruption, Norway NEW YORK/LONDON/MILAN/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights. - Transparency International - Government Pension Fund Global SKINNY DOMESTIC PRODUCT. U.S. GDP expanded at a puny 4% annual pace in the fourth quarter, by the government’s early estimate on Thursday. That’s nothing compared with a 33% annualized rate in the third quarter, but at least the economy is growing. Overall America’s economic output in 2020 was down 3.5% from the year before. That’s the biggest contraction since 1946, although, to be fair, the figure 75 years ago was a seismic minus 11.6%. The biggest hit has been to the services sector – think everything from airlines to bars – while housing and manufacturing have propped up the economy. The net effect has been bad for jobs, though, and a recovery that is losing steam because of continuing Covid-19 infections is a worry that was also noted by Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell in a press conference on Wednesday. With poverty increasing and nonfarm employment declining last month for the first time since last April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there’s increased pressure on lawmakers in Congress to deliver some version of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion spending plan. That requires the plight of real people to prevail over politics. (By Richard Beales) BUNGED UP. One symptom of the coronavirus crisis is a global corruption pandemic, according to a report released on Thursday by Transparency International. The watchdog identified a link between perceived corruption within a country and underinvestment in healthcare, which persisted even after accounting for levels of economic development. The organisation also called out weak oversight of coronavirus response programmes in rich countries like the United States, and the British government’s habit of handing out huge procurement contracts with weak controls. Underlining TI’s point, its annual Corruption Perceptions Index saw the U.S. achieve its worst score since 2012, and successful virus-fighter New Zealand top the charts. Governments wanting to do better could make it mandatory for state departments to conduct corruption risk analyses, even in health emergencies, and hand greater power to audit bodies. But politicians and civil servants are understandably more focused on fighting Covid-19 right now. The danger is that, once the crisis is over, public anger about corruption takes a back seat, risking a repeat in the next emergency. (By Liam Proud) THE NORDIC WAY. Norway’s controversial bet on hedgies is paying off nicely. On Thursday the country’s $1.26 trillion Government Pension Fund Global – led by former hedge fund supremo Nicolai Tangen – announced a 10.9% return for 2020, as bets on U.S. technology stocks paid off. That compares with a roughly 9% increase in Norwegian crown terms for the FTSE Global All Cap Index, according to Refinitiv data. Zooming tech giants such as Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft saw equities, which represent nearly three-quarters of the fund’s assets, buoy overall gains as credit and unlisted real estate returned 7.5% and made a small decline, respectively. Such outperformance should further vindicate the choice of Tangen – founder of London-based AKO Capital – following opposition to his appointment last year. The fact that it represents a marked acceleration from a 14.6% drop suffered in the first quarter may also indicate happier news for Singapore’s competitor, $230 billion sovereign fund Temasek, which posted a 2% fall in the year ending last March, just as the pandemic began to bite. (By Christopher Thompson) PUMPLONA. The Paloma cocktail, comprising grapefruit juice and tequila, is lifting Diageo’s spirits. The $92 billion drinks giant said on Thursday that sales of tequila jumped 80% in North America in the six months to December, helping to drive year-on-year organic sales in the region up 12%. That eased the hangover from closed bars and restaurants. Diageo is not the only beneficiary of the home-cocktail vogue: tonic maker Fevertree’s U.S. sales were up 23% last year. Tequila brands like Don Julio and Casamigos also liven up Diageo’s valuation gap over its closest rival Pernod Ricard, which reports results on Feb. 11. The French group has an enterprise value of just under 19 times expected EBITDA for the year to June 2021, while Diageo is valued at almost 21 times, according to Refinitiv data. Assuming there’s no supply shortage – agave plants used to make tequila take seven years to grow – Diageo’s cocktail buzz should carry it through the pandemic. (By Dasha Afanasieva) PANDEMIC WINNER. Prada is returning to its former glory. Sales at the $16 billion fashion group will double to 5 billion euros in four to five years, boss Patrizio Bertelli said in an interview published on Thursday. Investors are already pricing in an acceleration. Shares in the Italian maker of the $2,500 Galleria bag have gained 68% in the past 12 months, making it the best-performing stock among top European bling companies. Over the same period LVMH is up 23%, while Moncler rose 18%. That suggests that Prada’s turnaround strategy is working. Even before Covid-19, the group stopped offering discounts and cut ties with most department stores to improve its profitability. Its directly controlled retail shops now account for over 90% of total sales. By 2023, EBITDA should represent 33% of forecast sales of 4 billion euros, Refinitiv data shows. That’s still behind Moncler’s projected 39% EBITDA margin. Even so, the gap is narrowing. (By Lisa Jucca) SWEETENED REVENGE. Chalk one up for pushy investors. A Carlyle-backed group doubled its original offer for Japan Asia Group, a green energy and technology company, to 48 billion yen ($463 million) after activist Yoshiaki Murakami smelled something fishy and lobbed in his own unsolicited bid. The 1,200 yen a share proposal is now quadruple the company’s undisturbed price in September. Murakami blasted the original structure, accusing JAG’s board of handing Chairman Tetsuo Yamashita 10 billion yen of assets as part of the deal for just 60 million yen. Under the revised terms, Carlyle pays a little more to buy bigger stakes in two of the company’s divisions, but at the same valuation. That should help it avoid looking like a pushover in future confrontations with hedge funds. Yamashita, though, kicks in a heftier sum, which suggests it might be that much harder for Japanese companies to get away with cosy management buyouts. (By Jennifer Hughes)"
12.53125215288582," Diageo's sales get surprise boost from U.S. spirits drinkers (Reuters) - Drinks group Diageo on Thursday reported an unexpected rise in underlying net sales growth for its first half year as people splurged on premium tequila and bourbon at retail stores in the United States, sending its shares up as much as 4%. The coronavirus pandemic has hit beer and spirits makers as bars, restaurants and night clubs around the world had to close and as travel was restricted. But as more people drink at home, Diageo, maker of Johnnie Walker whisky, benefited from a strong performance in United States, where it generates 80% of sales from off-licence retail and grocery stores. Consumers drank more premium spirits such as Don Julio and Casamigos tequilas , Ciroc Vodkas and Bulleit bourbon. North America sales rose 12% in the six months to Dec. 31, driven by strong consumer demand and a shift towards spirits over beer and wine. Retailers also replenished more stock ahead of the holiday season. Beer sales dropped 15%. In the United States, which contributes 39% to sales and makes up nearly 45% of Diageo’s profits, the penetration of spirits has grown three times that of beer and wine, Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said and he was confident these drinking habits would stick. While U.S. was a bright spot, the company struggled in other markets such as Europe and Turkey where sales declined 10% and in the Asia Pacific where they fell 3%, despite strong performance in China. The group, however, expects sales growth in all regions in the second half year, given easier comparables with last year, strong momentum in North America, and re-opening of bars and restaurants in some other regions, chief fianancial officer Kathryn Mikells told Reuters. Overall, Diageo, the world’s largest spirits maker, reported a 1% rise in organic net sales growth for the first half, compared with expectations for a 4.6% drop, according to company supplied estimates. “Time for us to eat humble pie. Diageo announced an incredibly resilient set of H1F21 results this morning, with beats across the board,” Bernstein analyst Trevor Sterling wrote in a note. Menezes also said that Diageo had ended a dividend dispute with LVMH, with the French company agreeing to pay it 181 million euros in dividends from their Moët Hennessy wine and spirits joint venture. Diageo had filed arbitration proceedings against Moet Hennessy last year after it said it was owed dividends for 2019. “The dividend dispute is resolved and our relationship with LVMH remains very strong,” CEO Menezes said. Diageo also said it would bring back its non-alcoholic Guinness beer to markets this year after recalling the new drink due to “microbial contamination” in November. Diageo also raised its interim dividend by 2% to 27.96 pence per share."

5.444632147403809," Waterworld: How beverage company Diageo is rethinking water usage NEW YORK (Reuters) - When you sit down at the end of the day with a glass of Johnnie Walker or Captain Morgan, you probably do not think much about all the water that goes into that glass. But Perry Jones does. As head of the North American supply chain for beverage behemoth Diageo Plc - which produces not only the above brands, but everything from Tanqueray gin to Don Julio tequila to Guinness beer - the buck stops with Jones. So from the water used in producing raw materials, to the water in the finished product, to the wastewater produced along the way, Jones is constantly thinking about how to source it, how to treat it, and how to use less of it. It is a pressing issue on a global scale: Climate change, droughts, population growth and pollution are all squeezing supply. As a result, 2 billion people live in nations that are facing water stress, according to the United Nations. Reuters sat down with Jones to peek into the future of a most precious global resource. Edited excerpts are below. Q: You are rethinking your relationship to water, so what targets have you set? A: We have set our 2030 goals, which represent our 10-year ambition for a more inclusive and sustainable world. We are focusing on three areas: One is promoting responsible drinking, the second is championing inclusion and diversity, and the third is devoted to grain-to-glass sustainability. That means things like water preservation, replenishing sources, carbon neutrality, wastewater treatment, sustainable packaging, and supporting small farmers. Q: What does this mean in terms of water usage? A: We have already made a lot of progress, but from this point forward we are calling for another 30% reduction in our water usage by 2030. We want to leave Earth in a better place than we found it, so at a minimum we want to replenish what we are taking. Q: How exactly do you replenish water sources? A: There are a few different ways you can look at it. One is the planting of trees, which reduces runoff and helps get water back into aquifers. Another is to improve water quality and access to clean drinking water – in India, for example, we set up community water purification plants with chillers and water ATMs in villages in the Nagpur district. Other projects cover rainwater harvesting, wetland restoration and desilting dams. Q: How do your water targets filter down to the factory level – or how do suggestions filter up? A: We have a management process where we review what our actual water usage is, versus what our theoretical usage should be, every day across the globe. So water issues or concerns or suggestions get elevated up to the manager level, then to site directors, then to VPs, then to the C-Suite level. We have metering that tells us what came in the door, how it was deployed, and how much went out in the product. That helps us identify any losses, so we can correct them. Q: How is technology helping with these goals? A: You want to get water usage to the optimum level the equipment is designed for, and where the systems are outdated and you can’t meet your water targets, you want to upgrade to new technology. For example, in our Plainfield, Illinois, plant, we saw a 40% reduction in water usage. And in one of our Canadian plants, we reduced our water loss by 50%. Q: People are worried about water supplies, so has this issue become front-and-center in recent years? A: It has always been a center of discussion, but what I am seeing is a broader collaboration across the beverage industry, as we support each other on this journey. We may be competitors when we go to market, but when it comes to sustainability we look at everyone as a partner. We share technology and learning, because we don’t operate in a vacuum. This is a much bigger issue than just our company. Q: When you are having a drink, do you think about all this stuff? A: I’m a vodka drinker, so I usually drink Smirnoff. I think about everything that went into that glass, and I’m proud of it."
7.018439359994229," Diageo recalls new non-alcoholic Guinness in Britain due to contamination LONDON (Reuters) - Diageo recalled its non-alcoholic beer Guinness 0.0 in Britain on Wednesday due to “microbiological contamination”, just over two weeks after launching the product into the competitive and growing market for non-alcoholic beer. Guinness, the brewer based in Dublin, said on its website the recall was a “precautionary measure” due to contamination that it said might make some cans of Guinness 0.0 unsafe to consume. “We are sorry that this has happened,” the company said in a statement, adding that the issue did not affect any other Guinness variants or brands. Guinness said last month it would launch the non-alcoholic beer in Britain from Oct. 26 at stores, and would make it available in pubs in Britain and Ireland from Spring 2021 before rolling it out to more markets around the world later in 2021. The market for non-alcoholic beer has grown in recent years as many consumers drink less, prompting other big brands such as Budweiser and Heineken to launch alcohol-free versions of their beers."

15.529172954006738," Pernod Ricard says sales likely to suffer during second wave PARIS (Reuters) - French spirits maker Pernod Ricard PERP.PA doesn't expect sales to rise until next year as second-wave COVID-19 lockdowns are likely to hit its business heavily in the last three months of 2020, the company said on Thursday. Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits company behind Diageo DGE.L, said sales rebounded in the three months to Sept. 30 after a torrid previous quarter but were still down 6% from a year earlier at 2.236 billion euros ($2.7 billion). “We expect a second quarter that will be heavily impacted by the COVID crisis. There is a second wave of infections in Europe and new restrictions in France, even lockdowns in Ireland, Britain,” Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard told Reuters. Pernod’s fiscal year starts on July 1. While down from a year earlier, its first-quarter sales beat analyst expectations for a 13% drop and were a marked improvement on a 36.2 % slump in the three months to June 30 as strict lockdowns kicked in. Shares in Pernod, which makes drinks such as Absolut Vodka, Mumm champagne and Martell cognac, were 2.9% higher at 0840 GMT. Like its rivals, Pernod has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has led to closures of bars, restaurants and night clubs in many countries and worldwide travel restrictions. When venues have reopened, strict social distancing, early closing times and reduced capacity have all kept a lid on sales. Ricard also said duty-free sales would not recover during the company’s current financial year due to continued travel restrictions and were likely to show a double-digit decline. Travel retail sales, which make 6% of group sales, fell 64% in the three months to Sept. 30. In China, which contributes 9% of Pernod’s sales and is its second largest market after the United States, sales rose 4% in the quarter, helped by the reopening of bars and restaurants and strong demand ahead of the country’s Mid-Autumn festival. About 90% of China’s bars, restaurants and clubs had reopened and while business was not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, customers were prepared to spend more, Ricard told Reuters. U.S. sales rose 6%, also benefiting from good orders ahead of the festive season and strong consumption in homes. Smaller rival Remy Cointreau RCOP.PA also posted better-than-expected sales in its second quarter and said it was confident the United States and China would fuel a strong rebound its second half."

Pernod, which is the world’s second-biggest spirits group behind Diageo, made the forecast after its first quarter sales sequentially improved, beating expectations and reflecting resilient home consumption in Europe and the United States amid the pandemic, and improving sales in China. Pernod Ricard’s fiscal year started on July 1. Pernod, which owns Martell cognac, Mumm champagne and Absolut vodka, has along with its peers been hurt by the pandemic, which has led to closures of bars and restaurants in many countries and travel restrictions that have hit duty free travel. Travel retail makes 6% of group’s sales. For the first quarter ended Sept. 30, Pernod reported sales of 2.236 billion euros ($2.65 billion), marking a like-for-like decline of 6%, but also an improvement on a 36.2 % fall in the fourth quarter of its last fiscal year which ended on June 30. The numbers were also better than market expectations of a 13.1% quarterly sales fall."
16.190479481835705," Spirits maker Diageo says U.S. business ahead of expectations (Reuters) - Diageo DGE.L, the world's largest spirits maker, said on Monday it has made a strong start to its fiscal year 2021, with many countries easing their COVID-19 restrictions and its U.S. business performing ahead of expectations. “Our outlook for the first half of fiscal ‘21 has improved since the year-end, reflecting the good start to the year, particularly for our US business,” CEO Ivan Menezes said in a statement ahead of the company’s annual general meeting. The company’s shares jumped 6%. Alcoholic drink makers have been hurt by the closure of bars and restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic. Sales have been helped by some reopening of venues and strong demand from people drinking at home. The company’s U.S. business - which represents about 45% of group profits, according to Barclays analysts, is performing ahead of expectations, helped by “resilient” demand and people increasingly choosing spirits over wine or beer. It’s “an encouraging start to the year,” Barclays said. Diageo cited the risk of additional restrictions in Europe, where infection rates are rising, and noted that in China, while bars and restaurants are recovering, large banquets - once a mainstay of Chinese spirits consumption - are returning more slowly. Travel retail continues to be severely impacted, it said. The maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka said it continues to expect sequential improvement in organic net sales and operating profit compared to the second half of fiscal 2020, which ended on June 30. However, year on year, it expects lower sales and margins compared to the first half of fiscal 2020. In August, Diageo reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year, its worst performance in more than a decade."
14.8277035345043," Diageo to buy Ryan Reynolds-backed Aviation Gin as it moves upmarket (Reuters) - Diageo DGE.L is paying up to $610 million for Aviation American Gin, co-owned by Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds, and a clutch of other spirits brands, adding to a gin portfolio which already includes Tanqueray and Gordon's. Diageo isn’t new to acquiring brands linked to Hollywood celebrities, having in 2017 paid $1 billion to acquire the super premium tequila brand Casamigos co-founded by “Ocean’s Eleven” star George Clooney. It also teamed up with up with music producer and rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs to sell Ciroc vodka in 2007. [bit.ly/3g1S5Nx] Reynolds acquired an unspecified minority stake in Aviation Gin in 2018, since when the brand had thrived, Diageo, the world’s largest spirits maker, said on Monday. It said Reynolds would retain his interest in Aviation American Gin. The deal comes at a time when consumption of gin has been rising in the United States. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, distillers sold nearly 10 million nine-liter cases of gin in the United States in 2019, generating $918 million in revenue, a 3% rise over 2018. Most of this growth was driven by the super-premium gin category where bottles cost $25 and upwards. Aviation American Gin, which retails for $27 per 750 millilitres, is the second-largest super-premium gin brand in the United States, growing volumes at over 100% in 2019 and contributed 40% of super-premium gin category growth in the country, Diageo said, citing industry tracker IWSR. Diageo is paying up to $610 million for Aviation Gin LLC and Davos Brands LLC, whose portfolio also includes Astral Tequila, Sombra Mezcal and TYKU Sake. The 43-year old actor, star of the superhero movie Deadpool, is also creative director of the brand and more recently was applauded for his ""genius"" in roping in commercial actress Monica Ruiz to promote Aviation Gin, days after she appeared in a widely panned ad for exercise bike maker Peloton Interactive Inc PTON.O that was seen as sexist. The tongue-in-cheek video advertisement by Aviation garnered 5 million-plus views on its first day. Diageo’s acquisition comes just two weeks after the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka said yearly profit had nearly halved as widespread closures of pubs and restaurants, cancellation of sporting events and a plunge in duty free purchases hit global demand. It also took a 1.3 billion pound ($1.7 billion) charge on some slow-selling brands. ($1 = 0.7636 pounds)"

13.794116385768717," Walmart's Flipkart eyes alcohol delivery foray with Indian startup, letters show NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart's WMT.N e-commerce platform Flipkart has partnered with a startup backed by spirits giant Diageo to deliver alcohol in two Indian states, according to government letters seen by Reuters, months after Amazon AMZN.O planned a similar foray. Flipkart and Amazon’s interest in delivering alcohol in India marks a bold move to make inroads into an alcohol market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. The local governments of eastern West Bengal and Odisha states have said that Flipkart can be associated as a technology service provider of Diageo DGE.L-backed HipBar, an Indian alcohol home delivery mobile application. Flipkart’s customers will be allowed to access HipBar’s application on the e-commerce giant’s platforms, according to the letters, which have not previously been reported. Under the arrangement, Flipkart customers will be able to place orders for their favourite tipple, which HipBar will then deliver after collecting products from retail outlets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. HipBar, 26% owned by Diageo India, and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In June, Reuters reported that Amazon had secured clearance to deliver alcohol in West Bengal, signalling the U.S. e-commerce giant’s foray into the sector. “Flipkart wants to make sure that whatever consumers want, they get it. The margins (on liquor deliveries) maybe low, but for Flipkart it is about stickiness so consumer don’t have to anywhere else,” said a source close to Flipkart. West Bengal is India’s fourth most populous state, with a population of more than 90 million people, while Odisha’s population is more than 41 million. Some states in India, like Gujarat in the west, prohibit alcohol retail. India’s top two food-delivery startups, Swiggy and Zomato, have also started delivering alcohol in some cities, as companies look to cash in on the high demand for booze from people staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon on Friday also said it will launch an online pharmacy in India that will serve the southern city of Bengaluru. Shoppers in India are increasingly going online to buy everything from groceries to electronics during the pandemic."
-1.5515729116534265," Diageo full-year sales plunge as demand in bars, restaurants dries up (Reuters) - Diageo Plc DGE.L, the world's largest spirits maker, took a 1.3 billion pound writedown as it reported a bigger than expected decline in underlying net sales on Tuesday as demand for its whisky, vodka and gin fell in nearly all markets. The Johnnie Walker whisky maker took the 1.3 billion pound non-cash writedown related to its businesses in India, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Windsor whisky brand in South Korea, blaming challenging trading conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, the company reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year ended June 30, larger than the 7.3% fall analysts had expected, company supplied estimates showed. This marks the company’s worst annual sales performance in more than a decade, according to Bernstein analysts. Diageo shares were down 6.2% in early trading and was the biggest loser on the FTSE .FTSE. The stock is down nearly 10% this year, better than the FTSE's 20% decline over the same period. By region, organic sales in Asia fell the most, dropping 16% due to the impact of coronavirus-related closures of alcohol outlets and bars in India and Thailand, while in China demand was hit by the absence of the Chinese New Year. The company’s Latin America, Africa and Europe and Turkey markets also posted double-digit falls in sales, mainly due to disruptions to supply chains and fewer social occasions due to the pandemic. North America was the only bright spot, with sales rising 2%, reflecting strong demand for tequilas and ready-to-drink beverages at supermarkets and alcohol stores, the company said. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said the strong results in North America, its biggest market by revenue, was because 80% of Diageo’s sales came from retail stores, in contrast to other markets, where bars and restaurants make up most of the sales. The company, which also makes Tanqueray Gin, Smirnoff Vodka and a wide range of scotch whiskey, said it was still unable to provide specific outlook for the year, after abandoning a full-year forecast in April. Its 4.5 billion pound capital returns programme remains suspended. “The hit to earnings should be short lived provided the global economy doesn’t take too long to recover,” William Ryder, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said. “We think the group will continue to do well long term, but management will have to focus more on debt reduction than they probably would have liked.” The company also said it would keep paying a dividend, which Liberum analyst Nico Von Stackelberg called a “positive sign”. After a tough second half of the year “we should see sequential improvements (in the business) from here,” he said in a note. Diageo's business outlook was in contrast to French spirits makers Pernod Ricard PERP.PA and Remy Cointreau RCOP.PA , which last month said the pandemic would not hit their full-year forecasts as strongly as initially feared.

-1.4737010441979872," Diageo bets on ecommerce in Brazil to make up for closed bars and restaurants SAO PAULO, June 26 (Reuters) - Diageo Plc, the world’s largest spirits maker, has doubled efforts to strengthen its presence in e-commerce channels in Brazil as the coronavirus pandemic triggered lockdowns, driving customers to drink at home, a company executive said on Friday. “Consumption at home has increased significantly over the past three months, but does not fully compensate revenue lost with the closure of bars, restaurants, nightclubs and events,” Diageo’s managing director for Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, Gregorio Gutierrez, told Reuters in an interview. He did not specify how much sales have fallen in the region since the outbreak started, but noted that the so-called “on-trade: segment - in which alcoholic drinks are sold for consumption in licensed premises - represents between 40% and 50% of Diageo’s business. “As soon as these on-trade channels closed, we reallocated our resources to an online task force,” Gutierrez added. The Johnnie Walker whisky maker currently has partnerships with major retailers in Brazil, including international players such as Amazon.com and MercadoLibre, as well as the local subsidiaries of French supermarkets groups Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Carrefour SA. Despite efforts to boost online channels, Brazil’s alcoholic beverages association Abrabe estimates the coronavirus crisis reduced total sales by an average of 50%. Brazil has become the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Latin America, reaching over 1.2 million confirmed cases and almost 55,000 deaths by June 25, according to Health Ministry data. For Gutierrez, it is still difficult to tell when Diageo’s operations should return to pre-COVID-19 levels even as authorities begin to lift restrictions in some locations. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s most populous city and the first to confirm a coronavirus case, bars and restaurants are allowed to reopen as of July 6. In the meantime, the Tanqueray gin maker has been working to prepare its partners for the reopening, setting aside US$100 million to help bars and restaurants around the world.

-3.4129989484030605," Indian military stores orders for Pernod, Diageo dry up-sources * India PM Modi wants to promote use of local products * Defence canteens haven’t placed regular liquor orders: sources * Pernod, Diageo seeing lack of orders for foreign brands: sources NEW DELHI, June 17 (Reuters) - Pernod Ricard and Diageo, two of the world’s biggest spirit makers, have stopped receiving orders for their imported brands from India’s defence canteen stores where they were sold at concessional prices, industry sources told Reuters. The move is seen as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “vocal for local” campaign in which he has called for promotion of indigenous products to make India self-reliant during the coronavirus pandemic, a government measure that critics have called protectionist and against foreign businesses. India’s defence canteens provide access to both local and imported products such as liquor and electronics at less-than-market rates to soldiers, ex-servicemen and their families. But Pernod Ricard India, whose brands include Chivas and Glenlivet scotch whisky, received no orders in May for imported spirits, compared with average monthly orders of 4,500-5,000 cases by defence stores, one source said. One case typically holds six, nine or 12 bottles of liquor. Diageo India too has not received any orders since May for its imported brands such as the popular Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky and Talisker single malt, a second source said. Pernod Ricard declined to comment and Diageo did not respond to queries. The defence ministry did not respond. While no written order has been issued, a senior government official said a formal decision in the matter was imminent. “We want to encourage indigenous products ... with the PM’s campaign, it gets more priority,” said the official. A bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label costs 3,600 rupees ($47) in Maharashtra state’s defence canteens, a third lower than the 5,500 rupees ($72) retail customers pay there. “Drinking scotch has become a habit, this move is going to hurt our pockets,” said a retired Indian army official who said he purchases five scotch bottles each month for himself and his family. While imported liquor sales at defence stores generate only about $17 million in annual sales, the channel generates regular demand for top foreign brands. The canteens sell about $450 million worth of liquor each year, mostly Indian-made beer, whisky, rum and other spirits, industry sources said. A formal order to restrict purchases of imported liquor by defence stores will signal an unfriendly business environment, and will be “protectionism when there is nothing to protect,” said an executive working at a foreign liquor company in India. “You can’t make scotch in India,” said the executive. In May and June, the defence ministry asked liquor firms to provide details of their brands, the country where they are manufactured and details of imported ingredients used. The ministry had also sought similar answers from other non-liquor firms, the sources said, but it was not immediately clear which other orders had been halted.

-0.22116470678093464," Breakingviews - Diageo can go on India bender for virtual pittance MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s a respectable time to reach for the bottle in India. Diageo, the UK liquor giant led by Ivan Menezes, has built up a roughly 56% stake in India’s $5.3 billion United Spirits, maker of McDowell’s and Signature whiskies. The business makes up almost one-fifth of Diageo’s global sales and was growing fast before the virus struck. Now Diageo has an opportunity to go on a bender and buy out the minorities for a virtual pittance. The price: its dividend. It’s easy to see why the $80 billion distiller of Smirnoff and Tanqueray would be eyeing full control of its subsidiary. Diageo made its first big move on United Spirits in 2012, won control a couple of years later, and eventually agreed to pay its chairman, Vijay Mallya, a handsome sum to step down after inquiry found irregularities in the accounts. The disgraced booze baron now faces extradition from the UK for other dealings. Any deal would be a coronavirus-induced cheap tipple in the world’s largest whiskey market. United Spirits is now trading at around 26 times the estimates of its forward EBITDA, more than its parent at 18 times, but near a five-year low. The business, selling over 1 million cases a year, was in good shape before the outbreak. The top line was growing faster than Diageo’s. A strategy to sell more premium drinks was also working, and it has successfully cut debt. Profitability can still improve: United Spirits’ operating margin pales in comparison to its ultra-efficient parent. And other worries about a future tilt towards prohibition on the subcontinent seem overdone, not least because booze comprises a decent chunk of official tax revenues. Besides, Diageo has always been bullish on the long-term prospects of the market given low per capita alcohol consumption. Mid-pandemic dealmaking brings its own challenges: Diageo is already in cash-conservation mode and has suspended buybacks. A bid for the rest of United Spirits at a 25% premium to the share price, or nearly $3 billion, might push net debt to 4 times its EBITDA, analysts at Jefferies reckon. That might force Maharashtra-born Menezes to sacrifice a consistently poured final dividend this year, estimated at about 1 billion pounds. But given Diageo’s bumpy journey in India, taking full control of the business would also be a moment to toast."

The Johnnie Walker whisky maker is the latest company to pull its guidance as the closure of bars and restaurants around the world due to lockdowns imposed by governments hit its sales. Production facilities in many countries including India and in its key markets of Africa are closed, while in the United States - its biggest market - the closure of bars and restaurants in most states was impacting about 20% of its business there, the company said. Its shares were, however, up 2.4% in early trade after the company said it would pay its interim dividend in April as planned. Diageo also said it was seeing a small pickup in sales in retail stores in the United States and Europe in recent weeks, as more people drink at home. Online seller Naked Wines also said it was seeing a boost in business as Britons and Americans order more home deliveries. Consumption in mainland China was slowly recovering with the gradual opening of bars and restaurants, Diageo said in a statement, though global travel retail spending continued to be subdued. The company in February had estimated that the spread of coronavirus in greater China and the Asia Pacific region could knock up to $260 million off its profit in 2020. “Given the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertainty around the severity and duration of the impact across multiple markets, we are not in a position to accurately assess the impact of this on our future financial performance,” the Tanqueray gin maker said. The company had estimated annual underlying net sales growth to be about 2% and earnings before interest to be flat to up 2%, according to analysts. French spirits company Pernod Ricard PERP.PA and Budweiser beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR have in recent weeks estimated that the impact from the coronavirus pandemic would reduce current quarter profits by 20% and 10%, respectively. “(Diageo’s) withdrawal of guidance for 2020 (is) not a surprise,” Jefferies analyst Edward Mundy wrote in a note. “Debate will turn to pace of recovery in 2021, which we think is unlikely to be v-shaped given some continued impact on consumption patterns...and destocking risk” Diageo said it was stopping advertising and promotion “that would not be effective in the current environment” and deferring discretionary capital expenditure projects in an effort to shore up cash. It recently completed a 1.9 billion pound euro and sterling bond issue and said it had committed bank loans of 2.8 billion. Diageo also said it was suspending its three-year multi-phase 4.5 billion pound shareholder returns programme for the rest of the year. In its first phase that ended on Jan. 31, the company had paid out 1.25 billion in the form of buybacks."

Diageo said it would donate 2 million litres of grain neutral spirit - a 96% ethyl alcohol used mainly for vodka and gin - to help manufacturers make more than 8 million 250 ml bottles of sanitisers that are in short supply in countries worst hit by coronavirus. The maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Tanqueray gin said the bottles would be supplied to healthcare systems and workers, vulnerable communities and at-risk groups in Australia, Brazil, Britain, Kenya, India, Ireland, Italy and the United States. “This is the quickest and most effective way for us to meet the surging demand for hand sanitiser around the world,” Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in a statement.Separately, Budweiser maker AB InBev said it will start shipping some 50,000 litres of disinfectant made with alcohol removed from its alcohol-free beers for use in hospitals in several European countries from Wednesday. Shipments of 5-litre containers will likely be sent to Belgium, Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands, the company said, adding that it had already produced 26,000 bottles of hand sanitisers for pharmacies and health sector workers as well as 1,000 Beck’s bottles of disinfectant for German businesses. The surge in hand sanitisers made with alcohol from distilleries comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced bit.ly/395w1OH last week that it would allow some facilities and licensed professionals to make the product as long as they follow certain protocols. Jameson whisky maker Pernod Ricard was one of the first major distillers to announce it was producing and donating alcohol, with 70,000 litres destined for hydroalcoholic gel. Consumer product companies including Nivea-maker Beiersdorf and French luxury goods maker LVMH have joined the fight against COVID-19.

The company said that in China, bars and restaurants have largely been closed and there has been a substantial reduction in banqueting. Trading has been significantly disrupted since the end of January and the group expects this to last at least into March. After that Diageo anticipates a gradual improvement with consumption returning to normal levels towards the end of fiscal 2020. The company estimated the negative impact of the virus outbreak on the group’s organic net sales and organic operating profit to be between 225-325 million pounds and 140-200 million pounds ($260 million) respectively. It cautioned that these ranges exclude any impact of coronavirus on its other markets beyond China and Asia Pacific. Shares in Diageo were down 2.3% at 0846 GMT. When the group published first half results on Jan. 30, it had commented on the expectation of an impact from coronavirus but was not able to quantify it at the time. Rival Remy Cointreau warned last month of the potential impact on demand for its premium cognac in China, while Pernod Ricard said earlier in February that shuttered Chinese clubs and bars would have a severe impact on its current quarter. China’s National Health Commission reported another 406 new infections on Wednesday, down from 508 a day earlier and bringing the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 78,064. Its death toll rose by 52 to 2,715. The United States has warned of an inevitable pandemic and outbreaks in Italy and Iran have spread to more countries. In the past four trading sessions about $3 trillion has been wiped off the value of the MSCI World, a market cap weighted stock market index of 1,644 stocks globally. Diageo highlighted a hit to consumption in several other Asian countries, especially South Korea, Japan and Thailand. In these countries it expects a gradual improvement throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The group also called out a significant reduction in international passenger traffic, especially in Asia. It said recovery of passenger traffic is assumed to be gradual, resulting in weaker performance for the remainder of fiscal 2020. “We remain confident in the growth opportunities in our Greater China and Asia Pacific business. We will continue to invest behind our brands, ensuring we are strongly positioned for the expected recovery in consumer demand,” Diageo added.

The London-based company - whose brands include Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, Smirnoff vodka, Tanqueray gin and Guinness beer - did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but agreed to cease and desist from further violations, the SEC said on Wednesday. A Diageo spokeswoman said in a statement that the company was pleased to settle, and was “committed to maintaining a robust and transparent disclosure process.” According to the SEC, Diageo failed to publicly disclose how employees at its most profitable unit, Diageo North America, pushed distributors in its 2014 and 2015 fiscal years to buy more wine and spirits than they needed. The SEC said this “overshipping” enabled Diageo to report higher growth in operating profit and net sales than analysts expected, but was unsustainable because distributors would likely eventually push back on orders, and some did. According to the regulator, Diageo misled investors by leaving them with the impression that normal customer demand was helping fuel its reported growth. Melissa Hodgman, an associate director in the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement that Diageo created a “misleading picture of the company’s financial results and its ability to meet key performance indicators.” Diageo had disclosed an SEC probe into its distribution and public disclosure practices in July 2015.

The two-year deal includes a 3% pay increase in the first year and then a cost of living increase and a performance-based incentive bonus in the second year, the company said. “We are pleased to have reached agreement on a good, fair offer that ensures our employees can receive an increase on their pay while maintaining the competitiveness of our operations,” the company said in a statement.

A Diageo spokeswoman said that the unions had initially demanded 5% pay hikes when talks started in May, but had since come down to 3.5%. The source said that the unions “never” agreed to settle at 3.5% and that their previous demand still stood.

The unions on Aug. 30 again rejected Diageo’s offer to increase wages by 2.8%, after rejecting a prior offer of 2.5%. Last year, workers received a 3.2% hike. Bob MacGregor, regional industrial officer of Scottish union Unite, has said previously that production would come to a standstill if the strikes go ahead. “We are willing to listen to any offer from the company above what they offered last year... but what our members won’t accept is a pay cut,” MacGregor told Reuters. The Diageo spokeswoman said the union’s estimate that the strikes would cause losses of 1 million pounds a day did not have “any ground in reality” and that the company was unable to verify the number. The unions have said their demands should be taken in the context of the world’s largest spirits maker’s annual profits, which were 4.2 billion pounds ($5.19 billion) last year. The unions have also voiced frustrations over Diageo’s plan to build a 150 million pound Johnnie Walker visitor attraction in Edinburgh, as part of an investment in Scottish whisky tourism.

The new 50-50 venture, Ron Santiago SA, will have exclusive international rights to the premium brand, considered the best by local residents along with Havana Club, which is marketed by French firm Pernod Ricard PERP.PA under a similar arrangement signed in the 1990s.

It had been suspended by President Donald Trump’s predecessors. The Santiago distillery and related properties were reportedly nationalized.

The maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Tanqueray gin bought a 20% stake in the maker of spice-based drinks in 2016 through its venture capital arm Distill Ventures. Diageo uses Distill Ventures to invest in small brands that tap into emerging consumer tastes and trends. So far, the venture has invested more than 60 million pounds ($73 million) in about 15 drinks brands. Shares of Diageo, which did not disclose the terms of the transaction, were up 1%. The deal comes at a time a growing proportion of young drinkers in Great Britain claim to abstain from drinking alcohol. Teetotalism in Great Britain increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2005 for those aged between 16 and 24 years, according to a 2018 report from the Office of National Statistics. That equates to about 10.2 million people. Founded by Ben Branson, Seedlip has a presence in more than 25 countries, including the U.K., Australia and the United States and is sold in three spice variants. In the UK, Seedlip is sold at outlets including Selfridges, Waitrose, Sainsbury's SBRY.L and Tesco TSCO.L. Branson will retain a minority shareholding in the company, Diageo said."

-0.5455794399417853," Game of Thrones inspired scotch boosts Diageo's sales (Reuters) - Diageo DGE.L, the world's largest spirits company, reported higher annual profit on Thursday, helped by growth across all its markets and the popularity of its ""Game of Thrones"" inspired scotch. The company also approved plans to return up to 4.5 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) to shareholders over financial years 2020-2022, less than some analysts had expected, which pushed its shares 1.8% lower. Diageo reported pre-exceptional earnings per share of 130.8 pence, beating company supplied estimates of 128.8 pence, saying results were also helped by an improved price mix and cost controls. Diageo has been restructuring in recent years to improve performance and streamline its portfolio, while trying to bulk up on newer, hipper brands. It has looked to focus on its scotch business and grow its operations in India and the United States. The maker of Johnnie Walker scotch whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Guinness stout said operating profit rose 10% to 4 billion pounds ($5 billion) for the year ended June 30. Asia Pacific sales rose 9% on strong demand in China and India. Net sales in North America rose 5%, with total net sales up 5.8% at 12.9 billion pounds. “WHITE WALKER” WINS CONVERTS Scotch represents a quarter of Diageo’s net sales and was up 6% with broad-based growth across all regions except Europe. Diageo said Scotch growth in the period was driven by Johnnie Walker, helped by the launch of “White Walker by Johnnie Walker” inspired by HBO’s global hit “Game of Thrones”, which recruited new consumers into scotch. Diageo, however, faces potential pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump’s use of tariffs as a weapon in trade conflicts because Scotland’s most famous export could get caught up in the crossfire. The company also faces headwinds in Scotland, where talks over pay between the company and two of its biggest Scottish unions fell apart on Wednesday, threatening the production of some the region’s most popular whiskies. “I would say it’s just too early to tell whether that trade dispute between the U.S. and the EU is going to have (an impact)on our industry and to what degree,” Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells told reporters on a call. “We wouldn’t be immune from a trade war but I think it’s important to remember how resilient Diageo is, given the broad portfolio,” she added."

The main stock market index inched lower by 0.2%, but still outperformed its U.S. and European counterparts, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was up 0.2% with gains led by aerospace firm Cobham that surged after a buyout offer. Diageo slumped 3.4% after its capital return plans were less than what some analysts had expected, though the company reported higher annual profit helped by the popularity of its “Game of Thrones” inspired scotch. Software firm Sage and information and analytics provider Relx slumped 10.4% and 3.7%, respectively, after downbeat updates, while consumer goods giant Unilever fell as rainy weather hit ice cream sales in Europe and North America. Helping contain the losses was AstraZeneca, which jumped nearly 8% to an all-time high after raising its annual product sales forecast, as cancer drugs helped its second-quarter results beat analysts’ estimates. Market sentiment broadly weakened after the European Central Bank meeting, in which ECB President Mario Draghi all but pledged to ease policy further as the growth outlook deteriorates, and said that there was no discussion of a rate cut. “Draghi indicated they didn’t really even discuss a cut today so that’s what surprised the market and that’s why we’re seeing this reversal, but it doesn’t change the bigger picture,” said Jeremy Gatto, investment manager at Cross Assets Solutions team in Unigestion. Among midcaps, Cobham soared 34.5% to 165.8 pence, roughly matching the 165 pence per share offered by U.S. private equity group Advent International that valued the London-listed company at $5 billion. “It’s the latest sign that more firms are happy to go private and take them out of the glare of public markets,” Wilson said. “It’s also a sign that weakness in sterling continues to make UK companies attractive to foreign buyers.” However, gains on the FTSE 250 were kept in check by Metro Bank, which plunged more than 19% to an all-time low after it disclosed that customers had pulled 2 billion pounds out this year following an accounting error and said its founder would stand down as chairman. Shares of Aston Martin, which shed over a quarter of their value after the luxury carmaker cut its 2019 volumes forecast in the previous session, fell another 18%, deepening its losses for the year to 47%.

Last week, the unions rejected a 2.5% pay raise. Diageo is the maker of whiskies including Johnnie Walker, Black & White, Lagavulin and Talisker. It has 29 distilleries in Scotland and most of the whisky it produces there is exported to 180 countries around the world. “During these talks it soon became clear that no progress would be made because the company have attempted to repackage the pay offer making it appear more generous,” Unite’s regional industrial officer, Bob McGregor, said. “The reality is that the latest offer is just as insulting as the previous one, and our members won’t be conned or denied what they deserve,” he said in an email.

6.336256912604971," Pernod confident on Asia, Jacob's Creek selling well in China PARIS (Reuters) - Drinks group Pernod Ricard, which is being targeted by activist investor Elliot, sounded confident on Tuesday over its growth prospects in Asia including for wines such as its Jacob’s Creek brand. Pernod, the world’s second-largest spirits group after Diageo, said it was “uniquely positioned” to quench a thirst for premium drinks, from a fast-growing, affluent middle class in Asia. The French company said growth would continue to be fueled by strong demand for its Martell cognac and Chivas whisky in China, and for its Seagram’s whiskies in India. It was also banking on a reorganization of its business in Korea and a diversification of its brands, sales channels and markets to drive its future growth. Digital acceleration and the launch of Seagram’s whiskies in Vietnam, the Philippines and Myanmar would also help it win over clients from the sector tagged as new ‘Middle Income and Affluent Consumers’ (MAC), it said. Pernod is under pressure from U.S. hedge fund Elliott to improve profit margins and corporate governance. In February, Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns under a three-year strategic plan that Elliott described as a first, small step. China is the group’s largest market after the United States, accounting for around 10% of total group sales, and the company said that it still aimed to double the size of the imported spirits market in China to 2% by 2025. Its goal in the country was to “educate and recruit new customers” through its luxury, prestige, premium and wine sales channels, Asia CEO Philippe Guettat told a call. Australian brand Jacob’s Creek was leading the group’s wine portfolio in China, with double-digit sales growth, “which would suggest that Jacob’s Creek remains strategic to China,” Jefferies analysts noted. There has been recurring speculation that Pernod Ricard was considering the sale of its wine division, which includes Jacob’s Creek and Spain’s Campo Viejo and makes roughly 5 percent of group sales. Asked if the group could buy a brand of the Chinese liquor baiju, Guettat said: “Clearly it’s a category we are observing and looking at but there is no action, not even intention announced by Pernod Ricard at this stage” Guettat also said he “would not expect any impact” on Pernod Ricard’s business in China from a government’s controversial “social credit system” to nudge Chinese citizens to adopt good behavior, including motivating them to pay debts and fines, as the system did not relate to alcohol consumption. Pernod’s Asia businesses saw organic sales growth of 15% in the first nine-months of its fiscal year 2019, outpacing group sales growth of 6.3% and driven by a 21% jump in China and a 19% increase in India."

Elliott has suggested 500 million euros (437 million pounds) in cost cuts and options such as merging with another spirits company. The hedge fund, which has become increasingly active in Europe in recent years, issued a statement on Friday after Pernod’s results this week when the group raised its profit growth outlook for 2018-2019 and unveiled new margin goals in a three-year strategy plan. “Pernod’s half-year earnings announcement confirmed the strong growth potential and solid financial performance of the company. It also reflected a first small step in starting to address the company’s shortcomings in operational efficiency,” Elliott said. Last month, Pernod Ricard took a step towards improving its governance, naming Patricia Barbizet to the newly created role of lead independent director. Nevertheless, Elliott on Friday made clear it wanted more. “Necessary enhancements to the company’s board and corporate governance have yet to be addressed,” Elliott said. Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard, 46-year-old grandson of the firm’s founder, made sales growth his top priority when he took over in 2015 and has defended his long-term value strategy. Elliott has blamed Pernod’s underperformance in part on what it views as poor governance, having highlighted that Pernod’s 15-member board needs more diversity and independence, since many directors are linked to the Ricard family. One indicator of the family’s influence, which was controversial, was double-voting rights at Pernod Ricard, a source familiar with the situation said. Most French companies have a two-year period before an investor can get these rights while at Pernod Ricard it is 10 years, restricting the influence of outsiders. Elliott also said Pernod’s targeted savings of 100 million euros and a margin step-up of 50-60 basis points per year over the next three years were “modest goals” for a company of its size. Liberum analysts, which had hoped for a margin step up of some 150 basis points, also called Pernod’s plan a “a bit soft”. Pernod shares traded 0.6 percent lower by 1115 GMT. A spokesman for Pernod Ricard told Reuters that its first-half results this week showed how its strategy was working, and that Pernod “remains focused on executing its strategy plan while continuing a regular dialogue with all its shareholders”."

The FTSE 100 added 0.4 percent after earlier hitting its highest level in nearly three weeks, while the midcap index handed back earlier gains to close 0.6 percent lower. A positive tone was initially set with Asian shares bouncing to a four-month high after the Federal Reserve pledged it will be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing global growth. The blue chips handily outperformed their European peers on Thursday and were on course for their best monthly performance since April. But UK markets saw some of that cheer fade as weakness from Europe spilled over with data showing that the euro zone economy stuck to its lowest pace of growth in four years in 2018’s last three months. On the other hand, uncertainties mounted for Britain with the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator saying that time was too short to find an alternative to the Irish border arrangement agreed in their divorce deal, as London wants. Topping the FTSE 100, Diageo, the world’s largest spirits company, jumped 4.7 percent to a record high after it reported higher half-year sales and announced a share buyback. Oil major Shell, the highest valued FTSE 100 firm, was close behind after it reported a forecast-beating 36-percent surge in 2018 profits as cost savings kicked in. That helped oil stocks climb 3 percent and notch their biggest intra-day gain in three months. Water utilities Severn Trent and United Utilities advanced 2.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively after regulator Ofwat approved their five-year business plans. But investors shunned the banking sector after a Bloomberg report that Deutsche Bank was expecting a merger with rival Commerzbank if efforts to restructure fall short of targets. “You take two banks which are struggling and have been really underperforming in comparison to their British or American counterparts and you consider shoving them together just to take pressure away from it ...” “... two weak banks doesn’t give you one larger strong bank,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. The report dragged down shares in Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, as well as British banks that dipped nearly 2 percent to their worst day since early December. The so called “Big Five” lenders - HSBC, Barclays , Lloyds, Standard Chartered and Royal Bank of Scotland - all lost big on the main index. Mid-cap Metro Bank plunged 11 percent to a new record low after the lender said Britain’s Prudential Regulation Authority had first discovered “potential inconsistencies” on its books, rather than Metro discovering the mistakes independently. Some other notable fallers were telecoms giant BT and Unilever, while asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen tumbled 5 percent after a downgrade by Morgan Stanley to “equal-weight”. “In 2019 we expect market conditions to remain challenging,” Unilever’s new chief executive Alan Jope said. RPC rose 4 percent, biggest support to the midcap index, after U.S.-based Berry Global said it was considering an offer for the packaging firm following Apollo Global Management’s 3.3 billion pounds ($4.33 billion) deal. “What a difference a month makes, from the doom and gloom of December, January looks set to see some decent gains as investors look at the latest earnings numbers,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson."
11.453510319884678," Spirits firm Diageo hits new high as China sales surge (Reuters) - Diageo, the world’s largest spirits company, beat half-year earnings and sales forecasts on stronger demand from China and India and said it would buy back 660 million pounds ($866 million) of shares, sending its stock to a new high on Thursday. Shares in the maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch and Smirnoff vodka, which also raised its dividend by 5 percent, climbed as much as 4.3 percent to 2,903 pence to top Britain’s FTSE-100 index. They were up 4.1 percent at 2,887 pence at 1008 GMT. Diageo said organic net sales - excluding currency moves and one-off items as well as acquisitions and disposals - leapt 20 percent in China, helped by strong demand for Scotch and Chinese white spirits and allaying concerns of any impact from a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. “Diageo has the strength of brands and global reach to be able to prosper in almost any environment. Diageo generates a lot of cash and the company threw off another 1.3 billion pounds in these last six months alone,” said Steve Clayton, manager of Hargreaves Lansdown Select funds. French rival Remy Cointreau also struck a confident tone over its prospects in China this month. Diageo has been restructuring in recent years to improve performance and streamline its portfolio by selling non-core businesses and underperforming labels, while trying to bulk up on newer, hipper brands. It has looked to focus on its Scotch business and grow its operations in India and the United States. In India, organic net sales rose 12 percent in the six months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, when the country’s top court imposed some restrictions on alcohol sale. Diageo stuck to its overall forecast for mid-single-digit organic net sales growth for the year ending June 30, and for a 175 basis point increase in its operating margin for the three years to that date. First-half organic net sales rose 7.5 percent to 6.91 billion pounds ($9.07 billion), beating analysts’ average forecast for a 5.5 percent rise. Exchange rate moves shaved 91 million pounds off half-year sales and will lower the full-year total by 80 million pounds, Diageo estimated. Earnings of 77 pence per share, excluding one-time items, also beat forecasts of 71.4 pence, according to a company-supplied consensus. Diageo said it booked an exceptional pre-tax gain of 154 million pounds from its recent sale of 19 lower-end brands, including Seagrams VO Canadian whisky, for $550 million. The company said the latest share buyback would take the total repurchase program to up to 3 billion pounds for the year ending June 30. ($1 = 0.7616 pounds)"

The FTSE 100 was up 0.7 percent by 0848 GMT after hitting its highest level in nearly three weeks, while the midcap index rose 0.6 percent to their highest since last November.

The EU promptly reiterated that the deal was not open for renegotiation.

12.32621677271448," Breakingviews - Pernod Ricard served a shot of Diageo by Elliott PARIS (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s getting increasingly crowded at the bar for shareholder activists in Europe, but it’s still possible to get a good drink. Elliott Advisors, the U.S. hedge fund manager, has found another decent tipple in the form of Pernod Ricard, the French purveyor of booze like Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal whisky. Even though it trails its rival Diageo on some counts, the family-run firm with a 39 billion euro market capitalisation is not low-hanging fruit. It has even bested Diageo when it comes to share-price performance. But narrowing the gap on profitability, and improving governance, as Elliott urges, are worthy and achievable objectives that Pernod’s management – and family descendants controlling 20 percent of the stock – can come to share. In their last fiscal years ended in June, Diageo managed to convert 31 percent of its net sales into operating profit. Pernod managed just a 26 percent margin. That suggests an improvement of some 460 million euros to shoot for on the 9.2 billion euros of sauce that the French group is expected to sell in its 2019 fiscal year, according to Refinitiv data. Put those extra earnings on Pernod Ricard’s existing enterprise value multiple of 18 times, and up to 8 billion euros of extra value could be extracted, equating to a bump of some 20 percent in the stock price before Elliott placed its order. Pernod is two-thirds the size of Diageo in sales, so entirely squeezing out the difference won’t be simple, but it’s probably the chief reason the fund calls Pernod “one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the industry”. A little extra pressure on Alexandre Ricard, the chairman, chief executive and grandson of the founder, will help. Though Pernod recently added Patricia Barbizet, a veteran independent director, the board is heavy on family members, insiders and representatives of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the investment company of the late Albert Frere. Adding directors with more industry expertise, and insight into growth markets like Asia shouldn’t be a stretch. Potential improvements aside, Pernod isn’t a big laggard. Over the past five years, its shares have provided a total annualised return, including dividends, of 14.4 percent compared to Diageo’s 12 percent, Refinitiv data show. Spiked with a bit more profitability, and a twist of better governance, and Pernod could even join its bigger competitor on the top shelf."
8.457731601052826," Diageo to sell 19 brands to U.S.-based Sazerac for $550 million (Reuters) - Diageo Plc DGE.L is selling 19 lower-end spirits brands including Seagrams VO Canadian whisky and Goldschlager cinnamon schnapps to U.S.-based Sazerac for $550 million, as it focuses on its premium labels such as Johnnie Walker in the United States. The divestiture is the latest move from the world’s largest spirits company to trim its portfolio and concentrate more closely on its core business. In recent years, it has sold interests in wine, Red Stripe beer and the Gleneagles hotel and golf resort. Diageo, also known for Smirnoff vodka and Guinness stout, said on Monday it would return the net proceeds of about 340 million pounds ($438 million) to shareholders through a share repurchase. The sale, which also includes whisky brands such as Seagram’s 83, Seagram’s Five Star and Jamaican rum Myers’s, will reduce Diageo’s pre-exceptional earnings per share by 1.9 pence per share in the first full financial year after closing. Yet it will improve growth in Diageo’s U.S. spirits business by 40 to 50 basis points, its chief financial officer told Reuters, by shifting the business away from the low end of the market, where sales are falling as more drinkers choose premium labels. “The value space has been in secular decline for a number of years, so we see the bigger growth opportunity and focus for our business in premium and above,” CFO Kathryn Mikells said. Berenberg analyst Javier Gonzalez Lastra said the brands Diageo is selling were seeing sales decline by as much as 10 percent a year. Sky News reported here in May that the company was in talks to sell some U.S.-focused brands for an overall price tag of between $500 million and $1 billion. But the deal struck with Sazerac does not include the large Seagram’s 7 Crown American whiskey brand, Mikells noted. The company is keeping that brand, while selling the Canadian Seagram’s whisky. The North American region is the biggest market for premium drinks in the world, and accounts for a third of the British company’s sales and nearly half its operating profit. Aside from pruning its portfolio, Diageo has been expanding the reach and improving the marketing of premium, global brands like Johnnie Walker. It has also done a number of acquisitions, including last year’s purchase of George Clooney’s tequila Casamigos and this year’s purchase of Belsazar vermouth. Mikells said Diageo was “very happy” with its current portfolio, but noted that the company would look at it periodically over the long term. Regarding the beer business, which has sometimes been touted by outsiders as a potential divestiture, Mikells said Diageo considered it “a core business,” and its key brand Guinness a high-end name consistent with its focus on premium labels. Asked if Diageo was interested in entering the cannabis market, Mikells said Diageo was watching it closely, but so far had not seen any impact to its business from legalization of marijuana in Canada or parts of the United States. “It’s very early days and I think there isn’t really enough clear data to be certain exactly what, if any, impact it may have,” she said. U.S. liquor sales hit a record $26.2 billion in 2017, fueled by high-end brown spirits like bourbon, and a big thirst for tequila and vodka, the Distilled Spirits Council, an industry group, said in February. Diageo, part of the UK’s blue-chip index, said it expects the sale to close in early 2019 and to bring in a one-time gain of roughly 110 million pounds. The company has also agreed to long-term supply contracts with Louisiana, U.S.-based Sazerac. Sazerac, which traces its roots to the early 19th century, is an independent, family owned company in the United States, home to brands such as Buffalo Trace and Pappy Van Winkle bourbon.

4.231130015202232," Pernod Ricard cautions of slower growth after stellar quarter PARIS (Reuters) - Demand in China and India powered a 10.4 percent rise in quarterly sales for France's Pernod Ricard PERP.PA, helping the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell cognac offset slower progress in its main U.S. market. Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits group behind Britain's Diageo DGE.L, however cautioned sales growth would moderate in the full 2018-19 financial year, notably for Martell cognac in China after a stellar first quarter. Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard told Reuters his group was closely monitoring trade tensions between the United States and China, although the company had yet not seen any impact from it on demand for its products in China. He predicted Chinese sales would still grow at a double-digit pace this year. Pernod said that despite an uncertain geopolitical and monetary environment, it was keeping its forecast for a 5-7 percent organic rise in full-year profit from recurring operations after last year’s 6.3 percent growth. Its financial year runs until the end of June. Pernod shares added 0.8 percent by 0915 GMT, with the stock down less than 1 percent so far in 2018. The company has a valuation of around 34.5 billion euros ($39.8 billion). “The consensus is at the high-end of this range at 6.8 percent, while the Asia results are strong, the company is clearly indicating that investors cannot rely on that kind of growth in Asia,” said Liberum analysts in a note. “In light of some softer results in the U.S. and Europe, we wonder if consensus might drift back towards the mid-point of that range,” they added. Pernod’s first quarter sales came in at 2.387 billion euros ($2.74 billion), a like-for-like rise of 10.4 percent that beat analysts’ estimates for 7.4 percent like-for-like growth. Pernod said it benefited from advance shipments in China ahead of the Mid-Autumn and Chinese New Year festivities and from a low year-ago comparison in India, where it has faced setbacks including a ban on liquor outlets. The group, whose other brands include Jameson whiskey, said sales in India rose 34 percent in the quarter, while in China sales leapt to 27 percent in the first quarter, led by strong demand for Martell cognac and by double-digit growth in Chivas whisky. Pernod said it would benefit in the first half from the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year, but growth would then moderate. In the United States, where sales were up 2 percent in the quarter, Jameson whiskey continued its double-digit growth but the Absolut vodka brand was still in decline. Pernod tied the overall slower growth in the U.S. to high year-ago comparables when demand had been boosted by strong demand in anticipation of price hikes in Jameson whiskey and Tequila notably in California, but said the underlying trend remained broadly in line with that of a growing market.

0.19166844120749657," Smirnoff-maker Diageo's sales set for currency hangover (Reuters) - British spirits maker Diageo DGE.L flagged a bigger than expected sales hit from currency movements on Thursday, an early indication of the potential impact of recent volatility on companies with emerging market revenues. However, the maker of Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka said its performance from the start of the year was in line with expectations and its organic sales would grow in line with last year. Diageo, which has operations across 180 countries, said it expected currency effects to knock 175 million pounds off net sales, compared to a previous estimate of 70 million pounds, which would wipe 45 million pounds off its full-year profit, up from an earlier estimate of 10 million pounds. While Diageo’s revenue from emerging markets like India or China suffers as their currencies weaken, it is helped by the strengthening of the dollar which has driven such moves. The currency hit represents just a fraction of the 12 billion pounds Diageo reported in full-year sales last year and the spirit maker’s shares were broadly unchanged. “The FX update is worth less than 1 percent to EPS but shares already largely reflect the move,” analysts from brokerage Jefferies said in a note on the update. “The year has started well.” Diageo said its organic net sales growth in 2019 would be “broadly” in line with last fiscal year when it grew organic sales by 5 percent. The company said that it continued to expect operating margins growth of 175 basis points in the three years ending June 30, 2019. Diageo, which suffers when sterling rises against the dollar because it reduces the value of its largely foreign sales, assumed average rates of the pound at $1.35 when it reported results in July , compared to $1.27 a year ago. Sterling, hurt by worries over Brexit and the rise in U.S. interest rates, was trading around $1.3150 on Thursday."
