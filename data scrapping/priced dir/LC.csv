-59.16795069337443," LendingClub to acquire Radius Bank for $185 million NEW YORK (Reuters) - LendingClub Corp on Tuesday agreed to buy U.S. digital lender Radius Bank in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $185 million, as it looks to gain access to a cheaper source of funding and offer a broader suite of banking services. The San Francisco-based online lender, which had previously disclosed it was looking to secure a national bank charter, said the acquisition will enable it to diversify its revenue stream and enhance resiliency. Boston-based Radius has more than $1.4 billion in assets and offers checking and savings accounts online. “It’s a no-brainer,” LendingCorp Chief Executive Scott Sanborn said in an interview. “Adding the capabilities of a bank charter to the LendingClub mix really changes the game both in terms of what we can do for our customers and what we can do for shareholders.” The deal, which marks the first time a U.S. fintech company has bought a bank, requires approval by U.S. federal banking regulators, but LendingClub believes the process will be faster than applying for a new bank charter, executives said. The company has been in discussions with regulators for over a year and expects the approval process to take 12 to 15 months, Sanborn said on a call with analysts. LendingClub is known as a pioneer of so-called peer-to-peer lending, a model that connects consumers looking for loans online with individuals or institutional investors such as banks. Unlike banks, which tend to have lower-cost and more stable deposits, online lenders rely on market funding that can be harder to come by in times of stress and is more expensive. LendingClub said the deal will allow it to save $40 million a year in bank fees and funding costs. Like many of its peers, over the past few years LendingClub has faced questions from investors on its ability to grow fast while keeping the quality of its loans in check. Its shares have fallen more than 88% over the past five years. The acquisition comes as other fintech companies, such as payments processor Square Inc, seek to secure national bank licenses, a lengthy and cumbersome process. Online banking startup Varo Money, last week said it had secured approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the latest step in a multi-year endeavor. LendingClub’s deal will enable the firm to offer checking accounts, making it the latest fintech to enter online banking. The company believes it will be better positioned than competitors as it already has an established consumer lending franchise, Sanborn said. Separately, the online lender reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit helped by higher loan originations. LendingClub forecast 2020 revenue of $790 million to $820 million, below analysts’ average estimate of $869.6 million. The company said it expects to post adjusted net income of $17 million to $37 million for the year, the mid-point of which is below expectations of $34.5 million.

For the first quarter, the company expects net revenue between $162 million and $172 million, below analysts’ estimates of $181.2 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. LendingClub also forecast a first-quarter loss between $20 million and $15 million, compared to Wall Street estimates of a loss of $5.14 million. For the full-year 2019, LendingClub forecast a loss that was bigger than Wall Street estimates. However, the company said it was targeting profitability on an adjusted basis in the second half of the year. LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn said in an interview that the lower-than-expected guidance was due in part to seasonal weakness in the first quarter and economic uncertainty both in the United States and overseas. “There is a lot of uncertainty both globally and domestically,” Sanborn said. He added that the company would focus on achieving profitability in the second half of the year by cutting costs through initiatives such as outsourcing some business processes. The company plans to transition its loan servicing platform, to an off-the-shelf solution operated by a third party, Sanborn said. This would allow LendingClub to redeploy engineers to more “value-add” activities, Sanborn said.

The company said it now expects 2018 adjusted earnings of between $89 million and $94 million, up from a previous range of $75 million to $90 million. LendingClub shares were up 1.4 percent at $3.69 in extended trading on Tuesday. The company originated a record $2.9 billion of loans on its platform in the quarter, up 18.2 percent. Its overall quarterly revenue rose 20 percent to $184.6 million, with transaction fee revenue up 13 percent. “We had another record quarter, driven by strong borrowing and investor demand,” Tom Casey, LendingClub’s Chief Financial Officer, said on a call with analysts. LendingClub is one of the best-known companies that runs an online marketplace connecting consumers looking for loans to individuals or institutional investors, such as banks. The San Francisco lender has been working to restore investor confidence after an internal investigation in May 2016 into a series of loan malpractices led to the ouster of then-CEO and founder Renaud Laplanche. The incident also led to a drop in loan originations. Since then, the company has worked to turn itself around by cutting costs and enhancing its marketing tactics, in particular working to entice consumers to become return customers. The company’s third-quarter results reflected “delivery against the plan” LendingClub laid out for investors late last year, Chief Executive Scott Sanborn said in a call with analysts. LendingClub also announced that it plans to open an office near Salt Lake City, Utah, to house its operations staff. The initiative aims to help drive down costs by reducing its need for more expensive San Francisco real estate space. “We’ll benefit from lower real estate and staffing costs, which will give us greater long-term scalability and operating leverage,” Casey said.

Shares were down 2.4 percent at $3.99 in after-hours trading. Chief Executive Scott Sanborn said in an interview that while the company’s patient and education finance unit was performing well it “was not growing at the rate we had anticipated when we acquired it.” LendingClub had acquired the business in 2014 for $140 million. The company’s second-quarter net loss widened to $60.9 million from $25.5 million a year earlier, due largely to two extraordinary expenses including a $36.5 million goodwill impairment for the patient and education finance unit. Excluding one-time items, LendingClub earned 3 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose to a record $177 million from $140 million but a 44 percent jump in operating expenses contributed to the wider loss for the San Francisco-based online lender. San Francisco-based LendingClub is one of the most prominent firms in a cohort of tech-savvy companies that connect consumers looking for loans with individuals or institutional investors such as banks through its website. It has been seeking to turn itself around since May 2016, when an internal investigation into a series of loan malpractices led to the ouster of then-CEO and founder Renaud Laplanche. The incident caused the volume of loans originated through the company to drop and investors to leave the platform. LendingClub has since sought to boost growth by improving its marketing and getting customers to return to its platform when looking for another loan. These efforts are paying off, Sanborn said. In the most recent quarter, LendingClub originated a record $2.82 billion in loans, up 31 percent from a year earlier. “Since our inception, about a quarter of our more than two million members have gone back to us at least once for another loan,” Sanborn said on a call with analysts. Earnings were also boosted by higher revenue from transaction fees which rose 27 percent to $136 million in the second quarter ended June 30. LendingClub maintained its forecast for 2018 revenue of between $680 million and $705 million.

Its shares have fallen more than 88 percent since its initial public offering in late 2014. In the complaint, the FTC alleges that “hundreds or even thousands of dollars” in upfront fees were subtracted from the loans disbursed to consumers. LendingClub was allegedly aware that many consumers did not know about these up-front fees, according to the complaint. The company listed “I didn’t receive the full loan amount” in training materials for its customer service representatives as one of the main complaints, the complaint alleges.
