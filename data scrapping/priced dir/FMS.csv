In its first forecasts factoring in the impact of the pandemic, the company said it expected adjusted net income this year within a range of down 4% to up 1% from last year, and revenue growth of 3-6%. That compares with previous forecasts for growth of 1-5%, and 4-7%, respectively. The company’s shares were down 4.2% at 1320 GMT. “Our base case is that a major second COVID-19 wave in our relevant markets can be prevented. Instead, we should continue to see local and regional outbreaks,” Chief Executive Stephan Sturm said in a conference call. The pandemic has been a mixed blessing for healthcare companies, bringing increased demand for selected products and services but also delays in treatments and extra expenses. While the number of post-acute treatments should gradually recover, postponed site inspections will cut Fresenius’ 2020 product launches by about 30% and project delays may last well into the second half, Sturm said. Fresenius’ second-quarter net income came in at 410 million euros ($483 million), down 13% year-on-year but above analysts’ mean forecast of 398 million euros in a company-provided poll. The company pointed to easing demand for painkillers and sedatives to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients after a surge in the first quarter, and a slower-than-expected recovery in China after its coronavirus outbreak was brought under control. Fresenius Medical Care, the group’s separately listed dialysis unit, confirmed its 2020 targets, citing a strong underlying performance and receding pandemic effects, after reporting second-quarter net income 8% above consensus."

11.282441183025622," Fresenius reports Q1 net income beat on pandemic demand (Reuters) - Healthcare group Fresenius FREG.DE beat first-quarter net income expectations on Wednesday, citing a U.S. and European spike in demand for drugs and devices for COVID-19 patients and government help with costs incurred by health providers. Healthcare companies worldwide have benefited from subsidies and increased demand as a result of the coronavirus crisis, but they have also faced new costs, including protective gear. Fresenius’ first-quarter net income was 465 million euros ($503.97 million), above analysts’ average forecast of 421.8 million euros, a Refinitiv poll found. “It is, however, too early to say with any certainty what impact COVID-19 will have on the company’s full business year,” Chief Executive Stephan Sturm said in a statement. On April 7, Fresenius’ infusion drug unit Kabi said it was trying to meet demand by focusing on products used in COVID-19 patients, such as sedatives and painkillers. Increased demand should last into the second quarter, so Kabi’s performance should not decrease from the first three months of 2020, Sturm told a conference call. Fresenius said its hospital-operating unit Helios overcame pandemic-related costs as the German government is compensating hospitals for procedures they cancel to focus on COVID-19 patients. It pays 560 euros for every missed treatment day compared to 2019. Helios is waiting to see how much compensation it can get for its Spanish division, which treated 13% of all COVID-19 inpatients in the country, Sturm said. The group said it would revisit its 2020 guidance when publishing results for the second quarter, when it expects a greater COVID-19 effect than in the first three months of 2020, although it does not see an impact on dividend payments. The company is also not considering issuing equity as it expects reduced investment as some projects are delayed from this year to the next, Sturm said. Fresenius' separately-listed dialysis unit, Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) FMEG.DE, also reported better-than-expected first-quarter net income, saying patients' continued need for dialysis offset pandemic-related costs of about 30 million euros. FMC’s earnings were also spurred by a switch to generic dialysis drugs, high demand for its Novalung respirator alternative and the fact that dialysis patients with COVID-19 are more likely to need acute blood purification, the company’s spokesman said. The dialysis specialist is also set to receive U.S. state aid, but the amount will depend on the development of the pandemic, FMC said. Both companies were among the biggest risers on Germany's blue chip index .GDAXI with Fresenius up 2.7% and its dialysis unit up 2.4% at 1450 GMT."

-2.4512078554564427," Fresenius forecasts 2020 profit growth driven by drug, dialysis units (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius FREG.DE said it expects net income to increase in 2020 after strong growth in its dialysis business, and in its infusion drugs unit in emerging markets, helped it to just beat fourth quarter expectations. Following a tumultuous 2018 when Fresenius issued several profit warnings, last year was marked by investment and stabilization, with the group’s management pointing to an improvement from 2020 onwards. Separately-listed dialysis unit Fresenius Medical Care FMEG.DE, which generated 49% of the group's quarterly revenue, on Wednesday reported in-line results saying record growth in home care dialysis offset the one-off effects of an ongoing legal dispute. Home care has been a growth area for the world’s largest kidney dialysis provider, but it has been critical of hard targets set by President Donald Trump’s administration for treating more patients with kidney disease at home. While the company is confident the administration will soften its initial goals in this area, FMC expects home dialysis to account for between 25% and 30% of treatments in the U.S. by 2025, up from 13% now, Chief Executive Rice Powell told Reuters. Despite some softness in North America, group fourth-quarter adjusted operating income came in at 1.29 billion euros ($1.39 billion), slightly above the 1.25 billion euros expected on average by analysts in a company-provided consensus. Fresenius said it expected 2020 net income to rise between 1% and 5% in constant currency terms and confirmed mid-term forecasts, saying growth, efficiency improvements and its biosimilars business should all bolster earnings. It said it was too early to quantify the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China, which has killed 2,100 and infected 74,000 while disrupting the global economy. Chief Executive Stephan Sturm told a news conference the infusion drugs division Kabi was the most exposed, but the effect would likely not be significant for the unit or group. In a separate statement, Fresenius announced a joint venture between Kabi and Swiss rival Vifor Pharma VIFN.S to provide iron deficiency treatments in China. The group’s Helios hospital division, which has continued to stabilize in Germany and grow in Spain, will keep looking for opportunities to expand this year after making several acquisitions in Colombia, Sturm said. Fresenius shares closed 2.3% higher while FMC ended the day up 3.7%."
-2.4512078554564427," FMC sees U.S. government easing home dialysis goals FRANKFURT, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) , the world’s largest kidney dialysis provider, is confident the U.S. government will soften initial targets for treating patients with kidney disease at home rather than in dedicated centres. Chief Executive Rice Powell told Reuters a goal laid out by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last July for 80% of new patients to undergo dialysis at home or receive organ transplants by 2025 was under review amid industry criticism. While Fresenius is developing less bulky and easier-to-use dialysis equipment and smartphone apps for home treatment, Powell said dialysis companies risked financial penalties if they kept patients who were deemed unsuitable for home treatment in dialysis centres under the new goals. Speaking after the release of fourth quarter results, he said patients and physicians should be allowed to decide whether they wanted to make a change. “We said to the government you can’t dictate this. You can’t make this mandatory.” He said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was likely to rework the executive order this year, hopefully in time for an October investor event where FMC plans to map out its five-year business goals. The government is keen to rein in the $114 billion spent each year to treat chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Powell said that while his company had no influence over kidney transplant rates it was feasible to have 25% to 30% of FMC’s patients treated at home by 2025, up from 13% now. The advantages of home dialysis means blood can also be cleansed while a patient sleeps, which allows about 40% of patients to continue working. On the downside, it requires help from a family member, space for medical gear in the home and confidence to operate it. Those factors put hard limits on the government’s ambitions to encourage a change in medical practice, Powell argued. Closest rival DaVita Inc and FMC between them operate more than 5,000 U.S. dialysis clinics, controlling around 70 percent of the market. FMC, which acquired home dialysis specialist NxStage Medical for $2 billion a year ago, runs almost 2,600 dialysis centres in North America and a total of 4,000 globally. Powell said home treatment resulted in lower staffing expenses but the government should initially refrain from offering financial incentives to keep patients out of dialysis centres. “I believe enough in it that if I got diagnosed tomorrow...I would do (dialysis) at home – because I want to work,” said Powell.

14.52868359418013," UPDATE 3-Fresenius beats Q3 forecasts with strong sales of home dialysis treatments * Fresenius and FMC beat Q3 consensus, confirm outlook * Home dialysis growth offsets ESCO effect at FMC * Fresenius highlights infusion drugs unit growth in emerging markets (Adds details from conference call and analyst comments, updates share price) Oct 29 (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius beat third-quarter revenue forecasts on Tuesday, citing a solid performance by its infusion drugs unit in emerging markets and strong growth in home treatment at its separately listed dialysis business. The group said both Fresenius Medical Care, the world’s largest provider of dialysis treatments, and drugmaker Kabi saw strong organic growth in Asia and Europe, more than offsetting weak U.S. markets. Fresenius confirmed its full-year guidance after third-quarter revenues rose by 8% to 8.9 billion euros ($9.86 billion) in the third quarter, compared to 8.7 billion euros in a company-compiled consensus. Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe said the results showed “a strong underlying business, which should help regain trust after a 12-month period with rather mediocre results.” Shares in Fresenius were up 2.7%, while Fresenius Medical Care were up 4.7% at 1350 GMT, topping Germany’s blue-chip index . Fresenius’ Helios unit, which runs private hospitals in Germany and Spain, also reported good growth. The hospital operator is monitoring a consolidation trend which appears to be gaining momentum in the German hospital market and will “take a closer look at any suitable opportunity,” Fresenius CEO Stephan Sturm said during a conference call. Helios will also open a new mid-sized hospital in Barcelona by 2022 after opening two outpatient centres in the Spanish cities of Toledo and Algeciras this year, Sturm added. Analysts said investors were relieved that a summer slowdown at Helios and a further negative impact from a U.S. dialysis treatment coordination programme known as ESCO had not materialized. “Our businesses developed solidly in the third quarter, keeping Fresenius on track to deliver the results that we promised earlier this year,” Sturm said in a statement. Fresenius Medical Care reported a 9% rise in its third-quarter revenue, driven by record growth in home dialysis in North America as its investment in NxStage, a U.S. maker of home-use dialysis machines FMC acquired earlier this year, started to pay off. Shares in FMC, which remains exposed to changes in U.S. healthcare policy with 70% of its revenue coming from North America, had lagged the European health sector index since July when President Donald Trump’s administration set goals to move more kidney disease treatment out of dialysis clinics and into patients’ homes. While this could hurt FMC’s business of running the clinics, the company stands to benefit from its investment in home dialysis systems, softening the potential impact, analysts have said. Analysts at Berenberg said in a note that the dialysis company’s revenues and EBIT were “better than they look” since they “included an €84m headwind related to an ongoing billing dispute (we suspect with the US Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Thus on an underlying basis revenues were actually around 2% better than we and consensus had expected.” FMC’s earnings came in slightly above expectations despite a negative adjustment for income from the ESCO programme, established to coordinate the care of dialysis patients. The “ESCO effect” reduced third quarter revenue and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by 46 million euros, and made a 33 million euro dent in net income, the company said. In the second quarter, FMC lowered the range for an expected ESCO programme lump-sum reimbursement by 41 million euros. FMC’s third-quarter sales totalled 4.4 billion euros, a touch above analysts’ average forecast of 4.3 billion euros in a company-compiled consensus. Fresenius Medical Care confirmed its 2019 guidance of adjusted revenue growth between 3% and 7% at constant exchange rates, and adjusted net income change to be in the range of between 2% higher and 2% lower than last year. For 2020, the company expects adjusted revenue as well as adjusted net income to grow at a mid to high single digit rate."

1.1794430767772357," UPDATE 4-Fresenius slides as weakness in dialysis unit offsets improved outlook * Fresenius expects FY 4%-7% revenue growth at constant currency * Fresenius highlights strong emerging markets growth * Concerns about U.S. cost savings weigh on FMC (Updates share prices, adds CEO M&A comments) July 30 (Reuters) - Shares in German healthcare group Fresenius slid on Tuesday after its dialysis unit FMC reported smaller than expected cost savings and said full-year earnings growth would likely come in at the lower end of guidance. That assessment overshadowed an increase in Fresenius’s full-year revenue target following strong generic drug sales in emerging markets. Fresenius shares were down 2.9% at 1450 GMT, while those of dialysis unit Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) slid 5.2%, making it the second biggest loser on Germany’s blue-chip DAX index Analysts said the market was focusing on FMC’s updated assessment of its participation in a U.S. government programme for kidney disease care, ESCO, which sparked a 41 million euro ($45.70 million) drop in revenue in the second quarter. FMC Chief Executive Rice Powell said it had cut the savings ratio for the programme, which it uses to calculate sales and earnings “as a precautionary measure”, though it maintained its overall outlook. “The savings rate is lower than we had anticipated and hoped for,” Powell told analysts in a call, adding the adjustment was not part of the company’s planning when it issued full-year guidance in February. As a result, FMC believes it will be closer to the lower end of its adjusted net income growth guidance for 2019, Powell said. Asked whether there was a risk of more substantial corrections linked to the programme, financial chief Mike Brosnan said: “That 41 million euro adjustment was substantial, so I’d like to think the worst is behind us.” The update weighed on the margins of the company’s coordinated care business, JP Morgan said, adding that FMC had also been hit by lower product sales in Europe. Fresenius, FMC’s parent, meanwhile highlighted continued strong growth of its generic infusions unit Kabi in markets including China, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, while noting increased competition and easing shortages in the United States. The group could consider small and medium acquisitions opportunities for Kabi, Fresenius chief executive Stephan Sturm told analysts, adding he did not rule out bigger ones. Fresenius said it now expected full-year revenue growth of between 4% and 7% at constant currency rates, up from a previous range of 3% to 6%. Its outlook included the effects of its February acquisition of U.S. home dialysis firm NxStage. “We are reporting a good second quarter 2019, with healthy organic growth in all four business segments,” Sturm said in a statement. “We are very confident about the second half and the coming years.” Fresenius Medical Care maintained its 2019 targets, but JP Morgan said the revenue target would require significant acceleration in the second half of the year. The unit reported adjusted second-quarter revenue of 4.28 billion euros ($4.77 billion), below the 4.35 billion euros expected on average by analysts in a Refinitiv poll. Fresenius said its hospitals division Helios, which had long acted as a drag on its results due to decreasing admissions and staff shortages in Germany, recorded strong organic sales growth in its home market. Sturm said with that business now stabilized, Fresenius could revisit the idea of expanding beyond Germany and Spain, where it now operates, into a third European market in 2020 and beyond. He said he was open to acquisitions in the hospital market, particularly in Spain. He would also look at opportunities in Latin America if they arose, he said, and selectively consider options in Germany.

-15.12743552387081," Shareholders reproach Germany's Fresenius Medical Care after foreign bribery case * Fresenius Medical Care AGM held on Thursday * Executive board gets approval rating of 56.81 pct * ISS recommends no confidence vote on U.S. bribery settlement BERLIN, May 16 (Reuters) - Fresenius Medical Care on Thursday became the latest German company to face a reproach from investors, with only a narrow majority of shareholders giving its top management and supervisory board their vote of approval. At the dialysis clinic operator’s annual general meeting, 56.81 percent of shareholders voted in favour of ratifying the executive board’s business conduct during 2018, Fresenius said. In addition, its non-executive supervisory board, won just 52.32 percent of the vote. A vote on management’s performance is a prominent feature at every German AGM. Approval rates are typically above 95 percent and are seen as a key gauge of investor sentiment, although the vote is largely symbolic because it has no bearing on management’s liability or tenure. The low score for Fresenius Medical Care’s management comes as shareholders of German companies increasingly demand better corporate governance and an end to scandals. Last month, shareholders at Bayer delivered the first ever vote of no confidence to the serving management of a DAX-listed company, amid anger over mounting litigation risks from the group’s $63 billion takeover of seed maker Monsanto. At Fresenius Medical Care, shareholder advisory group ISS had recommended that investors vote against approving the actions of management. ISS based its decision on the company’s $231 million settlement with the U.S. justice department at the end of March to resolve allegations that Fresenius paid bribes to officials in several countries to win or retain business. ISS also said that Fresenius’s long-term payout ratios were low. Many institutional investors often follow the recommendations of ISS on voting behaviour at annual general meetings. Shares in Fresenius Medical Care fell more than 34 percent in 2018, hurt by a profit warning in October as it grappled with a slowdown in its key North American business and a lower percentage of patients on higher paying insurance schemes. A spokesman for Fresenius Medical Care said the company respected the outcome of the vote but said it believed the recommendation by ISS was not justified. “We do not dismiss the topic, on the contrary,” the spokesman said, referring to the bribery case. “How we have handled it since the discovery of the incident shows that we take the matter very seriously and have always kept it up to date.” (Reporting by Caroline Copley; Editing by Susan Fenton)"
-17.50108624309621," UPDATE 2-Fresenius makes solid start to year after turbulent 2018 * Fresenius Q1 sales up 5 pct to 8.5 bln euros * Adjusted operating profit rises 2 pct to 1.11 bln euros * Sees signs of stabilisation at Helios Germany * Confirms full-year guidance (Adds analysts, shares, details) BERLIN, May 2 (Reuters) - Fresenius reported a rise in first-quarter sales and operating profit on Thursday, helped by growth at its generic infusion drugs and dialysis units, as its troubled German hospital business showed signs of stabilisation. The German group has flagged 2019 as an investment year as it steps up a drive to improve German hospitals that have suffered from declining admissions and high staff turnover. It also wants to scale up its home dialysis business. Currency-adjusted quarterly sales rose 5 percent to 8.5 billion euros ($9.5 billion), helped by growth at its Kabi infusion unit and separately listed Fresenius Medical Care . Operating profit rose 2 percent to 1.11 billion euros. “All four Fresenius business segments have developed in line with our expectations, putting us well on course to meet our targets for the year,” Chief Executive Stephan Sturm said. Fresenius had a turbulent 2018 as it grappled with operating problems at two of its three major businesses and was tied up with a court battle over its aborted takeover of generic drugmaker Akorn, which it won. Bankhaus Lampe analysts were encouraged the company had managed to stop the margin erosion at its Helios Germany hospitals business, even though sales fell 6 percent and operating profit declined 16 percent, hurt by a nursing shortage and a less pronounced flu season. “We see our thesis supported that none of the businesses are facing material structural challenges,” wrote analyst Volker Braun, who rates the stock ‘buy’. But Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest said it was too early to call a stabilisation trend at Helios given the company faces challenges from reforms to the German hospital payments system that kick in next year. Shares in Fresenius, which have surged 19 percent so far this year, outperforming a 9.6 percent increase in the European health sector index, pared early gains to trade 0.1 percent lower at 0942 GMT. At Fresenius Medical Care, which has faced a slowdown in North America, its most important market, adjusted sales rose 6 percent to 4.13 billion euros, helped by agreements that materialised earlier than planned. Operating profit increased by 4 percent in constant currencies to 551 million euros. Adjusted quarterly sales at Kabi rose 4 percent, while revenue at its smallest division Vamed, which manages projects for hospitals and provides post-acute care in central Europe, jumped 33 percent. Despite expected earnings dilution from its $2 billion acquisition of home dialysis maker NxStage, Fresenius confirmed its guidance for currency-adjusted sales growth of 3-6 percent this year compared with 6 percent last year, while profit is expected to stay around the same level as 2018."
-1.4579044253812017," Fresenius Medical Care to pay $231 million to resolve criminal, civil foreign bribery charges (Reuters) - Germany-based dialysis clinic operator Fresenius Medical Care AG will pay about $231 million to resolve criminal and civil allegations that the company paid bribes to public health and government officials in several countries to win or retain business, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday. As part of the settlement, the company admitted that it doled out bribes to officials in Angola and Saudi Arabia from 2007 through 2016, and also failed to maintain proper internal accounting controls, the department said. The Justice Department agreed not to prosecute the company criminally in exchange for Fresenius paying a penalty of $84,715,273. The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, ordered the company to pay $147 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to settle the civil charges. “We are pleased to have concluded these investigations and to have resolved the issues that we identified and voluntarily disclosed to the U.S. authorities,” Fresenius Medical Care Chief Executive Officer Rice Powell said in a statement. For the past few years, the Justice Department has been trying to encourage companies with potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations to come forward and self-report them in exchange for prosecutorial declinations and lower penalties. The Justice Department said on Friday that while Fresenius did self-report the issues in this case, it got a higher penalty because it did not provide “timely” responses to requests for information and some of its responses were not “fulsome.” In addition, the misconduct allegedly occurred in 13 countries and allowed the company to profit illegally by more than $140 million, the Justice Department said. In Morocco, for instance, the department said the company paid bribes through a “sham” commission to a Moroccan state official in order to win contracts to develop dialysis centers at state-owned military hospitals. The scheme worked by having the commission pay 10 percent of the value of the contract to the official, and the payment would be disguised as a bonus payment to a Fresenius company employee. In addition to Morocco, Angola and Saudi Arabia, the company also paid bribes in Spain, the Justice Department said. “Fresenius doled out millions of dollars in bribes across the globe to gain an advantage in the medical services industry,” said Brian Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division. As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to retain an independent monitor for at least two years, he said."

The closure - some 18 months after FMC agreed to buy NxStage - paves the way for the world’s biggest provider of dialysis services to scale up its home dialysis business by investing in new infrastructure, patient training and education.

Fresenius, which makes generic infusion drugs and operates hospitals and dialysis clinics, expects sales to rise between 3 and 6 percent this year compared with 6 percent last year, while profit should stay around the same level as 2018. “2019 will be a year of investment in growth areas such as home dialysis, biosimilars and new hospital services and therapies,” Chief Executive Stefan Sturm said in a statement. From 2020-2023, Fresenius is targeting a compound annual organic sales growth rate of 4-7 percent while net income should grow at a faster rate, in a range of 5-9 percent. Fresenius shares lost over a third of their value in 2018 as investors were rattled by operating problems at its U.S. dialysis business and its German hospitals. The hospitals are facing uncertainty around new minimum staffing laws, a shift to more outpatient treatments and disruption caused by their move to develop clusters for procedures. Sales at the hospitals unit fell 5 percent in the fourth quarter, hurt by a fall in patient admissions and unexpectedly high staff turnover, while net income dropped 16 percent. At the same time, the company’s separately-listed dialysis business, Fresenius Medical Care (FMC), is grappling with a slowdown in North America, its most important market, and a lower percentage of patients on higher paying insurance schemes. FMC plans to spend money scaling up its business in China this year, as well as building training facilities and home dialysis infrastructure to meet demand from patients. Its planned $2 billion acquisition of NxStage, a maker of home dialysis machines, which most recently has been delayed by the U.S. government shutdown, is expected to close in the first quarter. FMC also announced a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) share buyback over the next two years and said it would pay a dividend of 1.17 euros per share, up 10 percent on the previous year. Fresenius’ sales in the fourth quarter rose 7 percent to 8.8 billion euros, as a strong performance at its Kabi generics unit offset declines at its Helios hospitals business and FMC. Adjusted net income increased 6 percent to 504 million euros, in line with expectations. It proposed a dividend of 0.80 euros per share, up 7 percent."

To win approval for the $2 billion deal, the companies agreed to sell NxStage’s bloodline tubing set business, the agency said. Fresenius and NxStage together dominate the market for the single-use plastic tubes used during dialysis, the agency said. The five FTC commissioners split along party lines in voting on whether to approve the merger. The three Republicans, Joseph Simons, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, voted “yes,” while Democrats Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Slaughter dissented. A spokesman for Fresenius was not available for comment outside of European business hours. Fresenius and rival DaVita Inc dominate the U.S. market for dialysis clinics. Fresenius, which has 2,200 U.S. dialysis clinics, struck the deal to buy NxStage in August 2017 as a way for it to move into cheaper home dialysis. It has served 190,000 U.S. patients, according to its website. Simons and the Republican commissioners defended the settlement by arguing that since most patients cannot use in-home dialysis, the two services do not compete against each other, among other reasons. Chopra and Slaughter, in separate statements, noted that the clinic dialysis market was already concentrated and that the merger could lead to higher prices for people with kidney ailments."

FMC said on Wednesday it had bought a 70 percent stake in Guangzhou KangNiDaiSi Medical Investment Co. Ltd, a hospital management and consulting firm which has three dialysis centers under construction, and is awaiting approval to build a fourth center. The German company also acquired a 55 percent stake in Henan Aishen Hospital Management Co. Ltd and Aishen Beijing Hospital Management Co. Ltd which are building 13 dialysis centers and a renal hospital, as well as a 60 percent stake in Daqing Kangda Dialysis Center Co. Ltd. “These acquisitions mark an important strategic step in our business development in China,” FMC Chief Executive Rice Powell said in a statement. Around 500,000 patients in China currently receive dialysis, according to the Chinese Society of Nephrology, making it the biggest market globally after the United States in terms of numbers. Analysts at Bernstein estimate the number of Chinese patients on dialysis is growing by 15-20 percent per year. While FMC has long sold its dialysis products in China, it has had a minimal presence in dialysis services due to low reimbursement rates. FMC has made several investments in China in recent years, announcing the acquisition of a 70 percent stake in a hospital there last year, as well as opening its first independent dialysis center. On Wednesday, it also disclosed that in June it acquired 70 percent stakes in two hospitals in Sichuan province."

1.3657232478350165," Jilted Akorn sues Fresenius over deal termination FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. generic drugmaker Akorn is taking former suitor Fresenius to court after the German healthcare group canceled their $4.75 billion takeover agreement. Akorn shares lost more than a third of their value on Monday, the day after Fresenius pulled out of a deal first announced last April. The German company cited evidence of misconduct in Akorn’s reporting of drug development data to U.S. healthcare regulators. Fresenius had warned in February that it could terminate the deal after starting an investigating into alleged breaches of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data integrity requirements. “We have found proof of material breaches of FDA data integrity requirements in Akorn’s operations, including product development,” Fresenius said in its statement on Sunday, adding that Akorn also violated other requirements of the merger agreement. Akorn, which filed the complaint in a Delaware court, said the investigation “has not found any facts that would result in a material adverse effect on Akorn’s business and therefore there is no basis to terminate the transaction”. It reiterated it would “vigorously” enforce its rights and Fresenius’s obligations. Akorn shares traded at $13.64 on Monday, compared with the $34 that Fresenius had offered. Shares in Fresenius initially jumped as much as 3.9 percent on Monday, with analysts saying the company was extricating itself from taking on an underperforming business. But the stock traded 1.1 percent lower at 1420 GMT because of concern over a drawn-out legal dispute. The German group had hoped the acquisition would help it to offer a wider choice of drugs to hospitals and pharmacies, who tend to favor large suppliers. A spokesman on Monday said that its Kabi subsidiary, a maker of generic drugs for injection and infusion, would expand its existing business to reach that goal. “This can of course be accelerated via acquisitions.” the spokesman said. Akorn was burdened last year by supply disruptions and competition for a range of products, such as ephedrine injections for low blood pressure under anesthesia and lidocaine anesthetic ointment. Fresenius warned in November that weakness at Akorn could continue into 2018, but at the time reaffirmed the logic behind the deal. Fresenius on Monday ruled out seeking a new deal on more favorable terms after an analyst discussed the possibility in a research note. The German group’s separately-listed Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) subsidiary struck a deal on Saturday to sell its majority stake in Sound Inpatient Physicians Holdings for $2.15 billion, less than four years after buying it. The shares dropped 3.6 percent as the group also cut its 2018 sales target because of lower reimbursement of calcimimetic drugs at its dialysis service business in the United States. FMC had bought Sound Inpatient to build up a so-called care coordination business to expand into other types of therapy that kidney dialysis patients typically need."
1.3657232478350165," Fresenius Medical cuts 2018 sales target after drug dosage shift BERLIN (Reuters) - German dialysis specialist Fresenius Medical Care FMEG.DE cut its 2018 sales target due to lower than expected doses of calcimimetic drugs at its dialysis service business in the United States. The company said on Sunday it now expects sales to rise by 5-7 percent at constant currency, compared with a previous forecast for a rise of around 8 percent. Calcimimetic drugs, which are given to kidney patients to control calcium levels and prevent hardening of the arteries, were given in tablet form until the start of this year, but are now available as an injection. That means there is a change to how they are reimbursed by Medicare and so FMC has had to shift the drugs from its pharmacy business into the dialysis service business. However, dosing of the drugs in the dialysis service business was lower than FMC had expected because patients were taking it more accurately than before, meaning revenue did not rise as planned. “Due to a faster than expected reduction in dosing of those drugs in the controlled clinic environment, we are experiencing a headwind on revenue growth for fiscal 2018,” CEO Rice Powell said in a statement. It confirmed a target for 2018 net income to rise by 13-15 percent at constant currency. It also reported preliminary first quarter results, with revenue up 2 percent at constant currency to 3.98 billion euros ($4.88 billion) and net income stable at 279 million euros. FMC had on Saturday announced the sale of Sound Inpatient, a U.S. provider of emergency medicine and critical care. It said on Sunday the 2018 targets did not include the effect of the disposal.

The sale to an investment consortium led by private equity firm Summit Partners is expected to close in late 2018 and will bring a pretax book gain of about 800 million euros ($983 million) for the German company. Fresenius Medical Care, which says it is the world’s largest provider of dialysis products and services, bought the stake in Sound Inpatient for about $600 million in 2014 as part of a drive to offer additional services linked to kidney dialysis. Sound Inpatient provides services such as emergency medicine and critical care. FMC said the investment had enabled it to gain insight in value-based care programs in the U.S. and that it was now in a position where it could divest Sound Inpatient and use the proceeds for other investments. In 2017, Sound generated revenues of around 1.25 billion euros and EBIT of around 90 million euros with 3,500 employees. FMC’s financial targets for 2018 and 2020 do not include the effects of the Sound Inpatient sale or the acquisition of NxStage Medical, it added. FMC is due to publish first quarter results on May 3.
