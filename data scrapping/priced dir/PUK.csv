27.352870284336483," Breakingviews - Prudential’s shortcut adds pace to Asia pivot LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Shortcuts are supposed to eliminate unwanted delay and hassle. That’s what Prudential Chief Executive Mike Wells was thinking when he scrapped an initial public offering of the UK insurer’s American unit in favour of demerging the business. Investors didn’t like the change of direction, which comes with a plan for Pru to issue up to $3 billion in equity. But if the manoeuvre speeds the company’s long-awaited shift to being valued more like an Asian insurer, all should be forgiven. Wells has already spun off the insurer’s UK and European business, now known as M&G. The next step, announced last year, was to list the Jackson American unit and gradually reduce Pru’s stake. That would raise capital while freeing the $43 billion group to focus on its faster growing Asian and African life insurance markets. Prudential’s new post-pandemic direction will see it shed around 80% of Jackson this summer, by giving shareholders a share in the U.S. business for each share they already own. The group will also issue stock worth $2.5 billion to $3 billion in London or Hong Kong to fund growth and repay expensive debt, saving it around $125 million in interest a year. Investors didn’t respond well to the new road map, pushing Pru’s London-listed shares down as much as 10% on Thursday morning. However, the reshuffle should help uncover the true value of Pru. Analysts at UBS reckon Jackson is worth $3.6 billion. Once it’s fully demerged, the remaining group should be worth about $39.5 billion. Pru’s Asian business is expected to earn an operating profit of almost $4.5 billion by 2022, according to consensus estimates. After deducting central overheads and tax at 14%, the group should earn about $3.5 billion, implying a price-earnings multiple of little more than 11. Pru’s main Asian rival, the $148 billion AIA, trades on 19 times. The reaction to Wells’ latest plan shows investors will take some convincing. For one, the surprise equity offering will fuel concerns that Pru’s Asian business cannot generate enough capital to finance its future growth. Wobbly markets and near-zero interest rates have also dented its income. Wells will have to hope his accelerated Asian pivot also speeds up the company’s long-awaited re-rating."
27.352870284336483," Prudential to split off U.S. business Jackson, eyes $2.5-3 billion capital raise LONDON (Reuters) - British life insurer Prudential said on Thursday it would separate its U.S. business Jackson through a demerger to better focus on Asian and African markets, while adding it was considering raising $2.5-3 billion in new equity. Prudential, under pressure from activist investor Third Point, had originally planned a minority initial public offering of the U.S. business. It said in a statement that a demerger would allow a quicker separation than a minority IPO and future sell-downs. Prudential CEO Mike Wells said the demerger would “significantly accelerate Prudential’s transformation into a business purely focused on profitable growth in Asia and Africa”. Shares fell sharply after the announcement and were down 8.9% at 0904 GMT. The company said shares in Jackson would be distributed to Prudential shareholders after the demerger, which is expected in the second quarter of 2021. Following the demerger, Prudential said it would retain a 19.9% non-controlling interest in Jackson. Prudential said operating results for 2020 were anticipated to be in line with market expectations, ahead of its full-year earnings announcement on March 3. Shares in Prudential were down 5% at 0854 GMT."

26.432921531045356," UK appeal court allows new hearing on Prudential $16 bln annuity transfer LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - A UK court of appeal on Wednesday overturned a judgment blocking the transfer of 12 billion pounds ($15.97 billion) in annuities from insurance giant Prudential to specialist provider Rothesay Life, paving the way for a second transfer hearing. The deal, which would have been the largest ever such transfer covering 400,000 policyholders, was announced in 2018 at the same time as Prudential said it would split in two. The annuities - which pay pensioners a fixed income for life - are now managed by M&G, Prudential’s former UK arm. The High Court in London last year blocked the deal following representations from around 1,000 policyholders, who were wary about the financial strength of Rothesay, a major player in the sector. But the High Court was wrong to assume there was a material difference between the level of financial support which the two firms could offer, according to a summary of the appeal judgment published on Wednesday. “This will be very well received by the insurance industry, as the original and unprecedented ruling risked stymieing corporate activity,” said Michael Abramson, partner at consultants Hymans Robertson. Insurers frequently transfer books of business to one another, but the process requires court approval. Another hearing for the policy transfer can now go ahead, the appeal court said. The hearing is likely to take place late next year, a Rothesay spokesperson said. ($1 = 0.7513 pounds) (Reporting by Carolyn Cohn, editing by Louise Heavens)"

14.06615072030527," Exclusive: Grab in talks with Prudential, AIA for fintech investment - sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asia’s Grab is in advanced talks with Prudential PLC, AIA Group Ltd and others as it seeks $300 million to $500 million in investment for its financial services unit, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Grab, which evolved from ride-hailing app operator to one-stop shop for services as varied as food delivery and insurance, aims to reach agreements as early as October, the people said. Insurers are likely to provide half of the target spread over a few fundraising rounds, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as prospective investors have not been made public. Prudential and AIA are named here for the first time. They said Grab Financial Group’s pre-money valuation - the value of an unlisted startup before its next funding round - has been estimated at about $2 billion. Grab, Prudential and AIA declined to comment. The fundraising, coming as the COVID-19 pandemic decimates the global economic outlook, underscores the potential for technology-led financial services as the bulk of retail transactions go digital. It also indicates the pandemic’s limited impact on fundraising efforts for Southeast Asia’s most valuable startup - worth $14 billion, sources have said - even though its business in eight countries has suffered from coronavirus control measures. At Grab and Indonesian rival Gojek, lockdowns have savaged the transport business but have sparked a boom in food delivery. Backing from Prudential and AIA would add heft to Grab’s financial services ambitions, which go beyond expanding its insurance and lending businesses and into the realm of wealth management. “Finalising new funding during these times could also help Grab in its sales pitch for the Singapore banking licence,” said one of the people. Last year, it applied for an online banking licence with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. The financial theme continued in February when Grab raised about $850 million from investors including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. For Asia-focused insurers Prudential and AIA, investing in Grab Financial Group will allow them to explore the use of its technology and data to market products, said one of the people. It was not clear how much each insurer planned to invest. Grab, which counts Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Group Corp among its investors, has said its flagship app has clocked 198 million downloads."
-1.8716937539665368," M&G plans savings push into Europe as first-half profit tops forecast LONDON (Reuters) - M&G MNG.L is planning to launch its flagship Prufund retail savings product in mainland Europe by year-end, it said on Wednesday, as the British insurer and asset manager reported above forecast first-half profit. M&G, which was spun out by parent Prudential PRU.L last year, has signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with two banks in Europe to distribute Prufund, Chief Executive John Foley told Reuters. He declined to name the banks, citing confidentiality agreements. The 136 billion pound ($177.4 billion) Prufund, which pools long-term investments, saw net inflows of 800 million pounds in the six months to end-June. Overall net outflows from savings and asset management totaled 4.1 billion pounds, however, as retail investors pulled money out during the coronavirus-led market sell-off. “The pandemic was obviously unhelpful, people ran for cash,” Foley said, adding that going forward: “The basic drivers don’t change, people still need to save for their retirement.” Assets under management and administration totaled 339 billion pounds at end-June, above 329 billion seen in a company-supplied consensus poll. Adjusted operating profit fell 57% to 309 million pounds, slightly ahead of the 299 million pounds forecast. Extra costs related to the demerger contributed to the fall in profit, M&G said. The pandemic has hit insurers and asset managers across the board. Asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L last week recorded a 30% drop in pre-tax profit, while life insurer Legal & General LGEN.L posted a 2% fall in first-half operating profit. M&G's shares were up 2% at 178 pence at 0716 GMT, one of the strongest performers in the FTSE 100 .FTSE. JPMorgan analysts described the results as ""solid"", reiterating their ""overweight"" rating. M&G said it would pay an interim dividend of six pence per share, in line with forecasts."
2.0447494511864095," Britain's Prudential to exit U.S. business, focus on Asia, Africa LONDON (Reuters) - British life insurer Prudential PRU.L said on Tuesday it planned to spin off its U.S. business Jackson to focus on Africa and its largest market Asia, responding to investor pressure for a split. Prudential’s shares hit eight-week highs as investors cheered news the company would follow in the footsteps of peers Standard Life and Old Mutual, which have both divided up their operations in recent years. “This new Prudential model will be a growth-oriented business,” Prudential CEO Mike Wells, a former boss of Jackson, told a media call. “Jackson is ready to be a standalone.” U.S. hedge fund Third Point took a 5% stake in Prudential in February and called on management to split the company in two. A minority initial public offering of Jackson is planned for the first half of 2021, with “full divestment over time”, Prudential, which spun off its European unit M&G last year, said. It had already sold an equity stake in the U.S. unit to Apollo Global-backed Athene Holding for $500 million in June. Athene now owns 11% of Jackson and has reinsured $28 billion of its annuity portfolio. Wells said the investor was a “potential partner” for Jackson for further reinsurance transactions. Prudential, which started life in London in 1848, will maintain its head office in the city, of which Third Point had been critical, but said it would cut costs. Wells did not say if there would be job losses. Prudential’s shares rose more than 4% before easing to 12.71 pounds per share by 1106 GMT, up 3.2%. Operating profit fell 3% in the first half to $2.5 billion, hurt by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but was above a company-compiled consensus forecast of $2.4 billion. Operating profit in Asia was up 14%, but down 19% at Jackson. Analysts at Jefferies said the Jackson disposal would reduce the risk premium currently applied to Prudential, reiterating their hold rating. Prudential said under a new dividend policy aligned to growth in the Asia and Africa businesses, it would make an interim payment of 5.37 cents per share, one-third of its expected full-year 2020 dividend of 16.1 cents. Shore Capital said the expected full-year dividend represented a 55% cut from 2019 on a pro-forma basis."

0.5644302345321965," Prudential sells Jackson equity stake to Apollo-backed Athene for $500 million LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Prudential PRU.L sold a minority stake in its U.S. business, Jackson, to Apollo Global-backed Athene Holding ATH.N for $500 million, the insurer said on Thursday, in the first phase of its plan to create an independent U.S. business. The London-listed, Asia-focused insurer has been looking for ways to bring external capital into the U.S. annuity provider and said it would continue to evaluate options for the part of the business it still owned, including a minority initial public offering. The end goal was to create an independent U.S. business, Prudential said, without giving details on how much of Jackson it still wanted to keep. “This agreement is a key step forward in meeting our strategic objectives for Jackson,” Chief Executive Mike Wells said in a statement. Athene’s investment, which hands the retirement services company an 11.1% economic interest in Jackson’s enlarged common equity, was expected to close in July, Prudential said. The sale comes less than four months after U.S. hedge fund Third Point took a more than $2 billion stake and called on Prudential to split into two companies. Over the last months, Third Point, which is run by Daniel Loeb, has held discussions with Wells about how to proceed. Loeb applauded the sale on Thursday, calling it a great first step, a person familiar with his thinking said. “Third Point had suggested a blueprint for Prudential earlier in the year and Wells seems to be in sync with the hedge fund’s ideas”, the person said. Some analysts say there is little logic in Prudential holding onto Jackson, which has few synergies with its Asian arm - where profits and new business sales have historically been higher. Prudential shares were trading 2.8% up at 1353 GMT. “The deal is particularly welcome since there were concerns the current market conditions would make a disposal difficult,” said Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The inherently unpredictable nature of Jackson’s large variable annuity portfolio isn’t exactly the reliable income model investors generally expect from a life insurer.” In addition, Prudential said Athene - which counts Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management as its biggest shareholder- would fully reinsure $27.6 billion of Jackson’s in-force fixed and fixed indexed annuity portfolio from June 1. The combined effects of investment and reinsurance transactions are expected to raise Jackson’s risk-based capital cover ratio by 80 percentage points, Prudential said."

27.117333074655832," Pandemic hits Prudential Asia, sources say Jackson on block LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in Prudential PRU.L fell on Thursday as the coronavirus pandemic hit its Asia sales and it warned of challenging times ahead, while sources told Reuters the insurer's U.S. unit was for sale. Prudential’s main businesses are in Asia and the United States after it spun off its British unit last year. Asian annual premium equivalent sales fell 24% in the first quarter to $986 million, with a 50% drop in Hong Kong and 19% in China, although Prudential said there were signs the sales environment was beginning to normalise in China. Prudential traditionally relies on face-to-face contact between customers and agents to make sales in Asia. Prudential's shares were down 5% to 10.36 pounds at 1523 GMT, compared with a 2.75% drop in the FTSE 100 .FTSE. And the coronavirus crisis would continue to have an impact on its business in the second quarter, with sales in Asia inevitably “challenged”, Prudential Chief Executive Mike Wells told a media call ahead of its annual general meeting. “In times like this, the quality of our existing customer relationships becomes clear,” Wells added. The company said it was working with regulators to enable more products to be sold online, with more than 25% in Hong Kong already sold in this way. Prudential reiterated that it was continuing to prepare to float a minority stake in Jackson, whose annual premium equivalent sales rose 25% to $631 million, alongside “active evaluation of other options”. However, a process organised by an investment bank was launched in recent weeks to sell all of Jackson, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information isn’t public. The economic dislocation caused by the virus has impacted Prudential’s plans for the minority initial public offering, the sources said. Interest in Jackson, which mostly sells annuity products, is expected to come predominantly from private equity firms and their insurance affiliates. While Prudential had hoped to value Jackson as highly as $10 billion before COVID-19 struck, the pandemic has reduced insurance company valuations, meaning that potential buyers will likely offer well below that mark, the sources added. A spokesman for Prudential declined to comment. Jackson didn’t respond to a request for comment. Rebel investor Third Point is pushing Prudential for a full separation of Jackson. JP Morgan analysts said Jackson “remains a drag on the attractiveness of Prudential”, reiterating their “neutral” rating on the stock. Although several insurers in Britain have suspended dividend payments, under pressure from regulators to preserve capital, Prudential, whose main regulator is in Hong Kong, is continuing with its 2019 payout."

29.12897205987487," Prudential to float part of U.S. business as Third Point demands sale LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Prudential plans to float a minority stake in its U.S. business, Britain’s largest insurer said on Wednesday, as it faces demands from rebel investor Third Point for a full break-up. The U.S. hedge fund last month said it had bought around 5% of the company and called on Prudential to hive off its U.S. business Jackson and cut its London head office, proposals with which investors have sympathy. Prudential’s main businesses are in Asia and the United States after it spun off its British unit last year. Prudential was planning a minority initial public offering (IPO) of Jackson, CEO Mike Wells - who formerly served as the boss of Jackson - said as the company reported a 20% rise in 2019 operating profit. “In order to diversify at pace, Jackson will need access to additional investment,” he said on a media call, adding that he had first signaled the need for outside capital for Jackson in August and that the company had “undertaken significant work with our advisers to prep the U.S. business”. Goldman Sachs and Citi are advisers to Prudential, according to its website, while Rothschild is also advising the firm, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A Third Point spokesman declined to comment on the IPO plan. Panmure analyst Barrie Cornes said the plan was “positive as it will enable a realistic valuation of the US business”, reiterating his buy rating on the stock. Analysts say Jackson is hard to value because of its complex annuity products. JPMorgan last month estimated its value at $6-10 billion. Jackson saw a 28% drop in 2019 new business profit, which Prudential said reflected lower interest rates and changes in its product mix. Wells defended the firm’s London headquarters, telling reporters on the conference call it was the logical place to be, given the depth of talent in financial services in the city. Third Point has also criticized Prudential for prioritizing dividend growth over reinvestment, but Wells said the company’s dividend policy was “appropriate”. Prudential reported an overall above-forecast 20% rise in 2019 adjusted operating profit to $5.3 billion, compared with a $5.1 billion forecast in a company-supplied analyst poll. Adjusted operating profit from Asian insurance operations was $3 billion, up by 14%, with Hong Kong up by 24%. But fewer visitors from mainland China caused a fall in total Hong Kong annual premium equivalent sales - a key revenue measure - by 11% and a fall in new business profit of 12%. Anti-government demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory, which began in June, resulted in a sharp drop in tourist arrivals, mainly those from the mainland, hitting sales of insurance policies. Prudential also said it was monitoring the coronavirus outbreak, which has cut economic activity in the region. Wells said there had been few coronavirus-related claims in Asia so far and the firm’s exposure to the outbreak had been “minimal”. Prudential said it would pay a second interim ordinary dividend of 25.97 cents per share. Its shares were steady at 10.98 pounds per share at 1024 GMT, compared with a 0.4% rise in the FTSE 100."

4.588878009601693," UPDATE 2-Coronavirus brings uncertainty for insurer, asset manager M&G * Operating profit 1.15 bln stg * Solvency ratio drops to 166% at March 6 * Company pays special demerger dividend * Shares up 1.16% (Adds CEO, CFO comments, shares, analyst) LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - British insurer and asset manager M&G said on Tuesday it was facing uncertainty from the coronavirus outbreak as it recorded in-line 2019 operating profit in its first set of results after splitting from parent Prudential last year. M&G, the former British and European arm of Prudential, saw net client outflows of 1.3 billion pounds in its savings and asset management division last year, with outflows from asset management outweighing savings inflows. Sharp market moves in the past few weeks have knocked 10 percentage points off M&G’s solvency ratio, while it lost a further four to five percentage points on Monday, Chief Financial Officer Clare Bousfield told Reuters by phone. Analysts expect the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak to have a greater impact on insurers’ investment positions than on the number of claims. “We do not know what this virus could throw at us,” Chief Executive John Foley said on the call, adding that the firm was preparing for the possibility of remote working in Britain, while its Milan office was closed following a government lockdown. M&G’s Solvency II ratio, a key measure of its capital strength, dropped to 166% at March 6, compared to 176% at end-Dec, though Bousfield said the firm’s balance sheet was resilient. A solvency level below 100% indicates inadequate capital reserves, though regulators prefer to see a higher number. M&G’s shares were up 1.4% at 174.8 pence at 0838 GMT, against a 2.3% rise in the FTSE 100. JPMorgan analysts described the results as “mixed”, but retained their overweight rating on the stock. Asset managers have been buffeted by a number of factors in the past year, including Brexit uncertainty, U.S.-China trade tensions, competition from cheaper index-tracking funds and most recently, the coronavirus. Rival Standard Life Aberdeen recorded a 10% drop in pre-tax profit on Tuesday, hit by the impact of lower revenues as investors continued to pull money from its funds. M&G’s adjusted operating profit fell 29% to 1.15 billion pounds, partly from a change in longevity assumptions, but the result was in line with forecasts from a company-supplied consensus poll. Assets under management and administration (AUMA) totalled 352 billion pounds, a 10% rise mainly reflecting strong investment returns. The company said it would pay an ordinary dividend of 11.92 pence per share, as well as a special demerger dividend of 3.85 pence."
-18.584003130061223," Prudential investors back Loeb but in no rush to execute break-up plan LONDON (Reuters) - Shareholders in Prudential Plc PRU.L have given their blessing to a bid by activist investor Third Point to carve up Britain’s largest insurer but advise against a hasty sale of its U.S business. Third Point, the $14 billion hedge fund run by investor Dan Loeb, on Monday amassed a $2 billion-plus stake in the 170-year-old life insurer and called on management to separate its Asian and U.S. businesses. The investor's demands come only a few months after the $48 billion life insurer spun out its European insurance and asset management businesses into a new company, M&G MNG.L. Investors and analysts say the idea of selling the U.S. business, Jackson, is not revolutionary and echoes requests by long-term investors, given the lack of synergies between it and Prudential’s faster-growing Asian unit. But weak and unstable valuations for Jackson and its U.S. peers and the complex nature of its life insurance products will make the division tough to sell quickly, investors say, warning Third Point against a fire sale that could risk billions of dollars in potential upside. “Forcing through a demerger in the near term is unlikely to create much value for Prudential shareholders,” said a top-40 investor, adding that Prudential had made it clear it wanted to diversify the business before any sale. JPMorgan analysts estimated earlier this week Jackson’s value at $10 billion, without adjusting for the holding company’s cost and debt share, although it added there were “uncertainties” around the valuation. Reiner Kloecker, fund manager at Union Investment, a top-30 investor, said Prudential had “an incoherent structure” and a separation of its Asian and U.S businesses was in the interests of all investors. But now was not an ideal time to bring Jackson to market. “Prudential can take little steps here, they don’t have to race into a sale, they just have to begin with something,” he said. “It’s much more important to us that they get rid of the U.S. business at a sensible valuation over time.” Pru could start by reinsuring or selling parts of its U.S. business, and use that capital to buy out its joint venture partner in China, Kloecker said. Reuters reported this month that the insurer wanted to expand in China. Ratings agencies Moody’s and Fitch said Jackson’s credit rating was supported by Prudential’s, making a split a potential concern for Pru bondholders who might end up with some Jackson debt. Industry sources see the arrival of new chair Shriti Vadera - who is set to take up her role in January- as a catalyst for change. Announcing her appointment, Prudential highlighted Vadera’s extensive Asian experience. Prudential CEO Mike Wells told analysts last year that following the M&G spin-out, “nothing is off-limits”. Investors are also receptive to Third Point’s proposal to cut expensive British head office costs. But shareholders, many of whom are based in Britain and Europe, are keen for Prudential to retain a London listing. Prudential has no UK business left and is now regulated in Hong Kong. Third Point has left the listing decision in Pru’s court, saying in its letter that it “trusts that the Board will identify listing venues where the standalone businesses will receive the attention they deserve”. Prudential is expected to respond when it publishes its annual results on March 11. Meanwhile, it “looks forward to commencing a dialogue with Third Point” and has already started putting its case to investors. “Prudential has been very communicative,” said another major shareholder, who had not yet made a decision on the Third Point proposals, adding “it’s very early doors.”"
-28.618605691173265," Hedge fund Third Point calls on Prudential to break up (Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC amassed a more than $2 billion stake in Prudential Plc PRU.L and called on the British insurer on Monday to split into two companies. Third Point's demands, first reported by Reuters earlier on Monday, could lead to a major shake-up at Prudential, only a few months after it spun out its European insurance and asset management businesses into a new company called M&G Plc MNG.L. Third Point, which specializes in shareholder activism and is run by Daniel Loeb, wrote to the 332-year old London-based company on Monday to ask it to separate its Asian and U.S. businesses. The New York-based hedge fund said Prudential’s stock would benefit if it stopped running its crown jewel Asia business and its U.S. business, Jackson National Life, out of one holding company in Britain. Jackson accounts for a small portion of Prudential’s value, but is extremely complex to analyze, Third Point said. As a result, investors are undervaluing Prudential’s Asia business because they are bundling it with Jackson, Third Point added. Moreover, the current structure is putting Prudential at a disadvantage when it comes to recruiting top talent in Asia, according to Third Point. In the letter, addressed to Prudential’s board of directors, Third Point also blamed the company’s management for prioritizing dividend payouts over reinvesting in the business. Third Point is arguing that some of the benefits of a split would include cost cuts at Prudential’s British holding company, better capital allocation policies, and better management of the U.S. and Asia businesses, the sources said. “If PruAsia and Jackson were separated, resulting in a greater focus on reinvesting capital in each unit and streamlining central costs at the group level, our analysis indicates that the interests represented by Prudential plc shares can double within three years,” Loeb wrote in the letter. Prudential confirmed in a separate statement that it had received a letter from Third Point and looked forward to commencing a dialogue with the hedge fund. While Prudential’s headquarters are in London, it is regulated in Hong Kong following its separation from M&G. A source told Reuters earlier this month that Prudential was studying options to reduce its ownership in Jackson, including seeking “outside capital.” Third Point’s stake is equivalent to just under 5% ownership of Prudential, making the fund the company’s second-largest shareholder and Prudential the hedge fund’s biggest position currently, according to the sources. Prudential has a market capitalization of 36.8 billion pounds. Third Point, which has $14 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to split themselves apart, including at Yum Brands, Dow Chemical and most recently United Technologies. To raise additional capital to build the stake in Prudential, Third Point raised a so-called special purpose vehicle, which allows hedge funds to raise money quickly and investors to put money to work in the stock of a specific company instead of a co-mingled fund. Although Third Point is based in the United States, a significant portion of its recent activist engagements have taken place overseas, at companies including Sony Corp 6758.T, Nestle NESN.S and EssilorLuxottica ESLX.PA."

-26.876138902380593," Exclusive: Prudential eyes full control of China venture, considers U.S. options LONDON (Reuters) - Prudential PRU.L is in talks that could lead to it taking full control of its 50:50 joint venture with China's CITIC 0267.HK and is considering selling some or all of its U.S. business to sharpen its focus on Asia, a source told Reuters. Changes in January to foreign ownership laws in China have made it possible for the first time for the British life insurer to own all of its CITIC joint venture, a landmark transaction which the source said Prudential was working towards. Prudential has not made a formal application to increase its ownership yet but is checking the plan would win approval from the Chinese authorities before it submits an application, the source said. Insiders at the $48 billion company say the deal could offer a boost to China as it battles to minimize the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted travel to the country and put several cities on lockdown. It would be hard to put a timescale on the approval process for a possible transaction, the source said, adding that the Chinese authorities were capable of acting fast to grant the necessary permissions if CITIC was willing to sell. “They want foreign investment post-virus,” the source said. Analysts at KBW said they expected Prudential to spend ""a few billion"" dollars increasing their stake in the venture. The company no longer has any British or European business after splitting off its M&G MNG.L insurance and asset management unit last year. The growth of the middle class in Asian economies and the lack of state retirement benefits have driven demand for private life and health insurance. Many western insurers have joint ventures in China but the Prudential-CITIC venture is among the largest, with around 20 provincial licenses. Chinese officials have become more welcoming of British and European companies amid Beijing’s trade tussle with the United States, the source added. Insurance sales for Prudential’s Chinese business rose 45% in the first half of 2019, and the recent coronavirus outbreak is not seen having much direct impact, analysts said. Its shares have fallen by 1.5% so far this year but the insurer has low exposure to Wuhan, where the virus originated. Prudential, which sells insurance in China through 55,000 agents, is opening a technical center in Shenzhen, in mainland China, where hiring is cheaper than Hong Kong because the cost of living is lower. In addition to the China plans, Prudential is looking at ways to reduce its ownership of its U.S. business Jackson. Analysts say there is little logic in Prudential holding onto the business, which has few synergies with its Asian arm. All options are on the table as Jackson seeks “outside capital”, the source said, adding that the business was attracting interest from private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and Canadian pension funds. Jackson had an operating profit of 1.9 billion pounds in 2018 compared with 2.2 billion for Prudential’s Asian business. New business sales for the United States totaled only 1.5 billion pounds compared with 3.7 billion in Asia. A dilution of ownership in Jackson would leave the 170-year-old insurer, Britain’s biggest, with the vast bulk of its operations in Asia, along with a smaller African business."

Vadera, currently chairwoman of Santander UK Group and senior independent director at mining giant BHP Group , will join Prudential on May 1 as a non-executive director before replacing Manduca on Jan. 1, 2021, Prudential said in a statement.

Vadera was touted as one of several candidates for the Bank of England’s top job, which will now be taken by Andrew Bailey, former head of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority. “Shriti Vadera was the unanimous choice of the board following a rigorous assessment of external and internal candidates from around the world,” said Prudential’s Philip Remnant, the director who led the process. Vadera, previously a British government minister, will step down from Santander and BHP, Prudential said.

3.992332320571558," FTSE debutant M&G still in shadow of glitzier Prudential * M&G shares fall more than 3% before recovering * Prudential up 6.5% to lead FTSE 100 gainers * KBW calls M&G ‘outperform’ with 335p price target LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares in UK and Europe-focused asset manager and insurer M&G fell slightly on its first day of trading after being demerged from Asia-focused Prudential , which soared to the top of Britain’s top share index. Faced with tougher European capital and solvency rules after the financial crisis, many insurers have looked to simplify their operations by breaking up, among them Standard Life Aberdeen and Old Mutual. The Prudential split, which gives investors shares in both companies, was aimed at allowing the high-growth Asia business to be more fully valued by the market, whilst also giving M&G more freedom to invest and grow the business. “The Board believes the demerger will help Prudential and M&G to become more closely aligned to the interests of their customers and shareholders,” Prudential Chairman Paul Manduca said. “Both businesses will retain their UK domicile and be able to allocate capital even more effectively as separate entities.” With many investors choosing to hold Prudential shares as a play on growing demand for insurance in Asia, analysts had expected early pressure on the shares of M&G as some sell out and reinvest the money in more Prudential stock. At 0835 GMT, shares in M&G were priced at 219.70 pence a share, just below their opening price of 220 pence but off the intraday low of 213 pence. After being sharply lower at the open, shares in Prudential bounced back strongly to trade up 6.5%, leading gainers on the blue-chip FTSE 100. KBW analyst Greig Paterson pegged M&G as “outperform” in a note to clients, flagging a 335 pence price target. “Investors in insurance companies have recently ignored the diversification and scale benefits of conglomerates, instead valuing the management focus, accountability, simplicity and lower information risk that mono-line, single-geography companies bring,” he wrote.

25.405298661083254," Prudential's Eastspring buys second Thai asset manager to boost growth SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Prudential Plc's PRU.L Asian asset management unit Eastspring Investments is buying 50.1% of Thanachart Fund Management Co. Ltd. (TFUND) for 4.21 billion baht ($137.5 million), just a year after entering the Thai mutual fund market via an acquisition. Eastspring is buying the stakes from Thanachart Bank Pcl (TBANK) and Government Savings Bank. It has an option to raise ownership in the Thai asset manager to 100% in the future. “The acquisition of TFUND not only complements our existing business but allows us to accelerate our growth and extend our presence in this dynamic market,” Nic Nicandrou, CEO of Prudential Corporation Asia, said in a statement on Tuesday. Thailand is one of the largest and fastest-growing asset management markets in Southeast Asia, supported by an expanding middle class, rising affluence and regulatory changes. The move comes amid Prudential’s plans to focus on Asia and the United States and spin off its UK and European insurance and asset management business M&G. In July 2018, Eastspring agreed to buy 65% of TMB Asset Management (TMBAM) from Thai TMB Bank Pcl TMB.BK. TFUND is the eighth-largest mutual fund manager in Thailand. TFUND and TMBAM Eastspring will become the fourth-largest asset manager in Thailand with a market share of 12% and combined assets under management of 653 billion baht, the companies said. The deal’s completion is conditional upon regulatory approval and the acquisition of TBANK by TMB Bank, among other things. Last month, the two banks agreed to create the country’s sixth-largest lender through a merger."
19.26659974951634," UK Markets watchdog fines Prudential 24 million pounds over annuity sales LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog has fined the country's largest insurer Prudential PRU.L 24 million pounds ($29.39 million) for failures related to non-advised sales of annuities, it said on Monday. The fine comes after Standard Life Assurance, part of insurer Phoenix Group PHNX.L, was charged 31 million over the same issue in July. The FCA said Prudential, which is preparing to spin off its UK business next month, failed to make sure customers were consistently advised that by shopping around they could get a higher rate on their annuities, which pay pensioners a fixed income for life. Prudential did not always tell customers about enhanced annuities, which pay a higher rate to policyholders with a reduced life expectancy, it said. “Prudential failed to treat some of its customers, who could have secured a better deal on the open market, fairly,” Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said. “These are very serious breaches that caused harm to those customers.” The fine relates to the period between July 2008 and September 2017, the FCA said, adding that by Sept. 19, 2019, Prudential had offered around 110 million pounds in redress to 17,240 customers. “We are deeply sorry for the historic failings in our non-advised annuity business and any detriment this has caused our customers,” Prudential said in an emailed statement, adding that it expected to compensate the “vast majority” of affected customers by the end of October. Prudential’s fine was cut by 30% because it did not dispute the findings, the FCA said. Prudential shares were little changed on the news and were trading up 1% at 14.89 pounds at 1006 GMT."

19.15897856353837," Prudential's M&G, Rothesay to appeal blocking of large annuity transfer LONDON (Reuters) - Prudential PRU.L and Rothesay Life will appeal a recent judgment blocking the transfer of 12 billion pounds ($15 billion) in annuities, the largest ever such deal, the firms said on Friday. A UK High Court judge in August blocked the transfer of the annuities, which are closed to new customers, from Prudential’s UK business M&G to Rothesay, following complaints from policyholders. The planned deal would have been the largest ever such transfer covering 400,000 policy holders. It was announced in March 2018 at the same time Prudential said it was to spin off its M&G business though the demerger has not been affected by the decision. In response to tougher European Union rules introduced after the financial crisis, insurers have increasingly looked to free up capital by off-loading closed books of annuity business to specialist firms such as Rothesay and Phoenix PHNX.L. Lawyers said they had not previously seen such deals blocked by the courts. The decision raises questions about whether other similar big deals can be struck. “Our appeal is on the basis that the judgment in the High Court contains material errors of law and should therefore be reconsidered,” Rothesay said in a statement, adding that the appeal would be unlikely to be heard for several months. M&G’s Chief Financial Officer Clare Bousfield also told an investor and analyst conference on Friday that the firm was appealing the decision. Prudential and M&G aim to split by Oct 21, they said on Thursday. Rothesay, whose investors include U.S. private equity giant Blackstone and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, this week announced two bulk annuity deals totaling more than eight billion pounds. It said shareholders had chipped in 200 million pounds of new equity into the company, taking total new equity raised this year to 700 million pounds. Rothesay’s main focus is on bulk annuities, which involve insuring company defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes."

22.88105330233948," Prudential, M&G to split in October into two FTSE 100 firms LONDON (Reuters) - Prudential PRU.L will spin off its UK and European insurance and asset management business M&G in October, Britain's largest insurer said in a prospectus published on Wednesday, dividing the insurance giant into two large-cap stocks. Prudential, founded in 1848 to provide loans to professional workers, announced the plan to hive off its UK arm last year. The split follows a trend among insurance and asset management businesses such as Old Mutual OMUJ.J and Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L to break up and simplify their operations. Prudential is planning to focus on its Asia business, while the split will allow M&G to expand globally, M&G chief executive John Foley told Reuters by phone. “We are going to scale up operations at pace in Europe,” Foley said, adding that the company would also look to grow in Asia and the United States. The break-up of Prudential and M&G was “what the market has wanted for years,” analysts at Shore Capital said in a note, reiterating their buy rating on the stock. But a UK fund manager said the M&G business might look in time to separate insurance and asset management, as the combination was “an awkward hybrid”. The split, which will leave Prudential with a one-off pre-tax bill of 350 million pounds ($433.30 million), will be completed by Oct. 21, the prospectus said. M&G is targeting cash generation of 2.2 billion pounds over three years and dividends will be stable or increase in absolute terms over time, it said in a separate prospectus. Prudential shareholders will receive one M&G share, with both firms expected to list on the FTSE 100 index .FTSE. M&G directors expect to declare a 2019 ordinary dividend of 310 million pounds and a one-off dividend of 100 million pounds. Prudential expects to declare a second interim ordinary dividend of around 510 million pounds, equivalent to around 19.6 pence per share. Prudential shares were down 0.5% at 1516 GMT, compared with a 0.2% drop in the FTSE 100."

17.632083076412634," Legal & General to sell annuities to Prudential pensions savers LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - British insurer Legal & General will offer annuities to Prudential pension savers in a deal it expects will increase its 2020 annuity sales by 15%, L&G said on Friday. Legal & General is one of the biggest players in annuities in Britain which offer pensioners a fixed income for life. Prudential pulled out of the annuity market in early 2017. Prudential pension policyholders who had been promised a guaranteed annuity rate will from Nov. 1 be “introduced” to Legal & General, who will take over the obligation of providing their annuities, L&G said. This follows similar deals between L&G and Aegon, Swiss Re unit ReAssure and Sun Life Financial of Canada. The market for individual annuities has been in decline since the British government gave pensioners more choice about how to use their pension pots in 2015. But L&G said its individual annuity sales had risen by 47% in the first half of 2019, to 497 million pounds ($623.98 million). Britain’s markets watchdog has previously flagged concern about mis-selling of annuities, particularly to people with a reduced life expectancy. L&G will “compare to whole market to see if the rate can be improved on, assisting customers to obtain a better rate if one is available”, it said. L&G is also a big player in bulk annuities, which involve taking on the risk of company defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes. It agreed a 930 million pound bulk annuity deal with Tate & Lyle this week."
19.42558629377127," Prudential subsidiaries to pay nearly $33 million to settle disclosure charges: SEC WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Prudential subsidiaries have agreed to pay nearly $33 million to settle charges they failed to disclose conflicts of interest and made misleading disclosures regarding 94 insurance-dedicated mutual funds they advised, the U.S. securities regulator said on Monday. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it had censured AST Investment Services Inc and PGIM Investments LLC, requiring them to disgorge $27.6 million and pay a civil fine of $5 million. The subsidiaries did not admit or deny the SEC’s findings, the SEC said. The SEC acknowledged that AST and PGIM self-reported their misconduct, cooperated with its investigation and had voluntarily reimbursed the funds more than $155 million. In 2006, Prudential reorganized its mutual fund business so it could receive certain tax benefits, the SEC said. This move benefited Prudential but the funds advised by the company’s two subsidiaries wound up losing income from a temporary recall of securities the mutual funds had out on loan. Neither Prudential nor the subsidiary disclose any potential conflict of interest to the affected mutual fund clients about the connection between the company reorganization and the recalls. Monday’s settlement comes as the SEC is seeking to stamp out undisclosed conflicts of interest among investment advisers and their clients. “Investment advisers must be vigilant in monitoring for conflicts related to actions taken by affiliates, and must act consistently with their representations to their clients,” said Dabney O’Riordan, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit. “Here, AST and PI acted to benefit their parent company despite the costs those acts imposed on their clients.”"

13.841163531748785," UK judge blocks $15 billion transfer of Prudential annuities to Rothesay Life LONDON (Reuters) - A UK High Court judge has blocked the transfer of 12 billion pounds ($15 billion) in annuities from insurer Prudential PRU.L to Rothesay Life, the two companies said on Friday. The deal, which would have been the largest ever such transfer covering 400,000 policy holders, was announced in March last year at the same time Prudential said it was to demerge its UK business. In response to tougher European Union rules introduced after the financial crisis, insurers have increasingly looked to free up capital by offloading closed books of annuity business to specialist firms such as Rothesay and Phoenix Group. The details of the ruling were not immediately available, but are likely to lead to questions about whether other similar big deals in the sector can be struck. At 1329 GMT, Prudential shares were down 0.7%. Prudential, which can appeal the decision, said it would have no impact on the company’s planned demerger of its UK insurance and asset management business, set to complete in the fourth quarter. The insurer said it was “disappointed” by the verdict. “The Independent Expert, who was appointed to report to the High Court, concluded the transfer would have no material adverse effect on the security of benefits or the reasonable benefit expectations of our policyholders.” Rothesay, whose investors include U.S. private equity giant Blackstone and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, is Britain’s largest specialist annuity insurer. It said the deal had already been approved by regulators the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulatory Authority. “Whilst it is not the preferred or optimal outcome for either party, it will not have a material impact on Rothesay Life as a whole,” it said. (This story corrects paragraph 8 to say that Rothesay is already Britain’s largest specialist annuity insurer)"

Prudential, which can appeal the decision, said it would have no impact on the company’s planned demerger of its UK insurance and asset management business, set to complete in the fourth quarter. The proposed transfer was initially agreed in March 2018.

13.670676257011028," Prudential to split by year-end; monitoring Hong Kong protests LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest insurer Prudential PRU.L will complete a planned break-up of the company by the end of the year, with its UK-focused fund and insurance business set to list as M&G Plc. The Asia and U.S.-focused rump of the company will continue to trade as Prudential and be listed in the UK, but will be subject to the regulator in Hong Kong - where Prudential said it was “carefully monitoring” current violent protests in the city. “We expect to complete the demerger of M&GPrudential in the fourth quarter of 2019, and preparations are complete for Prudential Plc’s move to group-wide supervision by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority,” Chief Executive Mike Wells said in a statement. “We believe that the demerger will enable both businesses to maximize their potential performance.” Prudential said last year it planned to split into two companies, a route followed by insurance and asset management peers including Old Mutual and Standard Life Aberdeen. The process has been slow, though, due to the need for a court process to complete a transfer of 12 billion pounds ($14.5 billion) in annuities to insurer Rothesay Life. Prudential agreed the sale of the book of closed policies to Rothesay last year. While splitting the two companies had been a complex task, Wells said it would allow both to perform better and had been done from a “position of strength”. John Foley, the chief executive of M&GPrudential and post-demerger of M&G Plc, said the split would open “many doors” for the company and help it tap growing global demand to save for retirement. “An independent M&GPrudential will be in a far stronger position to seize the many opportunities we see out there,” he said. While it would keep the Prudential brand for savings and insurance customers in the UK and Europe, and for asset management in South Africa, M&G would be the asset management brand globally. Total assets under management rose 6% in January-June from a year earlier to more than 341 billion pounds, Foley said, although like most of its major fund rivals, the bulk of that came from market moves more than offsetting net outflows of client cash. At 1123 GMT, shares in Prudential were down 1.3%. The split will enable the part of the group focused on Asia and the United States to be regulated in Hong Kong, where capital rules are considered less onerous. Prudential, which has a substantial business in mainland China and Hong Kong, has seen its shares hit hard by the long-running trade tussle between China and the United States, but Wells said business had not been impacted. Sales of insurance in mainland China jumped 45% in the first half from a year earlier, beating peers, Wells said, and the company now had a network of 231 sales offices in 89 cities. Wells declined to comment on the political situation in Hong Kong but said the company was “obviously taking appropriate precautions for our employees”, without elaborating. The former British colony has been rocked by around 10 weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters in the worst crisis since the territory reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Stripping out the performance of its M&GPrudential unit over the period, Prudential saw a 14% rise in half-year operating profit to 2.02 billion pounds, driven by robust growth in its Asian business. “The group’s performance has again been driven by our Asian business, where we have delivered double-digit growth across our key metrics of operating profit,” Wells said in a statement. “We are benefiting from growing demand for health, protection and savings across the region.” New business profit in Asia rose 10% over the six months to the end of June, while assets under management at its Asia-focused fund unit Eastspring grew 12% to 169.5 billion pounds. While there has been speculation Prudential may seek to sell off Jackson, its U.S. business, Wells said the company remained committed to the region and was actively targeting the growing number of ‘Baby Boomers’ set to retire in the coming years. However, he said he wanted the unit to accelerate its diversification and cash-flow generation, after reporting a 14% rise in first-half operating profit."

2.7236987106409116," Prudential shifts $50 billion in assets to Luxembourg ahead of Brexit LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest insurer, Prudential, has transferred 36 billion pounds ($47.33 billion) in customer assets to its new Luxembourg subsidiary ahead of Brexit, it said on Wednesday, as the company reported a six percent rise in operating profit. Insurers and banks have been shifting hundreds of billions of pounds in assets to European Union subsidiaries regardless of the form Brexit takes, reversing decades of European financial market integration and chipping away at the City of London’s dominance. British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a second, heavy parliamentary defeat on the withdrawal deal she struck with the EU on Tuesday, leaving open the possibility of an abrupt, economically damaging Brexit without a transition arrangement. But parliament is expected to vote against a no-deal Brexit later on Wednesday and then, on Thursday, vote for a delay. Prudential Chief Executive Mike Wells told a media call that the life insurer’s strategy was “not to assume any shape on Brexit, but to look at what retail and institutional clients would want, regardless of the shape of Brexit”. John Foley, head of Prudential’s UK business M&G Prudential, said the insurer had spent 27 million pounds on setting up the new Luxembourg operation, which currently has 35 staff. Prudential said it was making continued progress with plans to separate M&G Prudential through a stock market listing, which market sources expect before the end of the year. Wells declined to give a time frame for the demerger. Other insurers and asset managers such as Old Mutual and Standard Life Aberdeen have also restructured their businesses as they grapple with increased regulatory requirements and competitive pressures. JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said the demerger of the UK operations was a positive step. “It removes S-II (Solvency II capital requirements) overhang for non-European businesses and it is a step forward to further simplification by potentially splitting U.S. and Asia in the future to unlock more value.” After the spin-off, Prudential’s international business will be subject to Hong Kong regulation but will remain headquartered in Britain. Prudential reported a higher than forecast rise in 2018 operating profit to 4.8 billion pounds after a strong performance from its Asian business. The company’s Asian business “may be attractive to other players, as there are very few similar franchises”, JP Morgan Cazenove analysts also said, reiterating a “neutral” rating on the stock. The Asian business reported a 14 percent rise in operating profit. M&G Prudential’s profit rose 19 percent, with its British pensions business helped by a slowdown in improvements to life expectancy. In the United States, Prudential’s Jackson business reported an 11 percent fall in profit due to accounting measures related to lower U.S. stock markets. M&G Prudential had net asset management outflows of 9.9 billion pounds from external clients, including an expected redemption of a 6.5 billion pound institutional mandate. Prudential’s shares were trading at 15.32 pounds at 1025 GMT, up 0.2 percent and in line with the FTSE 100 index. Prudential said it would pay a total dividend of 49.35 pence per share, up 5 percent but below a forecast 50.36 pence."

In a statement on Thursday, Metro said it then undertook a comprehensive review of its loan book in order to establish the full picture before its fiscal full year, following the PRA advice. On Jan 23, it said its risk weighted assets had risen by around 900 million pounds ($1.18 billion), ramping up pressure on its core capital ratio - a widely-tracked measure of bank strength - which now stood at 15.8 percent, down from 19.1 percent in the third quarter.

The plans underscore Asia’s key role as a profit driver for the insurer, which is in the process of splitting itself into two. Higher sales in markets including China, Hong Kong, India, and Malaysia are guiding Prudential toward its goal of doubling the Asian business in size every five to seven years. “We are agency-focused in those markets, but we would love to do more on the distribution side,” Nic Nicandrou told Reuters last week, referring to markets including Indonesia and Vietnam. “We are on the lookout for right partners.” Besides expanding their own agent workforce to distribute products, insurance companies in Asia have been vying to tie up with banks by paying hefty fees to tap lenders’ branch networks and digital platforms. Prudential is also keen to acquire other insurance companies in the region, but there aren’t many sellers in the market, said Nicandrou. Prudential and at least four other insurance companies have bid for Commonwealth Bank of Australia's CBA.AX majority stake in an Indonesian insurance venture, people with knowledge of the process said last month. The British insurer declined to comment on the deal process. Prudential is de-merging M&G Prudential, its UK and Europe life insurance and asset management business, into a separate business with a London listing. The remaining Prudential business will focus on Asia and the United States. Responding to media reports that Chinese insurer Ping An 601318.SS is looking to buy Prudential's Asia business, the Asia chief executive said the insurer had not received any offer for the regional business. Eastspring, Prudential’s Asian asset management business, has applied for registration of its wholly owned unit in China to manage non-retail funds and is expected to win approval in the current quarter, he said. Prudential already has a joint venture with CITIC Group that manages retail funds in China, which is expected by asset management research firm Cerulli Associates to account for 49 percent of Asia’s total funds under management by 2020. Prudential, which in July this year agreed to buy 65 percent of TMB Asset Management from Thai bank TMB PCL TMB.BK, also has a 50:50 life insurance business in China with CITIC. “We can do some team lift-outs and bolt-on M&A there to grow our business and get a bigger share of the asset management market in China,” Nicandrou said, referring to Eastspring’s business."

The stake sale, which could value the venture at between $250 million and $300 million, has also received second-round bids from insurer FWD Group, Singapore-listed Great Eastern Holdings GELA.SI, and Indonesia's Sequis Life, three people said. Australia’s biggest lender is selling its 80 percent stake in PT Commonwealth Life, which has a presence in 20 Indonesian cities with more than 500,000 individual and group customers, Reuters reported in January. The interest in PT Commonwealth Life is the latest case of foreign insurers wanting to expand their life business in Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million people. In March, CBA confirmed that it was undertaking a strategic review of its Indonesian life insurance business, and that it has engaged external advisers for guidance on a possible sale of the venture. The second-round bids were submitted last week, the people said, adding potential buyers are likely to be further short-listed within the next few weeks before a decision is made by CBA. Representatives of CBA, FWD, Great Eastern, Prudential, and Sun Life declined to comment. Sequis said it could not comment now as it was “bound by NDA”, or non-disclosure agreement. The people declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk to the media about the deal process. The Australian lender has been selling some of its businesses over the past year after suffering a string of scandals including rate-rigging charges, breaches of anti-money laundering laws, and fees charged to dead clients. CBA sold its insurance business in Australia and New Zealand to AIA Group 1299.HK for $3.1 billion last year. It also said this year its loss-making digital banking unit in South Africa was being sold for an undisclosed sum. The Indonesian stake sale, if completed, will also be another instance of Asian banks exiting the insurance sector to free up capital and focus on their core banking businesses amid tougher regulatory capital buffer requirements. Asia is a battleground for foreign insurers including Aviva AV.L, Prudential and Sun Life, attracted by the region's lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums. The people said the foreign insurers competing for CBA’s stake in the Indonesian venture were looking to bolster their presence in Southeast Asia, which has seen a handful of M&A deals in the last couple of years in the insurance sector. Swiss group Zurich Insurance ZURN.S said on Thursday it was acquiring an 80 percent stake in Indonesia's Adira Insurance from PT Bank Danamon Indonesia BDMN.JK and a minority investor for at least $414 million. FWD, owned by Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Richard Li, has agreed to buy HSBC Holdings' HSBA.L stake in a Malaysian insurance joint venture as part of a plan to expand its presence in Asia, sources told Reuters last month. Sun Life, which operates in seven Asian markets including China, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines and Malaysia, has in recent years made a series of deals in the region to acquire businesses or raise its ownership in several of those markets. CBA raised its holding in Commonwealth Life to 80 percent in 2007 in what was then a 50:50 joint venture. The remaining 20 percent is owned by an Indonesian firm, PT Gala Arta Jaya, according to the insurer’s website. Besides the insurance joint venture, CBA also has a retail and business banking presence in Indonesia."

In March, CBA confirmed that it was undertaking a strategic review of its Indonesian life insurance business, and that it has engaged external advisers for guidance on a possible sale of the venture. The second-round bids were submitted last week, the people said, adding potential buyers are likely to be further short-listed within the next few weeks before a decision is made by CBA. Representatives of CBA, FWD, Great Eastern, Prudential, and Sun Life declined to comment. Sequis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The people declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk to the media about the deal process. The Australian lender has been selling some of its businesses over the past year after suffering a string of scandals including rate-rigging charges, breaches of anti-money laundering laws, and fees charged to dead clients. CBA sold its insurance business in Australia and New Zealand to AIA Group for $3.1 billion last year. It also said this year its loss-making digital banking unit in South Africa was being sold for an undisclosed sum. The Indonesian stake sale, if completed, will also be another instance of Asian banks exiting the insurance sector to free up capital and focus on their core banking businesses amid tougher regulatory capital buffer requirements. Asia is a battleground for foreign insurers including Aviva , Prudential and Sun Life, attracted by the region’s lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums. The people said the foreign insurers competing for CBA’s stake in the Indonesian venture were looking to bolster their presence in Southeast Asia, which has seen a handful of M&A deals in the last couple of years in the insurance sector. Swiss group Zurich Insurance said on Thursday it was acquiring an 80 percent stake in Indonesia’s Adira Insurance from PT Bank Danamon Indonesia and a minority investor for at least $414 million. FWD, owned by Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Richard Li, has agreed to buy HSBC Holdings’ stake in a Malaysian insurance joint venture as part of a plan to expand its presence in Asia, sources told Reuters last month. Sun Life, which operates in seven Asian markets including China, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines and Malaysia, has in recent years made a series of deals in the region to acquire businesses or raise its ownership in several of those markets. CBA raised its holding in Commonwealth Life to 80 percent in 2007 in what was then a 50:50 joint venture. The remaining 20 percent is owned by an Indonesian firm, PT Gala Arta Jaya, according to the insurer’s website. Besides the insurance joint venture, CBA also has a retail and business banking presence in Indonesia.

-12.683049470091785," Prudential launches consumer-direct insurance, investing service NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc is going straight to consumers with its insurance and investment products for the first time in its 143-year history, a move that follows rivals and startups which are already well established in the field. The direct-to-consumer service marks a sea change for Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential, the largest U.S. life insurance company by assets, managing $1.4 trillion, according to a filing. Prudential is also one the oldest U.S. insurance and investment companies, which has traditionally sold its products through a large network of advisers as well as employer-sponsored insurance and retirement plans. Prudential quietly unveiled the service, LINK by Prudential, in August, which offers personalized financial planning, recommendations for insurance, annuities and investments in a portfolio of exchange-traded funds, Prudential executives said in an interview. Customers can buy products through the LINK website, through remote advisers, or set up one-on-one meetings with local advisers. The shift, which comes long after insurance and financial services competitors have established an online presence and dozens of online life insurance startups have sprouted up, is an effort to balance a growing demand for online sales, without alienating the sales force that has played a large role in building the company. Prudential’s advisers continue to play a “critical role” in the company’s success, said Stephen Pelletier, chief operating officer of Prudential’s U.S.-based businesses. “Given where the investing world is going, this makes sense,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst John Barnidge, noting that the service is just one piece of Prudential’s multifaceted business. “Millennials and other younger people have large purchasing power,” Barnidge said, adding that they do not value insurance agent relationships as much as previous generations. The company’s service differs from others sold direct to consumers because it offers a more “seamless experience,” with customers able to get advice and buy both insurance and financial products from the same site, or choose from different levels of advisory services, said Naveen Agarwal, Prudential’s chief customer officer. Prudential’s goals also include finding new ways to grow business from customers it now serves through existing businesses. The insurer and investment company already works with 5 million customers who buy its insurance, income and investment products through Prudential’s adviser network. Prudential will also make the service available to 20 million people through workplace businesses, including retirement plans and pension payments it took over from other companies that bought group annuities, Pelletier said."
