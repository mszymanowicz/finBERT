KKR’s after-tax distributable earnings (DE) – the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders – rose to $431 million from $375.1 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 49 cents, surpassing the average analyst estimate of 41 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. Last month, KKR rival Blackstone Group Inc reported a 60% rise in fourth-quarter distributable earnings, while Carlyle Group Inc said last week its earnings climbed 38% year-on-year.

KKR said its private equity portfolio rose 32% during the quarter, while real estate and infrastructure funds gained 8% and 3%, respectively. Its leveraged credit funds rose by 7%. In the fourth quarter, KKR said net income reached $1.47 billion under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), driven by a sharp rise in investment gains. Total assets under management rose to $252 billion from $233.8 billion as of the end of September. KKR expects its assets under management to reach $342 billion following the completion of its $4.4 billion acquisition of annuities and life insurance provider Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd.

33.376935979969076," Harley Davidson adopts KKR executive-inspired employee stock program (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz said on Tuesday that the U.S. motorcycle maker would give stock grants to its employees, inspired by a program devised by KKR & Co Inc executive Pete Stavros. Zeitz said the move would make 4,500 employees of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company more aligned with executives and shareholders. While KKR is not an investor in Harley-Davidson, he said he worked on the plan after meeting Stavros, who has been spearheading a similar initiative at his private equity firm. “We wanted to align our expectations with those of our shareholders and include our hourly and factory workers,” Zeitz, who took charge of the 118 year-old motorcycle company last year, said in an interview. About 20,000 non-management employees have been awarded more than $500 million worth of stock across eight industrial companies owned by KKR, including New Jersey-based drug capsule maker Capsugel and Ingersoll Rand Inc, a Denver-based producer of pumps and compressors. “In industrial firms the majority of the workforce tend to have low levels of income and low levels of engagement, but they are critical to your success,” said Stavros, who co-heads KKR’s private equity business in the Americas. Harley-Davidson unveiled the employee stock program as part of a 2021-2025 strategic plan to bolster earnings growth and profitability. Earlier on Tuesday, the company said its revenue fell 32% to $725 million in the fourth quarter, as motorcycle shipments almost halved. It also reported a net loss of $96 million, as retail motorcycle sales in the United States - the company’s biggest market - fell for the 16th straight quarter."
46.05302417981988," Exclusive: KKR seeks $15 billion for flagship North America buyout fund, sources say NEW YORK (Reuters) - KKR & Co Inc aims to attract at least $15 billion for its flagship North America private equity fund, which would make it the second largest amount raised for a fund managed by the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Buyout firms are seeking to tap cheap and plentiful financing for acquisitions amid rising corporate valuations, as economies start recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Several investors have committed to KKR’s new fund, North America XIII, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter was confidential, adding that the target included money KKR employees would contribute. It will be the largest pool of capital KKR has attracted since its KKR 2006 Fund raised $17.6 billion. A spokeswoman for New York-based KKR, which now has $234 billion in assets under management, declined to comment. KKR Americas XII Fund raised $13.9 billion in 2017 and delivered 20% growth by June 2020, according to the website of Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, one of the investors. This means the fund ranks in the top quartile of all private equity funds of that vintage based on its financial performance, according to Cambridge Associates. KKR North America Fund XI raised $9 billion in 2013 and delivered 100% growth by June 2020, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund website said. North America XIII is the first fund in the region to be raised since KKR promoted Pete Stavros and Nate Taylor to co-heads of the private equity business in the Americas. Stavros previously led KKR’s investments in the industrial and healthcare sectors, while Taylor oversaw investments in the retail, consumer and technology sectors. KKR said it expected its assets under management to reach $311 billion after completing the $4.4 billion acquisition of annuities and life insurance provider Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd in the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals."
29.972423029113955," KKR closes first Asia Pacific real estate fund at $1.7 billion HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S.-based investment firm KKR & Co said on Thursday it had closed its first fund targeting real estate investments in Asia Pacific at $1.7 billion. The announcement comes days after KKR closed its inaugural Asia infrastructure fund, as the private equity powerhouse expands its platforms in the region. John Pattar, KKR head of real estate Asia, told Reuters the new fund would focus on Asia’s urbanization trends, corporate carve-outs of non-core real estate assets in Japan and also take-private opportunities in markets including Australia, Singapore and Japan. “Increased domestic consumption, productivity and urbanization – combined with the acceleration of e-commerce and platform-based businesses and the evolution of the traditional office landscape – is fundamentally reshaping the region’s real estate sector,” he said. The fund is also looking at opportunities in countries such as South Korea, which has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, said Hong Kong-based Pattar, a veteran real estate investor poached by KKR in 2018 to lead its Asia real estate efforts. “We look at markets that handle COVID best,” he said. “...Asia Pacific is the first to recover in 2021.” KKR’s real estate fundraising comes as private equity firms globally have expanded from a model of buying out companies to turn around and sell for profit. They now invest through a range of alternative asset management products including infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit. Investment firms raised $9 billion in 47 Asia-focused real estate funds last year, following a record $26 billion raised in 2019, according to data provider Preqin. KKR’s U.S.-based rival Blackstone Group raised the region’s biggest real estate fund in 2018 at $7.1 billion. KKR will also be competing with regional firms such as Hillhouse Capital Group, which has hired former Warburg Pincus and Blackstone dealmakers to build out its real estate capabilities. The New York-headquartered firm launched its dedicated global real estate platform in 2011 and has about $14 billion of real estate assets under management as of the end of September 2020. In Asia Pacific, it has deployed more than $1.5 billion of equity across about 20 real estate transactions since 2011. Its portfolio includes office tower Namsan Square in Seoul, Oasis Shopping Centre in Australia’s Gold Coast and Hong Kong retail assets Lake Silver and Parkside."

28.53506014537176," KKR closes its first Asia Pacific infrastructure fund at $3.9 billion HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S.-based investment powerhouse KKR & Co said Monday it has closed a fund targeting infrastructure-related investments in Asia Pacific at $3.9 billion. The fund, KKR’s first in the region for the sector, closed at its hard cap to become the largest pan-regional infrastructure fund for Asia Pacific, the firm said in a press release. KKR invested about $300 million in the fund alongside external investors through its balance sheet and employee commitments. KKR first established its global infrastructure team and strategy in 2008 but entered Asia only 11 years later when it poached David Luboff, then CEO of Macquarie Group’s Asia Infrastructure Fund, to build out its Asia team. It launched the fundraising later that year. The firm has committed US$1.8 billion across six investments in the infrastructure sector, including a roughly $400 million acquisition of a controlling stake in India Grid Trust, India’s leading infrastructure investment trust and a $192 million purchase of a minor stake in First Gen, a leading Philippines power producer."

The funding round, which aims to raise $2 billion and would make it the world’s most valuable financing round in the private market, is drawing to a close after kicking off about a month ago, the two people said. The sources declined to be identified as talks were not public. A Sequoia spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. KKR didn’t immediately respond. ByteDance declined to comment. The Chinese company has seen its valuation more than double in the past two years. ByteDance’s last round of financing dates back to 2018, which valued it at $78 billion after that round. Earlier this year, ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion in the secondary private equity market. The jump in valuation comes despite a U.S. order, citing national security grounds, that ByteDance must divest TikTok’s U.S. assets. In its home market, however, it is on track to rake in at least 180 billion yuan ($27.2 billion) in advertising revenue this year, Reuters has reported. Douyin, ByteDance’s Chinese version of TikTok, said it had amassed 600 million daily users in August."

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but a person familiar with the matter said KKR agreed to pay around $100 million for its Argenta stake. KKR will acquire its stake in New Zealand-based Argenta from Tomlinson Group, which will become a significant minority shareholder, a statement said. Founded in 2006, Argenta provides animal-focused contract research and manufacturing for pharmaceutical companies across the United States, Europe and New Zealand. Argenta plans to use KKR’s investment to expand its research and development as well as its clinical regulatory services in Europe and the United States, Ben Russell, the company’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. KKR’s investment was made out of its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund, which raised $1.45 billion from investors in 2017. Private equity interest in the pet and animal care sector has grown due to significant household spending on animal diet, health, and exercise. KKR currently owns PetVet Care Centers, a Westport, Connecticut-based network of pet clinics. In 2018, the buyout firm sold its remaining stake in Pets at Home Group, a UK-based pet retailer supplier it bought for 955 million pounds in 2010."

After-tax distributable earnings (DE) – the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders – rose to $410.4 million, up from $388.8 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 48 cents, which exceeded the average Wall Street analyst forecast of 40 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. “The capital markets business has been growing over time as this has been an area KKR has invested a lot in, but it can bounce around a bit from quarter-to-quarter and we expect it to moderate,” said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan. KKR’s shares were down 1.8% in afternoon trading, in line with the broader market. KKR said the value of its private equity portfolio appreciated by 16% during the quarter, while real estate and infrastructure funds rose 6% and 10% respectively. Its leveraged credit funds rose by 5%. On Wednesday, rival Blackstone Group BX.N said its third-quarter distributable earnings rose 9%, while its private equity funds appreciated by 12.2%. Carlyle Group Inc CG.O reported a smaller-than-expected 6% drop in its third-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, with its overall fund portfolio rising 5%. Apollo Global Management APO.N said its private equity portfolio rose 8%, although distributable earnings fell 8% during the quarter. KKR said its net income under generally accepted accounting principles rose to $1.1 billion, from $241.2 million a year earlier, driven by income from capital allocated out of its balance sheet. The strength in its capital markets business offset a decline in profits from asset sales. Total asset management was $233.8 billion at the end of September, up from $221.8 billion from three months earlier. KKR closed the quarter with $67.1 billion in unspent capital. KKR said it is on track to raise its three flagship funds - Americas private equity, global infrastructure, and Asia private equity - as well as 20 other strategies over the next 18 months. It said it already amassed over $13 billion in its flagship Asia private equity fund, which began fundraising last year. “We really did lean in when the market was dislocated, so this dry powder is particularly noteworthy given the level of capital investment we have made year-to-date,” KKR chief financial officer Robert Lewin said during an analyst earnings call on Friday.

Reliance Retail is on a fundraising spree and has secured around $1.8 billion in the past few weeks from KKR & Co KKR.N and Silver Lake Partners. Mubadala’s investment translates into a 1.4% equity stake in Reliance Retail Ventures Limited on a fully diluted basis, according to the statement and a source close to the deal. “This marks the second significant investment by Mubadala in a Reliance Industries subsidiary after the $1.2 billion investment in Jio Platforms announced earlier this year,” Reliance said. Reliance, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has approached investors, who collectively pumped more than $20 billion into its Jio Platforms digital business this year, to take stakes in its retail business. That business has nearly 12,000 stores and sells everything from groceries and electronics to fashion and shoes. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Mubadala, which manages over $230 billion in assets and is the second-biggest state investor in Abu Dhabi after Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, was in advanced talks to invest in Reliance Retail.

Reliance Industries, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, is lining up investors in its retail unit after the conglomerate raised just over $20 billion this year from global investors, including Facebook Inc FB.O, by selling stakes in its Jio Platforms digital business. The Mumbai-headquartered Reliance has approached investors in Jio Platforms about buying stakes in its retail arm, Reuters had reported. While Silver Lake, another one of Jio Platforms’ backers, said earlier this month it will invest $1.02 billion in Reliance Retail. KKR’s investment for a 1.28% stake in Reliance Retail values the company at 4.21 trillion rupees ($57 billion), Reliance said in a statement. “Retail, whether online or offline, is a very capital-intensive business, so for Reliance making sure that their retail venture has a funding pipeline of its own is important,” said Devangshu Dutta, the chief executive of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. KKR, which announced its biggest investment in Asia with a $1.5 billion stake buy in Jio Platforms in May, said it was deepening its relationship with Reliance. Reliance Retail is “empowering merchants of all sizes and fundamentally changing the retail experience for Indian consumers,” KKR co-founder Henry Kravis said in the statement. Reliance, already India’s biggest retailer with roughly 12,000 stores, forged a $3.38 billion deal last month to acquire rival Future Group’s retail business. The Indian conglomerate is also attempting to expand its so-called new commerce venture, which ties neighborhood stores to Reliance for online deliveries of groceries, apparel and electronics in a space currently dominated by Walmart Inc's WMT.N Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Indian arm. “Anyone taking on the deep-pocketed Amazon and Walmart has to make sure they are equally well-capitalized,” Dutta said."

KKR started marketing the new Asia fund towards the end of last year before the COVID-19 pandemic, targeting $12.5 billion in what would be the region’s biggest private equity fund, people familiar with the situation have said. It is unclear when the final close of the fund will be reached. KKR declined to comment on its fundraising status. Sun, speaking at the AVCJ China Virtual Forum, said China, the world’s second largest economy, has been an important market for the fund, adding that Japan, India and Southeast Asia are also its focused markets. The U.S.-based firm has been investing heavily in India this year, most notably a $1.5 billion purchase of a stake in the country’s top telecom operator Jio Platforms.

The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""ASO"". (bit.ly/2RcnjYA) Academy Sports, which KKR bought in 2011, has 259 stores across the United States that sell sporting equipment including footwear, apparel as well as products like tents, and bicycles. The company’s net sales rose nearly 1% to $4.8 billion in 2019 from a year earlier. Academy Sports said on Wednesday it expects to benefit from the shift to recreational activities. “More recently, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers are spending more time at and around home engaging in isolated recreation and leisure activities that we support,” the company said. The company’s public offering comes at a time of a revival of investor interest in IPOs after the dry spell in recent months.

KnowBe4, which last year raised $300 million in a private fundraising round led by buyout firm KKR & Co, has engaged investment banks to help with preparations for the IPO, which could come later this year or early in 2021, the sources said. The IPO could value KnowBe4 at over $2 billion, one of the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential and cautioned that the listing plans are subject to market conditions. KnowBe4 and KKR declined to comment. Tampa, Florida-based KnowBe4, which was founded in 2010 by entrepreneur Stu Sjouwerman, educates employees at various companies on how to detect fraudulent emails and other potential online scams. Demand for its services has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies spend more to protect the information technology systems of employees working from home. Worldwide spending on information security and risk management technology and services is expected to reach $124 billion in 2020, according to technology research firm Gartner. KnowBe4’s plans to go public come at a time of frenetic activity in U.S. capital markets, with public debuts of high-profile, venture-backed tech startups such as Airbnb, Palantir Technologies, Asana and DoorDash lined up before the end of 2020. During the last full week of August, nearly two dozen companies filed registration statements to go public - the highest levels in recent history. Companies that have gone public in the United States have so far raised more than $70 billion this year, already the second-biggest yearly haul since 2000."

The buyout of Epicor, which provides application software to mid-sized retailers, distributors and manufacturers, is one of the U.S. sector’s largest so far this year and is the ninth investment by CD&R since March. Companies such as Epicor that generate recurring revenue through business software sales have been popular targets for the private equity industry. CD&R’s Operating Partner Jeff Hawn will become chairman of Epicor’s board after the deal closes this year, the companies said. Hawn led software firms such as Quest Software and Vertafore before joining the investment firm this year. CD&R, whose portfolio companies have been Epicor customers, regarded the Austin, Texas-based business as resilient in an economic downturn with a long-term customer base and recurring revenue, a person familiar with the matter said. CD&R plans to expand Epicor by building cloud-based products with a software-as-a-service model, as well as acquiring other companies in the sector, the source said. KKR acquired Epicor from Apax Partners in 2016 for $3.3 billion, including debt. The private equity firm had been exploring a sale of Epicor since last year, Reuters reported earlier this month. UBS Investment Bank is acting as financial adviser and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP as legal adviser to CD&R.

5.773068193299428," Former KKR dealmaker launches healthcare-focused buyout firm (Reuters) - Jim Momtazee, a former dealmaker at U.S. buyout firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N, has launched his own firm to pursue private equity deals in the healthcare sector. Momtazee, who spent 21 years at KKR and led its Americas healthcare team for a decade, said in a statement he formed Patient Square Capital together with Maria Walker, a former partner at consulting firm KPMG. The move comes as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has strained some healthcare providers, while spurring growth in some sectors such as telemedicine and vaccine production. Patient Square Capital plans to look for deals across the healthcare industry, including technology-enabled services, biopharmaceuticals, the pharmaceutical value chain, medical devices, diagnostics, providers, digital health and consumer health, the statement said. “We’re going to be broad-based in our focus on all aspects of healthcare, bringing depth of knowledge, scale, expertise, and long-term view to our investments,” Momtazee told Reuters in an interview. Prior to leaving KKR last year, Momtazee worked on some of the buyout firm's biggest healthcare deals, including the $33 billion take-private of U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N, as well as the acquisition of contract research firm PRA International for $1.3 billion in 2013."
2.9213811565498227," KKR beats estimates with flat second-quarter earnings (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N said on Tuesday second-quarter distributable earnings were almost unchanged from a year earlier, beating many analysts' expectations thanks to a rise in management and performance fees. KKR said after-tax distributable earnings (DE) of $326 million were in line with the $327 million posted a year earlier. This translated to after-tax DE per share of 39 cents, which was greater than the 36 cents that Wall Street analysts estimated on average, according to Refinitiv. KKR’s shares were up 1.4% at $36.30 on Tuesday afternoon. Following similar announcements by its peers, KKR said the value of its funds rebounded alongside the recovery of financial markets from a slump caused by the spread of the coronavirus, allowing investment income to rise 37% to $1.58 billion. KKR’s private equity funds rose 11% in the second quarter, while global infrastructure and real estate funds rose 7% and 2% respectively. Its leverage credit funds rose 11%. Last month, Blackstone Group Inc BX.N said its private equity portfolio rose 12.8% in the second quarter, while Carlyle Group Inc CG.O and Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N reported that their private equity funds grew 13% and 11.7% respectively. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), KKR said its net income rose 36% year-on-year to $698.6 million in the second quarter owing to the appreciation of its funds. The New York-based firm said its performance fee income rose 52% to $355.4 million, as it completed asset sales including the 2.8 billion euros ($3.03 billion) divestment of German fiber-optic network company Deutsche Glasfaser to private equity firm EQT and Canadian pension fund OMERS. In July, KKR announced that it agreed to acquire annuities and life insurer Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd, a deal that is expected to add about $72 billion to the buyout firm’s assets under management when it is completed in early 2021. “The retirement end market continues to grow, with an aging population creating demographic tailwinds,” said KKR’s Co-president Scott Nuttall during a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. “We expect annual net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work together.” KKR said its total asset management was $222 billion, up from $207.1 billion as of the end of March, driven by strong fundraising in its flagship funds. The firm declared its regular quarterly dividend of 0.135 cents per share."
6.801403342258975," KKR to take over Goldman Sachs-backed insurer Global Atlantic (Reuters) - KKR & Co Inc KKR.N said on Wednesday it would acquire Goldman Sachs-backed Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd, making it the latest private equity firm to add an annuities and life insurance provider to its platform. KKR said it will become the manager of Global Atlantic’s investment portfolio, giving it a steady stream of lucrative fees and boosting its assets under management from $207 billion to $279 billion. New York-based KKR will take over Global Atlantic through its balance sheet rather than its buyout funds, and plans to keep it as opposed to flipping it for a profit as it does with its private equity portfolio. It said the deal will boost its permanent capital base from 9% to 33%, reducing its reliance on fundraising. The purchase price will be equal to Global Atlantic’s book value at the time the deal closes, sometime in the first quarter of 2021 subject to regulatory approvals, KKR said. Global Atlantic had a book value of about $4.4 billion at the end of March. KKR said it would pay cash for the acquisition but offer the opportunity to Global Atlantic investors, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, to keep ownership of the firm. KKR said it expected to own about 60% of Global Atlantic. KKR shares ended Wednesday up 10% at $33.88. Global Atlantic serves more than 2 million policyholders through its retirement and life insurance products. It was set up by Goldman Sachs in 2004. The investment bank kept a stake in it when it separated it as an independent company in 2013. KKR co-President Scott Nuttall told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday that Global Atlantic’s investors will have made three times their money over the last seven years as a result of the deal. Two years from now, KKR expects to be receiving $200 million in annual management fees as a result of the deal, KKR’s chief financial officer, Robert Levin, said. Last year, it generated $1.2 billion in management fees. KKR said it expected to grow Global Atlantic’s platform through more acquisitions, as low interest rates give insurers that generate returns from high-yielding assets such as private equity an edge. It is the latest deal in the private equity industry to emulate Warren Buffett, whose network of insurance firms has given his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N a reliable flow of insurance premiums to invest. Private equity rival Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N has blazed a trail in the insurance industry, and now generates almost half its management fees through permanent capital it manages for a network of insurers, including Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N, which also account for about half its $316 billion of assets under management. Unlike with KKR and Global Atlantic, however, Apollo owns only a third of Athene. Blackstone Group Inc BX.N manages the investment portfolio of FGL Holdings, an insurance firm with $28.9 billion in assets under management that was taken over last month by Fidelity National Financial Inc FNF.N.

Daniel, who served as executive vice president at Danaher from 2008 till March this year, is expected to become chief executive of an industrial company that KKR will acquire, and help improve its performance, KKR’s co-head of Americas private equity Pete Stavros said in an interview. He added that the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown presents opportunities for KKR to acquire companies. “With demand being down in the industrial sector, it makes for an attractive buying environment,” Stavros said. Daniel managed Danaher’s industrial technologies and life sciences portfolios until 2017, and subsequently ran the company’s diagnostics and dental divisions. He is the second Danaher executive KKR has recruited. In 2017, KKR hired Ronald Voigt, who previously ran X-Rite Pantone, a Danaher subsidiary. Voight was eventually named CEO of Hyperion Materials & Technologies after KKR acquired the Worthington, Ohio-based industrial tools maker in 2018 from Sandvik AB SAND.ST for 4 billion Swedish knona ($432 million). KKR said its upcoming industrial acquisition will be made through its flagship $13.9 billion Americas Fund XII. All KKR industrial portfolio companies have an employee stock ownership program as an incentive to drive growth, the buyout firm said. In March, KKR merged Gardner Denver Holdings Inc, a pumps and compressors producer it acquired for $3.9 billion in 2013, with the industrial division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc, creating a new company, Ingersoll Rand Inc IR.N, which has a $12 billion market capitalization. KKR has kept a 17% stake in the new company."

Arnott’s, which also makes Monte Carlo, Mint Slice and SAO biscuits, had made management changes which meant “a small number of employees will be departing our business”, a spokeswoman said, without disclosing which positions were being cut. The cuts would give Arnott’s the “right organisational structure to ensure its success as a stand-alone company”, the spokeswoman said in an email. The cuts would involve about 2% of the workforce, she added, equating to roughly 48 of the company’s 2,400 employees. The move comes a year after KKR bought Arnott's from Campbell Soup Co CPB.N as part of a $2.2 billion deal that also included the U.S. snack giant's international and ""fresh"" units. [reut.rs/2BNIRGo] Buyout specialists such as KKR routinely cut costs of portfolio companies to improve profitability and prepare for resale in periods of typically four years. KKR declined to comment on Arnott’s job cuts. Arnott’s has factories in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane and has been foreign-owned since the 1990s. The spokeswoman said the 155-year-old company “must re-adjust and build its capabilities in order to remain competitive against overseas exports and continue to grow”."

The sale of the unit, called MLC, could fetch more than A$1 billion ($688 million), said two of the sources, who declined to be identified as the negotiations are private. KKR's interest comes on the heels of an agreement in May to pay A$1.7 billion for 55% of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's CBA.AX wealth unit, Colonial First State. Spokeswomen for KKR and NAB declined to comment. Representatives for Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Suitors are expected to submit bids for MLC by Tuesday, one of the sources said. A second source said the timeline for the sale was fluid. NAB, Australia’s third largest bank, decided to divest its wealth management unit in 2018, but the plan has been delayed by a management overhaul and a special government-appointed inquiry into the financial services sector that found industry-wide misconduct. It appointed Morgan Stanley MS.N and Macquarie Group MQG.AX to handle the sale of the unit, which manages over A$120 billion in funds. The unit had an operating margin of 0.46% in the six months to March, company documents show. Blackstone Group BX.N also expressed early interest in MLC, two of the sources said, although it was not immediately clear if it is still interested. A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment. A string of scandals and the findings of the year-long financial sector inquiry that ended in February 2019 have prompted Australia’s biggest banks to focus on core businesses and divest wealth management and insurance units."

The offer is preliminary and was submitted to Oxford Immunotec in the last few days, the sources said. It comes after the company explored a potential sale to large healthcare peers over the course of the last year, but failed to agree on terms, the sources added. KKR and Ampersand Capital have proposed to acquire Oxford Immunotec for around $15 per share in cash, subject to due diligence, the sources said. There is no certainty that the offer will lead to a deal, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Oxford Immunotec, KKR and Ampersand did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oxford Immunotec sells its tuberculosis test kits and associated accessories to laboratories that perform the testing themselves. It also has a clinical testing laboratory in Britain where it performs the tests on samples sent in by clients. Its customers include independent laboratories, large hospital systems and public and private institutions. Oxford Immunities so-called T-SPOT.TB test measures antigen-specific T cells indicative of a tuberculosis infection. About 23% of the world’s population, or about 1.7 billion people, are infected with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, according to the World Health Organization. Oxford Immunotec listed on the Nasdaq in 2013. Its shares ended trading on Thursday at $12.96. In 2018, the company sold its laboratory services business to Quest Diagnostics Inc DGX.N for gross proceeds of $170 million in cash.

24.01888265377092," Exclusive: KKR raises $4 billion to invest in coronavirus-stricken credit - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - KKR & Co Inc KKR.N has raised close to $4 billion from investors to snap up corporate debt at significant discounts, as the coronavirus outbreak weighs on big swathes of the corporate world, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. A wave of interventions from the Federal Reserve and trillions of dollars in U.S. government stimulus have allowed many companies battered by the crisis to continue to borrow. Yet several firms, particularly those whose debt is rated ‘junk’ by credit rating agencies, are struggling to stay afloat. They have seen the value of their debt plunge, leaving them with limited or no access to capital markets. Their battered bonds represent attractive opportunities for KKR, the sources said. KKR raised $2.8 billion for its KKR Dislocation Opportunities Fund and more than $1.1 billion through separately managed accounts investing alongside the fund, the sources said. The fund is a rebranding of KKR’s Special Situations Fund III, which the private equity firm was marketing to investors last year with a $1.5 billion target, Reuters reported at the time. “We know this market is not a forgiving one, but as we navigate this global crisis together, we will find attractive opportunities to invest in good companies with strong fundamentals and sustainable cash flows at discounted prices,” Chris Sheldon, KKR’s head of leveraged credit, wrote in a letter to investors in April. After it rebranded the credit investment fund for the COVID-19 era, KKR completed its fundraising in eight weeks, securing capital commitments from over 20 new institutional investors, the sources said. KKR and its employees invested about $447 million in the new fund, which will have an 18-month investment period, the sources added. KKR had about $67.6 billion in assets under management in its credit business as of the end of March."
50.056075135080604," Australia's CBA takes $970 million COVID-hit, sells control of wealth unit to KKR SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX said on Wednesday it booked A$1.5 billion ($970 million) in provisions in the third quarter to cover future pandemic-related loan losses and that it had sold a majority stake in its wealth management unit to KKR. The coronavirus crisis has meant Australia’s banks are facing record-low interest rates, rising unemployment and what is likely to be the country’s first recession in three decades. CBA’s charge brings its total credit provisions to A$6.4 billion while total credit provisions by the country’s “Big Four” lenders now stand at more than A$23 billion. During the January-March quarter, CBA’s cash profit fell 23.5% to A$1.3 billion, while higher risk weightings for loan exposure cut its core equity tier one capital ratio to 10.7% from 11.7% at end-December. Highlighting financial strains caused by the virus on Australians, CBA said it had received 144,000 requests for deferrals on home loan repayments, 70,700 for business loans and 25,000 for personal loans. Economic modelling by the country’s biggest home loan lender also showed it believes home prices could plunge by nearly a third by 2022 in the case of a prolonged downturn. The bank said, however, it was well prepared to weather the coming economic stress and that capitalisation levels compared favourably to levels seen before the global financial crisis. “Compared to pre-GFC levels, we now hold three to four times the provisions for credit losses and our capital ratios are more than double on a like-for-like basis,” CEO Matt Comyn said in a statement. It added that the sale of a 55% stake in its Colonial First State wealth management business to private equity giant KKR & Co Inc KKR.N for A$1.7 billion would increase that core capital ratio by up to 0.40% and is expected to completed in the first half of 2021. The sale comes after a string of scandals and a shift focus on core banking operations, and follows the sale of its asset management arm to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 8306.T for $2.9 billion in late 2018. In the last fortnight, CBA’s rivals, which reported first-half earnings, have more than quadrupled their bad debt charges. Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX, National Australia Bank NAB.AX, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX - posted a near two-thirds drop in their combined profit due to the charges which totalled around A$5 billion."

KKR’s investment comes amid a surge in demand for online shopping and delivery services because of the stay-at-home orders and economic shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pizzerias, restaurants and other retail shops have been closed to in-person visitors, and have relied on online orders to generate sales. Slice will use the cash to enhance its online ordering, marketing, payments and other services, which serve more than 12,000 pizza shops across all 50 states, KKR said. “Slice comes at it from a foundational perspective providing services to allow independent pizza stores to compete with the big four pizza corporations,” said Jake Heller, co-head of KKR’s Technology Growth team in North America. Venture capital firm GGV Capital and other early investors in Slice also participated in the KKR-led funding round. Slice’s valuation following the deal was not disclosed, but the latest investment brings the total amount the company has raised to $82 million, sources said. KKR is making its investment in Slice largely through its Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II, which raised $2.2 billion from investors in January."

The firm also laid out plans to cut costs by $700 million, suspended its dividend and said KKR would invest $1 billion in Coty through the sale of convertible preferred shares. “Coty is clearly taking very aggressive actions to reduce its leverage and put the company in a better position for the long-run,” Wells Fargo analyst Joe Lachky wrote in a note. Coty, which has been struggling with slowing sales and mounting debt, had put the brands on the block last October and seen interest from sector players such as Henkel HNKG_p.DE and Unilever ULVR.L. Henkel, which owns the Schwarzkopf hair care brand, had been hoping to boost its market share with Wella, but dropped out several weeks ago due to differences on price and the structure of a deal, a person familiar with the matter said. Henkel declined to comment on Coty’s deal with KKR. Henkel said earlier on Monday it expected its beauty care business to have a tough second quarter as many salons are still closed, after sales fell 3.9% in the first quarter. Sales of U.S. prestige beauty products fell 14% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion, according to NPD Group, while online sales rose 24% in the same period, with hair products up 41%. L'Oreal OREP.PA - the world's number one in salon haircare followed by John Paul Mitchell Systems and Coty, according to Euromonitor - said last month it was counting on consumers rushing back to salons once lockdowns are lifted. But Henkel Chief Executive Carsten Knobel noted the salons that are reopening are operating at lower capacity than before the crisis due to social distancing and hygiene rules, with consumers less willing to spend due to recession fears. Meanwhile, Henkel saw demand boom for home hair dyeing, with U.S. online orders for personalised hair colour jumping sixfold. Coty reported a wider-than-expected loss and revenue down 23% for the three months ended March 31, including a 14% fall in its professional beauty division. The company decided to put the portfolio up for sale after it struggled to integrate more than 40 brands it acquired from Procter & Gamble PG.N in 2016, forcing it to rethink its strategy. Coty bought a majority stake in Kylie Jenner’s make-up and skincare businesses late last year, banking on Jenner’s more than 270 million social media followers to attract a younger audience. As part of the deal with KKR, the private equity firm will also get two seats on Coty’s board. Coty said that under the deal, which also includes the Clairol and ghd brands, the nail and hair care business would operate as a standalone company, with KKR acquiring a 60% stake and Coty retaining the rest. Including debt, the deal values Wella at $4.3 billion, or 12.3 times its 2019 core earnings (EBITDA). As part of the transaction, KKR is buying $750 million worth convertible preferred shares in Coty, while it will later buy another $250 million of these securities. New York-based Coty will continue to fully own its mass beauty business in Brazil, for which the company was exploring options."
41.52952651328474," KKR's first-quarter profit rises 11% on stronger asset sales NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N reported an 11% jump in after-tax distributable earnings in the first quarter on Wednesday, driven by growth in asset sales and management fees ahead of the coronavirus-linked market turmoil. After-tax distributable earnings rose to $355.3 million in the quarter through March, from $314.1 million a year earlier, KKR said. This translated to after-tax distributable earnings of 42 cents per share, in line with the average analyst forecast, according to data from Refinitiv. KKR’s shares were up 2.3% in early afternoon trading on Wednesday. Private equity firms such as KKR were forced to mark down the value of many of their funds following a sharp decline in global markets in February and March amid economic fallout from the pandemic, which shut down large swaths of the economy. The value of KKR’s private equity portfolio depreciated by 12% in the quarter, while its alternative credit and leveraged credit funds fell by 16% and 13% respectively. However, KKR said the value of its global infrastructure funds rose 18%. During the quarter, KKR sold its German fiber-optic network company Deutsche Glasfaser to private equity firm EQT EQTAB.ST and Canadian pension fund OMERS for a reported 2.8 billion euros ($3.03 billion). KKR's peers have also reported declines in the values of their funds in the first quarter. Last week, Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N said its private equity portfolio depreciated by 21.6% in the first quarter, while its credit funds declined 9% in aggregate. In April, Blackstone Group Inc BX.N reported a 21.6% slump in its private equity portfolio, while opportunistic and core real estate funds fell by 8.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Carlyle Group Inc CG.O said its private equity funds fell by 8% in the quarter, while credit funds fell by 21%. KKR reported a net loss of $1.3 billion under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the quarter, compared with a net income of $701 million a year earlier. This takes into account the mark-to-market valuations of its funds, even if paper losses have not been realized. KKR said it has made about $8 billion in new investments since the onset of the pandemic, partly by snapping up junk-rated loans and bonds. “We are using the target list we’ve been building over the last few years,” KKR Co-president Scott Nuttall said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. “And investing into companies we know and like at risk reward levels we find attractive.” At the end of March, KKR had $207.1 billion in assets under management, down from $218.4 billion three months earlier. KKR declared a quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share."

38.6584309430379," Exclusive: KKR's Envision Healthcare hires bank to explore debt restructuring - sources (Reuters) - Envision Healthcare Corp, a U.S. provider of physicians and other medical staff owned by buyout firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N, has hired a financial adviser to explore ways to restructure its $7.5 billion debt pile, people familiar with the matter said. Envision’s move underscores the struggles facing the medical industry in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company’s doctors are needed more than ever as the number of COVID-19 cases soars. Yet its revenue has collapsed as patients who have not contracted the virus are avoiding elective procedures and are staying clear of emergency rooms for fear of being infected. Envision has hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc HLI.N to explore a range of debt restructuring options, according to the sources. Envision's recent offer to creditors to exchange some of its bonds with loan borrowings will not be enough to keep the company afloat, the sources said. The healthcare services provider will have to make more significant cuts to its debt, the sources added. The sources cautioned that no decision on a course of action had yet been taken and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Envision, KKR and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. The novel coronavirus, which first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has infected more than 1.4 million people around the world, killing more than 87,700. In the United States, the number of those infected topped 459,000 on Thursday, with deaths soaring to more than 16,400. Elective surgeries that Envision provides are among the most lucrative medical procedures, while intensive care, which COVID-19 patients require, is far more expensive. Envision’s business of staffing emergency rooms has also suffered because it gets compensated per visit rather than for the time patients spent there. As a result, the typical two-week period that many COVID-19 patients spend in intensive care is a further drag on Envision’s revenue. Moreover, it not just the non-COVID-19 patients who are avoiding hospital treatment when possible. Acute care hospitals are postponing non-essential elective surgical procedures to make room for COVID-19 patients. Ambulatory surgery centers are doing the same on the advice of health officials and to conserve surgical supplies, such as personal protective equipment. Envision said this week that patient volumes are down by as much as 70% in its ambulatory surgery and anesthesia services since the onset of the pandemic, while emergency room visits are down by 30%. The company also said that it would cut senior staffers’ salaries by 50%, reduce doctors’ pay in areas where patient visits are down, and furlough non-clinical workers. A portion of Envision’s roughly $5 billion term loan was trading at 60 cents on the dollar this week, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating investor concerns about being paid back in full. The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package approved by Congress includes a $100 billion relief fund to reimburse medical providers. However, many large doctors’ groups such as Envision, which has more than 25,000 physicians, anesthesiologists and other medical staff, are not eligible for aid. The only relief Envision has secured so far is a three-month advance on Medicare fee-for-service payments, which has made little difference to its finances, according to one of the sources. “The ongoing spread of the coronavirus will make it increasingly challenging for Envision to manage its labor costs, sustain consistent revenue cycle management, and maintain subsidies that it receives from hospitals,” credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc said this week. Much of Envision's debt is the legacy of KKR's $9.9 billion leveraged buyout of the company in 2018. Its rival, TeamHealth Inc, which is owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, has also been hit by a severe decline in revenue and cash flow, according to Moody's. Envision provides medical staff to more than 1,800 clinical departments in healthcare facilities in 45 states and the District of Columbia. It also owns and operates 257 surgery centers and one surgical hospital in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The company faced financial threats even before the emergence of the pandemic. U.S. lawmakers are considering proposals that would reduce reimbursement that Envision collects on out-of-network claims. Some patients have criticized it for so-called “surprise billing,” after unknowingly seeing a doctor who was not covered by their health insurance, even though the visit may have occurred in an in-network facility. In February, Envision replaced its chief executive officer Chris Holden with healthcare services company OptumCare president James Rechtin. The company said this week said it would deploy a total of 200 doctors to the Mount Sinai Health System and nearby hospitals in New York to help with the coronavirus crisis."
41.507784001819594," Exclusive: KKR shelves $2 billion sale of Singapore-based Goodpack due to market slump: sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - KKR & Co KKR.N has shelved a plan to sell Singapore-based Goodpack, which provides shipping containers and logistics services, after the coronavirus outbreak hit valuations, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The private equity group had received bids from a few consortiums after tapping more than a dozen potential buyers late last year, the sources said, adding that a deal could have valued Goodpack at about $2 billion. “Till about six weeks ago, bidders were interested and a deal looked likely but there’s a lot of uncertainty in the current environment,” said one of the sources. The sources declined to be identified as the shelving of the deal has not been made public. KKR declined to comment. A successful deal would have ranked as one of the largest private-equity backed sales in Asia excluding Japan and Australia for the past few years, according to data from Refinitiv. KKR acquired Goodpack for about S$1.4 billion ($985 million)in 2014 and delisted it from Singapore Exchange. Goodpack then changed senior management, expanded into new markets such as food and chemicals and set up offices in Europe and the United States. Goodpack’s network is embedded in the supply chain of many multinational companies and its business is expected to weather any short-term downturn, the source said. It also caters to global customers in the rubber and automotive sectors with operations across 80 countries and about 5,000 delivery and collection points. The coronavirus pandemic has prompted governments around the world to impose social distancing and other containment measures that have brought many businesses to a near standstill. The value of deals in Asia-Pacific fell 20% in the first three months of 2020 versus a year earlier, data from Refinitiv shows."
21.193424995244968," KKR says employee tests positive for coronavirus, shuts London offices March 10 (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc said late on Monday an employee in its London office had tested positive for coronavirus, and that it would temporarily close both its London offices to have them sanitized. “Our London office has recently been impacted, with a member of staff being confirmed with COVID-19,” a company spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that the individual was at home and recovering well. As a necessary precaution, the company is temporarily closing both its London offices to implement a thorough cleaning and sanitization process and employees have been asked to work from home until further notice, the spokeswoman said. Bloomberg had first reported the news. KKR said it also requires those employees with close contact with the impacted individual to self-quarantine themselves for 14 days. KKR is the latest to join a slew of banks in London to send staff home and to other locations in a bid to contain the spread of the virus in the main financial hub. More than 111,600 people have been infected by the virus globally and over 3,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.

-20.677475688130194," KKR seeks inclusion in Russell indexes, shares rise (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N said on Friday it will seek to be included in the Russell U.S. indexes, a move targeted at increasing its shareholder base, sending its shares sharply higher. KKR Co-president Scott Nuttall said on the New York-based firm’s quarterly earnings call that the process of admission into the indexes began after it held meetings with new investors last year. “We are discussing with our board taking the steps necessary to be included in the Russell indexes when they rebalance this spring,” he told analysts and reporters. KKR’s shares climbed 5.5% to $32.05 in late trading on Friday. The Russell indexes track the performance of the most-traded stocks in the U.S. equity market. The indexes are reviewed every June and are closely followed by mutual funds and other large money managers. Private equity firms such as KKR, Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, and Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N are not included in Russell indexes because of their dual-class share structures. Carlyle Group LP CG.O became the first U.S. private equity firm to eliminate its dual-class share structure last year. “KKR will need to move a small amount of voting rights to its float, but this would have a positive impact on trading volume and its long-term shareholder base,” Credit Suisse analyst Craig Siegenthaler said in a note to investors. Earlier on Friday, KKR said fourth-quarter after-tax distributable earnings fell 18%, owing to a decline in asset sales from its private equity business and lower transaction fee income in its capital markets unit. KKR said after-tax distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - fell to $375.1 million compared with $460 million a year earlier. That resulted in DE per share of 44 cents in the quarter, which exceeded the average analyst forecast of 41 cents, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. On Thursday, KKR peers Blackstone and Apollo also reported fourth-quarter earnings that outperformed most analyst estimates. However, their DE rose on stronger asset sales. KKR said the value of its private equity portfolio appreciated by 27% during the 2019 full year, which compares with 9.3% and 15.6% for Blackstone and Apollo, respectively. The New York-based firm said its total assets under management rose to $218.4 billion at the end of December from $208.4 billion three months earlier."

The source declined to be named because the information was not public. KKR declined to comment. The fundraising comes as private equity firms globally shift from focusing purely on buyouts towards becoming all-round investment houses with a series of alternative assets, such as infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit. KKR has about a dozen people in the region focused on infrastructure, according to the person. It made its first investment in the sector with a $400 million deal taking control of India Grid Trust (IndiGrid). Separately, the firm has begun raising its fourth Asian private equity fund, aiming to raise $15 billion, Reuters reported this month.

14.360989781071195," Private equity consortium to buy UK testing firm LGC from KKR (Reuters) - A private equity consortium led by European firms Cinven and Astorg has agreed to acquire British scientific measurement and testing company LGC Group from KKR & Co KKR.N for an undisclosed sum. LGC provides measuring and testing services to the healthcare and affiliated markets and also liaisons with government bodies. Tests it offers include those to determine the quality of beer brewers’ malt, check if milk powder contains salmonella, or find traces of drugs in hair samples. New York-based private equity firm KKR bought LGC from Bridgepoint in 2015 for about 650 million pounds and has since helped the company grow through a string of acquisitions. “We have been actively monitoring developments in the life sciences tools market, with a particular focus on LGC, for over five years, and have been very impressed by LGC’s scientific capabilities,” Francois de Mitry, managing partner at Paris-based Astorg, said in a statement on Thursday. While Cinven has a focus on the pharmaceuticals and life sciences industry, Astorg has interests across software, healthcare, business-to-business, and technology-based industrial companies.

Buyout groups including Bain Capital, Blackstone BX.N, Carlyle CG.O, and KKR are increasingly focusing on Asian investments as lower valuations and corporate restructuring throw up new opportunities in key markets. KKR’s fundraising will start in the first quarter of 2020, with the aim of achieving first close, an important milestone indicating the fund has crossed a minimum threshold and can begin making investments, by June, the people said on Thursday. A spokeswoman for KKR in Hong Kong declined to comment. The fundraising target and timeline for KKR’s planned Asia-focused fund, which will focus on consumer, technology, and manufacturing firms across major markets including Australia, China, Japan, and India, have not previously been reported. These are countries where it has done large deals in the last few years, including its acquisition of Campbell Soup's CPB.N Australian snacks unit for $2.2 billion in July and Japanese car parts maker and KKR-owned Calsonic Kansei's purchase of Fiat Chrysler's Magneti Marelli for $7.1 billion. KKR has already received interest for its planned fund from prospective investors, known as limited partners (LPs), including those who invested in its previous Asia funds, two of the people said. The fund size and fundraising schedule have not yet formalized and the plan is subject to change, said the people, who did not want to be named as the details are not public yet. An Asian fund of the size KKR is targeting would be the biggest raised by the New York-based firm, whose previous record was $9.3 billion in 2017. It would also be the biggest U.S. dollar-denominated private equity capital raising in the region. Hillhouse Capital, an investor in top Chinese technology firms including Tencent 0700.HK and Baidu BIDU.O, last year raised a record $10.6 billion Asian fund. A total of 92 funds have raised a combined $42.3 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated Asia funds so far this year, compared to $50 billion raised in the whole of 2018, Preqin data shows.

8.774110532985645," KKR earnings slide 23% as weaker deal activity hits revenue NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co KKR.N reported a 23% year-on-year drop in its quarterly after-tax distributable profit on Tuesday, as fee revenue slid amid a broader slowdown in asset sales by buyout firms. KKR said after-tax distributable earnings, the cash available for paying dividends, fell to $388.8 million in the third quarter, from $496.7 million a year earlier. Still, KKR’s after-tax distributable earnings per share of 46 cents surpassed the average analyst estimate of 42 cents per share, according to Refinitiv. Many private equity firms, including KKR, have sold fewer companies this year, even though the U.S. stock market is hovering near all-time highs, as potential acquirers balk at their valuation expectations. This has weighed on the income they generate from the lucrative fees accompanying such transactions. Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest private equity firm, last week also reported a decline in its distributable earnings, of 8%. During the third quarter, KKR-backed U.S. entertainment and talent agency Endeavor Group Holdings EDR.N postponed a plan to raise $400 million in an initial public offering because of weak market demand for the money-losing firm - a move that hit KKR's capital markets business, which had underwritten the IPO. KKR said total assets under management climbed to $208 billion, up 7% from a year ago. New York-based KKR said it plans to begin fundraising across its three largest flagship funds - Asia private equity, Americas private equity and global infrastructure - in addition to 20 other funds, as part of a plan to increase management fee revenue by 50% over three years. “So given what’s coming to market plus our ongoing distribution efforts, if the fundraising environment cooperates and we continue to perform, we believe we can grow our management fees by at least 50% again over the next three years,” KKR Co-president Scott Nuttall said during a call with analysts on Tuesday. Ongoing U.S-China trade tensions has heightened concerns that investments by U.S. investors in Chinese companies could be affected in a tit-for-tat retaliation as the world’s two biggest economies hold talks in an attempt to reach a trade deal. KKR has been one of the biggest U.S. private equity investors in China and other Asian countries, bolstered by about $19 billion the buyout firm has raised in its three funds focused on the region. The firm’s investments in China include ByteDance, the owner of short-form video app TikTok, and Gambol Pet Group, a pet food manufacturer. But KKR said it expects a minimal impact to the overall performance of its Chinese investments since they are focused on domestic consumption. “I think the overall impact on the portfolio was one that is one that’s pretty small, and the same point of time, we’re trying to find ways to pursue opportunities if there are companies that have decided to exit the region,” KKR’s head of investor relations, Craig Larson, said during the earnings call."

10.699976557318198," RPT-UPDATE 1-KKR consortium cancels Australia's Latitude IPO: sources (Repeats story published late on Tuesday, no change to text) Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co and its partners have cancelled what was expected to be the biggest Australian IPO of the year, the listing of their lender Latitude Financial, two sources told Reuters. In what was to be their second attempt at listing in just over a year, KKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners, decided to cancel the expected A$1 billion ($676.20 million) offering on Tuesday, because a large proportion of demand for shares was coming from hedge funds rather than desired long-term investors, the sources said. The sources had direct knowledge of the situation but asked not to be identified since they are not authorized to talk to the media. A Latitude spokesman declined to comment but said the company expected to make an announcement on Wednesday. Latitude had filed a prospectus with the regulator last month valuing the finance company at between A$2 and A$2.25 per share but over the weekend decided to discount the offer price by up to 20.9% due to low demand, Reuters reported. The firm, which offers easy-access loans and credit cards with minimal paperwork, and its bookrunners were due to finalise the raising on Wednesday and shares in the new company were due to begin trading Oct. 18.

Many investors that would have taken shares in the company were not large, long-term investors and the owners did not want to risk “an adverse after-market outcome”, they added.

10.699976557318198," KKR-led consortium invests $685 million in Philippines' top hospital chain MANILA/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A KKR-led KKR.N consortium said it will invest $685 million in the largest hospital group in the Philippines, seeking to capitalize on growing demand for private healthcare in Southeast Asia. Under the deal, KKR and partner Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC will spend $100 million to gain 6.25% of Metro Pacific Investments Corp's MPI.PS hospital business, with the remainder invested in mandatory exchangeable bonds. The bonds will give the consortium the right to swap the bonds for shares either at the time of an IPO or in 10 years, whichever is sooner. Bankers said the deal was one of the biggest equity investments by a private equity group in Southeast Asia. As part of the transaction, GIC will restructure its current investment in the business and reinvest alongside KKR. Once the bonds are converted and GIC’s existing 14% stake is accounted for, the consortium will own the equivalent of 80% of the company’s shares, Metro Pacific’s Chief Financial Officer David Nicol said. But Metro Pacific will retain control of the business by virtue of voting rights attached to the preferred shares it owns, he added. A planned IPO for the business, Metro Pacific Hospital Holdings, has been postponed as a result of the deal. Singapore state fund Temasek and buyout firm CVC had also been in the running to buy into the hospital group, sources familiar with the matter had said previously. “The Philippines has a very, very young population and as they grow, the rising disposable income is growing so fast that more and more people in the middle class are demanding private healthcare,” Ashish Shastry, KKR’s co-head of Asia Pacific Private Equity, told Reuters. He added that KKR could use its experience in healthcare businesses in China, India and the United States to help the hospital group. The funds will enable the unit to hit its new target of expanding to 30 hospitals with 5,000 beds before 2030, Augusto Palisoc, president of the healthcare group, said in a statement. It currently has 14 hospitals and around 3,200 beds. Metro Pacific, which has interests in power, water and other sectors, is a unit of First Pacific Co Ltd 0142.HK, which is owned by Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS were the financial advisors to Metro Pacific and GIC on the deal, which is expected to close by the year-end."

12.57364858153397," KKR, Deutsche Bank, Varde discount Australia's Latitude IPO: sources SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co KKR.N and its partners have lowered the IPO price of their Australian non-bank lender, Latitude Financial, by up to 20.9% ahead of its expected listing on Friday, two sources told Reuters. The owners will now seek to raise about A$1 billion ($678.6 million) in exchange for about 33% of the company, down from the previously planned 35%, the sources with direct knowledge of the situation said, in the largest IPO in Australia since July 2018, according to Refinitiv data. The new price is about A$1.78 per share, giving the company a market valuation of about A$3.1 billion, between 11% and 20.9% lower than the previous pricing range, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because they were not allowed to talk to the media. A Latitude LFS.AX spokesman declined to comment. It is the second attempt to list Latitude by KKR, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and Varde Partners. The trio had filed a prospectus with the regulator last month valuing the finance company at between A$2 and A$2.25 per share. The pricing cut was decided on the weekend, the sources said, ahead of a two-day bookbuild ending on Wednesday. Although some investors had already committed to buy about 35% of the shares on offer at the lower end of the range, KKR and its partners believed a lower price would achieve better support. Shares in the company would also have a better chance of trading higher on Oct. 18, when they start trading under the code LFS, the sources added. The firm, which offers easy-access loans and credit cards with minimal paperwork, expects to report 3% growth in cash earnings of about A$288 million for the 12 months ending June 2020, according to its prospectus. It has about A$8 billion in gross loans to 2 million customers, primarily credit cards, personal loans and auto loans, and it plans to grow its digital and installment payment business, the prospectus says. While analysts and investors welcomed the move to lower the offer price, some said the discount was not big enough for the IPO to be considered attractive. “This new price is a little bit under our valuation of A$2 per share, but it would need to come down a bit more before we would argue it is attractively priced,” said Nathan Zaia, a banking and insurance analyst at Morningstar. “That’s simply because of the risks that we do see around this business.” Some of those, Zaia and investors noted, included the risks of rising bad-debts and high competition in the digital and installment payment sector, where Latitude wants to grow. KKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners founded Latitude in 2015 when they bought GE Capital’s Australian and New Zealand consumer lending arm for A$8.2 billion.

The move is part of the U.S. buyout firm’s efforts to tap retail investors globally. “For 40 years of KKR’s history, we primarily have relied on institutional capital to grow our business,” Jeremiah Lane, head of the fund, said in a phone interview. “In the individual market, we see a market that is 1) bigger and 2) growing faster.” The KKR Credit Income Fund, which will extend loans to companies, hopes to tap investor hunger for higher-yielding products amid falling global interest rates. It aims to offer annual dividend payments of 4% to 6%, according to the prospectus, while the targeted total return is up to 8%. Brokers briefed on the plan last week expect the fund to be well received, given Australia’s central bank has cut its cash rate to a record low of 1%, and financial futures are pricing in two further cuts by mid-2020, putting further pressure on bank deposits. The fund has a primary goal of raising A$750 million which could be increased by 10% if demand is strong, Lane said.

3.2772496844680337," KKR's distributable earnings beat estimates despite steep decline (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N reported a smaller than expected 19% drop in second-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, as a surge in transaction and management fee revenue helped offset some of the decline in performance fee income. The decline in performance fees was due to a slowdown in asset sales, KKR said. While the markets are hovering near all-time highs, KKR and other private equity firms have already sold many of their holdings for top dollar, leaving them with fewer mature assets to sell to generate performance fees. However, KKR compensated somewhat for this drop by gathering more fees from its growing assets under management, as well as its capital markets business, which helps arrange transactions for companies such as initial public offerings. KKR said its second-quarter after-tax distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends - fell to $327.3 million in three months to June this year, down from $404.7 million a year earlier. This translated to 39 cents per share in the second quarter, more than the 34 cent average that analysts on average forecast, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Last week, Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said its distributable earnings in the second quarter rose 1% year-on-year, more than most analysts expected. KKR reported net income per share on a diluted basis of 93 cents for the quarter, based on generally accepted accounting principles, down 25 percent from a year earlier. Blackstone posted 45 cents per share, down 59% from a year ago. KKR's revenue from transaction fees, which came mostly from its capital and private markets units, rose 85% to $303.8 million in the quarter. The New York-based firm booked fees from capital raising deals including the initial public offering of ride hailing startup Lyft Inc LYFT.O. KKR’s performance fee income dropped from $359.7 million to $233.7 million because of the slowdown in asset sales. Asset under management reached $205.7 billion, up 3% from three months earlier. The growth was driven mainly by fundraising activity and private equity investments, which partly offset divestments in public market holdings in the quarter. KKR declared a dividend of 12.5 cents per share."

11.050680144247035," KKR, GIC betting on India's power sector with $400 million investment: sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global investment firm KKR & Co Inc is leading a deal to acquire a controlling stake in India Grid Trust (IndiGrid), in a bet on the country’s rapidly growing power sector, people familiar with the transaction told Reuters. KKR, together with Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, will acquire up to 57 percent of IndiGrid for about $400 million, the people said. IndiGrid’s current market value is about $332 million. The deal would mark KKR’s first infrastructure investment in Asia since it set up a team late last year that focuses on the sector in the region. The pair will invest 20.64 billion rupees ($295 million) for a 42 percent stake in the trust via a preference equity issuance, the people said. KKR, having applied to become sponsor of IndiGrid, will then acquire a 15 percent stake from its current sponsor, Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd, pending regulatory approval. The infrastructure investment trust, the first of its kind in India, will separately raise around 4.5 billion rupees ($64.6 million) from other investors including Sterlite Power as part of the equity issue, the people said, declining to be named as the information is confidential. GIC is contributing $140 million to the deal while KKR is investing the rest from its own balance sheet, according to the people. KKR declined to provide comment for the story. GIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India Grid Trust and Sterlite Power Grid Ventures were not available for comment. India’s power demand grew at about 3.6 percent in 2018/19, lagging overall economic growth. However the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases aims to double its clean energy capacity to 40 percent of total power capacity by 2030, requiring new grid infrastructure, most of which is expected to be funded by foreign money. The energy-hungry nation will launch $5 billion of transmission line tenders, beginning in June, to deliver 175 gigawatts of power from renewable sources by 2022, government officials told Reuters last month. Sterlite Power, a major private transmission developer, created IndiGrid in 2016 to run its asset operations. The trust raised $350 million in an initial public offering a year later. IndiGrid owns five assets developed by Sterlite and one from a third party and 13 transmission lines. With the capital injection, it plans to acquire five more electricity transmission assets worth 115 billion rupees from Sterlite Power, which will more than triple its assets under management to 170 billion rupees, according to the people. KKR will separately acquire a majority stake in Sterlite Investment Managers Ltd, IndiGrid’s investment manager, from Sterlite Power, they said.

0.8122941274302322," Exclusive: KKR raising first Asia real estate fund, targeting $1.5 billion - sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global investment powerhouse KKR & Co Inc is raising its first Asia-focused real estate fund, targeting $1.5 billion as it looks to deepen its real estate portfolio in the region, said people with knowledge of the matter. The New York-headquartered private equity firm is moving toward first-close of the fund late in the second quarter, the people said, declining to be named as the information is confidential. The firm itself will commit about $250 million in capital, and potential investors - also known as limited partners - include sovereign funds and pension funds, they said. KKR declined to comment. The fundraising comes as private equity firms globally have expanded from a model of buying out companies to turn around and sell for profit. They now invest through a range of alternative asset management products, including infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit. Investment firms raised $18.6 billion in 26 Asia-focused real estate funds last year, the highest since 2008, according to data provider Preqin. KKR’s U.S.-based rival Blackstone Group raised the region’s biggest real estate fund last year at $7.1 billion. Like its peers, KKR has been building out new capabilities outside traditional private equity investments in Asia. It has committed about $2 billion in equity and debt across nearly 50 real estate transactions in the region including South Korea, Australia, China and India since 2011, the firm has said. Late last year, it teamed up with two Korean partners to acquire a mixed-use real estate project under development in Seoul’s Gangnam business district for about $1.9 billion. It also invested in The-K Twin Towers, a commercial property in Seoul in 2014 with a Hong Kong-based hedge fund in a deal which South Korean media valued at 500 billion won ($489 million). The property was sold to Samsung SRA at a premium last year. The firm has also been an active financing provider in India through its real estate-focused non-bank finance firm KKR India Asset Finance Ltd. KKR has a dedicated team of about 20 real estate professionals based in Asia Pacific spanning both the equity and credit deals. Last May, it hired John Pattar, former chief executive of CLSA Real Estate, to head its Asia real estate team. Pattar ran CLSA’s real estate funds for almost 15 years before joining KKR. It has also hired new heads of infrastructure and credit for Asia and is separately considering launching an Asia-focused infrastructure fund, Reuters has reported. Earlier this month, it announced the hiring of Kate Richdale, former Asia investment banking chief of Goldman Sachs, in a newly created role as Asia-Pacific head of strategy and business development."

5.818431137636812," UAE's ADNOC seals $4 billion pipeline infrastructure deal with KKR, BlackRock ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has sealed a $4 billion midstream pipeline infrastructure deal with U.S. investment firms KKR and BlackRock, the government-owned company said on Sunday. ADNOC has been expanding through strategic partnerships since 2017. Last month it won a combined $5.8 billion investment from Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV for a stake in its refining business to establish a new trading operation owned by the three partners. The latest deal follows ADNOC’s capital markets debut with its Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline bond, the IPO of ADNOC Distribution and other initiatives. A new entity called ADNOC Oil Pipelines will lease the oil company’s interest in 18 pipelines, transporting crude oil and condensates across ADNOC’s upstream concessions for a 23-year period, ADNOC said in a statement. The 18 pipelines have a total length of over 750 km and capacity of 13 million barrels per day. Funds managed by KKR and BlackRock will form a consortium to hold a 40 percent stake in the entity, with ADNOC owning the rest. ADNOC will have sovereignty over the pipelines and management of pipeline operations. The deal, expected to close in the third quarter of 2019, will result in upfront proceeds of some $4 billion to ADNOC. The statement cited Sultan al-Jaber, ADNOC group CEO, as saying the deal validated ADNOC’s approach of “unlocking value from its portfolio of assets while retaining control over their ownership and operation”. BlackRock is investing through its Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund series while KKR’s investment is through its third Global Infrastructure Investors Fund, the statement said. “We believe that today’s agreement among ADNOC, BlackRock and KKR will be followed by many more such partnerships to invest in the future growth of the region,” said BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink. This is KKR’s first direct investment in the region, co-CEO Henry Kravis said, adding that there is substantial potential for more. ADNOC has undergone major changes since al-Jaber’s appointment in 2016, embarking on privatization, oil trading and expanded partnerships with strategic investors. “I think the approach taken here by ADNOC reflects a desire to monetize assets they have under their control,” said Edward Bell, director of commodities research at Emirates NBD. “So I think it reflects an attempt to realize the value of the infrastructure they have in place more than a strategic shift into midstream oil and gas.” ADNOC produces about 3 million barrels of oil and 10.5 billion cubic feet of raw gas a day."

5.507623113184664," KKR reports 23.5 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc reported a 23.5 percent year-on-year rise in distributable earnings on Friday, as it sold down stakes in industrial machinery maker Gardner Denver Holdings Inc and optical retailer National Vision. After-tax distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends - totaled $460.1 million for the last three months of 2018, up from $372.6 million a year earlier, KKR said. This bucked the trend set on Thursday by private equity rivals Apollo Global Management LLC and Blackstone Group LP, which reported year-on-year drops of 20.4 percent and 42 percent, respectively, in DE. KKR said DE per share came in at 55 cents for the quarter, up from 45 cents a year earlier. Jefferies analysts, who rate KKR’s stock “buy”, said the earnings were ahead of market consensus for 49 cents per share, supported by transaction fees and performance income. KKR’s stock was up almost 4.7 percent around midday in New York, ahead of the broader market. The transaction fees came largely from KKR’s capital markets unit, a business it has focused on expanding in recent years and which had record revenue of $232 million in the quarter. It booked fees from transactions involving two KKR deals, BMC Software and Envision Healthcare. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), KKR reported a net loss attributable to the firm of $393 million for the quarter. Apollo and Blackstone lost $196.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 index had its biggest quarterly loss in more than seven years at the end of 2018, hitting private equity firms which use public peers to value their private investments. KKR said its overall private equity portfolio declined 8.3 percent in the quarter, compared to declines of 2.9 percent for Blackstone and 10.9 percent for Apollo. Assets under management around $195 billion, flat from three months earlier. Fundraising activity in the quarter was partly offset by decreases in the value of private equity and credit investments, the firm said. Wall Street’s slump at the end of last year may help private equity firms find bargains when they look for companies to purchase, according to KKR’s Scott Nuttall. “We’ve been seeing valuations drop in Asia and parts of Europe over the past couple of years back, and we may be seeing the beginning of a similar dynamic in the U.S.,” President and Co-Chief Operating Officer Nuttall said in an earnings call."

MYOB said it would reject an offer at the new suggested price of A$3.40 per share, from A$3.77 on Nov. 2. KKR first approached the company in October with a proposal to buy the 80 percent it did not already own for A$3.70. Since then, shares of global technology players like Facebook Inc FB.O and Google owner Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O have fallen sharply amid concerns about incursions on privacy, sparking a sell-down across the broader sector. The Australian sharemarket .AXJO has meanwhile tumbled 10 percent as a result of U.S.-China trade tensions. And credit markets have raised the price of corporate debt amid expectations of a rate hike, making it more expensive for firms like KKR to carry out leveraged buyouts. On Thursday MYOB shares were down 11 percent by midsession, just above the level they last traded at before KKR made its initial approach, while the broader market was down 0.2 percent. “It might be opportunism based on that move down in tech shares,” CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy said. “The reality is, when you make a takeover bid you see a lot of value above and beyond the price you bid at.” A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment, while a MYOB spokesman declined to comment further than the market filing announcing the lower offer. MYOB would be one of KKR’s biggest acquisitions in Australia and add to its 10-strong stable of technology businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. Although MYOB was once the dominant provider of accounting software to small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, in recent years it has struggled to compete for market share with cloud-based New Zealand rival Xero Ltd XRO.AX. Xero has a market value three times the size of MYOB’s and offices in London, San Francisco and Denver, while MYOB operates only in Australia and New Zealand."
25.7925722123864," UPDATE 1-MYOB says not in a position to recommend KKR's lower offer (Adds background, details on previous offer) Dec 20 (Reuters) - Australia’s MYOB Group on Thursday said it could not recommend a downwardly revised offer by KKR & Co after the U.S. buyout giant lowered its bid to take full control of the accounting software firm. MYOB said its board had informed KKR that it was not in a position to recommend the new offer which values the company at $1.43 billion, however it “remains in discussions with KKR regarding its proposal”. The U.S. firm, which already owns 19.9 percent of MYOB, revised its offer down by about 10 percent to A$3.40 per share from $3.77, following completion of due diligence and finalisation of debt funding commitments. Melbourne-based MYOB last month said it would grant due diligence after KKR had sweetened its offer by 2 percent. Although MYOB was once the dominant provider of accounting software to small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, it has in recent years struggled to compete for market share with cloud-based administrative software company Xero Ltd. Xero, based in Wellington, New Zealand, has overseas offices, including those in London, San Francisco and Denver, while MYOB operates only in Australia and New Zealand."
10.23808766668761," KKR sees India benefiting from U.S-China trade war MUMBAI (Reuters) - India can benefit from the trade tensions between the United States and China, Henry Kravis, co-chief of KKR & Co Inc KKR.N said on Wednesday, but he also said the country needed to cut back on red tape to attract more investment. U.S. President Donald Trump started a trade war with China earlier this year as his administration imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and various Chinese products. Beijing retaliated with import taxes of its own on products such as American-made cars. “This (the trade war) is very positive for South East Asia and is very positive, in my view, for India,” Henry R. Kravis, co-CEO of KKR told journalists at a media roundtable on Wednesday. “As you (India) get better infrastructure, get rid of some of this red tape bureaucracy ... this country will benefit big time.” India rose 23 places to 77th in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index for 2019, up from 100th in 2018, thanks to improving metrics in areas including access to credit and construction permits. Kravis also said India’s large youth population was a big positive and that the country needed major investment in several sectors such as education, finance, healthcare and environment. “That’s an opportunity for people like us,” he said. Kravis also highlighted the need for a healthy local bond market in India. “If you don’t have a long-term bond market you limit the growth because you’re putting all the onus back on to the banks to basically be the provider of capital,” Kravis. “That’s the reason that we set up our two NBFCs (non banking financial companies) here - one in real estate credit and one is in corporate credit.” KKR, founded in 1976, currently manages assets roughly worth $195 billion. The company opened an office in India in 2009 and currently has about 43 staff. It has invested more than $7 billion in its credit business in the country and will invest more in the business going forward, he said. KKR has also changed its focus to acquiring control positions or significant minority with near-control rights in companies instead of taking minority positions that did not give the company influence, Kravis said. KKR's investments in India include hospital management firm Radiant Life Care and Max Financial Services MAXI.NS, the holding company of private insurance firm Max Life Insurance."
5.93742915898121," KKR leads $100 million investment round in Cross River Bank NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N has led a $100 million investment in Cross River Bank, a community bank that powers some of the most well known financial technology startups in the United States, the companies said on Thursday. Chinese fintech conglomerate CreditEase, LionTree Partners and existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Battery Ventures and Ribbit Capital, also joined the equity round, the companies said. The company declined to disclose its valuation following the deal. Cross River will use the cash to grow its team and continue to invest in compliance infrastructure, the bank’s founder and Chief Executive Gilles Gade said in an interview. Cross River is a New Jersey-chartered community bank that was founded in 2008 and is best known for partnering with fintech startups including online lender Affirm Inc, money transfer company TransferWise and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. By joining forces with Cross River, which is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp-member, fintech companies are able to access some of the infrastructure available to banks without securing a federal banking license themselves. For example, Cross River can transfer money on the banking system’s payment rails for its partners and originate loans in any U.S. state. Companies like Affirm and TransferWise are part of a growing cohort of young businesses popular with venture capitalists that are seeking to take advantage of digital technology to offer cheaper and more user-friendly financial services. “Cross River offers solutions to address a number of challenges faced by fintech companies by giving them access to a full suite of banking solutions and services,” Dan Pietrzak, member and co-head of private credit at KKR, said in a statement. KKR is making the $75 million investment largely through its Private Credit Opportunities Partners II L.P. fund, the companies said. The new funding round follows $28 million in venture capital investment late 2016 from Battery Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Ribbit Capital."

13.552228632595876," KKR expands Asia infrastructure business with new hires HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private equity group KKR & Co KKR.N is expanding its presence in Asia's infrastructure sector with new hires and is looking at launching a new fund as project spending in the region picks up. The firm has poached David Luboff, CEO of Macquarie Group’s Asia Infrastructure Fund, as its new head of Asia Pacific Infrastructure, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Luboff, based in Singapore, will lead the Asian operations of the firm’s infrastructure business from early next year, the people said. Reuters could not reach Luboff for comment. A KKR spokeswoman confirmed the hire to Reuters but did not provide additional details. KKR has also hired Hardik Shah, formerly with Brookfield Asset management, as a Mumbai-based director, the spokeswoman said. He will focus on exploring infrastructure investment opportunities. People familiar with the matter said KKR is also considering launching an Asian-focused regional fund, following strong demand from investors keen to increase exposure to Asian and emerging markets. One of the sources said the fund could be as large as $1.5 billion and would look at areas such as power-related investments, toll roads and telecom infrastructure. KKR declined to comment on the fundraising. The people could not be named as the information is confidential. “Asia is an attractive part of KKR’s global infrastructure investment strategy. Across the region, macroeconomic and societal trends are fostering a unique need for expertise and private capital solutions for projects in a wide range of infrastructure sub-sectors,” Raj Agrawal, global head of KKR’s infrastructure business, told Reuters last week. He declined to comment about a new Asia-focused fund. The new hires follow the close of KKR’s $7.4 billion global infrastructure fund in September, which focuses primarily on North America and Europe. Asia is still a relatively small market for infrastructure funds, accounting for only about 15 percent of the total global fundraising pool over the past ten years, according to Preqin data. Only four Asia-focused infrastructure funds worth a combined $4.1 billion have been raised this year, just 5 percent of global activity. Infrastructure deals in the region, however, picked up from 2015 to 2017, and accounted for more than a quarter of the global amount last year, Preqin data showed, as local economies spent trillions of dollars to improve creaking infrastructure. KKR is a relative latecomer to infrastructure in the region compared with peers Global Infrastructure Partners, I Squared Capital and the infrastructure investment arms of Macquarie Group, Brookfield Asset Management and JPMorgan. Established in 2008, KKR’s infrastructure business manages approximately $13 billion in assets under management."
-1.7162018189962764," KKR nudges up bid for Australia's MYOB, granted due diligence SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s MYOB Group said it will grant due diligence to KKR & Co after the U.S. buyout giant sweetened its offer to take full control of the accounting software provider firm to A$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion). KKR, which owns 19.9 percent of MYOB, lifted its bid for the rest of the shares by 2 percent to A$3.77 per share, valuing the company at A$2.2 billion. If successful, the deal would be one of KKR’s biggest acquisitions in Australia and add to its 10-strong stable of technology businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. “My read of is they have raised the offer price to gain access to do due diligence, so that indicates a step forward,” said Jules Cooper, an analyst at stockbroker Ord Minnett. “The price is certainly above our valuation today,” he said, adding that he thought MYOB was worth A$3.28 per share. Melbourne-based MYOB, which at the time of KKR’s first bid last month only said it was assessing the offer, saw its shares surge 6 percent to a two-week high of A$3.52 on Friday. That, however, remains 7 percent below the bid price, suggesting investors are wary that a deal may not be sealed. Although MYOB was once the dominant provider of accounting software to small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, it has in recent years struggled to compete for market share with cloud-based administrative software company Xero Ltd. Xero, based in Wellington, New Zealand, has a market value of A$5.8 billion. It has overseas offices, including those in London, San Francisco and Denver, while MYOB operates only in Australia and New Zealand. KKR said at the time of its first bid that it wanted a unanimous recommendation from MYOB’s board to close the deal."

Singapore-based PropertyGuru will use the funds to take full ownership of Vietnamese property portal Batdongsan.com.vn, in which it already owns a stake, to expand in its fifth market. “The capital we raised is in excess of what we need to take that stake, the rest we are keeping essentially as a bit of a war chest for other inorganic growth opportunities,” said Hari Krishnan, its chief executive officer. Including KKR’s investment, PropertyGuru has raised S$436.2 million so far, the company said. Krishnan said the firm was looking at providing more mortgage-related services and customised products to users. He did not give valuations for Batdongsan or PropertyGuru. A person familiar with the matter said PropertyGuru was valued at more than S$500 million but was not a unicorn yet. “We expect it to become one in a few years,” said the person, adding the latest funding was done through a combination of primary and secondary shares. PropertyGuru, which was founded in 2007, says it is profitable and cash flow positive, with revenues growing by more than 25 percent year-on-year. The company offers services to make property-related decisions easier and more transparent for users, who can search listings online, view photos of homes and make comparisons. KKR has recently backed other technology firms in Southeast Asia, including Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek and the Philippines’ Voyager Innovations, a digital payments firm. PropertyGuru’s last funding round was in 2015, when it raised S$175 million from U.S. private equity firm TPG, Indonesian media company Emtek and venture capital firm Square Peg Capital. Krishnan said TPG and KKR would be PropertyGuru’s largest investors, with stakes of similar size in the company. While an initial public offering was an option for the company, Krishnan said such a move was not imminent and “definitely not in the next 6 months.” Redpeak Advisers was the financial adviser to PropertyGuru, while Allen and Gledhill provided legal counsel."

-2.3958300687854175," KKR preps for dealmaking in wake of stock market sell-off NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc sees the chance to take advantage of the recent U.S. stock market plunge to make acquisitions, co-President and co-Chief Operating Officer Scott Nuttall said on Thursday. This week’s stock market sell-off follows a sustained period of high valuations, which many private equity executives have complained make it harder to find companies to buy. KKR is sitting on almost $60 billion it has yet to invest. “Our teams have been waiting for a valuation adjustment to make some assets that they really like more attractive,” Nuttall said in an investor call for KKR’s third-quarter earnings. “The presiding emotion here is excitement that valuations have started maybe in the U.S. to come down a bit,” Nuttall added. Last year, private equity deal valuations in North America were at record-high levels, according to Hamilton Lane’s market overview. In the high-price environment, KKR this year has made two of its biggest acquisitions in the last 10 years with Envision Healthcare Corp and business software company BMC Software. In third-quarter earnings, KKR reported its second-highest distributable earnings (DE) in its history, as results were buoyed by the sale of the divestment of its stake in payments processor First Data Corp and the sale of Finish healthcare company Mehilainen. After-tax DE - the actual cash available for paying dividends - totaled $496.7 million for the three months to end-September, up 21.3 percent year over year, KKR said. KKR rival Blackstone Group LP reported a similar 22.8 percent year-over-year rise in third-quarter DE last week. KKR said DE per share came in at 60 cents, slightly ahead of analyst consensus for 59 cents. KKR shares were up around 4 percent in mid-morning trade in New York, outpacing the broader market. KKR said earlier this year it considers DE as its primary earnings metric, as opposed to economic net income, which reflects the mark-to-market valuation of gains or losses of private equity firms’ holdings and is a closely watched measure of performance at peers. This focus on DE is part of the firm’s efforts to make its stock more accessible to investors, a push which included converting to a corporation from a publicly traded partnership on July 1. KKR’s assets under management grew to $194.6 billion, up 27 percent over the last 12 months. Over the same period, Blackstone’s assets under management rose 18 percent to $456.7 billion."

-13.071254646694161," Gangnam style: KKR to invest in office property in southern Seoul SEOUL (Reuters) - A group of companies led by KKR & Co KKR.N will invest in an existing real estate project under construction in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea, hoping to cash in on one of the world's fastest-rising commercial property markets. The U.S. private equity firm will invest along with South Korea’s National Pension Service and IGIS Asset Management, the country’s biggest real estate fund manager, KKR said in a statement on Wednesday. The project will include office space, retail space, and a five-star hotel, with a gross floor area of 239,188 square meters (2.6 million square feet), the statement said, adding that the investment would be KKR’s third real estate investment in South Korea. The total cost of the project is expected to be about 2.1 trillion won, or $1.9 billion, which includes the purchase price paid by the group and other costs, KKR said. The project is KKR’s biggest real estate investment in South Korea, said a spokeswoman at the private equity firm. Since 2011, KKR has committed about $2 billion in equity and debt across nearly 50 real estate transactions in Asia Pacific markets. Seoul’s affluent southern Gangnam district gained international fame thanks to the song and music video for Gangnam Style by South Korean pop star Psy. The area of the South Korean capital is home to one of the major offices of Samsung Group, though the company agreed in September to sell the building for 748 billion won ($660 million). Hyundai Motor Group will also build its new headquarters in Gangnam. Investors spent $10.4 billion on office assets in Seoul in the 12 months through June 2018, second only to Hong Kong in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a report by Real Capital Analytic. Seoul registered the fifth-fastest price growth of major global markets in the second quarter, with commercial property prices rising by 7.8 percent year-over-year, according to the report released this month. KKR in January sold a prime office complex in central Seoul, which it bought in 2014.

Navab has started talking to potential investors about raising a private equity fund that will invest in a diverse range of companies in North America, although a fundraising target has not yet been set, the sources said.

-19.430784128529716," KKR launches $1.2 billion offer for Australian accounting software firm MYOB SYDNEY (Reuters) - KKR & Co KKR.N has launched a A$1.75 billion ($1.24 billion) takeover offer for MYOB Group MYO.AX after buying almost a fifth of the Australian accounting software provider, as the U.S. private equity firm grows its portfolio of tech businesses. The MYOB bid, if successful, would become one of KKR’s biggest acquisitions in Australia and add to its 10-strong stable of technology-driven businesses in the Asia-Pacific region. KKR last year raised $9.3 billion - a regional record - in its third Asia-focused buyout fund. MYOB disclosed the proposal in a statement and said its board was studying the non-binding offer, which was conditional on KKR obtaining financing for the deal and getting a unanimous recommendation from the target’s directors. A spokeswoman for KKR confirmed the A$3.7 per share offer for the remaining 80.1 percent of the company, and declined to comment further. The offer price, a premium of 24 percent to MYOB’s last closing price, values it at A$2.18 billion. In building its stake, KKR paid A$327 million to buy 17 percent of MYOB from its biggest shareholder, an affiliate of private equity firm Bain Capital, leaving the affiliate with a 6.1 percent stake, MYOB said. MYOB shares soared by over a fifth to A$3.6, their highest intraday price in almost nine months, after news of the unsolicited offer. But they stayed below the KKR offer price, indicating investors did not think a higher counteroffer was on the anvil. They closed at A$3.55. “With 19.9 percent of the register, KKR effectively own a blocking stake in the company. We think this could be enough of a deterrent for a potential interloper,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. MYOB did not specify if Bain, which acquired the then privately owned MYOB in 2011 and listed it in 2015, was endorsing KKR’s takeover offer, and a spokesman for Bain did not return calls seeking comment. Once the dominant provider of accounting software to small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, MYOB has in recent years struggled to compete for market share with cloud-based administrative software company Xero Ltd XRO.AX. Together they service more than 80 percent of the local market, according to Wilsons Equity Research, though the research also showed Xero’s growth has outpaced MYOB’s. Xero’s market value, at around A$6.88 billion, is more than thrice MYOB’s. JPMorgan analysts said KKR's stake would make it hard for strategic investors such as Sage Group SGE.L, which had attempted to buy MYOB back in 2011, and American peer Intuit Inc.INTU.O, maker of popular software QuickBooks, to rival KKR's bid. An Australian-based spokeswoman for Intuit said it did not comment on market speculation. Spokespeople for Sage did not return an email seeking comment outside of office hours. The proposed deal comes after KKR acquired U.S. business software company BMC Software in May in its largest deal since the 2008 financial crisis, underscoring how deal sizes are growing bigger again as private equity seeks to put a record $1 trillion of unused investor money to work. For KKR, the more than A$2 billion price tag for MYOB would make it one of its largest takeovers in Australia.

Voyager provides digital and financial services to millions of Filipinos through its e-wallet, digital payments and remittance units. “With the global expertise and fresh capital from the new investors, Voyager will enable greater access to mobile payments and the internet as a whole for the country’s population,” PLDT said."

KKR also basked in new investor interest in its stock after it simplified its structure by becoming a corporation earlier this month. Shares of New York-based KKR have risen 12 percent since July 1, when it converted from a publicly traded partnership into a so-called C-Corp, in an effort to make it easier for investors to hold stock. It closed at a record high of $27.85 on Thursday. “Although it’s still very early, we’re pleased with the significantly increased dialogue around our stock and we’re enjoying building relationships with a broader group of investors,” Scott Nuttall, KKR’s co-president and co-chief operating officer, said in an earnings call. Despite the change in structure, KKR remains tightly controlled by co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts. The lack of voting rights for shareholders excludes its stock from certain indexes from which passive investors can add KKR to their stock portfolio. Head of investor relations Craig Larson told analysts on the same call that KKR could look next year at giving outside investors some voting rights. “We’ll have an opportunity to evaluate that in the spring of next year and see where we are,” Larson said, when asked about adjusting KKR’s corporate governance and putting a small amount of voting rights into the shares that are publicly traded. Overall, KKR reported a 46 percent year-on-year rise in distributable earnings for the second quarter. Distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - totaled $404.7 million for the three months through June, up from $276.9 million a year earlier. Blackstone Group LP BX.N, one of KKR's biggest competitors, reported second-quarter distributable earnings last week of $700.1 million, down from $781.4 million. KKR’s second-quarter distributable earnings per share were 49 cents, above the consensus forecast for 45 cents, according to FactSet. KKR, which invests across private equity, real estate and credit markets, posted assets under management of $191.3 billion, up from $176.4 billion in the first quarter. Earnings were supported by the company selling portions of stakes in website domain name provider GoDaddy and industrial machinery maker Gardner Denver - companies in which KKR still holds large positions after taking them public.

In the New York-based firm’s first quarter of reporting since converting to a corporation earlier this month, KKR said distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - totaled $404.7 million for the three months through June, up from $276.9 million in the quarter a year earlier.

Earnings were supported by the company selling portions of its stakes in website domain name provider GoDaddy and industrial machinery maker Gardner Denver - companies in which KKR still holds large positions after taking them public. As part of its new plan for reporting results, KKR is no longer disclosing economic net income in its earnings statement, which reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on a portfolio and is traditionally a closely-watched earnings metric for private equity firms. It will, however, still report the metric in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. KKR also acknowledged $729.4 million of losses on certain investments, which were realized in advance of its July 1 conversion to a corporation from a publicly-traded partnership. Earlier this month, KKR had issued guidance for losses around $725 million, largely related to legacy energy and credit investments.

-14.791610039554046," KKR-led consortium to buy Taiwanese chemicals firm LCY for $1.56 billion HONG KONG (Reuters) - A consortium led by KKR & Co KKR.N agreed to acquire Taipei-listed LCY Chemical Corp 1704.TW in a $1.56 billion stock deal, the companies said on Sunday, marking it the U.S. private equity firm's first deal in the island in more than a decade. The investment is also the largest private equity-backed transaction in the island, according to Thomson Reuters data. KKR, leading a group of investors including LCY’s employees and family members of its founders, will pay T$56 ($1.83) per share, representing a 17.3 percent premium to LCY’s closing price on July 20. Upon completion, KKR will hold a majority and controlling interest in LCY. KKR invested in Taiwanese electronics component maker Yageo Corp 2327.TW in 2007 and made a buyout offer for the company four years later, which was rejected by Taiwanese regulators. Private equity dealmaking in Taiwan peaked in 2006 when a consortium led by South Korean firm MBK Partners acquired China Network Systems Co but has since 2008 declined, with a few deals proposed by global firms blocked by local regulators. “We see companies - hidden champions, companies that are not well known but have really established competitive positions with their product,” said Paul Yang, KKR’s head of Greater China, about seeking opportunities in Taiwan. Valuation in Taiwan is less challenging compared to some of the other markets in Asia, he said. The private equity powerhouse will make the investment from its $9.3 billion Asian Fund III, raised in June 2016 and currently the biggest private equity fund for the region. Founded in 1965, LCY produces specialty chemicals with a concentration on thermoplastic elastomers and performance plastics used in a wide range of products. LCY’s board has approved the deal and the chemicals maker will be delisted after the completion of the transaction, according to a statement. The transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, is subject to approval from LCY’s shareholders and regulators in Taiwan and China, people familiar with the deal said. Goldman Sachs (Asia) is KKR’s financial adviser, while Goldman Sachs Bank USA has agreed to underwrite and arrange debt financing to the consortium for the deal, the companies said.

-4.419670785494291," KKR agrees to buy stake in AppLovin at $2 billion valuation (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co KKR.N said on Monday it will acquire a minority stake in AppLovin Corp for $400 million, just months after the U.S. mobile marketing firm was forced by Washington to scrap a deal to be acquired by a Chinese buyout firm. The KKR deal values AppLovin at $2 billion, up from $1.4 billion in November, when China’s Orient Hontai Capital invested in the debt of AppLovin. Orient Hontai had originally agreed to buy a majority stake in AppLovin, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States objected to the deal on national security grounds. The investment is a bet by KKR on two fast-growing industries, mobile advertising and mobile gaming, according to KKR’s head of technology, media and telecom, Herald Chen. “This deal is an opportunity to play both those trends,” Chen said in a telephone interview on Monday. The mobile gaming market is seen reaching $70.3 billion in sales in 2018, according to a report by market research firm Newzoo. Palo Alto, California-based AppLovin has said it reaches more than 300 million daily active users and drives over 1 billion downloads for gaming companies each year. Last month, it launched a media division, Lion Studios, to work with developers to promote and publish apps. Funds from the deal, provided by KKR’s $13.9 billion Americas XII fund, will be used to grow AppLovin organically while also helping to fund potential acquisitions, Chen said. AppLovin also sees KKR helping it grow while putting the structures in place to potentially become a public company, according to AppLovin’s chief executive officer and co-founder, Adam Foroughi. “Our company is successful enough already to be a public company, so we wanted to start laying the groundwork for the public markets in the next couple of years so that we can be ready in case an initial public offering makes sense for us,” he said in an interview. AppLovin will also use some of the funds from KKR’s investment to purchase a portion of Orient Hontai Capital’s stake. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is serving as AppLovin’s financial adviser, and Raine Group acted as financial adviser to KKR.

What remains to be seen is if, given the new option, active fund managers will want to buy what KKR is selling. The firm’s rivals will meanwhile be keeping an eye on investor demand to judge if they should follow suit. The change by KKR, which made its name through leveraged buyouts in Corporate America in the 1980s, to so-called C-Corp from a publicly traded partnership (PTP) will mean a bigger tax bill. But it also opens the door to more investors, including some of the world’s biggest mutual funds. “How many of those people will show up on July 1? I have no idea,” said KKR head of investor relations Craig Larson, adding that the decision was made for the long-term benefit of the firm. KKR’s management has held nearly 100 investor meetings since announcing the conversion in May. Speculation about new demand for the stock starting July 1 has helped boost the shares around 20 percent, far outpacing peers. But fund managers say lingering complexity, the unpredictable nature of private equity performance fees and the fact that they are still founder-controlled could hold some investors back. “We love it, but there is a lot of ambivalence in the investment community about these names,” said Ariel Investments vice chairman Charles Bobrinskoy, a KKR and Blackstone Group shareholder. That could frustrate KKR management and employees, who own a large chuck of shares that have largely been underperforming the broader market since the firm went public. The new structure will make KKR eligible to be included in stock indexes, a change that can boost demand from passive investors that track those benchmarks. KKR is also trying to make its business easier for potential new investors to understand, simplifying earnings disclosures and no longer focusing on complicated metrics like economic net income, a hypothetical number reflecting the mark-to-market valuation of portfolio gains or losses. Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes said the change into a C-Corp solves some of the technical aspects of owning the stock but that “the nature of their business still comes with complexity.” Many mutual funds are either prohibited from investing in PTPs or opt not to because of the administrative hassle. As public companies, private equity firms have been able to diversify and invest in areas such as real estate, infrastructure and credit to style themselves as alternative asset managers. But while profits have swelled, their shares have lagged. Since KKR’s 2010 initial public offering through the end of 2017 the stock gained 48 percent, trailing the Dow Jones U.S. Financials Index which more than doubled in the same period. Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said last year that Blackstone’s stock price would be more than triple what it was at the time if it were valued the same as the average S&P 500 company based on its dividend yield. The downside is that, as a C-Corp, KKR will now be subject to the higher corporate tax rate on the performance fees it earns on the money it manages instead of the more favorable tax treatment it enjoyed as a partnership. The recent U.S. federal tax cut has softened the blow but in the years ahead, KKR expects its effective tax rate eventually to rise to around 23 percent from roughly 7 percent. The bet is that the greater tax burden will be offset by the market giving a higher valuation to its earnings. “It will take time to have comfort around the actual impact of the conversion,” said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan. If the conversion does pay off for KKR, rivals Apollo Global Management, Blackstone and Carlyle Group LP could follow suit. Ares Management LP made a similar change earlier this year, but KKR’s $20 billion market capitalization is more than four times that of Ares and provides a better test case."

12.706217210729973," Exclusive: KKR preps vending machine operator Selecta for $1 billion IPO - sources FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Buyout group KKR KKR.N has started preparations to list vending machine operator Selecta on the Swiss bourse as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018, people close to the matter said, adding to a flurry of major listings in the country. The private equity firm is working with investment bank Lazard LAZ.N as IPO advisor on the deal, they added. Lazard has already approached other banks to gauge their interest in helping organize the transaction which may see shares worth about 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) sold, one of the people said. In a bid to lock in high stock market valuations, the Selecta IPO may take place in late 2018, although a 2019 deal is also a possibility, the people said, adding KKR would also be open to an outright sale if it receives attractive offers. KKR declined to comment. Lazard had no immediate comment. Serving more than 10 million customers daily, Selecta operates self-service coffee and convenience food dispensers, more than half of which are located at private businesses, with the rest in places like train stations and hospitals. The company is targeting 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 245-255 million euros ($286-298 million) or more than 300 million including unrealized synergies, it said in a bondholder presentation in May. Its quarterly revenue stands at about 380 million. Including debt it may be valued at about 10 times its expected core earnings in a potential deal, one of the sources said. The initial public offering would add to a flurry of flotations in Switzerland this year, which have included that of Ceva Logistics CEVAL.S and sensors maker Sensirion SENSI.S, while others such as the listing of packaging maker SIG are expected in coming months. Switzerland has, however, also seen IPOs fall through, as investors have taken a harder line on the price they are willing to pay. KKR bought its majority stake in then ailing Selecta from Allianz Capital Partners (ACP) in 2015 for a small purchase price, sources familiar with the matter said at the time. ACP had acquired it in 2007 for 772 million pounds backed by 690 million pounds of loans, in an example of the highly leveraged buyout deals struck in boom times but proving unsustainable as Europe’s economy went into recession. Selecta ran into difficulties in repaying its loans, and after an unsuccessful sales attempt in 2012, KKR agreed in 2014 to provide a 220 million euro quasi-equity payment-in-kind loan to Selecta, which helped it to avoid a debt restructuring. In March 2018, Moody’s upgraded Selecta’s credit rating to B3 from Caa1, citing a successful refinancing of the company.

15.74858733736895," Envision US$9.9bn leveraged buyout by KKR adds to private equity deal bonanza NEW YORK (LPC) - Private equity firm KKR & Co’s US$9.9bn leveraged buyout (LBO) of physician service provider Envision Healthcare has helped boost private equity deal volumes to levels not seen since before the credit crisis. Global private equity-backed merger & acquisition (M&A) volume stands at US$191.7bn this year, which is up 39% over last year at this time and the highest level since 2007 when volume had already topped US$350bn by June 11, according to data from Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence. The buyout flurry comes as private equity firms look to take advantage of supportive credit markets, coupled with a record amount of dry powder available for purchases. In addition, bankers have cited strong fundamentals as corporate tax reform has propelled the economy. The deal, which was announced Monday, marks KKR’s second multi-billion acquisition within two weeks after announcing the US$8.5bn purchase of business software provider BMC Software on May 29. In addition to the KKR deals, private equity firm Blackstone earlier this year announced that it had agreed to buy a 55% stake of Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk business in a deal valued at US$20bn. The transaction is backed by a US$13bn financing, which will be the largest LBO-related credit since 2013 when food maker HJ Heinz lined up US$14.1bn to support its acquisition by conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. Blackstone is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR. Solid economics and certainty about the new administration in the US has created a risk-on environment where private equity sponsors have been more willing to commit to larger endeavors. As a result, M&A activity this year has broadly favored the larger transactions such as those seen in 2015-2016, said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of Americas Mergers and Acquisitions at UBS. “It’s really back on to the elephant deals – the US$10bn and up,” Hourihan said. Buyout financing in the US stands at US$22bn so far during the second quarter with US$6.1bn in progress, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. LBO volume in the first quarter totaled US$22.6bn. For the first half of 2017, volume reached US$58.8bn. The Envision financing will add to these totals, but it is not expected to be offered to investors until after Labor Day, a banking source said. Envision’s buyout is expected to be financed with US$5bn of first-lien loan debt and US$2bn of senior notes, the source said. This will put leverage at the company in the 7.1 times to 7.4 times area with adjustments. Another source familiar with the purchase said leverage will be closer to 7.5 times, though pointed out that the company has historically been able to deleverage quickly as maintenance capital expenditures totaled 2% of revenues in 2017. “It’s a people business and has lots of free cash flow,” the source familiar said. The deal has already captured the eyes of investors who are waiting to look at the financials for themselves. “It will get a lot of attention, but it’s a lot of leverage,” said one investor. The buyout is one of many recently with leverage well above the 6.0 times level that federal regulators had said would call for additional scrutiny, unless all senior debt or half of all debt could be paid down within five to seven years, according to federal leveraged lending guidance implemented in 2013. Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting reinforced last month that banks can step outside the guidelines if they proceed judiciously and have the capital to safely do so. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, Mizuho, and KKR Capital Markets are providing the financing for the Envision deal. Envision and KKR declined comment."
16.348676746351718," KKR and Blackstone pursue stake in Swiss sports data group: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - KKR KKR.N and Blackstone BX.N have been picked for a second round of bidding for Sportradar, as investor EQT looks to sell a minority stake that could value the Swiss sports data group at more than 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion), sources said. The sources familiar with the matter said the second-round of bidding was due in early July, and it was unclear whether other bidders, such as rival private equity firm Permira, were also still in the running. Evercore is advising EQT on the sale. The named parties either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Sportradar supplies data on live sports events and counts sports media and betting companies among its clients. In 2018 it is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than 150 million euros, before costs for sports rights. Including debt, the company may be valued at 13 times that or more in a potential stake sale. EQT invested in Sportradar in 2012, and owns 37 percent in the company, while the majority of the group is still owned by founder Carsten Koerl. Since EQT’s investment, the firm has acquired peers GSS, BTD and Sportsman among others, and expanded its U.S. business via partnerships with the American Football’s NFL, basketball’s NBA, stock car racing’s NASCAR and ice hockey’s NHL. Sportradar’s U.S. advisory board features celebrity investors such as former basketball star Michael Jordan and Mark Cuban, the owner of the U.S. basketball team Dallas Mavericks. Sportradar employs 1,900 staff in 24 countries, and tracks 400,000 annual events in 40 sports. Its customers include media organizations such as AP, Kicker, NBC Sports, Google GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O as well as betting companies such as William Hill WMH.L, Paddy Power PPB.I and Ladbrokes. Koerl and others founded Sportradar in 2007, based on a company called Market Monitor, in which Koerl had invested and which was originally set up by two Norwegian computer scientists as part of a student programming project."
14.777686320615787," KKR to take Envision private for $5.57 billion in healthcare push (Reuters) - KKR & Co KKR.N said on Monday it will buy Envision Healthcare Corp EVHC.N, one of biggest U.S. providers of physicians to hospitals, in a deal valued at $5.57 billion as it builds up its healthcare portfolio. The private equity firm beat peers Carlyle Group CG.O, TPG Global and others as it sealed the deal for $46 per share - a premium of 5.4 percent to Envision's last close on Friday. Envision’s shares rose 2.5 percent to $44.76, their highest in nearly eight months. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.9 billion. KKR already owns Envision's ambulance unit AMR, which it bought for $2.4 billion last year and merged with its helicopter ambulance service. The firm also took WebMD Health Corp WBMD.O private for about $2.8 billion. Private equity firms, armed with a record $1 trillion in cash, are investing more in public companies than at any time since the financial crisis. Take-private deals worldwide reached a decade-high of $109 billion last year, according to data provided to Reuters from industry tracker Preqin. KKR itself said last month it would buy business software company BMC Software, in a deal that could be worth about $8.5 billion with debt, according to Reuters’ sources. As of March 31, KKR had $176 billion in assets under management. It held $1.88 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its latest earnings report. The Envision deal is the latest in a spate of mergers and acquisitions among physician networks, a business that has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in how U.S. health insurers reimburse providers. The deal marks an end to Envision’s plan to find strategic options, which the company launched after posting disappointing third-quarter results last year. The company has been hit by lower patient admissions at hospitals - a trend that has plagued healthcare services providers in the United States. As part of its strategic review, Envision had reached out to around 25 potential buyers over the last seven months. UnitedHealth Group Inc's UNH.N OptumCare had also expressed interest in the company, Leerink analyst Ana Gupte wrote in a note. “We see the arms race for ambulatory care delivery continuing and likely to remain a strategic focus for OptumCare, HCA ... as well as not-for-profit hospital and health systems, and private equity,” Gupte said. Ryan Daniels, an analyst with William Blair, said the purchase price was a fair multiple for Envision given a number of headwinds facing the industry. Daniels also said there was little to no possibility of other bidders emerging. Reuters reported the deal on Sunday, citing a source. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. It was advised by J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities."

A deal could be announced as soon as Monday, the source said. A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment. Envision did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. The agreement will come less than two weeks after KKR said it will buy U.S. business software company BMC Software in a deal which sources valued at $8.5 billion, including debt, making it the buyout firm’s largest acquisition since the 2008 financial crisis. Reuters reported last month that KKR and U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N had joined forces to make an offer for Envision, with the move aimed at giving HCA and KKR an edge over buyout firms, which were also pursuing Envision. Other private equity firms competing for Envision included a consortium of Carlyle Group LP CG.O and TPG Global, sources told Reuters in May. Envision said in 2017 that it was reviewing a range of strategic alternatives after reporting disappointing third-quarter earnings, which were attributed partly to the impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, along with a slowdown in the growth of patient demand. The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that KKR is nearing a deal to buy Envision. KKR had agreed last month to acquire BMC from private equity companies Bain Capital and Golden Gate Capital, which bought BMC for $6.9 billion in 2013.

14.077881195076374," Goldman Sachs, KKR invest $360 million in Portugal tech firm LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal’s OutSystems, a platform which allows users to build software applications with minimal coding, has raised $360 million from Goldman Sachs and U.S. investment firm KKR, valuing it at more than $1 billion and allowing it to beef up its leading position in this niche market. Goldman and KKR took a minority stake in OutSystems with the financing, which will allow the company to expand in key markets in the U.S., Britain, Germany, Japan and elsewhere, it said. The operation makes OutSystems the second Portuguese technology company to be valued above $1 billion, a big boost for Lisbon’s ambitions to become a tech hub. The other is Farfetch, an online luxury clothing retailer which is considering an initial public offering. OutSystems’ Chief Executive Paulo Rosado said the funding would allow the company to take advantage of rapid growth opportunities and maintain its leading position in the market. “We’re seeing tremendous growth basically everywhere around the globe,” Rosado told Reuters. “In general this funding, together with the financial situation of the company, allows us to support all the growth in all the regions.” OutSystems runs a platform allowing software developers to build web and mobile applications without traditional coding. It has corporate customers in more than 50 countries and revenues of more than $100 million. Rosado said demand for OutSystems’ products is growing rapidly as businesses go through digital transformation and need software solutions that can be developed and delivered quickly. Stephen Shanley, director at KKR, said this was the biggest investment in his company’s growth equity fund because OutSystems has a “group of attributes that we rarely see together,” including fast revenue growth, an efficient business model and global reach. “This is a true platform, there aren’t many businesses that you look at and say, ‘this could be a 5-10 billion dollar plus company’,” Shanley said, adding that the investment is long-term and not intended as a “quick flip.” Asked about the company’s long-term plans, Rosado said OutSystem was not thinking of an initial public offering now, adding though that “it’s not off the table,” for the future. OutSystems will expand its workforce to about 1,000 by the end of 2018 from around 700 currently, half of whom are in Portugal."

16.79773450342497," KKR's Kravis says Japanese companies ripe for more carveouts (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP KKR.N wants to buy divisions from Japanese companies seeking to streamline their businesses in the world's third-largest economy, co-Chief Executive Henry Kravis said on Friday. Kravis told the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference that Japan was ripe for dealmaking as the corporate mindset is shifting toward leaner operations. He cited the CEO of a large Japanese company telling him 8 years ago that he had around 2,000 “core” subsidiaries. “That has changed,” said Kravis, whose firm he co-founded owns five companies based in Japan. “Today companies are waking up and saying, ‘We really need to do something differently in order to create value for our shareholders.’ So we like Japan a lot.” Private equity firms favor the investment strategy of buying a neglected unit of a conglomerate because they see the chance to improve it for resale. New York-based KKR, with $176 billion in assets under management, last year raised $9.3 billion for its most recent Asia-focused buyout fund. In April 2017, it agreed to a $2.3 billion acquisition for Hitachi Ltd's 6501.T chip-making equipment and video solution unit.

The size of the deal underscores how private equity firms are turning to bigger leveraged buyouts as they seek to put a record $1 trillion of unused investor money to work. Private equity firms are paid management and performance fees only on investor capital that is deployed on deals. KKR has also partnered with U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc HCA.N to make an offer for U.S. physician services provider Envision Healthcare Corp EVHC.N which has a value including debt of close to $10 billion, Reuters reported earlier this month. KKR agreed to buy BMC from private equity firms Bain Capital and Golden Gate Capital, which acquired BMC in 2013 for $6.9 billion. Representatives for KKR, Bain and Golden Gate declined to comment on the purchase price, which was disclosed by sources on condition of anonymity. The acquisition of BMC, which provides software that helps companies organise their tech support functions, comes as software companies are reorienting themselves to focus on higher-margin businesses such as cloud computing, cyber security and data analytics to counter a slowdown in their legacy businesses. KKR has invested about $26 billion in the technology sector over the past decade, and BMC will join a portfolio that includes Mitchell, Epicor and Calabrio - all firms that make software used by businesses. KKR expects to use BMC as a platform to make further acquisitions, a person familiar with the strategy said. Making bolt-on purchases is an increasingly common strategy for private equity firms to increase scale and pricing power in their markets. Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho Bank provided financing for the acquisition. Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley were BMC’s financial advisers, while Macquarie Capital advised KKR. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018."

23.42507339355217," Private equity firm KKR opts to become C-Corp after U.S. tax reform NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP KKR.N said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation after U.S. tax reform made the tax hit less painful, a move that it hopes will boost its share price by attracting more investors. It is the biggest shake-up in KKR's structure since the firm went public 12 years ago, making it the second alternative asset manager to change its tax status, following Ares Management LP ARES.N earlier this year. KKR's market capitalization, at almost $18 billion, is more than three times that of Ares. Its conversion will provide a serious test case for peers Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N, Carlyle Group LP CG.O and Blackstone Group LP BX.N as to whether the higher tax burden is offset by the market attributing a higher valuation to the stock. “Our stock has been too challenging to buy and too challenging to own, so many investors go elsewhere,” Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer Scott Nuttall said on an investor call. KKR shares were up 3.8 percent at $22.33 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. KKR hopes the change to a C-Corp, which is effective July 1, will attract new shareholders by enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock. Passive investors, which are becoming more important as they manage even more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring KKR stock under its partnership structure. The indices for which KKR expects to be eligible will result in at least 20 million shares of demand in its stock, said Craig Larson, the firm’s head of investor relations. Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees. Under the so-called C-Corp structure, KKR will pay corporate taxes on all revenue. However, the additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent. Analysts had earlier flagged KKR and Ares as the two private equity firms most likely to convert to C-Corps as the tax hit is less severe because the firms’ earnings rely less on the performance fees that are affected by the C-Corp change. “Absent material equity valuation improvements for Ares and KKR, we expect further conversions of Fitch-rated alternative investment managers to be decreasingly likely, given that the remaining managers generally have more incentive income which would not benefit from the lower tax rate,” said Meghan Neenan, head of North American Non-Bank Financial Institutions at Fitch. Apollo also reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Its co-founder and senior managing director, Josh Harris, said the firm is still mulling the C-Corp conversion. “Others going first is helpful. We have to see what happens over time,” Harris said on an earnings call. KKR said it expected to pay an annualized dividend of 50 cents per common share as a corporation for the third quarter. KKR also said its first-quarter earnings per share fell by a less-than-expected 35 percent year-on-year, the latest private equity firm to feel the brunt of turbulent financial markets. KKR’s economic net income per share came in at 42 cents in the first quarter, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on KKR’s portfolio. Blackstone and Carlyle have also reported a fall in first-quarter earnings, albeit less than analysts had feared. KKR’s assets under management totaled $176 billion at the end of March, up from $168 billion at the end of 2017."

It is the biggest shake-up in KKR’s structure since the firm went public 12 years ago. KKR is now the second alternative asset manager to change its tax status following Ares Management LP earlier this year. KKR’s market capitalization, at almost $18 billion, is more than three times that of Ares. Its conversion will provide a serious test case for peers Apollo Global Management, Carlyle Group LP and Blackstone as to whether the higher tax burden is offset by the market’s attributing a higher valuation. “KKR’s conversion from a partnership to a corporation is designed to broaden our investor base, simplify our structure and make it easier to invest in our shares,” Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-chairmen and co-chief executives, said in a statement for KKR’s first-quarter earnings. KKR hopes the change to a so-called C-Corp, which is effective July 1, will attract new shareholders by enabling investors such as index funds to buy the stock. Such passive investors, which are becoming more important as they manage even more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring KKR stock under its partnership structure. Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees. Under the C-Corp structure, KKR will pay corporate taxes on all revenue. However, the additional tax burden has become much less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent. To illustrate the limited impact of the change to the returns of shareholders, KKR said that an average New York City-based shareholder who bought its stock at $20 and sold at $25 a year later would see only a 6-cent hit to their windfall under a C-Corp structure. Analysts had earlier flagged KKR and Ares as the two private equity firms most likely to convert to C-Corps early on, as the tax hit is less severe because the firms’ earnings rely less on the performance fees that are affected by the C-Corp change. Apollo’s CEO, Leon Black, said in March that Ares’ stock performance has not made for a compelling case to follow suit. After Ares’ shares initially popped on the announcement of the change on mid-February, since making the switch on March 1 the stock is down 7.8 percent. KKR said it expected to pay an annualized dividend of 50 cents per common share as a corporation for the third quarter and that it had reupped its authorization to buy back shares to $500 million. KKR also said on Thursday that its first-quarter earnings per share fell by a less-than-expected 35 percent year-on-year, the latest private equity firm to feel the brunt of turbulent financial markets.

34.331883611259336," Exclusive: KKR launches unit focused on impact investing - sources (Reuters) - KKR & Co LP has set up a business to invest in budding companies which have societal or environmental benefits, marking the U.S. private equity firm’s foray into dedicated so-called impact investing, sources aware of the plans said. The move underscores how buyout firms, long associated with saddling companies with debt and slashing costs and jobs, are now seeking to offer products to investors that also appeal to an environmental, social and governance (ESG) business agenda. KKR’s new unit will seek investments in smaller medium-sized companies focusing on areas such as renewable energy, education and environmental management, according to one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. KKR’s approach will be to make private equity-style investments in these companies, with the aim of building up businesses and earning a profit from a future sale comparable to traditional buyout fund returns, the sources said. The new fund, which has investment themes tied to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, does not have an identified size, but is currently engaging with potential investors about contributing to it, three of the sources said. The business will be run by Robert Antablin, previously KKR’s head of energy private equity for the Americas, and Ken Mehlman, KKR’s global head of public affairs, the sources said. Antablin will move to New York from Houston under the new role, one of the sources said. His responsibility for energy private equity investments had moved earlier this year to David Rockecharlie, the firm’s head of energy real assets, another of the sources added. A spokeswoman for KKR, whose assets under management totaled $168 billion at the end of 2017, declined to comment. Other private equity firms are beginning to launch similar offerings focused on investors’ social responsibility agenda. TPG Capital’s $2 billion Rise Fund, for example, invests in five areas including agriculture and education, and counts musician and activist Bono as a founding stakeholder. KKR has made investments in the past that fit into the profile of companies its new fund would target, such as China Modern Dairy Holdings, which sells higher-end dairy to the country’s growing middle class when milk standards have been questioned."
