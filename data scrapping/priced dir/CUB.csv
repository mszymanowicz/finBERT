7.8245433011693635," Cubic to be taken private for $2.2 billion by Veritas, Elliott (Reuters) - Cubic Corp has agreed to be bought by private equity firm Veritas Capital and U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management in a deal valued at about $2.2 billion, the defense and transportation technology firm said on Monday. The company had adopted a poison pill last year, allowing existing shareholders to buy more shares at a discount, after Elliott took a 15% stake in the firm with an aim to acquire the company. The all-cash offer of $70 per share represents a premium of about 11% to Cubic’s closing price on Friday and values the company at about $2.8 billion, including debt. Cubic makes technology that helps major subway systems collect fares and has also developed a game-based learning technology for the defense industry. The deal is expected to close during the second quarter of 2021, Cubic said."

The offer is at a premium to Cubic’s closing share price on Tuesday of $54.73, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous because the matter is private. The exact value of the offer could not be learned. Cubic currently has a market value of $1.7 billion. Elliott and Cubic declined to comment. A spokesman for Veritas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Monday, Cubic announced it adopted a poison pill after Elliott took a 15% stake in the firm and expressed interest in acquiring the company with a private equity partner. Elliott confirmed its interest in a separate statement without disclosing the name of its partner for the deal. Elliott is best known for being an activist investor but has branched out into buying companies outright in recent years. The hedge fund and Veritas last partnered in 2018 for a $5.7 billion deal to take healthcare software company Athenahealth private. Cubic’s shares have slumped this year over fears the coronavirus pandemic may slow the company’s growth in the near term. Cubic makes technology that helps major subway systems collect fares as well technology for the defense industry, areas that are largely dependent on government spending.
