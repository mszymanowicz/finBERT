9.891619390376238," Aimco spurns 'grossly inadequate' buyout offer (Reuters) - Apartment Investment and Management Co (Aimco) said on Wednesday it had received a buyout offer which the board deemed “grossly inadequate” and not in the best interests of the real estate investment trust. The company said it would continue with a previously announced separation of Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. Bloomberg earlier reported here Westdale Real Estate Investment and Management had approached Aimco with an all-cash takeover proposal, citing people familiar with the matter.
