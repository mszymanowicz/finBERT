4.550877182197615," U.S. money fund assets fall $13.9 billion Monday: Crane Data (Reuters) - U.S. money market funds saw $13.9 billion in outflows on Monday from Friday, lowering their assets to $3.689 trillion, as companies and investors withdrew cash to pay quarterly taxes and their purchases of Treasuries, respectively, according to Crane Data. Money fund assets were down $38 billion from a week earlier, the data firm said on Tuesday."
2.0334633324142715," Fidelity's money-market fund assets surged 20% in past year BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments’ money-market fund assets have climbed $116 billion, or 20%, over the past 12 months as investors embrace higher yields for their idle cash, research firm Crane Data said on Thursday. At the end of July, Boston-based Fidelity had $710 billion in money-market fund assets, according to Crane. Fidelity is the No. 1 money-market fund provider in the United States. Vanguard Group, which is second largest, had $381 billion in money fund assets, up $72 billion over the past 12 months, according to Crane Data. Crane’s 100 Money Fund Index shows an average seven-day net yield of 2.12%. Investors are pulling money out of “plain vanilla” bank savings accounts, yielding less than half a percent, and pushing some of it into money funds. It is a boon for the $3 trillion-plus industry, whose yields cratered to as low as 0.02% in 2014, a far cry from the 5% yields investors got in 2007 before the Great Recession."
4.137351947382887," Crane says continues to prefer 'negotiated transaction' with Circor's board (Reuters) - U.S. industrial manufacturer Crane Co on Monday said it continues to prefer a “negotiated transaction” with Circor International Inc’s board, weeks after making a $894 million hostile bid for the smaller rival. Earlier this month, Crane said it was willing to adjust its $45 per share offer for Circor if its board was willing to engage in talks. On Monday, Crane began a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Circor and called on Circor shareholders to act on the opportunity. Crane’s tender offer is set to expire on July 16. Circor in response said its board will review and evaluate Crane’s tender offer, and shareholders do not need to take any action at this time. The board intends to make its recommendation within 10 business days, Circor said. “Circor shareholders have endured five years of underperformance and a series of value-destroying capital allocation decisions by current management,” Crane Chief Executive Officer Max Mitchell said in a statement. Crane, which makes pumps and valves, made a hostile takeover bid for Circor in May after an earlier offer was rejected by Circor."

-6.739623285160794," Crane says willing to adjust buyout offer if Circor board engages in talks (Reuters) - U.S. industrial manufacturer Crane Co said on Tuesday it was willing to adjust its $894 million offer for smaller rival Circor International Inc if its board was willing to engage in talks. In an open letter to Circor’s board, Crane said it was committed to pursuing an all cash buyout at $45 per share but was willing to adjust the price if Circor provided “sufficient justification.” Crane, which makes pumps and valves, made a hostile takeover bid for Circor in May after an earlier offer was rejected by Circor."
-9.716465805695657," Pumps and valves maker Crane makes $894-million hostile bid for rival Circor (Reuters) - U.S. industrial manufacturer Crane Co on Tuesday made a hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Circor International Inc for about $894 million, after an earlier offer was rejected by Circor’s board. Crane’s cash offer of $45 per share represents a premium of about 47% to Circor’s closing price on Monday. Circor’s shares jumped 48.4% to $45.44. Crane had sent a letter on April 30 to Circor’s board, offering to buy the company, but it was rejected with no offer of further discussions. Circor said on Tuesday its board rejected Crane’s proposal and determined that the offer “substantially undervalued Circor and its future prospects, and did not constitute a basis for engaging in further dialogue with Crane at this time.” “While we had hoped to complete a transaction privately, Circor’s rejection of our proposal...led to our decision to make our proposal known to Circor shareholders,” Crane Chief Executive Officer Max Mitchell said in a statement. Crane, which makes pumps and valves for industries, said its offer for Circor represents an enterprise value of about $1.7 billion, 13.5 times Circor’s last 12-month adjusted EBITDA. The deal would add brands such as Allweiler, Houttuin, IMO Pump and IMO AB to Crane’s portfolio. Circor, which makes products including centrifugal pumps and automatic recirculating valves, had a long-term debt of about $733.6 million as of March 31. Wells Fargo Securities advised Crane on the deal, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was its legal adviser."

-3.8586979532421517," Russia's only aircraft carrier damaged after crane falls on it MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s only aircraft carrier was damaged while undergoing repairs in the north of the country after the floating dock holding it sank in the early hours of Tuesday and a crane crashed onto its deck, tearing a gash up to 5 meters wide. The Admiral Kuznetsov has seen action in Russia’s military campaign in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad with its planes carrying out air strikes against rebel forces. It was being overhauled on one of the world’s biggest floating docks in the icy waters of the Kola Bay near Murmansk close to where Russia’s Northern Fleet is based and was due to go back into service in 2021. Maria Kovtun, Murmansk’s governor, said in a statement that a rescue operation had been launched and 71 people evacuated after the floating dock holding the ship had begun to sink. The warship had been successfully extracted from the dock before it completely sank, she said. Investigators, who said they had opened a criminal investigation into the incident that would look at whether safety rules had been violated, said one person was missing and four others were being treated for hypothermia after being plucked out of the water. Alexei Rakhmanov, head of Russia’s United Shipbuilding Corporation, told the TASS news agency that the ship’s hull and deck had been damaged, although what he called the vessel’s vitally important parts had not been harmed. “There is a jagged hole 4-5 meters wide,” Rakhmanov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. “It’s obvious that when a 70-tonne crane falls onto the deck, it’s possible that there could be such damage. We consider the damage to be insignificant.” Yevgeny Gladyshev, a spokesman for the shipbuilding factory which operated the floating dock, told the RIA news agency that unspecified equipment had been damaged but that much of the deck had been spared because it had been removed during the refit. The floating dock had been hit by a power outage which had caused its ballast tanks to fill up rapidly, prompting it to sink, the factory said. The Admiral Kuznetsov gained notoriety in Britain when then Secretary of Defence Michael Fallon dubbed it the “ship of shame” in 2017 when it passed through waters close to the English coast on its way back from the Mediterranean belching black smoke."
