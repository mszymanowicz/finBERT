20.552884615384603," U.S. launches national security probe of mobile crane imports WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday launched a ""Section 232"" national security investigation into imports of mobile cranes from Germany, Austria, Japan and elsewhere, following a complaint by domestic producer Manitowoc Co MTW.N. The investigation could potentially lead to new U.S. tariffs on imports of such cranes. Manitowoc in December petitioned the department, arguing that increased imports of low-priced mobile cranes and intellectual property infringement by foreign competitors had harmed the domestic mobile crane manufacturing industry. The Department of Homeland Security has identified mobile cranes as a critical industry because of their use in the defense and critical infrastructure sectors, the Commerce Department said in a statement launching the probe. “We will conduct this review thoroughly and expeditiously,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said. “This investigation will help determine whether mobile cranes are being imported in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair U.S. national security.” The Trump administration has used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to apply new tariffs to steel and aluminum imports from China and elsewhere, and last year threatened to use the law to put duties on imports of automobiles and automobile parts from Europe and Japan, although such duties have not been implemented. On Monday, the Commerce Department launched a separate Section 232 investigation that could lead to new U.S. tariffs on imports of key electrical steel components of power transformers and related goods. In the mobile crane case, Manitowoc claims the low-priced imports and intellectual property infringement resulted in the closure of one of its two production facilities in the United States and eliminated hundreds of skilled manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. In making its case to the department, the company cited data from the U.S. International Trade Commission, which showed that imports of mobile cranes increased 152% between 2014 and 2019, the Commerce Department said in its statement. It also cited a 2015 case in which the ITC banned the sale of a Chinese crane in the United States after it found that a Chinese manufacturer misappropriated six trade secrets and infringed on a patent."

-9.318806539509545," Icahn discloses U.S. probe into sale of Manitowoc shares: filing BOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s company for information about trades in crane maker Manitowoc, Icahn Enterprises disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday, in its first acknowledgement of such a probe. Icahn Enterprises said it received a subpoena after critics questioned the timing of Manitowoc stock sales Icahn, who briefly served as an unpaid adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, made before his administration announced steep steel tariffs in March 2018. Questions had swirled about whether the sales were prompted by inside information about Trump’s plans. The stocks of many U.S. industrial companies, major consumers of steel, fell that day after the announcement, with Manitowoc losing more than 6%. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York contacted Icahn Enterprises in June 2018, the company said in the filing. “We cooperated with the request and provided documents in response to the subpoena.” The U.S. Attorney’s office and Icahn’s office had no immediate comment. Manitowoc did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors in Manhattan have a history of pursuing major cases over insider trading on Wall Street, famously securing the trial conviction of hedge manager Raj Rajaratnam and a guilty plea from the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. Icahn sold roughly one-third of his stake in Manitowoc, which uses steel to make its equipment, between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, 2018. Trump said on March 1 that he would impose 15% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminum to make domestic production more attractive. In response to news reports about his stock sales, Icahn said he cut his position in Manitowoc for “legitimate investment reasons” and dismissed any speculation that his sale of shares was prompted by knowledge about Trump’s plans. Icahn, who has been friendly with Trump for decades, has been a sounding board for Trump and was instrumental in vetting people for key positions before Trump was inaugurated in 2017. He stepped down as an unpaid special adviser to Trump in August 2017."
