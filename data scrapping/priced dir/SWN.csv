-13.362068965517246," Western Gas seeks partner for Equus LNG project off Western Australia MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Privately owned Western Gas said it has appointed Goldman Sachs to advise on finding a partner for its Equus gas project off Western Australia, as it aims to start producing from the $3.5 billion project in 2024. Western Gas wants to develop the field using a 2 million tonnes a year (mtpa) floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, rather than feeding into larger existing facilities as contemplated by the field’s previous owner, Hess Corp. “Equus is at the right stage of development where the introduction of an experienced and financially capable partner can help progress the project to first gas and realize the value of the greater Equus area,” Western Gas Executive Director Andrew Leibovitch said in a statement on Tuesday. Western Gas declined to comment on the economics of the project, but said engineering firms McDermott International and Baker Hughes had designed a “globally competitive, mid-scale LNG development plan” for Equus, involving a floating production storage and offtake (FPSO) facility, with a 160 km (100 mile) pipeline hooked up to a 2 mtpa floating LNG facility. The project will be competing against large new developments led by Woodside Petroleum, also off Western Australia, designed to feed the North West Shelf LNG plant and an expansion of Woodside’s Pluto LNG plant. To achieve its target of first production from Equus in 2024, Western Gas will need to make a final investment decision on the project in 2020. Western Gas spokesman Tony Johnson said the company had spoken to parties about potentially taking a stake in the Equus project but declined to name them. One possible partner could be a consortium led by privately owned Transborders Energy, which has said it is looking to develop small-scale floating LNG projects with gas reserves of up to 2 trillion cubic feet, about the size of Equus. Transborders Managing Director Daein Cha said Equus would be a good fit for its floating LNG technology, but given Western Gas already has a development concept and has lined up contractors, it would just watch the project with interest. “If they are in need of an alternative solution to further create value, we’re quite open to have that discussion,” he told Reuters, adding that Transborders does not plan to take equity stakes in gas fields where it hopes to use its technology."
-15.54307116104869," Southwestern Energy to sell Fayetteville shale unit (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Southwestern Energy Co SWN.N agreed to sell its Fayetteville shale assets in Arkansas to privately owned Flywheel Energy LLC in an all-cash deal valued at about $1.87 billion, Southwestern said on Tuesday. The deal culminates a six-month effort by the Houston-based company to find a buyer for the Fayetteville shale operations to pay off debt it ran up years ago when U.S. natural gas prices were higher. “The debt was an overhang on our stock,” the company’s chief executive officer, Bill Way, said in an interview. “We’re focused on the highest-return projects in our portfolio, and at today’s prices, those are in the Appalachia basin.” Southwestern plans to pay off $900 million of its more than $3 billion in debt with the proceeds, and will spend $200 million to repurchase shares over the next 12 months, Way said. Southwestern’s shares declined nearly 3 percent to $5.46 following the announcement. Investors were disappointed that Southwestern earmarked only about half of the proceeds to repay debt, with $600 million to be used to expand production despite low natural gas prices, Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said. “There was some hope the transaction would result in lower leverage, but the reality is the leverage metrics don’t change too much,” Hanold said. “That could imply the company will outspend cash flow.” Hanold said investors want to see Southwestern’s ratio of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a financial yardstick often used to evaluate the health of an energy exploration and production company - decline to 2-to-1, down from the current 2.7-to-1. Several potential buyers had expressed interest, said Way, who declined to name the suitors. Southwestern will turn its focus to expanding its natural gas and gas-liquids output in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In July, BHP Billiton BHP.AX sold its Fayetteville assets for about $300 million to Merit Energy Co as part of its exit from U.S. shale properties. Low gas prices have encouraged companies to seek more profitable liquids production. Southwestern will have $2.3 billion in debt after the deal closes in December. “Our goal is to have a self-funding Appalachia business as we complete 2020,” Way said. Backed by investment firm Kayne Anderson, Flywheel will assume $438 million of future contractual liabilities."
