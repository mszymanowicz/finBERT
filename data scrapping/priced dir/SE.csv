44.20107719928185," Amazon launches bigger local online store in Singapore SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O has launched a bigger local store and marketplace in Singapore, expanding its product selection and intensifying competition with rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's BABA.N Lazada and Sea Ltd's SE.N Shopee. The U.S. company launched local online shopping in the wealthy Southeast Asian city-state more than two years ago with its fast delivery service through a mobile app. But its initial local selection, which focused on groceries and household essentials, has not been as wide as those offered by rivals. “With Amazon.sg, we want to provide what customers have been asking us for: the ability for everyone to shop on desktop and mobile, more local and international selection from Amazon and trusted sellers, paired with fast and reliable delivery,” Henry Low, Amazon Singapore country manager, said in a statement. Amazon also said it will allow small and medium-sized businesses to offer their products to online shoppers with Amazon.sg. Other e-commerce firms including Lazada mainly operate via a marketplace model in Singapore. Singapore, a small but high-value market with a population of just 5.7 million, is often seen as a launchpad for consumer-focused companies into much bigger Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, home to over 260 million people."
19.74683544303798," Siam Commercial Bank partners with Sea Group to expand digital lending BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s largest lender Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB) announced a partnership with e-commerce and game developer Sea Ltd’s Thai operations to provide payments and lending services as it seeks to increase revenues from digital banking. Siam Commercial will provide lending services to small businesses on Singapore-based Sea’s platforms, the bank’s president, Apiphan Charoenanusorn. Sea’s AirPay customers will also be able to pay bills via SCB’s apps, he said. The tie-up is in line with the bank’s strategy to secure partnerships and expand its digital capacity, including payments and lending. Earlier this year SCB made an undisclosed investment in Indonesian ride-hailing startup GoJek’s Thai unit, Get, with plans to expand financial services to drivers on the app. Its partnership with Sea comes as Thai banks are pressured by falling fee income following a waiver on digital transaction fees since last year. SCB’s non-interest income dropped by 9.7% in the first half of 2019 from a year earlier due to lower fee income. Sea, which owns e-commerce platform Shopee and operates in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, reported its e-commerce revenue more than tripled in the April-June period versus the same period a year ago on the marketplace-related services. Sea raised $1.5 billion this year to expand its e-commerce business. It has also hired Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo as its ambassador for an upcoming sales event on its app, hoping his popularity in Southeast Asia can bolster sales."

Nash left Sea last year. reut.rs/2WDYt43 “At Asia Partners, we believe deeply in the potential for growth equity to accelerate economic growth throughout Southeast Asia,” said Rippel, who had led Naspers’ investment in India’s Flipkart. Southeast Asia has turned into a battleground for start-ups, racing to provide payments to e-commerce to the region’s nearly 650 million people, with investors keen to back them. A 2018 report by Bain and Co said the region will give rise to at least 10 companies with a market value of more than $1 billion each by 2024.
