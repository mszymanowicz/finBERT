3.846389447377816," Analysis: Sovereign wealth, public pension giants caught up in U.S.-China tech fight LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds are getting caught in the escalating tensions over technology between the United States and China, a Reuters analysis of their filings data and public disclosures show. They range from Norway and Singapore’s giant sovereign wealth funds to Switzerland’s central bank and the $1.1 trillion U.S. TIAA, founded over a century ago by Andrew Carnegie as the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. U.S. investors were banned from owning stakes in more than 40 Chinese firms viewed as having military links in a series of moves since November, as outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump sought to cement his hardline policy against Beijing. That prompted TIAA unit Nuveen to sell stakes in blacklisted firms including China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom, as well as microchip giant SMIC, state oil firm CNOOC and phone and gadget maker Xiaomi. Other U.S. public pension funds are expected to follow suit. CalPERS, the largest such fund, held Hong Kong-listed ‘H’ shares in several firms, including a 1.1% stake in China Telecom and 0.2% apiece of both China Mobile and China Unicom, according to Refinitiv data. CalPERS, which has been criticised by Republican party politicians for its China investments, did not respond to a request for comment. The Florida State Board of Administration, which manages $200 billion of assets and had small stakes in China Telecom, China Mobile and Xiaomi, according to Refinitiv data, told Reuters it would be adhering to the bans. “The sanctions really bite for U.S. institutions,” said Elliot Hentov, head of policy research at State Street Global Advisors. And the ripples aren’t only being felt in the United States. A number of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have been affected as the New York Stock Exchange and index providers MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have ejected blacklisted firms from benchmarks, causing some stock prices to drop more than 20%. Norway’s $1.3 trillion SWF, the world’s largest, has 0.2%-0.6% stakes in China Telecom, China Mobile, Xiaomi, CNOOC and China Unicom Hong Kong as part of a broader $35 billion Chinese equity portfolio, according to most recent disclosures running up until the start of 2020. It said it would not comment on specific holdings. Singapore’s GIC, a self-described “independent state investor”, has a 10% stake in China Telecom’s Hong Kong-listed ‘H’ shares and holds roughly 1.4% of SMIC in mainland China A- and H-shares, Reuters calculations based on stock exchange filings show. GIC declined to comment. Other holders are Canadian pension funds Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ), British Columbia Investment Management, CPP Investment Board, Netherlands-based independent pension fund PGGM Vermogensbeheer and APG Asset Management. Non-U.S. investors are not formally required to make any changes and many will have seen the value of their Chinese investments soar in recent years. Chinese equity markets are at a 13-year high and the market cap of the main tech index is double what it was two years ago. “We view our investments in China – an important country in the global economy – with a long-term perspective,” CDPQ told Reuters, declining to comment on specific investments. Graphic: Norway sovereign wealth fund's rising China equity investments - While China’s growing weight in global markets is encouraging sovereign funds to hold larger Chinese portfolios, the bans and recent claims of cyber espionage over 5G firm Huawei and social media dance craze app TikTok show how technology is now a key geopolitical battleground. With no indication yet of new U.S. President Joe Biden’s approach, China Telecom, China Mobile, Xiaomi and CNOOC’s shares have dropped between 12% and 22% since being blacklisted in November or this month.. SMIC has bucked the trend with a double-digit gain. “Some of the offloaded shares may be picked up from bargain-hunting asset owners outside of the U.S.,” said Winston Ma, former managing director of sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. “However, it may be difficult for them to absorb everything.” Graphic: Mixed fortunes for Chinese firms amid blacklist uncertainty - It hasn’t just been Washington’s actions that have caused difficulties. Beijing shocked markets in November when it suspended Ant Group’s planned $37 billion IPO with days to go and just as Trump’s administration was pushing through its bans. Alibaba, which owns a third of Ant, saw its market value shrink by more than a quarter. It is a top 10 global stock and widely held by sovereign and pension funds. U.S. Securities Exchange Commission data sec.report/CIK/0001582202 shows Switzerland's central bank doubled its Alibaba holdings in the past two years to $1.4 billion worth of the $650 billion company's stock in September. November’s tumble would have wiped roughly $350 million off those holdings. Alibaba shares recovered almost half their losses in January after being spared the U.S. blacklist.

4.21547411259445," Asset manager Nuveen exits sanctions-hit Chinese companies LONDON (Reuters) - Nuveen, the $1.1 trillion asset management arm of TIAA, has sold out of its holdings in the Chinese companies that will be barred to U.S. investors by recent sanctions, it said in an email to Reuters. The disposals come as U.S. investors scramble to exit stocks subject to the sanctions, which ban Americans from owning companies deemed to have links with China’s military. Nuveen had held positions in several of the blacklisted companies, including China Telecom, SMIC, Xiaomi Corp, CNOOC, China Mobile and China Unicom Hong Kong, according to Refinitiv data up to the end of November last year. Of those, the largest was a 0.12% holding in the Hong Kong listing of China Telecom, the data showed. TIAA is the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, a leading retirement provider for people in the education, not-for-profit, healthcare and government fields. Other U.S. investors have made similar moves. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, had sold almost all its stake in China Telecom, a stock market filing showed last week. About $323 billion of Nuveen’s assets under management are invested in equities, its second-largest asset class behind fixed income, its website shows. Big U.S. funds are expected to liquidate more holdings before the rules take effect in November 2021. Before leaving office, Donald Trump’s administration slapped sanctions on 44 Chinese companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military, a move expected by financial executives to remain in place under Joe Biden’s presidency."
10.174193142673465," Investment fund workers crave company, but work-from-home here-to-stay NEW YORK (Reuters) - The alphabet soup in the finance industry, which already lives off EBITDA and AUM, may get a new addition in the form of WFH4EVA as work-from-home becomes the new post-pandemic normal. After nine months of working remotely to escape the dangers of crowded offices and mass transit, blamed for spreading the coronavirus, bankers, traders and investors await a vaccine they hope will usher in a return to normal. But for many, a new normal may look a lot like what they’ve been experiencing for months: days hunched over computers at home and meetings on Zoom, bankers and investors told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit this week. The pandemic has pushed how people work into the future by about a decade, they said, adding that there will be benefits ranging from increased flexibility for employees and cost savings for employers. But there may also be negatives that could dent productivity and spark health crises. “We are increasingly seeing white-collar companies realize that the flexibility employees wanted for some time doesn’t come with any real drawbacks,” said Max Gokhman, who oversees $32 billion as head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors and quipped that he coined the new acronym WFH4EVA. Dozens of employees at New York-based investment firms decamped to California, Florida and Texas to escape colder temperatures, using the time they save commuting to exercise or cook, several said. Many plan to stay put, with their bosses’ blessings. Not battling for seats on commuter trains, saving on dry cleaning and taking a midday walk are positives that may guard against burnout. For employers renting millions of square feet in the heart of some of the world’s most expensive cities, more flexible office setups could spell big savings. Trading floors will remain staffed in person, but analysts and others do not have to be in every day, which could reduce office rents. “We will have less of a physical footprint in dense cities,” said Jeffrey Solomon, chairman and chief executive officer at investment bank Cowen Inc. He also credits more working from home with widening firms’ talent pools through what he says will be more diverse staff recruitment. “There will be significantly more fluidity in hiring.” Once a vaccine is broadly available, workers who are desperate for a vacation away from home are likely to seize the opportunity to travel. But after the first rush to travel is satisfied, investors said longer-term, business travel, for example, may not boom. “I don’t have to be in the office physically every minute of every day, but I don’t have to travel so much going forward,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income and head of the Global Allocation Team at BlackRock. BlackRock manages $2.5 trillion in fixed income assets. The flip side of making remote work more permanent could spell fresh pain for retailers and fast food establishments in cities drained of office workers, investors said. “That probably does mean that is a sector that won’t come back as quickly as we thought it would,” said Jim Leaviss, chief investment officer for fixed income at M&G Investments. It might also be potentially negative for employees who crave human contact and say productivity depends on teams throwing mathematical formulas on a white board, which does not work on Zoom, several said. “My concerns have been more on the mental health side, the longer this gets,” said Jose Minaya, chief executive officer of Nuveen, the $1.1 trillion investment manager owned by TIAA. “As we get into winter months I do worry about the fatigue of it,” he said.

10.206798199203499," Nuveen's CEO Minaya sees good returns from alternative assets BOSTON (Reuters) - Alternative assets like office buildings, farmland and loans to mid-sized businesses will help investors meet their goals as interest rates stay low, said Jose Minaya, CEO of Nuveen, the $1.1 trillion asset management arm of TIAA. Roughly a quarter of Nuveen’s investments are in so-called alternative options, which Minaya said can pay returns well above typical stock or bond investments over time, especially with a dovish U.S. Federal Reserve. “If you stick to a traditional portfolio, hitting your targeted returns over the next five or ten years is highly unlikely,” said Minaya in an interview on Wednesday for the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit 2021. While investors didn’t need alternatives for the last decade, he said, now “we’re living in this environment where finding income and finding diversification is growing ever more challenging.” Nuveen has Global Cities REIT, a non-listed product sold through brokers that invests in assets in cities likely to benefit from trends such as urbanization, technology and aging populations. In addition to big capital cities these include places like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Osaka in Japan and Lyon in France. Holdings include industrial real estate, which is in demand especially for logistics operations as companies like Amazon.com Inc boost home-delivery sales, Minaya said. “The infrastructure is having a really hard time keeping up, which is why returns have been so great,” he said. Multifamily housing and home rentals in some areas are also attractive, he said. Nuveen also owns several shopping malls in China including in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus first spread widely. Shopper numbers have been strong as lockdowns eased, Minaya said. “The sales and the foot traffic were exponential. People were ready to go back, they were ready to spend,” he said.
