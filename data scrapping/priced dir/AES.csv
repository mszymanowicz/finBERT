18.420804057185197," Electric utility AES to sell stake in coal-fired plant in Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. electric utility AES Corp said it would sell its equity interest in the Mong Duong 2 coal-fired power plant in the Quang Ninh province in Vietnam to a consortium led by a U.S.-based investor. The deal is in line with the company’s strategy to invest in renewables and LNG infrastructure as it expects to achieve zero emissions from electricity by 2050. The company said it was making progress on the development of the 450 trillion British thermal units Son My LNG terminal with PetroVietnam and the 2,250 megawatt Son My 2 combined cycle gas power plant as part of its gas and renewables push. AES has a 51% stake, Posco Energy Co Ltd owns 30% and Stable Investment Corporation, a subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, owns the remaining 19% in Mong Duong 2. Vietnam said in September it was planning to ramp up its solar and wind power generation capacity, aiming to raise the proportion of renewables in its power mix to 15%-20% by 2030 and to 25%-30% by 2045, from the current 10%. Vietnam has been developing renewables, along with LNG-to-power and coal-based projects, as hydropower has been nearly fully tapped while oil and gas production has peaked. Plans to build nuclear power plants were scrapped in 2016."
12.580803358503728," AES Gener in Chile shuts down coal-fired power plant amid push to end carbon emissions from grid SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean unit of U.S.-based AES closed a coal-fired power plant along Chile’s central Pacific coast on Tuesday ahead of schedule amid a drive by the South American nation to end carbon emissions from its grid. Chile in 2019 signed an agreement with major generators AES Gener, Colbun, Enel and Engie to gradually eliminate the country’s coal-fired power plants, which currently produce around 40% of the country’s electricity. The deal is part of a broader move by Chile - a country rich in wind and solar resources - to decarbonize the country’s grid and become carbon-neutral by 2050. For its part, AES Gener decided to push forward the closure of its Ventanas 1 coal-fired electrical generating plant, and said it would close its Ventanas 2 plant in 2022. Both were originally slated for withdrawal from the grid in 2024. President Sebastián Piñera said at a ceremony announcing the closure of the Ventanas 1 Plant on Tuesday that they would be replaced “with clean and renewable energies.” Both of the AES facilities are located in a coastal region widely known in Chile for recent pollution episodes that have caused public health emergencies. The coastal port city is home to the coal-burning power plants, but also to an oil refinery and a copper smelter, some of which operate very close to residential areas. The plants, though shut down, will remain available to generate electricity in the event of an emergency, said AES Chief Executive Ricardo Falú. Chile’s government expects to have shut down 11 coal-fired plants by 2024, three more than initially anticipated by that date."
27.66712811817663," AES, PetroVietnam Gas to sign $2.8 billion LNG deal: Pompeo HANOI (Reuters) - AES Corp. AES.N will sign a deal with PetroVietnam Gas GAS.HM to develop a $2.8 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and a power plant in Vietnam, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. ""Vietnam has given the green light to AES Corp. AES.N, a company based in Virginia, to go forward with the project,"" Pompeo said at a virtual Indo-Pacific Business Forum. The deal will open the door for the import of billions of dollars worth of U.S. LNG to Vietnam each year, Pompeo said, describing it as a “real win-win situation”. The forum, also attended by his Vietnamese counterpart Pham Binh Minh, comes as the United States ramps up its rhetoric against the regional influence of Chinese state firms. “American companies adhere to the rule of law and transparency and have very high standards of quality for their products,” Pompeo said. “I say that because that’s quite a contrast with the Chinese state-backed companies.” Vietnam is building numerous LNG-to-power plants, with the first to be operational by 2023, an ambitious move that could see LNG become a major energy source for its fast-growing economy. Much of that will be imported from the United States, which wants to narrow its trade deficit with Vietnam, which widened to $44.3 billion in the first nine months of this year from $33.96 billion in the same period of 2019. Also at Wednesday's forum, Delta Offshore Energy formalised an earlier announced plan for a $3 billion agreement with Bechtel Corp., General Electric GE.N and McDermott MCDIF.PK for the development of a 3.2-gigawatt LNG power plant in Bac Lieu province, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said."

AES Corp offered to buy 65% of BNDES’ stake in AES Tiete for 17.15 reais ($3.33) per share in cash. The sale will reduce BNDES’ stake to 9.9% from 28.41%, while AES Corp will hold 42.86% after the deal. Besides AES Corp's offer only to the state-controlled lender, BNDES and all AES Tiete's shareholders on Monday received a merger proposal from power company Eneva SA ENEV3.SA, involving cash and shares, with a 17% premium over AES Tiete's market value at the time. Units in AES Tiete, comprising one common share and four preferred shares, tanked as the power company’s shareholders were left with no proposed deal. Eneva issued a statement on Tuesday saying it will “continue to work on generating value to its shareholders, focused on the development of its business plan and always attentive to opportunities that represent the best interest of all its shareholders and stakeholders.” Shares in Eneva fell 1.8% in early afternoon trading, underperforming Brazil’s stock exchange index."

AES Corp has offered to buy 65% of BNDES’ stake in AES Tiete for 17.15 per share, one of the sources added. After this partial sale, BNDES would reduce its stake in the company to 9.9% from 28.41%. BNDES believes the offer by AES Corp could trump a 7.5 billion reais ($1.43 billion) bid made by Brazilian power company Eneva SA ENEV3.SA, and will now analyze it, the sources said. BNDES could make its decision this week, the sources said. AES Corp has offered to pay BNDES in cash, while Eneva’s bid offers AES Tiete shareholders both cash and new shares after both companies merger. BNDES, which aims to sell its stake in AES Tiete, would remain with a 8.3% in the new company. Newspaper Valor Economico reported earlier on AES Corp’s offer."

Eneva ENEV3.SA announced on March 1 a hostile bid for AES Tiete TIET11.SA, controlled by AES Corp AES.N, in a 6.6 billion real ($1.25 billion) shares and cash transaction. On Monday, AES’ Chief Financial Officer Clarissa Della Nina said that AES would be willing to keep discussing the takeover bid if the terms were improved. Eneva said it was pulling out of the deal after AES Tiete said it would not extend voting rights to preferred shares, according to Eneva breaking rules of the stock exchange segment in which AES Tiete is listed."
21.369482740091716," UPDATE 2-AES Tiete may keep talks with Eneva alive if bid is raised -CFO (Adds CFO comments, share performance) SAO PAULO, April 20 (Reuters) - AES Tietê may keep talks alive for a merger with rival Eneva SA if the bid is raised, even after the rejection from AES board, Chief Financial Officer Clarissa Della Nina said on Monday. Eneva unveiled on March 1 a hostile bid for a merger with AES Tiete, controlled by AES Corp, a 6.6 billion-real ($1.25 billion) shares and cash transaction. Shares in AES Tiete were down 1.2%, in line with benchmark index Bovespa, and Eneva shares were rising 0.9% in early afternoon trading in Sao Paulo. AES Tiete’s CFO said shareholders would prefer a full-cash, higher bid. Della Nina said the CEO letter to Eneva invites for a meeting to discuss a revised bid. In a meeting on Sunday, AES Tietê board rejected the offer from Eneva SA, both companies said in filings late on Sunday. The board said a merger with Eneva would make no sense, since Eneva owns thermoelectrical plants that use coal or natural gas, and AES owns hydroelectric dams. A final decision needs to be taken by a shareholders assembly."

17.036822426656432," AES Corp to build $1.7 billion gas-fired power plant in Vietnam HANOI (Reuters) - AES Corp. AES.N on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Vietnamese government to build a $1.7-billion gas-fired power plant in Vietnam, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said. The deal for building the 2.2-gigawatt Son My 2 Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Power Plant was signed in Hanoi in the presence of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, the embassy said in a statement. Vietnam wants to import more U.S. goods to help narrow its trade surplus with the United States following threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on its products and to label the country a currency manipulator. The power plant is scheduled to start commercial operations in 2024, according to the statement. AES previously received approval from the Vietnamese government to build a $1.4 billion LNG terminal near the power plant in Vietnam’s southern-central province of Binh Thuan. Ross is leading a delegation of senior government officials and executives from 17 leading U.S. companies to Hanoi, as part of a larger trade mission to the Indo-Pacific region with stops in Thailand and Indonesia. On Friday he witnessed the signing of a $1-billion multi-year engine service agreement between Pratt & Whitney and Vietnam Airlines HVN.HM and a production sharing contract between Murphy Oil MUR.N, Vietnam Oil and Gas Group, PVEP and SK Innovation 096770.KS for Block 15-2/17 offshore Vietnam. Vietnam is at risk of being labeled a currency manipulator by the U.S. because of its trade surplus with the country, a highly positive current account balance and because its central bank has been quite active in terms of net foreign exchange purchases. The U.S. is Vietnam’s largest export market. Its trade surplus with the U.S. widened to $33.96 billion in the first nine months of this year from $25.46 billion a year earlier, according to Vietnam’s customs data. Vietnam imported its first batches of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil earlier this year, and is considering importing coal from the U.S. for power generation."

In an interview with Reuters, CEO Ítalo Freitas said AES may also join the auction of stakes in wind farm companies to be held by state-controlled power holding company Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA ELET6.SA. But AES is not interested in minority stakes. “We are looking at some of Eletrobras assets but our premise is to own majority stakes,” Freitas said. The potential acquisitions are part of AES plan to increase the share of renewables in its generation portfolio through 2020 and the Brazilian unit may also invest in solar power assets. After the sale of distribution company Eletropaulo Metropolitana to Italy's Enel SpA ENEI.MI, AES Tietê is the largest asset owned by AES in Brazil. AES Tietê already has acquired one wind farm from Renova for 600 million reais ($145 million). Renova said last July the company had received binding offers for the Alto Sertao III windfarm. One of the bidders is Aliança Geração, a joint venture between Cemig and Vale SA VALE3.SA, Reuters reported."
