6.047207558732011," PSEG on track to sell fossil-fired power plants by year end -CEO (Reuters) - Public Service Enterprise Group Inc is on track to sell its fossil-fired plants by the end of the year as it transitions into a mostly regulated utility operator and producer of 100% clean energy, the power company’s chief executive said. Energy companies are transitioning from dirty fuels to cleaner forms of energy to limit global warming from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced by burning coal and other fossil fuels. Most U.S. utilities plan to burn more natural gas - the cleanest fossil fuel - over the next decade as they retire coal plants until there is enough wind and solar power and energy storage available to keep the lights on and electric prices low. New Jersey-based PSEG has already retired most of its coal plants. In July 2020, the company said it would speed its clean energy transition by selling its non-nuclear power plants, which include over 6,750-megawatt (MW) of gas-, oil- and coal-fired generation. “The process will accelerate the transformation of our power generation business into a zero carbon emitter,” PSEG CEO Ralph Izzo told Reuters this week. Izzo said PSEG expects final bids for the plants by May or June. The company, which supplies power and gas to around 2.6 million customers, will remain a major electric generator by investing in offshore wind power and maintaining its three nuclear power plants. In December, PSEG agreed to buy a 25% interest in the 1,100-MW wind farm Orsted A/S is building off New Jersey. That plant will cost around $5 billion based on industry estimates and is expected to enter service in 2024. “We intend to participate further in offshore wind opportunities,” Izzo said, noting PSEG has another site it co-owns with Orsted with access to Maryland and New Jersey."
9.819310713526392," PSE&G's $1 billion New Jersey energy efficiency plan approved (Reuters) - New Jersey regulators on Wednesday approved Public Service Electric and Gas Co’s (PSE&G) plan to invest $1 billion on energy efficiency programs over the next three years. Parent company Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (PSEG) PEG.N Chief Executive Ralph Izzo told Reuters the investments would cut customer bills by about $1 billion and stimulate economic growth by creating up to 4,300 jobs that will help the state recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. PSE&G is the biggest power and gas company in New Jersey. Izzo said the investment will also drive “significant progress” toward achieving New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s clean energy agenda by avoiding 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) through 2050. New Jersey wants all of its electricity to come from non carbon emitting sources, like renewables and nuclear, by 2050. PSEG said in July that it expects to sell its non-nuclear generating plants in 2021. That generation includes more than 6,700 megawatts (MW) of fossil-fired generation in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Maryland, and over 400 MW of solar power in various states. “Our CO2 emissions (from power plants) are going to drop to zero by the end of 2021 as we exit the fossil generation business,” Izzo said, noting the only big power plants the company plans to keep are the nuclear reactors, which produce about 90% of the New Jersey’s carbon-free energy. Izzo also said PSEG would decide over the next month or so on whether to invest in Orsted A/S' ORSTED.CO planned 1,100-MW offshore wind farm off the coast of New Jersey, which is expected to cost about $1.6 billion and enter service in 2024."

6.268994031505009," PSEG to shut most fossil power plants by 2046 to cut carbon emissions (Reuters) - New Jersey energy company Public Service Enterprise Group Inc PEG.N plans to shut all but three of its fossil fuel-fired power plants in a bid to cut carbon emissions by 80% by 2046 from 2005 levels, Chief Executive Ralph Izzo told Reuters. PSEG also said it could reach net-zero carbon emissions in 2050 by shutting all of its fossil-fuel plants, assuming advances in technology and public policy. “Our gas (power plant) construction program is over. We do not have plans to purchase or expand the gas fleet,” Izzo said, noting the company will shut its last coal-fired power plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut by June 2021. PSEG has about 11,000 megawatts of generating capacity. About 60% of the power those plants produce comes from nuclear reactors, 30% from gas, 8% from coal and 2% from solar. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. The three gas plants the company plans to keep through 2046 are in Sewaren, New Jersey, Keys, Maryland, which were completed in 2018, and in Bridgeport, Connecticut, completed earlier this year. “If energy storage and advanced nuclear technologies come along and allows us to deal with the dispatchability limitations of renewables, then we can face the challenge of retiring the remaining gas plants,” Izzo said. In addition to shutting all but three of the company’s gas plants by 2046, Izzo said PSEG has no plans at this point to extend the licenses of its three nuclear reactors at the Salem and Hope Creek stations in New Jersey beyond their current operating licenses, which expire between 2036-2046. To replace the missing generation, Izzo said PSEG would focus on its $2.5 billion energy efficiency program and offshore wind and solar energy projects. “The goal is to make sure people are using as little energy as possible, that the electricity we generate is as clean as possible and that we electrify as much of the economy as possible,” Izzo said. Gas overtook coal as the nation’s leading source of power generation in 2016 and is expected to keep that title for the next 30 years. Gas emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal when burned. Renewables - hydro, solar and wind - are expected to overtake coal as the second biggest source of power generation by 2026, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration projections."
