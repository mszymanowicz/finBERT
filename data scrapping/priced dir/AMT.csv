9.601241315496518," Mexican broadcaster TV Azteca resolves loan dispute with American Tower MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster TV Azteca said on Tuesday it had paid American Tower Corp what it owed for a roughly $92 million loan plus interest, resolving a dispute that had clouded the company’s credit profile. As part of the agreement, TV Azteca paid the Boston-based cell tower owner and operator $53 million in cash, plus interest, the broadcaster disclosed in its third-quarter earnings report. The rest of the balance was covered by American Tower’s use of TV Azteca towers in Mexico. The broadcaster said it funded the payment to American Tower with a “peso-denominated bank loan,” without specifying the source. A spokesman for American Tower did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for TV Azteca declined to comment beyond the company’s earnings release. In May, an American Tower unit sued TV Azteca for nearly $97 million in a New York state court, saying the company had defaulted on the loan. The broadcaster did not confirm or deny having defaulted on the loan in court papers. TV Azteca has waged an aggressive campaign to reduce its debt in recent years, and the dispute took some investors by surprise. After Reuters reported on the legal dispute in August, credit ratings agency Fitch placed TV Azteca on “negative watch,” warning that a default on the loan from American Tower could lead to default on other loans under “cross-default” clauses. Nevertheless, TV Azteca kept trimming its debt in the third quarter. The company’s outstanding debt stood at 13 billion pesos ($694.5 million) at the end of the third quarter, down 19 percent from the same period last year, according to the earnings release. The agreement with American Tower “reduces interest expenses and TV Azteca’s exposure to liabilities in foreign currency,” TV Azteca Chief Financial Officer Esteban Galindez said in a statement accompanying the company’s earnings. The company reported an 8 percent increase in net revenue for the third quarter and net income of 438 million pesos, up from a net loss last year. (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

10.128838395083234," Fitch puts Mexico's TV Azteca on 'negative watch' amid legal row MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Credit ratings agency Fitch on Thursday placed TV Azteca on “negative watch,” warning of the risks of the Mexican broadcaster’s legal dispute with American Tower Corp as the companies attempt to reach a settlement. MATC Infraestructura, a unit of cell tower owner and operator American Tower, sued TV Azteca for nearly $97 million in a New York state court, saying the company had defaulted on a loan. American Tower and TV Azteca are now engaged in talks to settle the lawsuit, the companies wrote in court papers filed on Wednesday. In court papers, the broadcaster did not confirm or deny having defaulted on the loan from American Tower. “The Negative Watch reflects the high level of uncertainty related to the difficult situation of TV Azteca’s vendor financing and leasing agreement with the Mexican subsidiary of American Tower Corp (ATC),” Fitch wrote. Spokesmen for TV Azteca and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fitch has given TV Azteca a credit rating of “B+,” under the “speculative” category. If TV Azteca defaults on its loan from American Tower, that could lead to default on other loans under “cross-default” clauses, Fitch wrote. The dispute with American Tower also highlights TV Azteca’s “aggressive negotiating tactics,” Fitch wrote. Nevertheless, TV Azteca has made progress in its core business of content and broadcasting, the ratings agency said. “Fitch believes TV Azteca has a solid financial liquidity position, enough to comfortably cover all its interest payments,” it added.

6.942747409251515," American Tower feud 'not positive' for Mexico's TV Azteca, Fitch says MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Credit ratings agency Fitch voiced concerns on Thursday that TV Azteca’s legal battle with American Tower Corp was “not positive or favorable” for the Mexican broadcaster’s credit profile, two days after Reuters reported the lawsuit. MATC Infraestructura, a unit of cell tower owner and operator American Tower AMT.N, sued TV Azteca AZTECACPO.MX for nearly $97 million in a New York state court, saying the company has defaulted on a loan. In an interview, Alberto Moreno, a senior director at Fitch, said the agency will likely evaluate what the case means for TV Azteca’s credit rating. “Our sense is obviously this is not favorable or positive for the credit profile of the company,” he said. “We will continue monitoring.” A spokesman for TV Azteca declined to comment. The broadcaster did not confirm or deny having defaulted on the loan from American Tower in court papers, but argued it had not been served properly. In April, Fitch upgraded TV Azteca’s outlook to “positive” from “stable,” noting that the company had reduced its net debt by 23 percent in 2017. The market has viewed the dispute in New York as part of an ongoing negotiation between TV Azteca and American Tower, Moreno said. “They (TV Azteca) have enough liquidity and enough access to financing in order to cover their obligations,” he said."
7.312742763292568," American Tower, Algar buy telecom assets of Brazil's Cemig SAO PAULO (Reuters) - American Tower Corp AMT.N and unlisted Brazilian operator Algar Telecom SA on Wednesday purchased the broadband network of Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais SA CMIG4.SA, known as Cemig, potentially spurring more dealmaking in Brazil's telecoms space. At an auction in Cemig’s headquarters in the interior state of Minas Gerais, American Tower won Lot 1 of the network with a 571 million reais ($152 million) bid, and Algar won the smaller Lot 2 with a 78 million reais bid. While the Brazilian units of Telefonica SA TEF.MCVIVT4.SA, Telecom Italia SpA TLIT.MITIMP3.SA and America Movil SAB de CV AMXL.MX had mulled bids, they ended up not making any offers. Some potential buyers Reuters consulted in recent weeks considered the 367 million-real minimum price for the units to be relatively high. Still, American Tower's bid of 571 million reais was well above the minimum. Brazil-listed shares in Cemig were trading up 0.7 percent in early afternoon trade, while the benchmark Bovespa .BVSP was roughly flat. For Algar, the profile of Lot 2 fits with the company’s plans to expand its network into Brazil’s northeastern states. The company had planned an initial public offering late last year, but scuttled it after GIC, a sovereign wealth fund established by the government of Singapore, took a stake in the firm and injected about 360 million reais of capital. Other potential telecom deals in the short-term in Brazil include the sale of carrier Nextel by NII Holdings Inc NIHD.O. Major carrier Oi SA OIBR4.SA is often floated as a potential acquisition target in the long-term."

5.189706034941027," American Tower fights to recover tens of millions from TV Azteca MEXICO CITY, Aug 7 (Reuters) - American Tower Corp is seeking to recover nearly $97 million from TV Azteca , saying the Mexican broadcaster has defaulted on a loan, according to court papers. In a case filed in a New York state court, MATC Infraestructura, a unit of cell tower owner and operator American Tower, said TV Azteca failed to make a payment on a loan from MATC and has not indicated it will resume doing so. In June, state Supreme Court Judge Tanya Kennedy temporarily barred TV Azteca from selling or transferring assets up to the amount sought by American Tower. The total includes $6 million in back interest, American Tower said in its July 31 earnings release. “Defendants’ own statement and current conduct demonstrate they have no intention of paying MATC,” MATC wrote in court papers reviewed by Reuters. “TV Azteca has been evasive and uncooperative.” When MATC inquired about a missed payment, TV Azteca’s parent company, Grupo Salinas, said the broadcaster probably would not be able to pay anytime soon, MATC said in the court papers. The dispute with TV Azteca took a toll on American Tower’s second-quarter results, the company said in its earnings release. During a conference call with analysts, American Tower Chief Executive James Taiclet said TV Azteca had missed two payments, after paying consistently for years. In recent years, the broadcaster has aimed to reduce its debt. In April, credit ratings agency Fitch upgraded TV Azteca’s outlook to “positive” from “stable,” noting that the company had reduced its net debt by 23 percent in 2017. “They (TV Azteca) still have relatively high leverage, but solvency is not a pressing issue for the time being,” said Barclays analyst Gilberto Garcia. TV Azteca, Mexico’s number-two broadcaster, moved to dismiss the case, saying it had not been served properly. The company did not confirm or deny having defaulted on the loan in court papers. The company is controlled by Ricardo Salinas, one of Mexico’s richest men. A spokesman for TV Azteca declined to comment on the case. The lawyer listed for TV Azteca in the court papers did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for American Tower refused to comment, and a lawyer for the company did not respond to a request for comment."

9.214125057131115," American Tower Corp to acquire Telkom Kenya sites NAIROBI (Reuters) - America Tower Corporation will acquire Telkom Kenya’s transmission towers in a deal expected to be concluded in the second half of this year, allowing Telkom to invest in its internet network, the two companies said on Monday. The sale by Telkom Kenya, which is 60 percent owned by London-based Helios Investment Partners and is Kenya’s third-biggest telecoms company by users, takes American Tower Corp into its fifth African country and 17th worldwide. The companies said in a joint statement that they had reached agreement for American Tower Corp to acquire up to 723 towers from Telko. Neither company disclosed the price agreed. “The sale will release capital for further investment in our 4G network and a number of state-of-the-art IT platforms, all of which will further enhance services for our customers,” Telkom Kenya CEO Aldo Mareuse said. Telkom Kenya and the local unit of Indian-owned Bharti Airtel have a combined 23 percent of Kenya’s 41 million mobile subscribers but have long struggled to compete with sector leader Safaricom, which has a 71.9 percent market share."
