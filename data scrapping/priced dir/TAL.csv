-9.066491396412712," China online education firm Yuanfudao to raise $1.2 billion to nearly double valuation: sources BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese online education platform Yuanfudao is set to raise $1.2 billion in a new funding round which will value it at about $13 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the issue. Yuanfudao's existing investors, Tencent Holdings 0700.HK, Hillhouse Capital and Boyu Capital, will invest in this round, according to the people. The three are vying for a leading role in the fundraising with Tencent being the frontrunner, one of them said. The eight-year-old company has nearly doubled its valuation within six months. In March, Yuanfudao raised $1 billion that valued it at $7.8 billion. The company is planning to raise more fresh capital to include new investors in the near term at a different valuation, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential. Yuanfudao and Boyu declined to comment. Tencent and Hillhouse did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Yuanfudao’s valuation surge comes as investors increase their bets on China’s online education sector, which saw a surge of interest after the coronavirus outbreak triggered a migration to online classes. Start-ups targeting K-12 education have been particularly popular, which raised 12.5 billion yuan in the first half, over 60% of the total amount raised by the sector, according to Chinese research firm IT Orange. Online tutoring startup Zuoyebang in June raised $750 million in a fresh funding round, led by investment firms FountainVest Partners and Tiger Global Management Technology-driven education services provider GSX Techedu GSX.N has seen its share price more than triple this year, while shares of TAL Education Group TAL.N, which runs several online learning platforms, are up more than 50%. Yuanfudao, which says it has accumulated 400 million users and has 11 teaching and curriculum development centers across China, also counts IDG Capital, Warburg Pincus and Matrix Partners China among its backers."
8.731893960098368," China launches campaign to clean up websites that target minors SHANGHAI, July 13 (Reuters) - China’s internet watchdog said it was kicking off a two-month campaign to clean up websites aimed at users under the age of 18, saying it wanted to promote a healthy online environment. The Cyberspace Administration of China said on its website on Tuesday that under the campaign it will look at content on online learning websites as well as ones that have livestreaming or instant messaging tools aimed at minors. The regulator intends to “strictly control information and actions that induce minors to carry out behaviours which have value-oriented problems such as the chasing of entertainment stars with no limits in mind or worshipping money”, it said. The watchdog also said it had recently ordered the people in charge of the Xueersi Online School app, a unit of TAL Education Group, to clean up the app’s “low-brow” content after finding issues with its videos and articles. China has stringent rules on content ranging from video games to movies to music, and censors anything it believes violates core socialist values. In the past, it has imposed limits on online play time for young users amid reports of rising gaming addiction among children. (Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Himani Sarkar)"

The European Union’s eagerness to reopen this summer may not extend to American travellers. The New York Times on Tuesday reported that the bloc may include the United States in its draft list of unwelcome visitors, due to the country’s failure to control the pandemic.

U.S. travellers accounted for 5.1% of international arrivals in the EU in 2019, spending $33.4 billion, Tourism Economics data shows. The United States has more to lose. In March, when Covid-19 cases were rising in Europe, President Donald Trump angered EU officials by banning most of the continent’s citizens from entering the United States.

51.79398533950618," Breakingviews - Stars align for China tech’s stay-at-home project HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bad news in the United States is good news for a Chinese stay-at-home project. Controversial facial recognition startup Megvii Technology is considering going public on Shanghai’s recently opened STAR Market, the South China Morning Post reported last week. On Monday, state media announced plans for a U.S.-style, registration-based system that will better position ChiNext, Shenzhen’s $187 billion growth board, for new listings. It’s good timing given the suspicion U.S.-listed Chinese firms are falling under. Backers face longer lockups and capital controls, but they should get better valuations. Foreign appetite for Chinese companies is waning. The U.S.-China trade war, combined with recent scandals involving Luckin Coffee and TAL Education, have dented confidence. Megvii, for its part, has an image problem after being placed on a human rights blacklist by the United States. It failed to win approval for a Hong Kong listing in November and later let its application lapse. With private fundraising slowing to a trickle, capital-raising options for Chinese startups are dwindling. Many Chinese tech companies have shunned local exchanges. Long waiting times for listings, profitability requirements, limits on pricing initial public offerings and capital controls have made them unpopular venues for companies and their private equity backers. But regulators have experimented with STAR to ease many of these restrictions. Now ChiNext is rolling out similar changes, which could ultimately be extended to the whole market. There are caveats. Shareholders are subjected to much longer lockup periods of up to 36 months once companies list on the STAR Market, compared to up to six months in New York. Foreign investors need government approval to repatriate money out of China once they’ve cashed out, and that approval can be slower than usual during times of economic stress. But the valuations that companies and their backers stand to fetch are more attractive than those in New York. Roughly 100 companies have listed on the STAR board since it started and they currently trade at over 90 times historical earnings. ChiNext is up 8% year-to-date, outperforming domestic benchmarks, even as markets around the world have tanked. China’s fledgling exchanges are fast becoming a more hospitable fundraising option."
27.549101728646182," Online tutors boosting incomes as demand surges due to coronavirus lockdowns MANILA (Reuters) - Filipino teacher Raven Kate De Leon is in demand, spending up to 10 hours a day at her home computer surrounded by mini cars and stuffed toys that she uses as props to inject fun into her English classes for students far away in China. Since the coronavirus took a hold in China at the start of this year and forced schools and offices to shut down, thousands of Filipino teachers are cashing on overtime as grade schoolers and professionals in China, Japan and beyond turn lockdowns into opportunities to better their English. One of only a few countries in Asia that can combine affordable e-learning with an ample supply of teachers and strong English proficiency, the Philippines is uniquely placed to absorb demand in Asia for Internet language classes. Online platforms like 51Talk of China Online Education Group COE.N and RareJob Philippines, and a host of smaller local Philippine outfits, have seen demand and usage soar since February, bucking the devastating effect on the world's economies from coronavirus, which has infected more than 337,500 people and killed more than 14,500. “I usually have 20 classes every day, so I could meet the demand of the great number of students nowadays,” said De Leon, 22, who works for 51Talk. “I take that opportunity to give them a fun and fruitful distraction because I know they’re stressed, worried.” De Leon is currently now working from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., without a day off. 51Talk charges around 45 yuan ($6.36) per 25-minute session, with teachers earning around 130 pesos ($2.53) per hour. China shut down its schools in February to contain infections. More than two dozen countries followed suit, sending more than 290 million children and youths out of school, data from UNESCO, the United Nation’s cultural agency, showed. “More and more, the safe way to continue learning is to go online,” said Jennifer Que, country head of 51Talk , which has 20,000 partner-teachers in the Philippines. Many online teachers in the Philippines typically work from home, which has insulated them from the home quarantine measures that have devastated businesses and restricted tens of millions in the Philippines, which has nearly 400 confirmed cases. Shares in the $419-million China Online Education has surged 154% year-to-date, compared to the NYSE composite index's .NYA 34% slump in the same period. Other e-learning firms like TAL Education Group TAL.N, New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc EDU.N and GSX Techedu Inc GSX.N have seen their shares rally up to 24%, 17% and 112%, respectively, notably at the height of the school closures in mid-February. RareJob, which has around 6,000 Filipino tutors and specializes in the Japan market, saw its users nearly double to 800,000 since February, CEO Gaku Nakamura told Reuters. Japan shut down its schools last month to halt the coronavirus spread. “In these kinds of situation, parents do not want their kids to go out,” Nakamura said, adding that RareJob’s monthly fee of $60 for Japanese students and $100 for business-level English is cheaper by up to 40 times versus learning centers in Japan. Japanese teenagers form the bulk of Kristine Concepcion’s 26 daily students. “I’m happy to be of service in this situation and I admire them for still choosing to learn,” said Concepcion, a RareJob tutor of five years, who uses candy, Astroboy and stuffed toys to keep her child students engaged. But not everywhere can cope, including the southern city of Davao, which has a backoffice industry comprising 50,000 mostly call centre agents, but no more than 300 home-based online tutors. “We could not meet the demand,” said Samuel Matunog, president of the industry group, ICT Davao. “Every day, we are asked if we still have a supply of teachers.” Regardless of whether school and work shutdowns will continue for much longer, online learning firms are hoping to leave a lasting impression on an underserved market. 51Talk wants to engage 100,000 Filipino tutors by 2025 or earlier and hopes its teachers will get good ratings and referrals after the surge in customers to ensure demand after coronavirus containment measures are over. “Of course we don’t want this outbreak to last a long time but this is the best moment. If teachers do their best, even after things normalize, students will look for them,” said country head Que."
8.135385985748218," Satellites and shoe-leather: How investors get beyond China's dubious data TOKYO/SYDNEY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When TAL Education Group, a mid-sized tutoring services firm in China, reported a three-fold increase in its 2018 third-quarter net income earlier this year, few people made much of it. Rather, investors fretted over a weak performance in China from Apple Inc - a classic yardstick for measuring demand and the health of the world’s second-largest economy. For Brendan Ahern, the New York-based chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, TAL’s results showed that, while China may be showing signs of pain from a long-running U.S.-Sino trade war, parts of its economy are still doing well. “With some study of China, you can get results that are very contrary to this view of China as one entity,” said Ahern. Ahern is not alone. Foreign investors keen to get a grasp of China’s economy have for years distrusted official data. Many have models built on inputs such as auto sales or air traffic and even indicators such as commentary from food and beauty firms. “Many people look for alternative data sources in China as proxies for growth, rather than the just the official figures,” said Ross Hutchison, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. “I find it helpful to consider ‘micro’ stories, where you can get a better sense of actual activity.” In 2018, even as the trade war sapped exports and investment at home, China’s official GDP growth was 6.6 percent - as always, unerringly within official targets. That was a 28-year low for China, but still almost double the global average of 3.7 percent. “There are always questions about it and there are always doubts raised about it,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “U.S. investors for the most part put a little haircut on it. If the number is X, they suspect the real number is X minus something, and then it is more about trying to identify the trend of numbers rather than the absolute levels.” What’s more, for an economy that exceeds $10 trillion and a population of nearly 1.4 billion, analysts says China’s economic statistics are released too swiftly for investors to have faith in their accuracy, leading them to read the economic tea leaves elsewhere. China’s National Bureau of Statistics did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Around the same time that Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales were making investors nervous about China, Aberdeen’s Hutchison was looking at athletic apparel firm Nike Inc’s estimate-beating results and double-digit sales growth in China. “To me, it suggests that the worries around Apple are not a canary in the coalmine for faltering Chinese growth, but that increasingly expensive iPhones just aren’t as cool as they used to be,” said Hutchison. Peter Bye, a portfolio manager on the U.S. equity team at UBS Asset Management, agrees some filtering of data is needed. Bye cites the example of the 2013 crackdown by Chinese authorities on gift-giving by officials, which skewed demand for luxury brands. “Therefore, China growth numbers out of some high-end brands again weren’t that indicative of China consumer health.” His discretionary list of data points includes travel commentary from booking platforms as well as commentary from beauty and food companies around the region pandering to Chinese travelers and customers. For U.S. hedge fund manager Teddy Vallee, founder of Pervalle Global, the correlations between China’s credit growth and other markets such as global crude and copper are material, so he looks at China’s base money or M1 growth. “The issue today is we haven’t seen M1 turn higher, so it’s quite difficult to be constructive until this turns,” Vallee said. The Economist magazine’s Li Keqiang index was inspired by comments from the Chinese premier a decade or so ago that the official GDP was ‘man-made’. Li based his preferred measures of economic growth on bank loans, rail freight and electricity consumption. But as China weans its economy off a reliance on manufacturing and heavy industry, analysts have found the Li Keqiang index needs additional measures. Unfortunately, China’s modern economy, more represented by internet payment platforms and sales systems such as WeChat and Alipay, isn’t yet openly sharing data on online traffic. Jian Shi Cortesi, an Asian equities portfolio manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich, tracks a China Satellite Manufacturing Index, developed by San Francisco-based SpaceKnow. It analyses industrial facilities in China using imagery from space and algorithms measuring the level of manufacturing activity. Qinwei Wang, a London-based senior economist at European asset manager Amundi, uses in-house models incorporating freight and passenger traffic data, floor space under construction and electricity consumption. “These data are more independent from official GDP and headline data, of high frequency, difficult to manipulate by officials, and cover the relatively broad economy,” said Wang. For many analysts like Sarah Shaw, a Sydney-based global portfolio manager at 4D Infrastructure, nothing beats boots on the ground. “If you’re wandering around in Beijing and you can’t get into a restaurant or you can’t get on a train because they are all full, that’s an indication that things are still relatively okay.”"
36.485475186691154," RPT-INSIGHT-Chinese tech investors flee Silicon Valley as Trump tightens scrutiny (Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - New Trump administration policies aimed at curbing China’s access to American innovation have all but halted Chinese investment in U.S. technology startups, as both investors and startup founders abandon deals amid scrutiny from Washington. Chinese venture funding in U.S. startups crested to a record $3 billion last year, according to New York economic research firm Rhodium Group, spurred by a rush of investors and tech companies scrambling to complete deals before a new regulatory regime was approved in August. Since then, Chinese venture funding in U.S. startups has slowed to a trickle, Reuters interviews with more than 35 industry players show. U.S. President Donald Trump signed new legislation expanding the government’s ability to block foreign investment in U.S. companies, regardless of the investor’s country of origin. But Trump has been particularly vocal about stopping China from getting its hands on strategic U.S. technologies. The new rules are still being finalized, but tech industry veterans said the fallout has been swift. “Deals involving Chinese companies and Chinese buyers and Chinese investors have virtually stopped,” said attorney Nell O’Donnell, who has represented U.S. tech companies in transactions with foreign buyers. Lawyers who spoke to Reuters say they are feverishly rewriting deal terms to help ensure investments get the stamp of approval from Washington. Chinese investors, including big family offices, have walked away from transactions and stopped taking meetings with U.S. startups. Some entrepreneurs, meanwhile, are eschewing Chinese money, fearful of lengthy government reviews that could sap their resources and momentum in an arena where speed to market is critical. Volley Labs, Inc, a San Francisco-based company that uses artificial intelligence to build corporate training materials, is playing it safe. It declined offers from Chinese investors last year after accepting cash from Beijing-based TAL Education Group as part of a financing round in 2017. “We decided for optical reasons it just wouldn’t make sense to expose ourselves further to investors coming from a country where there is now so much by way of trade tensions and IP tensions,” said Carson Kahn, Volley’s CEO. A Silicon Valley venture capitalist told Reuters he is aware of at least ten deals, some involving companies in his own portfolio, that fell apart because they would need approval from the interagency group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). He declined to be named for fear of bringing negative attention to his portfolio companies. CFIUS is the government group tasked with reviewing foreign investment for potential national security and competitive risks. The new legislation expands its powers. Among them: the ability to probe transactions previously excluded from its purview, including attempts by foreigners to purchase minority stakes in U.S. startups. China is in the crosshairs. The Asian giant has been an aggressive investor in technology deemed critical to its global competitiveness and military prowess. Chinese investors have bought stakes in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft, as well as companies with more sensitive technologies including data center networking firm Barefoot Networks, autonomous driving startup Zoox and speech recognition startup AISense. (For a graphic of Chinese venture investment in U.S. tech, see: tmsnrt.rs/2SBHUVh) A dearth of Chinese money is unlikely to spell doomsday for Silicon Valley. Investors worldwide poured more than $84 billion into U.S. startups for the first three quarters of last year, exceeding any prior full-year funding, according to data provider PitchBook Inc. Still, Chinese funders are critical to helping U.S. companies gain access to the world’s second-largest economy. Volley’s Kahn acknowledged that rejecting Chinese investment may make his startup’s overseas expansion more difficult. “Those of us who are operators and entrepreneurs feel the brunt of these tensions,” Kahn said. It is a radical shift for Silicon Valley. Money has historically flowed in from every corner of the globe, including from geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia, largely uninhibited by U.S. government scrutiny or regulation. Reid Whitten, an attorney with Sheppard Mullin, said that of the six companies he recently advised to get CFIUS approval for their investment offers, only two have opted to file the paperwork. The others abandoned their deals or are still considering whether to proceed. “It is a generational change in the way we look at foreign investment in the United States,” Whitten said. The decline in Chinese investment comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington. Trump has blasted China for its enormous trade surplus and for what he claims are its underhanded strategies to obtain leading-edge American technology. The nations have already levied billions in tariffs on each other’s goods. And Trump is considering an executive order to bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by China’s Huawei and ZTE, which the U.S. government has accused of spying. CFIUS is emerging as another powerful cudgel. Led by the U.S. Treasury, it includes members from eight other government entities, including the departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security. The secretive committee does not disclose much about the deals it reviews. But its most recent annual report said Chinese investors made 74 CFIUS filings from 2013 to 2015, the most of any nation. The president has the authority to make the final decision, but a thumbs-down from CFIUS is usually enough to doom a deal. Washington demonstrated its tougher stance even before the new law was passed, when Trump in March blocked a $117 billion hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd to acquire Qualcomm Inc of San Diego. CFIUS said the takeover would weaken the United States in the race to develop next-generation wireless technology. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. In November, CFIUS rolled out a pilot program mandating that foreign investors notify the committee of any size investment in certain “critical technologies.” The scope of that term is still being defined, but a working list includes artificial intelligence, logistics technology, robotics and data analytics – the bread and butter of Silicon Valley. Research firm Rhodium predicted that up to three-quarters of Chinese venture investments would be subject to CFIUS review under the new rules. Just the threat of that scrutiny has caused some Chinese investors to reconsider. Peter Kuo, whose firm, Silicon Valley Global, connects Chinese investors with U.S. startups, said his business has slumped dramatically. In 2018, he said not a single Chinese investor took a stake in the companies he shopped to them. “CFIUS didn’t kill our organization, but it hampered a lot of startups, and most of them are American startups,” Kuo said. Some security experts applaud what they call long-overdue protections for U.S. startups. “What we are concerned about is a limited number of bad actors who are phenomenally clever about how they can access our intellectual property,” said Bob Ackerman, founder of AllegisCyber, a venture capital firm based in San Francisco and Maryland that backs cyber security startups. Rhodium calculates that, on average, 21 percent of Chinese venture investment in the United States from 2000 through 2017 came from state-owned funds, which are controlled at least in part by the Chinese government. In 2018, that figure surged to 41 percent. But some tech industry players say Washington is casting too wide a net in its zeal to check Beijing. “A lot of innocent business people are getting” caught up in the administration’s spat with China, said Wei Guo, the China-born founding partner of Silicon Valley firm UpHonest Capital, whose funding comes mostly from foreign investors with ties to China. Adding to Silicon Valley’s anxiety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken a more active role in policing Chinese investment. Two industry veterans, a startup adviser and a venture capitalist who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters they were recently cautioned by the FBI not to pursue deals with Chinese investors. The two people did not name the Chinese entities of interest to the FBI, but said the deals concerned U.S. companies building artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies. Whether any of this deters China from reaching its goal of dominating advanced technologies remains to be seen. China can still invest in U.S. technology through layers of funds that obscure the money source. And Chinese investors are redirecting funds to promising companies in Southeast Asia and Latin America. U.S. startups, meanwhile, are rewriting deal terms to avoid a CFIUS review. Strategies include adding provisions to prevent foreign investors from obtaining proprietary technical information, and denying them board rights, veto rights or additional equity in future rounds, attorneys told Reuters. “People are rightfully concerned about making sure they are on the safe side of the fence,” said Jeff Farrah, general counsel of the National Venture Capital Association."
36.485475186691154," Chinese tech investors flee Silicon Valley as Trump tightens scrutiny SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - New Trump administration policies aimed at curbing China’s access to American innovation have all but halted Chinese investment in U.S. technology startups, as both investors and startup founders abandon deals amid scrutiny from Washington. Chinese venture funding in U.S. startups crested to a record $3 billion last year, according to New York economic research firm Rhodium Group, spurred by a rush of investors and tech companies scrambling to complete deals before a new regulatory regime was approved in August. Since then, Chinese venture funding in U.S. startups has slowed to a trickle, Reuters interviews with more than 35 industry players show. U.S. President Donald Trump signed new legislation expanding the government’s ability to block foreign investment in U.S. companies, regardless of the investor’s country of origin. But Trump has been particularly vocal about stopping China from getting its hands on strategic U.S. technologies. The new rules are still being finalized, but tech industry veterans said the fallout has been swift. “Deals involving Chinese companies and Chinese buyers and Chinese investors have virtually stopped,” said attorney Nell O’Donnell, who has represented U.S. tech companies in transactions with foreign buyers. Lawyers who spoke to Reuters say they are feverishly rewriting deal terms to help ensure investments get the stamp of approval from Washington. Chinese investors, including big family offices, have walked away from transactions and stopped taking meetings with U.S. startups. Some entrepreneurs, meanwhile, are eschewing Chinese money, fearful of lengthy government reviews that could sap their resources and momentum in an arena where speed to market is critical. Volley Labs, Inc, a San Francisco-based company that uses artificial intelligence to build corporate training materials, is playing it safe. It declined offers from Chinese investors last year after accepting cash from Beijing-based TAL Education Group TAL.N as part of a financing round in 2017. “We decided for optical reasons it just wouldn’t make sense to expose ourselves further to investors coming from a country where there is now so much by way of trade tensions and IP tensions,” said Carson Kahn, Volley’s CEO. A Silicon Valley venture capitalist told Reuters he is aware of at least ten deals, some involving companies in his own portfolio, that fell apart because they would need approval from the interagency group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). He declined to be named for fear of bringing negative attention to his portfolio companies. CFIUS is the government group tasked with reviewing foreign investment for potential national security and competitive risks. The new legislation expands its powers. Among them: the ability to probe transactions previously excluded from its purview, including attempts by foreigners to purchase minority stakes in U.S. startups. China is in the crosshairs. The Asian giant has been an aggressive investor in technology deemed critical to its global competitiveness and military prowess. Chinese investors have bought stakes in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Lyft, as well as companies with more sensitive technologies including data center networking firm Barefoot Networks, autonomous driving startup Zoox and speech recognition startup AISense. A dearth of Chinese money is unlikely to spell doomsday for Silicon Valley. Investors worldwide poured more than $84 billion into U.S. startups for the first three quarters of last year, exceeding any prior full-year funding, according to data provider PitchBook Inc. Still, Chinese funders are critical to helping U.S. companies gain access to the world’s second-largest economy. Volley’s Kahn acknowledged that rejecting Chinese investment may make his startup’s overseas expansion more difficult. “Those of us who are operators and entrepreneurs feel the brunt of these tensions,” Kahn said. It is a radical shift for Silicon Valley. Money has historically flowed in from every corner of the globe, including from geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia, largely uninhibited by U.S. government scrutiny or regulation. Reid Whitten, an attorney with Sheppard Mullin, said that of the six companies he recently advised to get CFIUS approval for their investment offers, only two have opted to file the paperwork. The others abandoned their deals or are still considering whether to proceed. “It is a generational change in the way we look at foreign investment in the United States,” Whitten said. The decline in Chinese investment comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington. Trump has blasted China for its enormous trade surplus and for what he claims are its underhanded strategies to obtain leading-edge American technology. The nations have already levied billions in tariffs on each other’s goods. And Trump is considering an executive order to bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by China’s Huawei and ZTE, which the U.S. government has accused of spying. CFIUS is emerging as another powerful cudgel. Led by the U.S. Treasury, it includes members from eight other government entities, including the departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security. The secretive committee does not disclose much about the deals it reviews. But its most recent annual report said Chinese investors made 74 CFIUS filings from 2013 to 2015, the most of any nation. The president has the authority to make the final decision, but a thumbs-down from CFIUS is usually enough to doom a deal. Washington demonstrated its tougher stance even before the new law was passed, when Trump in March blocked a $117 billion hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O to acquire Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O of San Diego. CFIUS said the takeover would weaken the United States in the race to develop next-generation wireless technology. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. In November, CFIUS rolled out a pilot program mandating that foreign investors notify the committee of any size investment in certain “critical technologies.” The scope of that term is still being defined, but a working list includes artificial intelligence, logistics technology, robotics and data analytics – the bread and butter of Silicon Valley. Research firm Rhodium predicted that up to three-quarters of Chinese venture investments would be subject to CFIUS review under the new rules. Just the threat of that scrutiny has caused some Chinese investors to reconsider. Peter Kuo, whose firm, Silicon Valley Global, connects Chinese investors with U.S. startups, said his business has slumped dramatically. In 2018, he said not a single Chinese investor took a stake in the companies he shopped to them. “CFIUS didn’t kill our organization, but it hampered a lot of startups, and most of them are American startups,” Kuo said. Some security experts applaud what they call long-overdue protections for U.S. startups. “What we are concerned about is a limited number of bad actors who are phenomenally clever about how they can access our intellectual property,” said Bob Ackerman, founder of AllegisCyber, a venture capital firm based in San Francisco and Maryland that backs cyber security startups.

21.95934646799801," Chinese schools on funding spree * Loans: Education firms test offshore waters as lenders study regulations HONG KONG, Dec 14 (LPC) - Three US-listed Chinese educational firms are tapping the offshore loan market, testing appetite among lenders at a time when mainland regulators are clamping down on the sector. Two of the borrowers – Nasdaq-listed New Oriental Education & Technology Group and NYSE-listed OneSmart International Education Group – are making their loan debuts, while NYSE-listed TAL Education Group is refinancing its debut loan from 2016. New Oriental is raising up to US$250m, while OneSmart is eyeing up to US$200m and TAL Education at least US$400m. All three loans have three-year maturities. While the loans from the sector provide some welcome diversification for lenders, they are fraught with regulatory risks that are making banks jittery. “We can see that the government is stepping up restrictions, and we feel uneasy about how big the regulatory risks could be,” said one loans banker. In August, China’s Ministry of Justice released draft regulations that, if implemented, would prohibit educational institutions from acquiring other not-for-profit schools. The share prices of some Hong Kong-listed Chinese education companies tumbled 30% on average in reaction. “Educational firms listed overseas usually use the variable interest entity structure and rely on mergers and acquisitions to expand, which will likely be impacted by China’s recently proposed rules,” said a Hong Kong-based senior loans banker. China’s State Council in November also said kindergarten operators would be barred from selling shares, in a further blow to confidence in the sector. And private tuition companies have come under attack from short sellers: Muddy Waters in June accused TAL Education of overstating its profits. TAL said it had reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were “baseless”. Against that backdrop, some bankers also questioned the rationale for the three companies’ borrowings given that they enjoy strong cashflows from tuition fees. “We are not very clear about the purpose as those tuition fees are often paid upfront, and these companies do not usually need large amounts of working capital,” said a third loan banker. BOOMING SECTOR China’s education sector has been growing rapidly in recent years with companies listing on stock exchanges and raising funds for expansion to ward off competition from new entrants into a lucrative market. Private schools in China more than doubled their revenues from 2010 to 2016, while their penetration rate surged to 34.4% from 23.9%, according to a report from rating agency Fitch in October. Fundraising activity for private education companies has also accelerated, with as many as 10 IPOs in Hong Kong and the US completed in 2017, after the release of the amended law for promoting private education a year earlier. “As the private educational sector in China becomes more competitive, driven by the rising middle class and increased urbanisation, large educational companies want to do IPOs or borrow to get a stronger hold on and increase their market share,” said a Macau-based loan banker. Some Chinese banks are still keen to lend to educational borrowers as they provide a diversification from conventional sectors such as property and financial services. Well-known names such as New Oriental Education, which has a long track record and strong reputation, appeal to lenders. “New Oriental Education is a very famous in China and has a presence in almost every city. We would love to lend to them as private education companies generally have low-to-moderate financial leverage, and their deals carry higher pricing than similarly rated credits,” said a Hong Kong-based loan banker at a Chinese bank. TAL Education’s bullet loan offers a top-level all-in pricing of 200bp via an interest margin of 175bp over Libor, while New Oriental Education’s loan pays a top-level all-in pricing of 180bp based on a margin of 165bp. OneSmart’s deal offers the juiciest pricing among the three, paying a top-level all-in pricing of 300.2bp based on a margin of 270bp and an average life of 2.65 years. Not everyone is concerned about the regulatory risks. “We cannot predict how the government will change its policy towards the education sector in the future so we will go ahead and join the deal first as there are currently no policy restrictions on tuition centres,” said a banker at another Chinese lender. Elsewhere in Asia, the education sector, which has been booming in recent years, has met with mixed results in attracting investors and lenders. Last week, Hong Kong-based Asia International Schools, which owns the international schools bearing the Harrow name, closed a US$120m-equivalent three-year term loan with four banks. Earlier this month, ASX-listed child care service provider G8 Education closed a A$100m (US$72m) junior loan in addition to a A$450m senior secured syndicated loan in October. In August, three institutional lenders committed to a A$150m unitranche loan supporting Quadrant Private Equity’s purchase of a majority stake in Junior Adventures Group, the second-largest before-and-after-school care provider in Australia. Hong Kong-listed Wisdom Education International Holdings held a site visit for banks in July, but no loan materialised. In February, Hong Kong-listed China New Higher Education Group obtained an initial principal amount of HK$500m (US$64m) through a five-year loan after only two banks joined in general syndication.

-14.721718415423005," China education firms see no immediate impact from draft law HONG KONG, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Chinese schools operator Wisdom Education International Holdings said on Tuesday it did not expect a draft law related to the private education sector to have an impact on it, as it seeks to reassure investors after its shares plunged. The statement came a day after Wisdom’s shares led falls in Hong Kong-listed education firms after China released a draft of revised private education regulations that could bar some companies from growing through mergers and acquisitions. “The group has not been affected by the draft amendments in any material respect as at the date of this announcement, and the company currently does not expect that the draft amendments will have any material negative impact on the group based on its preliminary assessment,” chairman Liu Xuebin said in a statement. The Ministry of Justice released the draft amendment related to promoting private education late on Friday, which included incremental government support for private schools and the standardisation of setting up and operating private schools. (here) Jefferies said imprecise terms and language in the draft legislation had spooked the market and it expected further clarification in the next draft. On Monday, Wisdom’s stock slid 38 percent to its lowest in eight months. Shares of Tianli Education and China Yuhua Education, both plunged over 30 percent. Wisdom shares rebounded 16 percent on Tuesday after its announcement, while Tianli climbed 2 percent and Yuhua rose 4 percent. “The board notes that the draft law remains in draft form and is yet to be promulgated,” Yuhua’s chairman Li Guangyu said in a statement, adding the firm would monitor developments. Nomura said in a research note the regulation had created uncertainty as it stated that education groups were not allowed to control not-for-profit schools through mergers and acquisitions, and the change would hinder purchasing via equity interest. “The company is not yet in the position to assess the impact of the amendment law on its operation due to the ambiguity in the draft amendment law and the uncertainty in the legislative timetable of the amendment law,” Tianli chairman Luo Shi said in a statement. “The draft amendment law is not a final draft and has not been approved or has not taken effect yet,” Luo said. Shares of Hong Kong-listed education companies, including Mapleleaf Education, New High Education, Hope Education, China Education Group, China Xinhua Education and Minsheng Education also dived on Monday, falling between 20 and 30 percent. Many of the stocks had rebounded on Tuesday. U.S.-listed Bright Scholar Education, TAL Education , Puxin, New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Rise Education Cayman Ltd, and RYB Education Inc were also hit on Monday."
-34.15919699945169," U.S. fund managers zero in on software as tariffs upend tech sector NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries that a broadening trade war between the United States and China will upend the global supply chain are prompting some U.S. fund managers to buy shares of companies they believe will shield them from such disruptions. Managers from Baron Funds, Thornburg Investment Management, and James Advantage Funds are among those that are buying or adding to positions in companies ranging from cloud-based companies like Salesforce.com to London-based online food delivery company Just Eat Plc that get most of their revenues in their domestic markets, all in an effort to sidestep possible disruptions caused by trade tariffs. “We’ve positioned the portfolio to minimize the risk of exposure to companies that might be more directly impacted,” said Brad Slingerlend, a portfolio manager of the $2.8 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology fund. Slingerlend has been reducing his weight in semiconductor companies overall, he said, while adding to Chinese internet companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd on declines. At the same time, Salesforce.com is now the second-largest position in his portfolio, helped in part by the 31.4 percent gain in the company’s shares for the year-to-date. “The trend to more and more cloud computing is going to march on despite whether a trade war will happen with China,” he said. The U.S. is targeting $34 billion of Chinese goods for tariffs to take effect on July 6, and has threatened tens of billions of dollars more for similar duties. That has helped sink the shares of chipmakers and other industries that rely heavily on a Chinese supply chain. The $1.8-billion iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF has dropped 5.2 percent over the last week, more than double the 2-percent drop in the broad S&P 500 index. Yet there are also signs that some investors are picking up stocks that they think have been unduly hit by the tariff worries. Fund flows into the PHLX Semiconductor ETF, for instance, rose 5 percent in the week ending June 27 from the week before, even as its shares fell 6.9 percent over the same period, according to Lipper data. That positive inflow was more than 5 times larger than the 0.7-percent flow into the broad SPDR XLT ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 tech sector as a whole. Michael Lippert, portfolio manager of the $395 million Baron Opportunity fund, said that he is waiting for deeper declines in the stock market from trade concerns before adding to his positions. “If we have another few days of pullback, I absolutely have my list of companies that are hitting the price targets I want,” he said. Among his new positions is a stake in $395 million integrated circuit maker Aquantia Corp, which makes chips used in data centers and automated driving. Shares of the company are up 4 percent for the year, and are down 25 percent over the last 3 months in part due to trade worries. “In a hot market like this, you want to find a company that’s been overlooked,” Lippert said. Sean Koung Sun, a co-portfolio manager of the $1.8 billion Thornburg International Growth fund, said that his fund is focusing on technology companies that rely on domestic demand more than trade. He has been adding to his position in companies such as TAL Education Group, which operates online and in-person after-school tutoring centers in China. Shares of the company are up 22 percent for the year to date, including a 12.5 decline in the last month. “This is a way to reach the lower-tier cities in China, and technology makes it frictionless,” Sun said. He is also increasing his position in Just Eat, an online food delivery application which operates in markets including the UK, France, Italy and Mexico. Shares of the company are now down 1.3 percent year-to-date after its shares fell sharply Wednesday following cautious guidance from the company’s capital markets day. “The trade tensions have escalated and de-escalated and we’re trying to find high quality companies that will do well in any environment,” Sun said. “We’re trying to be tactical and focused more on the long-term potential.”"
