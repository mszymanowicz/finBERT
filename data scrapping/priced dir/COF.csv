21.874958179013053," Credit card firm Capital One fined for violating U.S. anti-money laundering law (Reuters) - Credit card firm Capital One Financial Corp has been fined $390 million for engaging in what the U.S. government called willful and negligent violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, an anti-money laundering law, a Treasury Department bureau said on Friday. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said in a statement that Capital One admitted to willfully failing to implement and maintain an effective program to guard against money laundering as required by law. (bit.ly/3qmXFji) FinCEN said the financial services company admitted that it failed to file “thousands of suspicious activity reports” and “thousands of Currency Transaction Reports” with respect to a business unit known as the Check Cashing Group. “The failures outlined in this enforcement action are egregious,” FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco said in a statement. The violations occurred from at least 2008 through 2014, and caused millions of dollars in suspicious transactions to go unreported in a timely and accurate manner, FinCEN added."

22.724880305945096," Capital One to pay $80 million fine after data breach WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp COF.N will pay an $80 million penalty to a U.S. bank regulator after the bank suffered a massive data breach one year ago. The fine, announced Thursday by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, punishes the bank for failing to adequately identify and manage risk as it moved significant portions of its technological operations to the cloud. “Safeguarding our customers’ information is essential to our role as a financial institution,” said a bank representative in a statement. “In the year since the incident, we have invested significant additional resources into further strengthening our cyber defenses, and have made substantial progress in addressing the requirements of these orders.” In July 2019, the bank disclosed that personal information including names and addresses of about 100 million individuals in the United States and 6 million people in Canada were obtained by a hacker. The suspected hacker was a former employee of Amazon Web Services, a cloud provider where the bank had moved some of its data. The OCC said in its consent order that the bank failed to identify and manage risks leading up to the move to cloud storage, and lacked sufficient network security and data loss prevention controls. The regulator also said that when internal auditing did identify issues, the bank’s board failed to hold management accountable. The 2019 breach did not expose credit card account information, but about 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised. The OCC also ordered the bank to overhaul its operations to ensure it is adequately guarding against general cybersecurity risks and risks specific to cloud operations, and submit those plans for review. The bank faces similar heightened oversight from the Federal Reserve."

27.609812054887662," RPT-Capital One says it won't use CFTC waiver related to oil lending (Repeats April 4 story with no changes to text) WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. lender Capital One Financial Corp said on Saturday it would not use a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) waiver after commodity price volatility lifted the bank’s derivatives exposure toward a key regulatory threshold. The exemption relieved the firm from a requirement to register as a “Major Swap Participant,” or MSP, even though its growing energy swaps exposure was expected to require that by the end of the next quarter. The CFTC had announced the relief for an unnamed lender two weeks ago, and Reuters later reported Capital One was the bank. “We are not an MSP,” a spokesperson for the bank said in an emailed statement on Saturday. The bank has “notified the CFTC that we will not rely on the waiver and will register if derivative volumes reach the MSP threshold.” The registration is related to Capital One’s commercial lending to the oil and gas industry, a relatively small part of its overall business. The bank enters into commodity swaps with energy clients to help them mitigate the risk of energy price swings and the related borrowing risks. While those trades typically do not bring the lender’s swaps exposure anywhere close to the CFTC’s registration threshold, a huge plunge in energy prices put it on track to hit the threshold by the end of the next quarter, the agency said in a letter on March 20. The temporary waiver sparked worries that regulators are going too easy on banks in a bid to prop up lending, potentially exposing them to more risk down the road if energy prices do not rebound. Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis during which several major institutions were toppled by their derivatives exposure, Congress created a slew of swap trading laws to reduce systemic risk and increase the visibility of the market. Capital One’s commercial bank “does not engage in speculative derivatives trading” and its normal hedging activity has not changed, the bank spokesperson said on Saturday.

6.384807945241773," Exclusive: Capital One got CFTC waiver after oil price plunge increased swap exposure - sources WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lender Capital One Financial Corp got a waiver from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) after plunging oil prices increased the bank’s derivatives exposure above a key regulatory threshold, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. On Friday, the CFTC said it would temporarily exempt a U.S. bank from a requirement to register as a “Major Swap Participant” even though its growing energy swaps exposure would technically require it to do so by the end of the next quarter. The CFTC did not name the bank on Friday, but the two sources told Reuters it was Virginia-based Capital One, which is best known for its retail lending and credit card business. The regulator and Capital One declined to comment on the identity of the bank on Wednesday. A spokesman for the CFTC said it issued the waiver to protect the bank and its energy clients from undue disruption, given the unprecedented market conditions over the past month amid the coronavirus outbreak. “We have actively encouraged all market participants to identify regulatory relief or other assistance that may be needed to help support robust, orderly and liquid markets in the face of this pandemic,” the spokesman said. Capital One’s waiver lasts until Sept. 30, but if energy prices remain low or the bank’s exposure remains above the threshold, it will register as a swap participant or make business adjustments, the CFTC said on Friday. The designation entails a number of complex and costly reporting and compliance obligations, which the CFTC spokesman said could hurt the institution’s ability to keep lending. The bank is a relatively small player in the energy lending and financing business, with energy loans accounting for just 1.4% of its total loan book, its filings show. As part of that business, Capital One enters into commodity swaps with its commercial oil and gas clients to help them mitigate the risk of energy price swings and the related borrowing risks. Typically, those trades do not bring Capital One’s swaps exposure anywhere close to the CFTC’s registration threshold, according to the CFTC’s Friday notice. But a 50% plunge in crude oil prices caused by the coronavirus and a flood of supply by top producers has seen its exposure on those swaps balloon, putting it on course to hit the threshold by the end of this month, the CFTC said. Broadly speaking, that threshold kicks in if a bank has $1 billion in daily average aggregate commodity swap exposure that is not secured by collateral, such as cash margin. Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis during which several major institutions were toppled by their derivatives exposure, Congress created a slew of swap trading laws to reduce systemic risk and increase the visibility of the market. Still, the decision to grant a waiver in this case has sparked worries that regulators are going too easy on banks in a bid to prop up lending, potentially exposing them to more risk down the road if energy prices do not rebound. Across the board, regulators have scrambled to grant regulatory relief, worried banks will pull back from lending and exacerbate corporate liquidity stress. “The priority of the CFTC is not to prop up an ailing sector. It’s to ensure that the market is protected from risks,” said Tyson Slocum, a director at government watchdog group Public Citizen and a member of the CFTC’s Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee. He added he was worried the agency would give exemptions to other banks caught flatfooted by the market turmoil. “I’ve got concerns with over-leveraged banks in the oil and gas sector. I don’t want this to spread across the financial sector,” he added."

The breach at Capital One between March and July was revealed late last month and stemmed from Capital One’s decision to store data in Amazon’s cloud unit, called Amazon Web Services (AWS), where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data. Thompson's indictment cited more than 30 victims of data intrusion and theft, including Capital One, the DOJ said bit.ly/32eBGPE, adding that the case is now headed for a federal court in Seattle. The DOJ did not identify other companies whose data was allegedly breached by Thompson. However, it mentioned that some of the victims included a state agency outside the state of Washington, a telecommunications conglomerate outside the United States and a public research university outside Washington. Thompson not only stole data, but also used stolen computer power to mine cryptocurrency for her own benefit, a practice known as “cryptojacking,” according to the indictment. The 33-year-old software engineer made her initial appearance in a federal court in July. She remains in custody and her charges in the indictment carry penalties of up to 25 years in prison, according to the statement. The data breach at Capital One resulted in the exposure of names and addresses of customers, the company said last month. The hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers, but about 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised."

4.096033614770415," Capital One customer data breach rattles investors (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp's COF.N assurances that a major data breach would have a limited impact on customers or profit failed to convince investors on Tuesday, with the bank's shares closing down 5.9%. Capital One said the prior day that 106 million people who had applied for credit cards in the United States and Canada had their personal data exposed. The bank expects the incident to cost $100 million-$150 million this year, some of which may be covered by a sizeable insurance policy. It also confirmed prior guidance that operating efficiency would improve. However, investors are wary, given the scale of the breach, the reputational impact on Capital One and likelihood of additional costs, analysts said. “We are skeptical of management’s implication that an issue of this magnitude will not impact go-forward earnings & efficiency expectations,” Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari wrote to clients. Analysts pointed to the legal expenses and possible regulatory penalties Capital One might face. On Tuesday, two class-action lawsuits were filed in federal courts and the state attorneys general of New York and Connecticut each said their offices would begin probing the matter. A few lawmakers also issued statements criticizing Capital One or calling for a tougher privacy law. The breach stemmed from Capital One's decision to store data in Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O cloud unit, called Amazon Web Services (AWS), where a former employee named Paige Thompson managed to access its data. She was charged with computer fraud by federal prosecutors in Seattle and made her first court appearance on Monday. Amazon said its cloud unit that stored the data was not compromised in any way. Instead, it attributed the breach to a “misconfiguration” outside of the cloud. Capital One attributed the problem to an error in its own infrastructure. The bank has been an enthusiastic adopter of external cloud services, with senior executives appearing at AWS events or touting the benefits. Amazon shares closed 0.7% lower on Tuesday. Capital One did not have an immediate response to Reuters questions about its technological vulnerabilities on Tuesday. But analysts said its reliance on a third-party provider would come under new scrutiny. The incident “raises questions on how best to police and protect client information,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. “Today’s revelation reminds investors of the trust that financial institutions place in their client-facing employees and highlights risks of outsourcing any part of client-facing operations,” Graseck wrote in a report. She expects the shares to remain under pressure as investors question whether the bank has other cloud-based vulnerabilities, and whether there will be additional regulatory scrutiny and expenses."

The suspect, a 33-year-old former Seattle technology company software engineer identified as Paige Thompson, made her initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday, the U.S. Attorney’s office said. According to a complaint filed in the District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle, Thompson posted information from her hack, which occurred between March 12 and July 17, on coding platform GitHub. Another user saw the post and notified Capital One of the breach. Law enforcement officials were able to track Thompson down as the page she posted on contained her full name as part of its digital address, the complaint said. Capital One said it identified the hack on July 19. A representative for the U.S. Attorney’s office said it was not immediately clear what the suspect’s motive was. The incident is expected to cost between $100 million and $150 million in 2019, mainly because of customer notifications, credit monitoring and legal support, Capital One said. The hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers, but about 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised, Capital One said. Other personal information accessed included phone numbers and credit scores. About 1 million social insurance numbers of the company’s Canadian credit card customers were also compromised. The Capital One hacker was able to gain access to the data through a misconfigured web application firewall, the U.S. Attorney’s office said. Credit-reporting company Equifax Inc EFX.N said last week it would pay up to $700 million to settle claims it broke the law during a 2017 data breach when roughly 147 million people had information, including Social Security numbers and driver's license data, compromised.

-1.3074931562209708," Escalating fight, Trump sues Deutsche Bank, Capital One over Democratic subpoenas (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization have sued Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp to try to block them from responding to U.S. congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats seeking financial records. The lawsuit filed late Monday opens a new front in Trump’s battle to stop the Democratic-led House of Representatives from probing the Republican president, his family, his businesses and his administration after Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his inquiry into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The lawsuit said urgent action was necessary because both banks signaled they would begin responding to the subpoenas unless a court intervened by May 6. Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump’s real estate empire. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, asked Capital One’s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump’s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests. In the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Trump, his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, and the Trump Organization accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose, hoping they would “stumble upon something” they could use as a political weapon against Trump. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the complaint said. Only the banks were named as defendants. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. “The president will do anything and everything that he can to obstruct justice ... to shut down an investigation,” Waters told reporters on Capitol Hill. She also said Trump has “cast a gauntlet and he has said that he is going to fight,” referring to her investigation of Deutsche Bank. “We will fight him,” Waters added. Deutsche Bank said it was “committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Capital One was not immediately available for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs were also not immediately available. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama. Michael Stern, who served as senior House counsel from 1996 to 2004, said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed because judges do not like second-guessing lawmakers’ motivations in investigations. Stern also said Trump’s decision to sue only Deutsche Bank and Capital One appears to have been strategic because the banks would not try to pick sides and were less likely to contest an injunction blocking a subpoena. Andy Wright, a former White House lawyer under Obama now at the law firm K&L Gates, said: “Courts have been really reluctant to assess whether or not Congress has a legitimate interest or not. They have been very deferential in the past.” Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January, including possible dealings with Russia, and said “we’re fighting all the subpoenas” issued by the House. That battle could herald a major showdown between the executive and legislative branches testing the separation of powers spelled out in the U.S. Constitution. The White House is also resisting other House subpoenas, including for Trump’s personal and business tax returns, and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators. Waters and Schiff in a joint statement called the lawsuit part of Trump’s “unprecedented stonewalling” of congressional oversight. In the complaint, the plaintiffs said House leaders ignored constitutional limits on Congress’ power to investigate, and any probe needed to further some “legitimate legislative purpose” and could not be an end in itself. They also said the subpoenas violated the plaintiffs’ privacy rights, and the refusal of House committees to even provide copies of the subpoenas to the plaintiffs made it impossible to know, or negotiate, their scope or breadth. Deutsche Bank stood almost alone in extending credit and managing money for Trump before he became president, as other banks avoided him because of his poor track record in paying back loans. The German lender has extended a substantial amount of capital to the Trump Organization in the past decade, according to documents and media reports. A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank. In March, the New York Times detailed other financial relationships, including more than $2 billion of property loans and private banking services."
-1.3074931562209708," Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block House subpoenas (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and seven of his companies filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial Corp to block the banks from complying with federal subpoenas investigating his financial dealings. The federal lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court’s Southern District of New York, contended that demands for records by Democrat-controlled House committees have no legitimate or lawful purpose. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the lawsuit said. It also complains that the Democrats are hoping “they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President.” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, both Democrats, called the lawsuit “meritless” in a joint statement, the New York Times and other media reported. On April 15, two U.S. House of Representatives committees issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Both banks have been involved in Trump’s real estate empire. “The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern. The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the president and his associates, as thoroughly as possible,” Waters, said in a statement earlier. Schiff said previously in a statement the subpoenas issued included a “friendly subpoena to Deutsche Bank.” Trump recently has said that he intends to defy any efforts from the Democrats to dig into his affairs. Among other things, the Democrats have been looking into possible dealings Trump might have with Russia. The suit, which includes The Trump Organization Inc. and Trump’s three eldest children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, states that the court has the power to declare the subpoenas invalid. A representative of Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Attorneys and representatives for the two sides were not immediately available to Reuters late Monday."

The merged group, ONE-Dyas, will operate alongside a group of several relatively large independent oil producers that entered the North Sea in recent years, including private equity-backed Chrysaor and Neptune. The tie-up will enable ONE-Dyas “to pursue further growth opportunities,” according to the statement. The two Netherlands-based firms expect to have a joint production in 2019 of 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), they said. Dyas holds stakes in several major British North Sea fields including Nexen-operated Buzzard, Premier Oil-operated PMO.L Catcher and Total-operated TOTF.PA Elgin Franklin. ONE also holds stakes in Buzzard, Elgin Franklin and Breagh. The company will be led by Robert Baurdoux, the current Chief Executive Officer of Dyas while ONE’s current CEO Alexander Berger will act as executive director. Under the agreement, ONE will own 51 percent of the shares in the combined group while SHV Holdings, Dyas’s parent company, will hold the remaining 49 percent. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019. The two had a combined production of over 40,000 boed in 2017, according to their websites."
