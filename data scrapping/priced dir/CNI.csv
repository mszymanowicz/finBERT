Coronavirus, which hit China’s industrial production, along with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, are further leading suppliers to eye alternative manufacturing sites in Asia. “The tariff war and coronavirus have intensified and accelerated these trends,” CN CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest said. “I think, therefore, we are even more bullish today than two years ago.” He sees a shift in the business mix, combined with container expansion projects planned for ports in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax - three main eastern Canadian ports - as key to reviving CN’s underutilized eastern network, which lost capacity as manufacturing dwindled. “CN is very focused to repurpose that network, which is in great shape and only running at 50% capacity,” Ruest said. CN, which has access to 15 port operations overall, is a partner in a C$775 million ($570 million) joint venture for a new container terminal at Quebec City’s port, but has not disclosed its specific investment. Montreal-based CN is betting on more freight generated by consumer spending being shipped through the Suez Canal to North America’s east coast, even as the pandemic fuels demand for e-commerce. CN figures show 30% of 2018 revenues were from consumer products, compared with 65% for commodities like chemicals, grain and fertilizer, that the railway moves on its densely-trafficked line in western Canada. But revenues for CN’s consumer franchise grew nearly 28% between 2014 and 2018, around double the rise in the company’s commodity and resource business during those years. CN figures show overall twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), a measurement for cargo capacity, are expected to grow by around 70% at the three ports in 2024.

CN’s strategy is to connect more cities with the port access through acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic partners that would help it access markets in the U.S. midwest and central Canada.

20.607534916242066," UPDATE 2-CN Rail profit beats, pulls 2020 forecast on coronavirus hit (Adds CEO comment, background) April 27 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co beat analysts’ estimates for first-quarter profit on Monday driven by crude-by-rail shipments and withdrew its full-year 2020 forecast following the COVID-19 pandemic. Canadian railroad operators have been getting a boost from shipping oil for producers looking for alternatives to congested pipelines. Canadian National said in January it expected crude shipments to be a growth driver this year. “Looking broadly at energy-related carloads, crude by rail was a significant growth driver, up 45% year-over-year for the quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Jacques Ruest said on Monday. Rail freight revenue rose marginally to C$3.42 billion in the reported quarter on higher petroleum and chemical shipments. Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, fell 5.9%. However, with global storage space filling up fast and oil demand slumping, railroads could stand to lose a key part of their business. Smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd last week warned the pandemic would result in flat growth for the full-year and flagged rapidly slowing crude volumes. CN Rail, Canada’s largest railroad operator, expects the second quarter to be tough for its energy unit on lower demand for crude, frack sand and jet fuel. Current-quarter volumes for the company’s automotives unit will also be hit as North American assembly plants remain shut as the virus outbreak continues. However, unlike many companies in North America, which have suspended dividend payouts to maintain liquidity during the pandemic, CN Rail said it plans to maintain its previously announced 2020 dividend increase of 7%. Rail blockades hit CN Rail’s capacity equivalent to 10,000 carloads, or 1 million tonnes of grain exports in February. Protesters blocked rail lines and roads across Canada for weeks to show solidarity with an indigenous group in the Pacific province of British Columbia who were opposed to a pipeline being built across their land. The company’s operating ratio, a key metric for Wall Street, fell to 65.7% from 69.5%. A lower ratio signals improved profitability. On an adjusted basis, the company earned C$1.22 per share, beating analysts’ estimate of C$1.09, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue was flat at C$3.55 billion.

5.656581825993932," CN Rail faces grain export backlog of 10,000 carloads: CEO MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TO lost capacity equivalent to 10,000 carloads, or 1 million tonnes of grain exports, in February due to rail blockades by protesters opposed to a pipeline project, Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said on Tuesday. Activists disrupted passenger and freight traffic last month to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en people, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp's TRP.TO Coastal GasLink pipeline from being built across their land. “In the case of CN we lost the equivalent of 10,000 carloads, or roughly 1 million tonnes,” Ruest said in an interview. “Of all the supply chains the one that will take the longest (to recover) is the grain export.” The lost capacity represents roughly 1% of Canada’s total harvest during the 2019-20 marketing year, which runs from Aug. 1, 2019, through July 31, 2020. Canada relies on CN, the country's largest railroad, and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway CP.TO to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. The blockades, which shut some lines for weeks, hit “every commodity,” creating backlogs of products sitting on CN railcars, along with product that “has yet to enter our network,” he said. Ruest said CN did not move as much crude by rail as expected in February because of the blockades. He said he believes crude shipments will remain a driver of growth this year for CN, although weaker prices could impact output. Global crude price benchmarks have tumbled this year by more than one-fifth, due to fears that the coronavirus outbreak could sap global demand. Earlier on Tuesday, CN said over 1,400 trains, including passenger trains, were delayed or canceled because of the blockades, causing shutdowns of parts of the company’s network as freight is parked across the network, ready to be moved. CN also confirmed a Reuters report from Friday that the company was calling back many of the 450 employees based in Eastern Canada who had been temporarily laid off because of the blockades. Ruest said he hopes protesters will not target rail amid tensions over other pipeline projects. Along with Coastal GasLink, twinning is under way with the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific coast near Vancouver, which also faces fierce opposition from environmental and some indigenous groups. “It is a very costly way to resolve issues,” Ruest said. “I surely hope this is not the way of the future.”"

Earlier this week, police made 10 arrests and cleared a blockade in eastern Canada that had been stopping freight and passenger traffic for almost three weeks on one of Canada’s busiest lines. The blockades were held in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people in the Pacific province of British Columbia, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp from building a gas pipeline over their land. “In the absence of illegal blockades on our network over the last 24 hours, and while we are keeping a close watch for any further disruptions, we have started calling back many of the temporarily laid off employees based in Eastern Canada,” CN chief executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said in the email seen by Reuters. The email did not specify how many of the 450 workers were being called back. After 21 days of disruptions, “there is a significant backlog of trains parked on our tracks and in our yards that will be processed,” the email said. “The complete network recovery process will take several weeks.” Montreal-based CN said the company was on its way to recovering in Western Canada, and said products like export grain, imported containerized goods, coal, potash and other commodities are moving to market.

Teamsters Canada said in a statement the contract was approved by 91.3% of the estimated 3,200 workers including rail conductors. The new contract “focuses primarily on safety, specifically with regards to crew fatigue and hours of work,” the union said. The agreement, which is retroactive to July 23, 2019, will “provide wage increases and benefit improvements” for the workers, CN said in a statement. Workers hit picket lines for eight days last year, calling for improved working conditions, including rest breaks. A tentative agreement reached between the union and CN brought them back to work in late November. “We’ve succeeded in getting CN to adjust some of its practices in the interests of safety. But the core problem of fatigue in the rail industry can only be resolved through government regulations,” said Lyndon Isaak, president of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) in a release. “The issue of fatigue is still far from resolved.” The strike triggered a severe propane shortage and left many Canadian exports stranded. Canada relies on CN and rival Canadian Pacific Railway to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. About half of Canada’s exports move by rail, according to industry data.

Still, the Canadian economy grew 0.1% during the month, as increases in utility use because of a cold weather snap helped to offset the effects of the strike.

-11.889614035911196," UPDATE 2-CN Rail expects crude shipments to drive growth in 2020 (Adds details from the call, executive comment, background) Jan 28 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co said on Tuesday it sees crude shipments as a growth driver in the year for the country’s largest railway operator, which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit. Canadian railroad operators had been benefiting from shipping oil for producers looking for alternatives to congested pipeline until recently when Alberta’s output cuts in Jan, 2019 hurt crude-by-rail volumes. The volumes, however, started recovering late last year, after Alberta eased the curtailments in October and said it would allow companies to produce additional oil if they move it by rail. “We expect significant year-over-year growth in crude carloads for the balance of first quarter,” said James Cairns, senior vice president of Rail Centric Supply Chain at CN Rail on a post-earnings call with analysts. The company’s quarterly results were hurt by a crippling eight-day strike in November, but it has been ramping up its services to clear delayed shipments. The strike resulted in lower volumes shipped across all units in the quarter, with revenue from the petroleum and chemicals segment, which includes crude-by-rail shipments, falling 8% to C$169 million ($128.60 million). CN Rail’s operating ratio, a closely watched productivity metric that measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, worsened to 66% from 61.9% a year earlier. A higher ratio represents inefficiency.

CN, Canada’s largest railroad, is ramping up its service following a crippling eight-day strike that ended last week, as it cuts jobs in response to softer economic conditions and less demand for freight services. “This year, crude by rail still hasn’t got its traction, which it may early year,” CN CEO JJ Ruest said at the Credit Suisse Industrials Conference. Crude by rail may actually affect “our first quarter positively,” he added, given a possible rise in production next year. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has said he may allow more oil production next year, but pipelines are congested, leaving rail as the main transport alternative. “We have the capacity, especially out west,” said Ruest, adding the railroad would also be able to move higher grain shipments. Canada relies on CN and its smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway to move products such as crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to domestic ports and the United States. The chief executive of CP, which did not suffer a strike, told analysts at the same conference that crude by rail increased during the fourth quarter. “We’re going to exit the fourth quarter with our highest ever crude-by-rail month with fundamentals that just strengthened that in 2020,” said CP CEO Keith Creel. CN’s Ruest said it had not lost business permanently because of the work stoppage, the biggest Canadian rail strike in a decade, but some business had to find its way to customers through other modes of transport. On Tuesday, CN cut its adjusted profit growth target for 2019, citing shipment delays from the eight-day strike. “It’s an expensive strike,” Ruest said.

The draft of the new labor agreement also calls for a retroactive 2.5% increase in hourly, mileage-based and flat rates of pay as of July 23, 2019, an identical wage rise a year later, and a 3% raise in 2021, according to the Free Press report. Workers had previously cited disputes over what counts as showing up on time for shifts. The tentative agreeement seeks to resolve this, in part, by setting out shifts as starting and ending at an agreed location, such as the employee’s locker facility. Employees will also be compensated when scheduled to work 30 or 60 minutes into their rest periods, including train staff and those at railyards, the Free Press reported. Union members should vote on the deal within eight weeks. (Reporting by Saumya Sibi Joseph in Bengaluru Editing by Tom Brown)"
-7.146035802666012," Canadian National Railway resume services after biggest rail strike in a decade ends MONTREAL/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Operations resumed at Canada’s largest railway, Canadian National Railway Co., on Wednesday, a day after company and union officials reached a tentative deal to end an eight-day-long strike that had triggered a severe propane shortage and left many Canadian exports stranded. A CN spokesman said on Wednesday that there were no hiccups in the return to work and that trains were resuming operations as expected. The company had said Tuesday operations would resume across Canada at 6 a.m. local time on Wednesday. The some 3,200 striking conductors and yard workers had been demanding improved working conditions, including rest breaks. Reuters reported on Tuesday that union’s release of recorded pleas of an exhausted rail worker wanting a break after a 10-hour shift helped deliver a critical breakthrough in securing the preliminary agreement. That deal help the end of the country’s biggest railway strike in a decade. The CN spokesman would not comment on Wednesday about the duration of any backlog or the recovery process. Shippers had warned on Tuesday it could take weeks before service normalized. Canada relies on CN and Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. About half of Canada’s exports move by rail, according to industry data. Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday the government would be monitoring CN’s return to operations, saying it would take a few days for the railway to ramp its operations back up. CN, he said, would “get going as quickly as possible.” “CN is a very experienced large company and, yes, they’re very aware of all the goods that we need to be moving,” Garneau said. CN shares rose 0.4% in early Wednesday trade, adding to Tuesday’s 1.3% gains. The benchmark Canadian share index was steady on Wednesday."

Talks with the management to end the stalemate was on even as factories whose supplies have been cut off from their markets began slowing production. The union’s concerns center on fatigue, safety and ensuring that workers’ breaks are not reduced. However, in a letter to employees that was seen by Reuters, the railroad denied union arguments that the “strike was about safety.” Canada, one of the world’s biggest exporters of farm products, relies on Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway to move crops, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. Chemicals maker Chemtrade Logistics Income Fund CHE_u.TO warned a prolonged interruption of rail service could negatively impact its operating results and may prevent the company from meeting its earnings forecast. Some plants that crush canola into vegetable oil and animal meal have slowed production and reduced purchases of the crop from farmers, said Chris Vervaet, executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association. Canadian canola processors include Bunge Ltd, Cargill Ltd and Richardson International. “Rail strikes are normally short-lived, with either a fast negotiated resolution or back-to-work legislation enacted to prevent a significant impact on the economy,” TD Securities analyst Sean Steuart said in a note on Tuesday.

The threatened strike by 3,000 workers with Teamsters Canada comes after CN, the country’s largest railroad operator, said on Friday it would cut management and union jobs, as it grapples with softer economic conditions. Labor Minister Patty Hajdu and Transportation Minister Marc Garneau were to meet with representatives from CN and the union in Montreal, Hajdu’s press secretary Veronique Simard said, following a stalemate in contract talks. CN said it believes a strike can be averted “with the assistance of federal mediators,” after Teamsters declined to submit to binding interest arbitration. “We expect talks to continue up to Nov. 19,” CN said. Teamsters and CN reached a last-minute deal in 2017 that averted a planned strike. Canada, one of the world’s biggest exporters of farm products, relies on its two main railways to move canola and wheat over the vast distances from western farms to ports. Crude oil shippers in Alberta have also used trains in the past two years to reach U.S. refineries as an alternative to congested pipelines. Alberta wheat and barley commissions, representing farmers, urged Ottawa to intervene, as they are already facing difficult harvest conditions because of weather. “There are a lot of farmers who already have a significant amount of their income trapped under snow,” said Gary Stanford, Alberta Wheat Commission chair. “Now adding insult to injury, we’re looking at possible CN rail strike action too.” CN was expecting slightly lower fourth-quarter crude shipments from the third quarter, officials said on an Oct. 22 conference call. Slumping commodity prices, congested oil pipelines and a dispute with China that has hampered Canadian agriculture exports have pressured the economies of resource-rich western provinces. Teamsters Canada spokesman Christopher Monette said the planned strike by its conductors, train personnel and yard workers comes because workers are “hitting a wall on issues related to health and safety.” “While we continue to negotiate in good faith and in hopes of avoiding a labor dispute, we have every intention of striking at 00:01 a.m. ET tonight (0501 GMT) unless an agreement can be reached before then,” Monette said by email.

5.482974990440346," UPDATE 2-CN Rail cuts 2019 adjusted profit outlook, sees challenging H1 (Adds details from conference call, CEO comment) Oct 22 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co on Tuesday cut its adjusted profit forecast for the year and said it expects the first half of 2020 to be “challenging” as freight demand in North America takes a hit from a weakening economy. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Jacques Ruest said on a conference call with analysts that he expects things to get better in the second half of 2020. “It’s a crystal ball for next year, it’s not clear yet,” he added. CN Rail now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share growth in the high single-digit percentage range compared with an earlier estimate of low double-digit range. The company also expects slightly negative volume growth in 2019 in terms of revenue ton miles (RTMs) compared to its earlier estimates of mid single-digit volume growth. RTMs measures the relative weight and distance of freight transported by a railroad. Revenue from the petroleum and chemicals segment, which also includes its crude-by-rail shipments, rose 18% to C$788 million with crude revenue up 34%. However, the company cautioned that with the delay in government contracts and ramp up in crude shipments, it does not expect to see the same level of crude shipments in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago. “We’re going to be slightly down, I think, in crude-by-rail volume going Q3 and Q4 unless something changes,” said a senior company executive James Cairns. Canadian railroad operators, which had earlier reaped the benefits of oil producers looking for alternatives to ship booming production in the backdrop of pipeline congestion, have seen softer crude-by-rail volumes after Alberta’s output cuts in addition to government contracts not ramping up as quickly as expected. Alberta’s government is trying to offload on to the private sector nearly C$4 billion ($3 billion) of crude-by-rail contracts that were signed by the former government, amounting to 120,000 barrels-per-day of crude. However, the largest Canadian railroad operator, reported a better-than-expected profit for the third quarter due to higher freight rates. Excluding one-time items, the railroad company earned C$1.66 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of C$1.62, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s net income rose 5.4% to C$1.20 billion, or C$1.66 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Revenue from intermodal shipments rose 13% to C$1.02 billion ($778.92 million) in the third quarter, driving the total revenue up 4% to C$3.83 billion, which however missed estimates of C$3.87 billion."
-1.2196093706657387," Canadian National Railway profit beats on higher crude, grain shipments (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TO beat analysts' estimates for quarterly adjusted profit on Tuesday, as the country's largest railroad operator shipped higher volumes of crude, refined petroleum products and grains. Revenue in the petroleum and chemicals segment, including crude-by-rail shipments, rose about 25% in the second quarter, while revenue in the grain and fertilizers unit rose 8.4%. CN's U.S.-listed shares CNI.N were up 2.4% at $93.30 after the bell. Pipeline congestion has helped crude by rail shipments recover recently, despite narrower differentials between U.S. and Canadian crude after Alberta government’s mandated crude production cuts. The newly-elected Alberta government has promised to scrap C$3.7 billion worth of crude-by-rail deals by the former government, calling them poor values for taxpayers. Although talks with the private sector are currently underway, the crude-by-rail program is not expected to start in July as originally planned. “I think the real determining factor ... is going to depend on whether the transfer of contracts is timed with the reduction of curtailment or exclusion of curtailment for crude-by-rail barrels,” said James Cairns, a senior executive on a post-earnings conference call. “We are very hopeful that is going to happen and could see some very positive news here this summer.” The two largest contracts signed were with Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TO and smaller rival Canadian Pacific CP.TO to move crude by rail. Canadian Pacific last week beat estimates for quarterly profit on the back of higher crude, chemicals and plastics volume as well as cost controls. CN’s total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars, rose 2% in the three months ended June 30. Operating ratio, a closely-watched productivity metric that measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, improved to 57.5% from 58.2% a year earlier.

3.2452011865318466," Canadian National Railway profit misses as harsh weather weighs on expenses (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co on Monday became the latest railroad operator to blame higher operating expenses due to prolonged extreme cold weather for a lower-than-expected quarterly profit. Rail traffic in Canada was dented by a severe winter, forcing rail operators to cease work. Operating expenses jumped 14 percent in the first quarter, also due to a crude oil train derailment in Western Canada. CN Rail’s operating ratio, a closely watched productivity metric that measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, rose to 69.5 percent in the first quarter from 67.8 percent a year earlier. The lower the ratio, the more efficient a railroad. Last week, smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway missed analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit as it spent heavily to combat a harsh winter that impacted its operations. CN Rail also bore the brunt of Alberta’s OPEC-style decision to force production cuts to deal with a glut. As a result, demand for crude shipment took a nosedive in February, the company said. Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars, rose less than a percent in the March-ended quarter. However, CN Rail and Canadian Pacific are set to benefit from Canada’s oil-producing province of Alberta’s move to buy rail cars to transport 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil after congested pipelines stranded much of Western Canada’s expanding crude output. This comes as a lack of pipelines to the United States and oversupply have led Canadian energy producers to look for alternatives such as railroads to ship crude. “Crude-by-rail is an opportunity that we expect at this point will produce growth in the second half,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Jacques Ruest said on a post-earnings conference call. The company said it expects North American industrial production to increase by about 2 percent this year.

10.75978060699778," Canadian National train derails in Manitoba, leaks oil WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Canadian National Railway Co train derailed early on Saturday in Western Canada, leaking an undetermined volume of crude oil, the company said. Thirty-seven tank cars derailed near St-Lazare, Manitoba. The leak has been contained and has not entered the nearby Assiniboine River, CN spokesman Jonathan Abecassis said in a statement. There were no injuries or fires, he said, adding that CN was preparing to clean up the spill and remediate the environment. The derailment comes as crude oil shipments by rail in Canada reached a record high late last year, after oil production expanded in the western province of Alberta and plugged up pipelines. Crude transport by rail is generally considered less safe than pipelines, although there was also a leak this month in TransCanada Corp’s Keystone pipeline in Missouri. Also this month, a parked Canadian Pacific Railway grain train rolled down a steep embankment in British Columbia, killing three crew members. Canada’s Transportation Safety Board, which regulates the rail industry, said it was deploying investigators to the site of the Manitoba train derailment."
12.238565406606165," Canadian National Rail profit beats on higher crude, grain shipments, raises dividend (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as it transported higher volumes of petroleum crude and Canadian grain. A lack of pipelines to the United States and oversupply have led Canadian energy producers to look for alternatives such as railroads to ship crude. As a result, Canada’s largest railway operator said total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars, rose about 5 percent in the final quarter of 2018. In late September, Canadian oil producer Cenovus Energy decided to ship crude through CN Rail’s network from the final quarter of 2018 as part of a three-year deal. The company said it saw a “significant ramp-up” in crude volumes in the second half of 2018, moving on average 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the quarter compared with about 130,000 bpd in the prior quarter. This drove an about 50 percent jump in revenue in its petroleum and chemicals segment, which contains its crude-by-rail shipments. Overall revenue rose nearly 16 percent to C$3.81 billion ($2.87 billion). The company said it was in talks with the Alberta government to start shipping crude from the region by the end of 2019 or early 2020. The Alberta government has said it was looking to buy rail cars to transport 120,000 bpd of crude oil after congested pipelines stranded much of Western Canada’s expanding crude output. CN raised its cash dividend by 18 percent and set a stock buyback of up to 22 million shares. The company also forecast earnings per share growth in the low double-digit range in 2019, compared with C$5.50 it earned on an adjusted basis in 2018. The railroad operator said its quarterly operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, fell to 61.9 percent from 62.7 percent a year earlier. The lower the ratio, the more efficient the railroad. Excluding one-time items, the railroad company earned C$1.49 per share, beating the analyst average estimate of C$1.47, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

The embargo, initially imposed on Sept. 5, could be lifted as early as Friday, the company said in an email to Reuters. The delivery halt to the most important U.S. ethanol delivery point and home for benchmark cash pricing is the latest sign of a growing ethanol inventory glut amid escalating trade wars and flat domestic demand. U.S. President Donald Trump’s widening trade disputes have forced U.S. ethanol producers to seek new export markets or cut production. The disruption to deliveries has not had an impact on prices, which are already at multi-year lows, traders said. Canadian National said it imposed the embargo to manage the number of inbound cars at the facility. “CN is currently working with its supply chain partners and customers to work through the built up inventory at the facility and restore inbound traffic,” company spokesman Patrick Waldron said in an email on Thursday. U.S. ethanol inventories have swollen to near-record highs in recent weeks. Commodities giant Archer Daniels Midland has ramped up sales to the Argo trading hub in recent months, driving down prices in the U.S. Midwest and angering the company’s rivals, according to traders and regulatory data. “It’s bad for them,” said one trader. “It can really impact their ability to operate.” ADM did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

CN Rail and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd have also been investing in rail infrastructure to meet surging demand for transportation capacity from producers of grains and other commodities. “With strong demand across our business, we continue to invest for the long haul with these locomotives that further expand the reliability and size of our fleet,” CN’s Chief Executive Officer JJ Ruest said in a statement."
-2.5078326155923847," CN Rail tops profit estimates on higher freight volumes (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TOCNI.N on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings as the railroad moved higher volumes of commodities including grains and fertilizers at better pricing. Canada’s largest railroad expects to move higher volumes in the second half of 2018, as it expects strong demand through 2019, and will improve capacity by bringing new workers and locomotives into service. The capacity gives Montreal-based CN more leeway to take on crude-by-rail contracts, provided it does not disrupt service of commodities like grain, said Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest, who now heads the company on a permanent basis. “In the second half, we will have more capacity, therefore we will also be able to execute a bigger book of business of crude,” Ruest told analysts. CN Rail and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd CP.TO are investing in rail infrastructure to ease capacity constraints following a surge in demand from producers of grains and other commodities. Oil producers are eying railroads as production has exceeded pipeline capacity. CN said it now expected adjusted earnings of C$5.30 to C$5.45 per share, compared with C$5.10 to C$5.25 per share estimated previously. CN also added another C$100 million ($76.02 million) to its capital budget, taking its total spending to C$3.5 billion for 2018, as it looks to invest in new rail cars. CN expects capital expenditures to remain similar in 2019 compared with this year. The introduction of tariffs on items like lumber and aluminum have not impacted CN’s business, Ruest said. “So far the impact has not been material in two of the three commodities where there is a duty,” he said. “The volume is actually increasing on the cross-border activities.” Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 5.8 percent, while rail freight revenue per carload increased 3.9 percent, the company said in a statement. CN Rail said operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, increased to 58.2 percent from 57.5 percent a year earlier. Net income rose to C$1.31 billion ($995.82 million), or C$1.77 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from C$1.03 billion, or C$1.36 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned C$1.51 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of C$1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
-2.5078326155923847," UPDATE 1-CN Rail names interim chief Ruest as CEO (Adds background on Ruest) July 24 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co on Tuesday gave interim Chief Executive Officer Jean-Jacques Ruest the role on a permanent basis. Sixty-three-year-old Ruest, who has been with the company for more than two decades, was named interim CEO at Canada’s largest railroad after Luc Jobin stepped down abruptly in March. CN Rail, once considered a benchmark for railway efficiency, has been struggling with capacity constraints that have shrunk its ability to meet strong demand to transport crude-by-rail to U.S. Gulf coast refiners. However, rail companies are looking to offset some of these challenges through negotiations with major oil and gas companies, who have turned to railways to transport oil as pipelines run in full capacity. Ruest said he plans to invest in infrastructure, digitalization and employees to build the Canadian National brand. The company is slated to report its second-quarter results after market close on Tuesday. (Reporting by John Benny and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)"
