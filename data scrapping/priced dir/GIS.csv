12.481785976418191," General Mills puts faith in cereals, ice cream and Mexican food for growth (Reuters) - General Mills Inc will focus on eight key markets and five global product categories, including ice cream, cereal and Mexican meals, as the Betty Crocker cake mixes maker seeks to reach its long-term goal of up to 3% growth. The Cheerios maker benefited from the trend to cook more at home during the pandemic and is now looking to cement the strong profits and market share gains it made during the health crisis. The new “Accelerate” strategy will also see higher investments behind top-selling local brands such as Pillsbury, Totino’s, Yoki and Kitano, and bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures that represent 5% of net sales. General Mills will prioritize investments in eight core markets, including the United States, Brazil and India, and allocate “outsized resources and investments” on the five global product platforms that generate 45% of overall sales, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference on Tuesday. The new plans are part of efforts to reach a long-term organic sales growth target of 2% to 3% and mid- to high-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in constant currencies. The Yoplait yogurt maker will also accelerate its media spending from mid-single-digit to high-single digits in fiscal 2021, while re-affirming its targets for the second half of the year."
5.627940217710878," Athletics: Raised-fist Olympian Smith to grace cover of Wheaties box (Reuters) - Former U.S. sprinter Tommie Smith, who was sent home from the 1968 Olympics after he raised a black-gloved fist on the medal podium following his triumph in the 200 metres, will be on the cover of a Wheaties cereal box. The iconic General Mills cereal brand, which for decades has been synonymous with celebrity athletes on the cover of its orange boxes, said on Friday the “racial equity trailblazer” will be honored with a limited-edition box in April. “As a world champion, I always wanted to be on a Wheaties box,” Smith, 76, said in a news release. “To now be recognized by Wheaties and selected to grace the cover of their box, in the class with other great champion athletes, is an honor.” On one side of the box Smith is shown as a black silhouette raising a right fist and standing on a podium while the other side shows a young Smith running in a singlet. Smith and compatriot John Carlos finished first and third, respectively, at the Mexico City Olympics and then launched an unprecedented protest on behalf of oppressed American blacks when they stood on the podium with heads bowed and fists raised. The image became an enduring symbol of the turbulent 1960s and the fight for racial equality. It was widely interpreted as a black power salute, but Smith later described it as a “human rights salute.” The protest, which occurred amid the civil rights movement in the United States and not long after the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr, cost both sprinters dearly. At home they were heroes to their contemporaries, and pariahs to the establishment. Both were suspended from the U.S. Olympic team and sent home, where they received death threats and hate mail. Carlos’s wife committed suicide, Smith’s first marriage collapsed and both men struggled for years to make a living. “While Tommie was a world champion runner, his work as one of the original activist athletes laid the foundation for champions to use their platform and stand for something extraordinary,” said Taylor Gessell, brand experience manager for Wheaties. “We are proud to honor this true champion and trailblazer with this special commemorative Wheaties box.” Wheaties has been highlighting athletes on its cereal boxes for nearly 90 years, starting with New York Yankees great and Baseball Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig in 1934."
0.3490456078866304," Pet food, baking product sales drive General Mills profit beat (Reuters) -General Mills Inc beat second-quarter profit estimates on Thursday, boosted by sales of its pet foods and baking products, and said it expects the demand trend to continue at the same levels it has seen over the past few months. “Third-quarter demand trends are expected to be generally consistent with recent months, due to ongoing virus concerns in many markets around the world,” the company said, adding that this would lead it to post another strong quarter of sales and profit growth. The Minneapolis-based company expects third-quarter organic sales to be up roughly 7%, similar to growth it witnessed in the second quarter. A spike in at-home cooking boosted sales of many products including Betty Crocker cake mixes and Old El Paso sauces in North America in the latest reported quarter. People also spent more on their pets, driving sales in General Mills’ pet segment up 18% in the quarter, in part due to increased distribution and media investments around brands such as BLUE. Asian and Latin American markets were also robust, the company said, with organic net sales growing 10% on the back of strong demand of its Wanchai Ferry dumplings in China and Häagen-Dazs retail ice cream. In Latin America, Yoki meals and Kitano seasonings were top-performing brands. Overall, net sales climbed nearly 7% to $4.72 billion in the quarter ended Nov. 29, beating market estimate of $4.65 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. Excluding items, General Mills earned $1.06 per share, beating analysts’ expectation of 97 cents. The company also said it expects full-year fiscal 2021 adjusted operating margins to be in line or better than year-ago levels. The company’s shares, up 10% this year, rose nearly 1% in premarket trading."

3.0536195675425195," Lockdown baking boom boosts General Mills sales (Reuters) - Cheerios maker General Mills Inc on Wednesday reported quarterly sales and profits that beat estimates as a surge in baking and cooking by stuck-at-home students and families drove a jump in sales in most of its product lines. The company said it has seen a 91% increase in 18- to 24-year-olds visiting its Pillsbury and Betty Crocker websites since the start of the crisis, with 7 million monthly visitors seeking out recipes made from those brands’ dough and cake mixes. That helped sales of its baking products and meals jump 31% in the quarter, allowing the Yoplait yogurt maker to raise its quarterly dividend by 4% and its shares rose as much as 3.5% in early trading in response. With more people continuing to work from home and an increasing number of students taking online classes, demand for breakfast items like Cheerios cereal and Yoplait also jumped. The company held or grew share in 8 out of its 10 top retail categories in the three months ended August, and said it continued to expect at-home demand to remain elevated in the current quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. It expects high single-digit retail sales growth in North America. “Not only are we gaining share, we’re attracting new consumers in this environment,” Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Harmening said, adding the new customers were heavily skewed to younger and Hispanic households than existing users. Net earnings rose nearly 23% to $639 million in the first quarter, but could be pressured over the next three months as the company increasingly uses third-party manufacturers to meet retail demand and spends more on hygiene and sanitation measures. Since the start of the pandemic, General Mills has employed around 30 new external manufacturers to boost its capacity by about 25% in North America, Harmening said."

President Donald Trump is taking an America-first approach to treating Covid-19. The U.S. government has acquired nearly all the supplies of potential treatment remdesivir, through September. The Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday it bought more than 500,000 treatment courses from Gilead Sciences, including all of its July production and 90% for August and September. It continues the White House’s go-it-alone strategy. In May, it skipped a fundraising conference hosted by the European Union to find a coronavirus vaccine. Japan, Norway and even pop icon Madonna contributed to the $8 billion total. That’s a smart approach because the virus knows no borders. Being selfish in a pandemic could come back to bite the United States. In clinical trials, remdesivir cut the recovery time for hospitalized patients by four days. If another country finds a more effective treatment, it may not be willing to share with Uncle Sam. (By Gina Chon) HOLIDAY HELL. Hundreds of millions of canceled holidays are more than an inconvenience. A report from the United Nations on Wednesday put the economic value of lost international tourism at up to $3.3 trillion – assuming a one-year global standstill. That factors in not just tourism but the indirect effect on industries from agriculture to construction. The losses aren’t equally shared. The United States has most to lose – $187 billion even in a “moderate” four-month standstill. But Jamaica has furthest to fall, with an 11% loss of GDP. In the most severe scenario, the Caribbean island could lose almost half of its unskilled jobs, and Thailand one-third. In countries like the United States and China, some locals who would otherwise spend generously elsewhere will take trips at home, replacing some lost tourist business. Other countries can’t even rely on that consolation. Once again with Covid-19, it’s the most vulnerable that will be left holding the bag. (By John Foley) SIREN CALL. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak may have dodged a Richard Branson-shaped custard pie. In April the bearded billionaire predicted Virgin Atlantic would collapse without 500 million pounds of state support. Sunak remained unmoved. As Breakingviews argued, Branson needed to look harder down the back of his own sofa before calling on taxpayers. Fast-forward three months and the airline is digging itself out of its financial hole unaided, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. Virgin Atlantic may not be totally out of the woods. It’s getting up to 250 million pounds from new investors, while Branson is throwing in 200 million pounds funded by the sale of some of his Virgin Galactic space-tourism venture. That’s only slightly more than Virgin Atlantic’s 2018 salary bill. Even after 30% staff reductions and 550 million pounds of deferred payments and additional leeway from creditors, its financial future remains uncertain. Sunak’s help may yet be required. (By Ed Cropley) GLASS HALF EMPTY. Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane’s optimism that the UK economy is on course for a V-shaped recovery has been quickly countered by fellow rate-setter Jonathan Haskel. The latter on Wednesday warned of the risks of a deeper slowdown and cited worries about the outlook for the labour market. Granted, Haldane had a day earlier acknowledged the possibility of a negative feedback loop from higher unemployment to lower spending. But he preferred to stress survey evidence that supported a more positive dynamic that would see higher spending lead to lower unemployment. Different data suggests Haskel has more of a point. A furlough scheme has cushioned Britain’s labour market. But only one-sixth of UK workers exiting furlough are returning to work as normal, according to a Bank of America survey. The majority reported changes like layoffs, employers folding, or pay cuts. Optimism looks premature. (By Swaha Pattanaik) WAIST LIMIT. This may be as good as it gets for General Mills. The Progresso soup, Lucky Charms cereal, and Betty Crocker cake maker said revenue for the quarter ending May 31 increased 21% compared to the same period last year. Earnings surpassed analysts’ estimates according to Refinitiv figures. Stockpiling of food with a long shelf life helped sales of cereals like Cocoa Puffs. A desire for small treats boosted Haagen Dazs ice cream. And increased pet adoptions meant more demand for Blue Buffalo’s high-end recipes like fish and sweet potato. Yet General Mills decided not to give annual guidance, saying growth would depend on how long the pandemic lasts, which is uncertain. The implied subtext: People may not need – or want to eat – more stockpiled soup and frozen pizza when they can get out and about. The shares fell slightly, but are still up 17% for the year. Investors may feel stuffed with General Mills stock too. (By Robert Cyran) STATE SUPPORT. Lloyd’s of London is turning over every stone to find solutions for the next pandemic. The 334-year-old insurance market is working on a new breed of programmes – Restart Re and Recover Re – to allow insurers to spread the risk of protecting businesses for lost revenue due to sudden crises, like virus lockdowns. Pandemic catastrophe bonds are another option. There’s definitely a need for new solutions. Insurers’ refusal to pay out on business interruption cover after Covid-19 left many small companies in the lurch. The snag is that the cost of covering the risk of further lockdowns is hard to gauge, and likely extremely expensive. Catastrophe pandemic bonds sound good, but the market for such tools may be limited and insurance-linked securities can be unpredictable. Even Lloyd’s Chief Executive John Neal acknowledges that getting a large pandemic reinsurance programme off the ground will need governments to take a lot of the risk.

Sputtering oil demand and falling coal use mean energy-related carbon dioxide emissions may have already peaked in 2019, according to new research from Norwegian consultant DNV GL. Great: except it also points out that despite the virus-related drop in emissions this year, the same is needed every year to prevent global warming rising by a damaging 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The extra year of breathing space enabled by 2020’s 8% dip in emissions remains handy: it offsets the time wasted by the virus-related cancellation of this year’s COP26 conference, at which national emissions reductions targets were supposed to be nailed down. But it’s more and more obvious that a green post-Covid recovery is not just vital for the next decade, but for the next century. (By George Hay)"
4.353700309385411," General Mills sees more gains from crisis-led demand (Reuters) - General Mills Inc reported strong quarterly results on Wednesday and said it expected further boost to sales of its cereals and snacks for the rest of the year as people remain hunkered down in their homes due to coronavirus-related curbs. America’s largest supermarket chains have benefited as consumers rushed to fill their pantries and refrigerators during the outbreak. “Consumer concerns about COVID-19 virus transmission and the recession (will) drive elevated demand for food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels,” General Mills said. While several chains, including Kroger and Canada’s Loblaw Cos, have indicated future demand could take a hit as people begin to emerge from home confinement and businesses reopen, all of them booked benefits from panic buying in the quarter. General Mills also said demand in 2021 may be impacted by changes in the buying habits of people even as North America retail business, its biggest unit, recorded a 36% rise in quarterly sales. The company, however, did not provide a full-year outlook and said the elevated demand compared to pre-pandemic levels might force it to incur higher expenses. Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar said General Mills not providing the outlook even for the current quarter “could be a modest disappointment to investors, particularly in light of the strength in organic sales.” Shares of the company, which gained 15% this year, fell 1% in morning trading. Overall net sales climbed nearly 21% to $5.02 billion, beating market estimates of $4.97 billion, also driven by a 37% increase in pet food sales. Excluding items, the company earned $1.1 per share, above analysts’ expectation of $1.06 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

The company, which makes everything from Cheerios cereal and Blue Buffalo pet foods, also said it expects fourth-quarter organic net sales to increase by double-digits percentage, powered by strong growth in its North America retail and pet segments in March and April. General Mills already raised its earnings forecast for the year in March as consumers cooked more meals at home and stocked up on packaged and pet foods. However, with many states easing restrictions in the United States, General Mills said it expects trends to moderate in May but will still remain ahead of pre-coronavirus levels. It expects to exceed its previous forecast ranges of 1% to 2 % organic net sales growth, 4% to 6% rise in adjusted operating profit, and 6% to 8% growth in adjusted profit for fiscal 2020.

7.880305525324176," Cheerios maker General Mills forecasts coronavirus boost to profit (Reuters) - General Mills Inc GIS.N on Wednesday forecast a boost to its earnings this year as consumers stock up on its cereals, frozen foods and pet food in the face of the global coronavirus pandemic. The company, whose products such as Cheerios cereals and Yoplait yogurt are sold at supermarket chains, said the pandemic led to higher orders from retailers mainly in North America, Europe and Australia. The pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China in late December and spread quickly around the world, has locked down several cities, disrupted businesses and kept people largely indoors, raising fears of a recession. “It’s been so long since we had a recession and especially here in the U.S. But certainly, during that time, people tend to eat in more, and General Mills did quite well,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said on a post earnings call. “But that was a decade ago. We’ll see how it plays out this time.” The company said it now expects constant-currency adjusted profit per share in 2020 to rise 6% to 8%, compared with an earlier projection of an increase of 3% to 5%, citing higher demand for packaged goods. General Mills said the financial impact due to the coronavirus fallout was uncertain, but its new forecast surprised Wall Street analysts. “If not for COVID-19, sales guidance probably would have been reduced to the low end of the 1-2% range,” J.P.Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. Its ice cream brand Häagen-Dazs, however, suffered from store closures in China and lower traffic at outlets in Asia due to the quick spread of the flu-like virus. That forced the company to keep its organic net sales forecast intact. Harmening said on the call that the company expects short-term stock up demand to remain elevated in the current quarter and added that any decline in demand would happen in fiscal 2021. Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share in the third quarter that ended on Feb. 23, beating analysts’ expectation of 76 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, net sales slipped to $4.18 billion from $4.20 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $4.21 billion, as growth in pet food sales was not enough to cushion the blow from lower sales of cereal, yogurt and snacks in the United States. Shares of the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company were down nearly 2% amid a decline in the broader market. Through Tuesday’s close, they jumped about 22% this month."

19.133666530683968," U.N. report names 112 companies doing business with Israeli settlements GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations’ human rights office on Wednesday named 112 companies it said have business ties to Jewish settlements in the West Bank, angering Israel and prompting a Palestinian threat of legal action against the firms. A long-delayed report issued in Geneva said 94 of the companies were domiciled in Israel and 18 were listed in six other countries -- the United States, Britain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Thailand and France. A spokesman for Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the report was not a “blacklist” and was not intended to qualify any of the companies’ business activities as illegal. But it is a sensitive issue as companies named could be targeted for boycotts or divestment intended to put pressure on Israel over its settlements. Despite the spokesman’s remarks, they could now also face legal battles. “We demand the companies immediately close their headquarters and branches inside illegal Israeli settlements because their presence contradicts international and U.N. resolutions,” Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh wrote on his Facebook page. He said companies would be pursued through “international legal institutions and in courts in their countries for taking part in human rights violations in Palestine”. Palestinians could also demand compensation for “use of our occupied land illegally,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the report as the work of a “biased and uninfluential body.” “Instead of dealing with human rights, this body is trying to blacken Israel’s name. We reject any such attempt in the strongest terms and with disgust,” he said in a statement. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the report a “shameful capitulation” to anti-Israel groups. Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war. Palestinians and much of the world view the settlements as illegal under international law, but the United States and Israel dispute this. The United States in effect backed Israel’s right to build settlements on Nov. 18 last year by abandoning its long-held position that they were “inconsistent with international law”. A Middle East peace plan announced last month by U.S. President Donald Trump proposed allowing Israel to keep control of the West Bank settlements though the plan would also create a Palestinian state. Several hours after the report was issued, there was no reaction from the U.S. government. “HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS” The report was issued on the eve of the U.N. Human Rights Council’s main annual session opening in Geneva from Feb 24. Neither Israel nor the United States are members of the forum which both accuse of a bias against Israel. “I am conscious this issue has been, and will continue to be, highly contentious,” Bachelet said in a statement. Her office said the report “does not provide a legal characterization of the activities in question, or of business enterprises’ involvement in them.” One of the businesses named in the report, home-rental company Airbnb, had already acknowledged having listings in settlements and said last April that it would donate proceeds from any bookings in the territory to international humanitarian aid organizations. Another, Cheerios maker General Mills Inc, said it was listed because of a manufacturing facility that “uses natural resources, in particular water and land, for business purposes”. About 50% of the workers are Palestinians who enjoy full social benefits and “the facility has a history of continuing employment and employee satisfaction”, a General Mills spokesman said. Other businesses listed for inclusion in a database included travel firms and a steel producer. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

The company, which owns dessert pre-mix brand Betty Crocker and Nature Valley granola bars, has been struggling to boost sales of its snacks, cereals and yogurt in the U.S. as consumers move away from processed and sugary foods to healthier and cheaper store-branded options. In a bid to drive growth, General Mills is making a big push into the pet food market with last year’s purchase of Blue Buffalo Pet Products. The company also invested in marketing and launching new products such as Blueberry Cheerios, Peanut Butter Chex cereal and Cinnamon Toast Crunch Churros cereal. Those efforts helped drive a 7% rise in sales in pet foods business and a 1% growth in U.S. cereals division in the first quarter. However, its snacks as well as meals and baking businesses in the United States recorded a 1% drop in revenue. Sales from its North America retail unit, General Mills’ biggest business, were flat at $2.38 billion. “We know we still have room to improve, including some key categories like yogurt and snacks,” General Mills Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said in the post-earnings conference call. Sales in General Mills’ international markets also declined, partly hurt by a strong dollar and lower-than-expected sales in Brazil, India and China, its key emerging markets. Harmening, however, said the challenges related to distribution in India and retail inventory reduction in Brazil that the company faced in first quarter were largely over. Overall, company’s net sales slipped 2.2% to $4 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $4.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Consumers have been moving away from granola and snack bars, once a staple breakfast food, as they become more conscious of high sugar content in them. To counter slowing demand for packaged food, companies have been revamping and tweaking flavors and recipes to offer consumers healthier options. General Mills, which makes Cheerios and Chex Mix, unveiled versions of its yogurt brands in sea salt caramel and dark chocolate raspberry flavors. It also refreshed store displays. Still, sales of cereal and yogurt were flat in the quarter and that of snacks declined. “We are very focused and frankly not satisfied with the performance on both Nature Valley and Fiber One, and that’s really what we need to turn around in the coming year,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said. Last month, Harmening noted that Fiber One, which used to be a part of the diet of half the U.S. population, is now only 2%. The company said it would now focus on new variations of granola and snack bars, a strategy that has worked for yogurts. “Last year our new product innovation (for Nature Valley) wasn’t what we wanted it to be and we look to correct that this year,” Harmening said in an interview with Reuters. Organic net sales, which excludes revenue from acquisitions, fell 2% to $2.34 billion in the quarter for its North America retail segment - its lowest in nearly three years. For interactive graphic click link: tmsnrt.rs/2X7eHYt Net sales rose 7% to $4.16 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $4.24 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The rise was largely fueled by a 38% increase in sales of Blue Buffalo pet foods. The company bought Blue Buffalo last year to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on snack, cereal and yogurt businesses. It now expects Blue Buffalo’s net sales to grow between 8% and 10% in fiscal 2020. General Mills earned 83 cents per share, excluding one-time items, above the estimate of 77 cents."

Plaintiff Mounira Doss of Broward County, Florida alleged that trace amounts of glyphosate have been found in some Cheerios, but she failed to allege that the Cheerios she actually bought had the chemical, U.S. District Judge Robert Scola ruled on Friday. Even if her cereal had glyphosate in it, Doss does not allege that she ate it and thus did not establish that her health was harmed, Scola said.

12.944402955180953," Price hikes drive General Mills profit beat, forecast raise (Reuters) - Cheerios cereal maker General Mills Inc beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday, aided by price increases across a wide range of products, sending its shares to their highest in a year. The packaged goods industry has been battling surging freight and commodities costs all of last year as railroads and truck fleets hike rates, forcing them to pass on the additional costs to consumers. The burden of rising costs has been a double-whammy to the industry that has been struggling to turnaround and adapt to changing preferences as consumers move away from processed and sugary foods. While price hikes helped overturn three quarters of declining revenue at its North America Retail business, its biggest unit, it has partly hurt consumer demand for snacks and yogurts. Still the business brought in $2.52 billion in the quarter, benefiting from strong U.S. cereal sales, which the company called the “best category performance” in years. “The consumers are responding to innovation as well as our marketing, we’re actually quite encouraged about the (cereal) category,” Chief Financial Officer Donal Mulligan said on a post-earnings call. The company has also been cutting costs, changing the mix of products it sold and cashing in on its acquisition of pet food business, Blue Buffalo, to boost margins. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter rose 170 basis points to a better-than-expected 34.2 percent. “Our year-to-date performance and fourth-quarter plans give us confidence that we will meet or exceed all of our key fiscal 2019 targets,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said. Upbeat results from General Mills provide a silver lining for the packaged food industry which was rattled late last month when Kraft Heinz Co posted a quarterly loss and wrote down the value of Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. “In the minefield of packaged food stocks lately, where big misses, disappointments have almost become the norm, General Mills’ strong third quarter, profit guidance raise and constructive tone should send the stock up by a solid amount,” J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. The company said it expects adjusted profit for fiscal 2019 to be between flat and 1 percent from a prior forecast range of flat to down 3 percent. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 83 cents per share for the quarter ended Feb.24 and beat expectations of 69 cents. Its net sales rose 8 percent to $4.20 billion and was largely in line with expectations. Shares of the company rose as much as 4.8 percent to a year high of $49.50, with a Jefferies analyst saying the results did not have much for the bears."

24.021092967508867," General Mills second-quarter profit jumps on tighter costs, price hikes (Reuters) - General Mills Inc GIS.N reported a quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as the maker of Cheerios cereal raised prices and eked out higher margins from cost savings. Several consumer goods companies, emboldened by a strong U.S. economy, have raised prices this year to make up for rising commodities and transportation costs. Many, like General Mills, have also been trying to cut other expenses. General Mills shares, which have fallen about 38 percent since the start of the year, were up 6.6 percent at $39.11. “Results were better then feared. Consumer stocks have been beaten up quite harshly in recent weeks because of continued concerns about margins and growth,” Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. “If General Mills’ margin pressures had continued I think that would have added to worries for the industry,” Weissman said. Adjusted gross margin was 34.5 percent for the second quarter ended Nov. 25, beating the average estimate of 33.76 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. General Mills said its recent acquisition of the high-margin Blue Buffalo pet food company also drove margins. General Mills is typically the first U.S. packaged food company to issue a quarterly report, and its results often set the tone for the rest of the industry. ConAgra Brands Inc CAG.N is scheduled to post earnings on Thursday. “What’s changed over the last six months is we’re seeing about 2 percent price increases across the industry,” Chief Financial Officer Donal Mulligan told Reuters. Retailers have accepted higher prices because they too are seeing the same jump in costs for logistics, raw materials and labor, he said. “We continue to have a frugal mindset in spending,” Mulligan said. The company has been cutting costs across its supply chain - reassessing how and where it makes products as well as with what ingredients. Mulligan said the company was on track to save $450 million in expenses by the end of the fiscal year. General Mills, which also makes Yoplait yogurts and Nature Valley granola bars, earned 85 cents per share excluding items, 4 cents above the average analyst estimate. Net sales rose 5 percent to $4.41 billion, but missed the average estimate of $4.51 billion. Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $343.4 million, or 57 cents per share, from $430.5 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier."

-15.908378032002455," General Mills shares tumble as first-qtr sales, margins disappoint (Reuters) - Cheerios and Yoplait maker General Mills Inc GIS.N missed analysts' estimates for quarterly sales and margins on Tuesday, hurt by higher input costs and lower demand for its snacks and yogurts in the United States. The Minneapolis-based company's shares were down 7.9 percent, leading a 2.2 percent decline in the S&P 500 Packaged Food & Meats index .SPLRCFOOD. General Mills, which also owns the Nature Valley cereal bar and Annie’s yogurt brands, said sales in its U.S. snacks unit fell 4 percent, while yogurt sales declined 2 percent. The company’s stock has lost more than a fifth in value this year. “There was a bit of a step back in sales momentum so you’re seeing some of the bears jump on that and wondering if things aren’t progressing as well as we thought they were,” Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. The packaged goods industry has been battling surging freight and commodities costs all year as railroads and truck fleets hike rates. This hurt General Mills’ first-quarter adjusted gross margin, which fell 160 basis points to 33.6 percent in the quarter. Margins were also weighed down by a charge related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc. Analysts at J.P. Morgan called the results “less than ideal,” saying the company’s gross margin was far lower than expected. Some of the gross margin pressure will continue into the second quarter but is expected to ease off later in the year, helped by higher prices, better placement on shelves and more premium products, Chief Financial Officer Donal Mulligan said in an interview. Mulligan added that lower supply chain costs were also expected to help margins. “We came into this year knowing we were going to see higher inflation, like the rest of the industry and our retail partners,” Mulligan said. Rival cereal-maker Kellogg Co K.N said last month that transportation costs were up strong double digits and that this would be the case for the foreseeable future. Net income attributable to the company fell to $392.3 million, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 26. Excluding items, the company earned 71 cents per share, beating the analyst estimate of 64 cents. The company’s net sales rose nearly 9 percent to $4.09 billion, boosted by its acquisition of pet food company Blue Buffalo, but missed analysts’ estimates of $4.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

-3.8076671434463147," General Mills changing Nature Valley labels after lawsuit's pesticide claim (Reuters) - General Mills Inc GIS.N agreed to stop calling the oats in its Nature Valley granola bars 100 percent natural to settle a lawsuit by three consumer groups that said the bars contained small amounts of the pesticide commonly known as Roundup. Beyond Pesticides, Moms Across America and the Organic Consumers Association on Thursday said the settlement calls for General Mills to remove the phrase “Made with 100% Natural Whole Grain Oats” from Nature Valley labels. The groups said independent tests showed that the granola bars contained 0.45 parts per million of glyphosate, and that oats were the “most likely” source of the pesticide. While this was below the maximum 30 parts per million that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends, the groups said General Mills’ label was deceptive and that “no reasonable consumer” would expect the bars to contain anything unnatural. “Nature Valley is confident in the accuracy of its label,” General Mills spokesman Mike Siemienas said in an email. He said the Minneapolis-based company settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation, and focus on making Nature Valley products “with 100 percent whole grain oats.” The settlement came 13 days after a San Francisco jury ordered Monsanto Co to pay a school groundskeeper $289 million after he said his exposure to its Roundup weed killer and another glyphosate herbicide caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Bayer AG BAYGn.DE, which now owns Monsanto, has said it would appeal the jury's verdict. The General Mills lawsuit was one of many accusing food companies of using deceptive labels, including terms such as “natural” that do not have clearly understood meanings, to induce consumers to buy or pay more for their products. In July 2017, a Minneapolis federal judge dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit over General Mills’ “100% Natural” label, saying that even if the oats contained traces of glyphosate, “there is no allegation that the oats, themselves, are not natural.” A subsequent appeal was dismissed. The consumer groups had sued General Mills two years ago in Superior Court in Washington, D.C. The Organic Consumers Association sued Unilever Plc UNc.ASULVR.L in the same court on July 9 over its labeling for Ben & Jerry's ice cream, including a claim over the use of glyphosate."

Shares of the company, which also reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, were up nearly 2 percent in midday trading. General Mills, which also owns Häagen-Dazs and Betty Crocker brands, has been struggling to turn around its U.S. yogurt business as competitors such as Chobani and Danone DANO.PA unleash new flavors and healthier versions of yogurt. Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said he expects new launches, including yogurt with high protein and less sugar, to boost sales in 2019. As the company’s yogurt sales continue to fall, General Mills has relied on cereals and snack business to help prop up its top line.

-2.689107585208625," Barron's: General Mills stock may be a bargain after pet food deal (Reuters) - General Mills Inc's GIS.N stock could rise to 16 times earnings projections from the current 14 as its acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc starts to create growth, Barron's reported. General Mills shares, which closed on Friday at $43.41, have fallen 27 percent this year, but investors may be underestimating the value of the company's purchase of pet-food seller Blue Buffalo BUFF.O, making it an under-the-radar bargain, the newspaper reported. General Mills’ earnings growth has stalled, and its $8 billion price tag for Blue Buffalo in February was viewed by some analysts as too ambitious. Yet the deal could allow the Lucky Charms and Annie’s Macaroni and Cheese maker to expand niche brands into mainstream stores, a payoff investors might not fully appreciate, the paper said. Its earnings per share should see 7 percent compounded growth in the next four years, Barron’s added. General Mills announced the deal for Blue Buffalo on Feb. 23, expanding into a $30 billion pet-food market in a move seen as countering low demand for the sugary, preservative-filled items with which it is most often associated. Blue Buffalo’s shares traded just under $40 on Friday. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded General Mills to Baa2 on the announcement of the deal. Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale said at the time that “we like the strategic merit, but the price is steep and General Mills will have to work hard to extract value from the deal.”"
