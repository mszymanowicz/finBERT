-17.948715303097877," Hudbay vows appeal after court affirms Arizona project ruling (Reuters) - Hudbay Minerals on Tuesday vowed to appeal a court ruling that barred the Canadian miner from building a major copper mine in the United States after losing its bid to have a judge revisit the decision. U.S. District Judge James Soto late on Monday said there was no basis to reconsider an earlier ruling that overturned approvals for the company’s contentious Rosemont project in southeastern Arizona, delivering a setback for Hudbay as it seeks to revive plans for the stalled $1.9 billion open-pit mine. Hudbay’s director of investor relations, Candace Brule, said the company was disappointed with the decision and would proceed with an appeal as it studies next steps for the project. “This ruling confirms that the court continues to misinterpret decades of precedent and the federal regulations and mining laws that govern the Rosemont project,” she said. At issue is the validity of mining claims that would allow the company to dispose of mine waste on public lands adjacent to its operations. The U.S. District Court for Arizona in July overturned approvals issued by the U.S. Forest Service for the mine, siding with environmental and tribal groups opposed to the plan. Hudbay in August said it would appeal that ruling but it first asked the court to reconsider the decision on grounds it overstepped its authority. However, Soto said there was no basis to reopen the case, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters. “Mere disagreement with a previous order is an insufficient basis for reconsideration,” the judge wrote. Hudbay had planned to start construction of Rosemont by the end of this year, with first production expected by the end of 2022."
0.24011332332508759," Hudbay shares slump 18% after court bars construction at Arizona project TORONTO (Reuters) - Hudbay Minerals HBM.TO shares plunged more than 20% on Thursday after a court ruling barred the company from proceeding with construction at one of its biggest copper projects in the U.S. The U.S. District Court for Arizona on Wednesday challenged the U.S. Forest Service’s June 2017 decision that enabled the company to advance its plans for its Rosemont project. Hudbay shares sank 18.4% in morning trading, after earlier falling as much as 24.8% to C$5.08 in Toronto. The company said on Thursday it plans to appeal the ruling. “We are extremely disappointed with the Court’s decision. We strongly believe that the project conforms to federal laws and regulations that have been in place for decades,” Hudbay’s interim Chief Executive Officer Peter Kukielski said in a statement. Following the 2017 decision, Hudbay received a water permit and approval of its mine plan for Rosemont in March, allowing it to move forward with development. The company had planned to begin construction of Rosemont by the end of this year, paving the way for first production from the mine by the end of 2022. Those plans led opponents, including local tribes and environmental groups to turn to the courts to prevent Hudbay from starting work on the project, saying it would cause “irreparable harm” to the area, the Arizona Daily Star reported in May. “We caution investors of near-term turbulence given today’s Rosemont news in addition to the Company’s recent Management change,” analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note. “Finding a joint venture partner at this time to de-risk the Rosemont project will likely be delayed as well.” Bloomberg reported in May that Hudbay was preparing to sell a 30% stake in the project. Hudbay said last month CEO Alan Hair had stepped down, with recently elected board director Kukielski taking over as his temporary replacement. Kukielski, backed by private equity firm Waterton Global Resource Management, was elected to the board following the settlement of a protracted proxy fight between Hudbay and the activist investor, who had demanded changes to the company’s board and management."

-31.70892557474485," UPDATE 3-CEO at Canadian miner Hudbay steps down, industry veteran steps in (Adds analyst comment in 6th paragraph, share prices in 9th paragraph) July 10 (Reuters) - Canada’s Hudbay Minerals Inc said on Wednesday that Chief Executive Officer Alan Hair has stepped down after more than 20 years with the company and named Peter Kukielski, who was backed by its second largest investor in a proxy battle, as interim CEO. As part of its proxy fight, private equity firm Waterton Global Resource Management had nominated five directors to the company’s board. Three of them, including Kukielski, were elected in May following a settlement that ended the drawn-out battle. Much of Waterton’s ire surrounded Hudbay’s reported talks to buy Chile’s Mantos Copper for about $780 million last year and what it described as an erosion of shareholder returns under its management and board. Bloomberg reported Hudbay’s discussions to buy Mantos mine in October, but the company did not confirm the talks. Although Waterton, which held a 12.09% stake in the company as of May 3, eventually dropped its call for Hair to be replaced by Kukielski, his appointment as interim CEO is a win of sorts for the activist shareholder. “While Mr. Kukielski has been named as interim CEO and a search for a permanent CEO has been launched, there is the possibility that Mr. Kukielski could ultimately be named permanent CEO,” analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note. “Nothwithstanding Mr. Kukielski’s role with Hudbay, an incoming CEO is likely to make changes to the senior team at the company,” they added. Shares of Hudbay have risen nearly 19% during Hair’s tenure as CEO, which started in 2016 after a four-year stint as chief operating officer. The S&P/TSX Global Gold index soared 68% in that time. The company said Hair’s departure does not affect its strategic or financial outlook. Hudbay does not have a time frame for naming a permanent CEO, a spokesman told Reuters. Hudbay shares rose 3.5% to C$6.50 in morning trade in Toronto, compared with a 0.7% gain in the S&P/TSX Global Gold index. “I think the sudden nature in which he stepped down would come as a surprise ... ” National Bank Financial analyst Shane Nagle said. Kukielski most recently served as CEO of Canadian miner Nevsun Resources, which was bought by China’s Zijin Mining Group Co Ltd in a C$1.86 billion deal. The companies said in May that Hudbay would also seek a successor to Chairman Alan Hibben following its shareholder meeting that month. Hibben will remain on the board until the 2020 shareholder meeting, they said. (Reporting by Nichola Saminather in Toronto and Debroop Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Jeffrey Benkoe)"

Hudbay last week settled a board battle with its second largest shareholder, Waterton, to elect a slate of 11 board members that includes some of the nominees proposed by both parties.

The agreement settles a proxy contest with the private equity firm, which nominated five directors to the Canadian miner’s board, two of whom the company accepted before one dropped out. Hudbay shares rose 2.1 percent to C$8.78 in early trading in Toronto, compared with the Toronto stock benchmark’s 0.25 percent gain. “We are not overly surprised as we had assumed that the Board would see only a minor change as a result of Waterton’s efforts,” Mark Llanes, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note. “Overall, we view this settlement positively.” The 11 directors include Chair Alan Hibben and current director Igor Gonzales, whom Waterton had sought to replace, and Waterton nominees Peter Kukielski and Daniel Muniz Quintanilla. The rest, including Chief Executive Alan Hair and David Smith, a Waterton nominee whom Hudbay had already accepted, had not been in dispute. Only votes on the agreed-upon nominees will be considered at Hudbay’s annual shareholder meeting on May 7, the company said. Both companies have also agreed to look for a successor as chair to Hibben following the meeting. After Hibben steps down as chair, he will remain on the board until the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders.

-31.9946558195517," Investor Waterton files suit against Canadian miner Hudbay to stop it soliciting proxies (Reuters) - Private equity firm Waterton Global Resource Management has filed a lawsuit against Canadian miner Hudbay Minerals Inc in a bid to stop it from soliciting proxies for its annual shareholder meeting in May. The lawsuit, filed at the Ontario Superior Court on Monday, escalates tensions between Toronto-based Hudbay and Waterton, which has blamed Hudbay’s management for “abysmal” shareholder returns and “chronic underperformance,” and has proposed five new independent board members, two of whom Hudbay has accepted. Hudbay disclosed Waterton’s legal action in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Waterton, which says it owns 12 percent of Hudbay, alleges in court documents there are misrepresentations in Hudbay’s management circular for an upcoming May 7 annual shareholder meeting. “Hudbay believes the litigation is frivolous and will vigorously defend itself,” the miner said, adding it will seek to recover its legal costs from Waterton. Hudbay shares were up 3.1 percent at C$10.08 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, erasing much of a 4.1 percent loss from Monday. The benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index retreated 2.1 percent on Tuesday. Much of Waterton’s ire against Hudbay surrounds alleged talks the company had to acquire Chile’s Mantos Copper for about $780 million last year, which Bloomberg reported in October. Hudbay never confirmed the talks and appeared not to be advancing a deal. But its information circular makes “material omissions” relating to its pursuit of Mantos, Waterton said in the court documents. Waterton alleges this information would “materially affect (shareholders’) votes at the meeting as it goes directly to the judgment of the board they’re being asked to vote on.” Waterton took issue with several of Hudbay’s claims about the private equity firm, including that Waterton made 60 percent of its share purchases after driving the miner’s share price down, as well as regarding the track record of several of its investments and comments about one of its board nominees. In a separate letter to investors on Monday, Waterton also said Hudbay’s acceptance of two of its proposed board members to an expanded 11-member board “does not constitute the level of change that is desperately needed,” and urged shareholders to vote for its five board nominees."
