For the full year through March, Mizuho revised its profit forecast to 350 billion yen from 320 billion yen, compared with the 363.2 billion yen average estimate of 13 analysts compiled by Refinitiv. Mizuho reported its half-year net profit fell 25% due partly to rising credit-related costs amid the pandemic. April-September profit was 215.5 billion yen ($2.05 billion) compared with 287.7 billion yen in the same period a year earlier. While Mizuho had estimated 200 billion yen of credit-related costs for the current financial year, it booked 81.2 billion yen of the costs for the first six months through September. Japanese banks have been struggling with ultra-low interest rates for years, and the three major lenders - Mizuho, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc - have said credit-related costs this year would reach levels not seen since the global financial crisis. As the outbreak has pushed companies to borrow money from banks, Mizuho’s net interest income came in at 440 billion yen for the six months, a 16.9% rise from a year earlier. Mizuho is also open to mezzanine financing such as subordinated debt and preferred stocks, with such financing requests reaching more than 1 trillion yen so far, the chief executive of Mizuho Bank Koji Fujiwara had told Reuters.

7.086614173228353," Japan's Mizuho to introduce shorter work week in response to coronavirus TOKYO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group Inc aims to give employees the option of a shorter working week as it seeks to boost flexibility during the coronavirus pandemic, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. Chief Executive Officer Tatsufumi Sakai made the comments on Tuesday at a symposium organized by the Nikkei, she said. Mizuho, Japan’s third-largest lender by assets, will give about 45,000 employees the option to work three or four days a week, the spokeswoman said. It aims to make the option available from December after holding talks with its labour union. It comes as firms in Japan, known for a strong work ethic and long working hours, have sought to give employees more flexibility during the pandemic, according to a Reuters poll in August. “We are strengthening the system (for flexible working) so that employees will be able to work more autonomously,” said the spokeswoman. Under the new system, employees who work three days would get 60% of their current salary and those who opt for four days would earn 80% of their income, she added. But employees can still opt to stick to five working days. Mizuho has allowed more employees to work remotely since April, building on last year’s push towards more flexible working. Mizuho last October began to allow employees to engage in side businesses and to take leave to study abroad. In April, the brokerage arm of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc introduced a three-day work week. (Reporting by Takashi Umekawa Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa)"

The motion received more than a third of the votes submitted but needed two-thirds to be binding on management.

Mizuho’s board opposed the motion, which required a two-thirds majority to pass, arguing that the bank already had metrics to measure its efforts towards meeting Paris Agreement goals. The climate motion received nearly 35% of the votes submitted, Kiko Network said by email, surprising some in the activist community who had expected a far smaller figure. A Mizuho spokeswoman said the result was based on votes submitted before the meeting and the final tally was not yet available but would not change the result. “For the first climate shareholder resolution in Japan to receive more than a third of the vote, even though it didn’t pass, sends a strong signal to Mizuho: exit all coal finance immediately,” said Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at MP Pension, one of the fund managers supporting the proposal.

2.6717557251908333," Japan's Mizuho says virus-related loan requests have reached $155 billion TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group Inc 8411.T has seen coronavirus-related loan requests reach 17 trillion yen ($155 billion) since the outbreak, and is bracing for further demand from companies battling to revive their operations, its chief executive said. The figure underscores the corporate impact of restrictions on movement and business imposed by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 18,000 people in Japan and killed almost 1,000. Since the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Japan in January, 225 companies have gone bankrupt as of Monday, showed data from Tokyo Shoko Research. “As clients face liquidity problems, we will help with financing as appropriate,” Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai said in an interview last week for publication on Wednesday. “But later, the problem may change from liquidity to solvency. At that stage, companies will need capital buffers to continue business.” Japan’s third-largest lender said it has extended 10 trillion yen in loans and credit lines from requests it deemed virus-related based on discussions with the clients. To support clients’ capital positions, Mizuho has secured over 100 billion yen for so-called mezzanine financing, such as subordinated debt and preferred stocks, Sakai said. But banks themselves also expect a difficult year. Mizuho estimates 200 billion yen worth of credit-related costs in the year through March 2021, whereas bigger rivals Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 8306.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc 8316.T expect 450 billion yen. “We can’t afford to lend to companies that are likely to turn into zombies,” said Sakai. “The crisis won’t be easy to overcome. It’s crucial for us and our clients to rebuild with an eye toward the post-coronavirus world.”"

12.227074235807851," Mizuho to stop lending to new coal power projects TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group will stop financing new coal power projects and end all loans for coal by 2050, bowing to pressure from a group of leading investors for climate concessions ahead of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in June. The policy change leaves Japan’s third-biggest bank by assets plenty of wriggle room on lending to projects planned or under construction, while the 2050 cutoff was dismissed by activists as too late for an exit from the dirtiest fossil fuel. Mizuho, among the world’s biggest lender to coal power plant developers, said in a statement on Wednesday it would cut its outstanding balance of 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) in loans to coal power projects as of March this year in half by 2030 and reduce it to zero by 2050. A shareholder resolution sent to Mizuho management last month calls on the bank to outline a plan and set targets so that its business practices are more in line with the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change. It was the first time a publicly traded Japanese company had been sent a shareholder climate change resolution. The resolution was sponsored by Kiko Network, a Japanese activist group that focuses on coal and also hold shares in Mizuho. “Climate change is one of the most important global issues that can affect financial market stability,” Mizuho said. “Responding to the environment and climate change is a key issue in our business strategy.” Kiko Network’s international director Kimiko Hirata welcomed the move but questioned the exceptions that would allow some projects to go ahead. “I hope they will stick to a basic policy and stop all coal financing,” Hirata said, adding: “Coal power needs to be phased out before the 2040s globally. That means reaching zero by 2050 is too late.” Climate campaigners have recently focused on Mizuho, including with a full-page advert in the Financial Times in March calling on the bank to exit coal financing. Japanese banks are among the few major lenders who have stuck to backing coal projects even as others such as JPMorgan have cut lending to the business. Mizuho is the world’s third-biggest lender to coal power and mining over the last five years, according to Refinitiv SDC Platinum data. Japan’s two other biggest banks - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group - are also in the top five. Yet pressure on Japanese banks may be working. A source at Sumitomo Mitsui told Reuters its banking unit would change its financing guidance to one of not lending to coal-fired power plants in principle. A Sumitomo Mitsui spokesman said the bank is considering updating its policies “based on international circumstances and revision of the guidelines” on disclosing climate risks. Investment funds with nearly $200 billion in assets and holding shares in Mizuho said last month they would back the Kiko Network motion. “This new coal restriction policy is an important and valuable move by Mizuho which other banks, insurers and financiers in Japan will surely follow, as the tide turns further away from extremely risky coal projects,” Jeanett Bergan, head of responsible investment at KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund and life insurance company, told Reuters."

6.55021834061135," Japan's Mizuho sees appetite for 'virtual' AGMs in coronavirus era TOKYO, April 8 (Reuters) - More Japanese companies are interested in holding annual general meetings online due to the coronavirus outbreak, presenting an opportunity for banks that help organise them, the head of Mizuho Financial Group Inc’s trust banking arm said. Japan on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to stem the spread of the coronavirus in major urban areas including Tokyo, giving authorities more power to press people to stay at home and businesses to close. While the state of emergency is due to last a month, it is unclear how long Japan - like other countries around the world - will have to hunker down and avoid public gatherings. Most Japanese companies are due to hold their annual general meetings (AGM) in June. “We have already received orders from more than ten companies to hold ‘virtual’ AGMs in June,” said Kei Umeda, who took over as the chief executive of Mizuho Trust and Banking on April 1. He said the requests for livestreamed meetings were mainly coming from larger companies. Trust banks are specialist lenders whose offerings typically include asset management and real estate services as well as advisory services, including helping firms prepare for AGMs. “We are building up the manpower to meet such needs as we expect the number of requests will increase,” Umeda said in an interview with Reuters that was embargoed for release on Wednesday. Under existing regulations, companies have to set up a venue for an AGM and cannot restrict entry to any shareholders who want to attend. The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, however, have recently said companies can now use smaller venues and limit numbers if their aim is to prevent coronavirus infection. They also said it would be possible to hold an AGM without any shareholders physically present. Through the service, Mizuho provides a livestream of the AGM, and shareholders can vote on proposals online ahead of the meeting. Due to regulations, shareholders are not allowed to vote realtime online or propose motions. Umeda said it would be better if more flexible legislation would be introduced to allow that.

Mizuho's weaker performance underscores its growing divide with bigger lenders Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 8306.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group 8316.T. MUFG reported a 6.3% drop in first-half profit this week and SMFG an 8.6% decline. The three banks have a total of $6.6 trillion in assets, according to Refinitiv data, bigger than the economies of Germany and India combined. While they have been punished by years of negative interest rates and a declining population at home, MUFG and SMFG have both ventured outside Japan to mitigate the pain, investing in Asian commercial banks. Only Mizuho has stayed largely focused on the weakening domestic market. It has said it would aim to increase its annual net business profit by 50% in five years through a combination of revenue growth and cost cutting. “The earnings target will be difficult to achieve because it will be hard to grow revenue by as much as Mizuho aims in just a few years, although the cost reduction goal is achievable,” analyst Tetsuya Yamamoto of Moody’s said in a note. The outlook remains grim for Japanese banks, given that Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last month gave the strongest signal to date that interest rates could be cut further. Kuroda said the central bank still had room to take already negative rates even lower to help the world’s third-largest economy. Japanese bankers have warned that further rate cuts would mean more damage to their earnings. An interest-rate decline of 10 basis points would translate into a loss of 30 billion yen ($275 million) in revenue, SMFG Chief Executive Jun Ohta said on Wednesday.

-2.280130293159604," BOJ should tread carefully when deliberating deeper cuts, Mizuho Bank head says TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) needs to be careful when deciding whether to deepen negative rates, the head of Mizuho Bank said, adding the contentious issue of charging account maintenance fees should be seen as separate from monetary policy. Like its rivals, the main unit of Mizuho Financial Group 8411.T, Japan's third-largest lender by assets, has struggled with years of near-zero rates, a dwindling population and a dearth of corporate fund demand. “I want the BOJ to be wary when deciding whether it will deepen negative interest rates,” Koji Fujiwara, Mizuho Bank’s president, told Reuters in an interview last week that was embargoed for release on Wednesday. Such a move could ultimately be damaging to Japan’s “economic lifeblood” if it hinders financial firms, he said. The central bank will hold next policy meeting on Oct. 30-31. On Tuesday, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would not hesitate to take additional easing steps if risks to the economy grow and threaten momentum towards its 2% inflation target. There has been speculation that Japan’s banks might start charging fees for account holders if the central bank deepens negative interest rates and puts more pressure on banks’ profits. Fujiwara, however, said that the idea should not be directly linked with monetary policy. While nothing had been decided about the fees, he said, the bank was as a stage where it should develop its pricing strategy “as a whole”. That comes after the bank recently said it would raise transfer fees from March 2020 for customers using ATMs and telephone. As the domestic market is expected to shrink, Mizuho's bigger competitors such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 8306.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group 8316.T have aggressively tapped into Asia by investing in local commercial banks. While Mizuho looks at the growing market, it will possibly consider another approach: business tie-ups with non-financial firms. Earlier this year, Mizuho agreed with Japanese messaging app operator Line Corp 3938.T to establish a new bank, aiming to take in Line's vast platform which has more than 80 million monthly active users. “When it comes to expanding business into Asia, it has often meant acquiring a financial firm. But in the future, a business partnership with non-financial company will be one of our options,” said Fujiwara."

Japan’s third-largest lender by assets reported April-June profit of 162.4 billion yen ($1.50 billion) compared to 161 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.

6.884057971014508," Japan's Mizuho aims to build warchest for Asia fintech investment TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group aims to build a warchest of several billion dollars in the next five years to target financial technology in Asia, its chief said, as the Japanese megabank looks to chart a different path from its bigger rivals. Mizuho is fighting to right its business after posting an 83% plunge in net profit in the last financial year, hit by impairment losses on fixed assets and an overhaul of its securities portfolio. Once Japan’s second-largest lender by assets, Mizuho has been recently eclipsed by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG). Its market value is down by a third in a little over a decade and it has largely stayed on the sidelines as top megabank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, in particular, has been more aggressive overseas. “I have an image that we will be able to have several billion dollars for investment,” chief executive Tatsufumi Sakai said in an interview with Reuters last week that was embargoed for release on Tuesday. “I would positively consider digital businesses if there are opportunities in Asia,” he said, adding he was not interested in investing in a traditional banking business overseas. Mizuho has already made some forays into the digital space. In 2016 it jointly founded online credit scorer J.Score Co with SoftBank Corp. Last year, it agreed with Line, the dominant messenger app in Japan, to launch a smartphone-focused bank, aiming to start its operation in fiscal 2020. But aggressive expansion appears unlikely. Under a mid-term plan that was unveiled last month, Mizuho is looking to boost a key measure of capital strength, its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, to more than 9% from 8.2% in fiscal 2018. As it stands, Mizuho’s ratio is the weakest among the Japanese megabanks with SMFG boasting 10.3% and MUFG at 11.4%. Mizuho is also aiming for a group net profit of 900 billion yen ($8.31 billion) by 2023 versus 408 billion yen in fiscal 2018. MUFG and SMFG each reported more than 1 trillion yen of group net profit in the year ended in March, while Mizuho fell well behind them in profitability. Undeterred, Sakai said the bank would walk its own path. “We are not chasing them,” he said."
2.8368794326241162," Japanese bank Mizuho to tighten financing norm for coal-fired plants TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group Inc said on Wednesday it will tighten its financing policy for coal-fired power projects from July 1 to help tackle global climate change issues. Mizuho, Japan’s No.2 bank by assets, will provide financing to coal-fired power projects in line with international guidelines and only to highly efficient ultra-super critical (USC) plants or those using more advanced technology, it said in a revised sustainability policy. The new policy will exclude the projects for which the bank has made plans to provide support before July 1, it said. It could also make exceptions for the projects using lower-efficient technology than USC as long as they comply with international guidance such as OECD agreement, a company spokeswoman said. In an original policy issued a year ago, Mizuho said it would provide financing to coal-fired power projects after verifying the technological efficiency and economic rationality. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said last week that it will no longer provide financing for new coal-fired power generation projects after July 1."
-2.960526315789469," Profits fall at Japan's top three banks as economy slows TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s three largest banks all reported lower annual profits on Wednesday, highlighting the challenges faced by the banking industry as the world’s third-largest economy looks to be headed for another downturn. The size of the declines varied - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group had a 1% drop while rival Mizuho reported an 83% dive - all three show the difficulty banks have in navigating Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy. Japanese banks have had to cope for years with an ageing and shrinking population and massive central bank stimulus that has left them with razor-thin profit margins. Now, there are signs of economic weakness on the horizon. A government assessment this week showed Japan may already be in recession due to the impact of a U.S.-China trade war and weak external demand. That is likely to drive up bad debt costs for banks as more loans go sour. “Our core profit fell for a fourth straight year. We had expected this, but the environment is very tough,” Kantesugu Mike, the chief executive of top lender Mitusbishi UFJ Financial Group, told a briefing. MUFG, one of the world’s largest banks by assets, reported a 12 percent slide in annual net profit, reflecting the squeeze on lending margins. The bank was also hit by a one-time charge from suspending development of a new system at a credit unit, reflecting increased competition from cashless services. Mizuho, Japan’s second-largest bank by assets, reported an 83% percent decline in net profit, to 96.6 billion yen ($884 million), in the year through March 2019. That marked its weakest performance since the global financial crisis when the bank made a loss. The result was widely expected after Mizuho cut its outlook for the year two months ago. Mizuho said it was hit by the cost of closing domestic branches and restructuring its securities portfolio. “The restructuring costs that the bank incurred in its domestic retail business highlight the challenges that Japanese banks face in keeping their retail businesses profitable amid an aging and shrinking population, and given the persistent ultra-low domestic interest rates,” analyst Tetsuya Yamamoto of Moody’s said in a note about Mizuho. Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s third-largest bank by assets, reported a 727 billion yen net profit for the year just ended from 734 billion yen in the previous year. For the year ending March 2020, SMFG forecast profit of 700 billion yen, down nearly 4 percent from the year just ended. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Wednesday said he was not considering additional easing right now but would consider it without hesitation if consumer prices lost momentum. “We have decided we should be prepared for a certain amount of credit costs for this year,” Mizuho Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai told a news conference, referring to money put aside to cover bad loans. Mizuho also announced a five-year business plan saying it needed to be able to respond quickly to structural changes, including Japan’s low birthrate and the industry’s increased use of technology. It said it would target consolidated net profit of 900 billion yen by 2023."

-8.580858085808575," Japan's Mizuho slashes profit outlook, hit by $6 billion restructuring costs TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group slashed its full-year profit outlook by 86 percent, citing one-time restructuring costs of 680 billion yen ($6 billion) at its bank and brokerage units and an overhaul of its securities portfolio. Japan’s second-largest bank by assets said it expects 80 billion yen in net income for the business year ending March 31, instead of 570 billion yen it had predicted earlier. Mizuho said it would book about 500 billion yen of impairment losses on fixed assets, including costs from closing retail branches at home and software-related expenses. It will also book 180 billion yen of losses to restructure its securities portfolio of foreign bonds. “Mizuho Financial Group’s profit warning highlights the key risks facing Japanese banks,” said Tetsuya Yamamoto of ratings agency Moody’s in emailed comments, adding the restructuring costs for the domestic business suggests bank branches are no longer valuable assets. “All of these losses indicate Mizuho’s efforts in eliminating structural issues in order to reduce future downside risk. Other Japanese banks will also face losses if they take similar actions.” Mizuho, like its rivals, has been accelerating cost-cutting as it grapples with the ultra-low interest rates and a declining population at home. In 2017, the bank said it would cut one-quarter of its workforce, or 19,000 positions, over a decade by scaling back hires. It has also said it would close about 100 of its 500 domestic branches by 2025. But unlike its rivals, Mizuho has been dogged by a series of system troubles, for more than a decade. It had a costly “fat-finger” keyboard error at its securities arm in 2005 and suffered a breakdown at its ATMs after a devastating earthquake hit Japan in 2011. Mizuho’s online brokerage platform crashed last year, forcing a suspension of trading for 2-1/2 days. Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai told a media briefing that with the impairments losses announced on Wednesday, restructuring costs related to branch closures have completed. Most of the impairment costs are associated with the banking group’s network, Sakai said. “Amid growing uncertainty in financial markets ... the company will implement the restructuring of its securities portfolio in respect of past investment in foreign bonds,” Mizuho said in a statement. The announcements on the slashed profit outlook and the impairment costs came after Tokyo’s stock market closed for the day. Mizuho shares have delivered a total return of only 0.14 percent over the last five years, underperforming rivals Mitsubishi UFJ, which has returned nearly 12 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui, with around 2 percent."

The low-key book lover represented a sharp contrast with Yasuhiro Sato, his bold, charismatic predecessor, who was vocal about his ambitions for Japan’s second-largest lender but presided over a sharp decline during the last three years. Sakai wasn’t considered a favourite for the top job. But now that he has it, he is coming to grips with the scale of the turnaround needed for Mizuho, which has the best blue-chip corporate client base in Japan but worst profits among the country’s three megabanks. “My biggest mission is to improve profitability in terms of both revenues and costs.

-6.798866855524073," Japan's Mizuho to take on more lending risk to arrest decline in profitability: CEO TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group Inc 8411.T will shed its conservative approach to lending and take on greater risk at home and abroad, its new chief executive told Reuters, as Japan's second-largest bank by assets looks to reverse its falling profitability. Mizuho is the least profitable of Japan's three mega-banks. Unlike peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 8306.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc 8316.T, Mizuho has not splurged abroad in search of growth to offset stagnation at home where aggressive central bank policy eats into lending income. One criticism analysts often level at Mizuho is an apparent focus on large, blue-chip firms which have a very low chance of defaulting on loan repayments and so are able to borrow cheaply - something which also makes them not very profitable customers. Tatsufumi Sakai, who assumed his role in April, said Mizuho must change its risk-averse culture to improve profitability. “We are taking various measures to improve our risk-taking capabilities,” Sakai said in an interview. “For instance, we are making conscious efforts in the overseas non-investment grade field, where we had a tendency to seek safety and avoid errors.” Mizuho’s domestic loan-deposit rate margin - the difference between interest earned from loans and paid for deposits - was 0.84 percent for October-March, compared with 0.97 percent at SMFG. It was 1.24 percent five years earlier, just before the central bank began a policy aimed at reducing lending costs. Under another initiative, Sakai, 58, said credit officers responsible for screening loans are being embedded with each business unit rather than grouped in an independent department, to make the whole process of lending more responsive to clients. “We cannot help customers when they really need it by just playing safe,” said Sakai, a career Mizuho banker. On expanding abroad, Sakai said Mizuho is unlikely to buy a full-service bank catering to both retail and business clients, such as MUFG target PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk BDMN.JK. “Basically, our global business is ‘B2B’ (business to business) and it’s our priority to sharpen our edge there,” he said. “We won’t try to enter B2C (business to consumer) in a single big deal.” Rather, he said Mizuho is more likely to invest in or buy financial technology (fintech) start-up companies, for which the bank has a dedicated private equity fund. Traditional financial institutions have been investing in fintech research and start-ups in anticipation of nimbler, innovative rivals attracting younger generations with cheaper, easier-to-use services in areas such as lending and remittance. “For us, it’s important from the viewpoint of buying seeds for technology and business. It won’t cost much anyway,” Sakai said."

0.0," UPDATE 1-Japan's Mizuho Q1 net up 36 pct, keeps full-year forecast * Q1 net profit Y161 bln vs Y118.3 bln a year earlier * Mizuho suffered sharp profit fall last year * Recovery in fee-generating businesses leads profit growth (Recasts, adds information) TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group said on Tuesday net profit rose 36 percent for its first quarter ended in June, boosted by a sharp recovery in banking business at home and overseas after a particularly weak year. Japan’s second-largest lender by assets and its domestic rivals have suffered from an ultra-low interest rate environment as part of the Bank of Japan’s aggressive easing of monetary policy, launched five years ago. The least profitable of Japan’s three biggest banks, Mizuho booked a sharp fall in profit in the last financial year, hurt by decline in bond trading gains. This sets the bar lower for year-on-year profit comparisons than its rivals. Mizuho said net profit came in at 161 billion yen ($1.45 billion) for the April-June period, up from 118.3 billion a year earlier. A sharp recovery in the first quarter was propelled by growth in fee-generating businesses such as trade finance, the bank said, adding that non-interest income rose 15 percent to 219 billion. Its domestic lending business remains tepid, however. Its loan-and-deposit rate margin, or the difference between the interest it earns on loans and what it pays for deposits, fell to 0.83 percent from 0.87 a year earlier. Mizuho’s bottomline was also helped by gains from clawing back past provisions made for potential bad loans after borrowers’ credit quality improved. It also booked profit from selling stocks of corporate clients held to cement business ties, a practice that faces growing criticism for hindering Japan’s corporate governance. For the full year through March, Mizuho kept its own forecast of 570 billion yen in net profit, down 1.1 percent from the previous year, but above an average estimate of 537.3 billion in a poll of 13 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On Monday, No. 3 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) reported a 6 percent drop in quarterly net profit, as bigger tax bills offset benefits from cost-cutting measures and smaller bad loan losses. No. 1 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is due to announce first quarter results later this week. Mizuho’s results reflect Japanese banks’ efforts to reduce the impact of diminishing returns from domestic loans by ramping up overseas operations and fee-based businesses. But in a clear sign that investors still see the lenders’ fortunes as closely tied to the central bank’s monetary policy, bank shares gyrated on the day of the BOJ announcement. Mizuho shares ended down 2.5 percent, outstripping a fall of 0.8 percent in the benchmark TOPIX index, despite having recovered early losses to enter positive territory immediately after the BOJ tweaked monetary policy.

Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) 8306.T, will halt all Iran transactions to comply with the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran later this year, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday. The banking unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc 8411.T said later on Thursday it would take the same action. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) 8316.T will carefully consider its response in compliance with the law and based on U.S. sanctions, it said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The move by MUFG is likely force a halt in Iranian crude oil purchases by Japanese companies as its banking unit handles the bulk of those imports, industry sources have told Reuters. The bank was fined hundreds of millions of dollars in 2014 for misleading U.S. regulators about its transactions with sanctioned countries including Iran. “The bank is afraid of U.S. sanctions, so cannot handle trade transactions. Other Japanese banks are likely to be in the same position,” said a Japanese analyst who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Trump in May withdrew the United States from a multi-party deal on Iran’s nuclear program and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the 2015 agreement. Washington later told countries to stop buying Iran’s crude oil, that nation’s most important export item, by Nov. 4 or face financial consequences. Japan is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude but the country’s oil refiners have said they may have to stop loading Iranian crude oil from October if they cannot get an exemption from U.S. sanctions to allow imports to continue. Beyond oil, trade between Japan and Iran is minimal. MUFG Bank Ltd [MTFGTU.UL] has informed customers in Japan about its decision, given that dealings with Iranian financial institutions will be prohibited after a 180-day wind-down period, which ends on Nov. 4, the document showed. MUFG may revise its policy should additional guidance be given by the United States, the bank said in the document. MUFG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Japan’s third-largest lender by market valuation said profit totalled 576.5 billion yen ($5.24 billion), versus 603.5 billion yen a year earlier. It was the smallest profit in five years. The result compared with the 559.6 billion yen average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Japanese banks have been suffering diminishing returns from loans to both retail and corporate customers due in part to the Bank of Japan’s five-year-old economic stimulus programme, under which the central bank charges private lenders to deposit money with it. That effectively forces banks to increase lending, raising competition and pushing down loan interest rates. Mizuho suffered a decline in profit even after booking hefty gains from equity holdings and reallocating funds previously set aside to cover bad loans. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, Japan’s second-biggest lender, on Monday reported a 3.9 percent rise in net profit for the year ended March, reaching its highest in three years, helped by lower bad loan costs and gains from equity holdings.

-7.417582417582418," Exclusive: Japan's Mizuho pulled out of Qatar bond amid Gulf dispute DUBAI (Reuters) - Japan’s Mizuho Securities withdrew from its role as a bookrunner for a U.S. dollar-denominated bond issued by Qatar last week, in the latest sign international banks are wary of doing business in the Gulf state amid a regional dispute. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt in June cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, which they accuse of backing terrorism. Qatar denies this, and says the pressure is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty. Qatar issued $12 billion of bonds last week, its first international debt sale since the dispute erupted. The gas-rich Gulf state had appointed eight banks including Mizuho, part of Japan's Mizuho Financial Group 8411.T, to lead a series of investor meetings ahead of the issue. But when the bond was marketed on Thursday, Mizuho was no longer in the group. “Mizuho can confirm it was a bookrunner to the State of Qatar’s U.S. Dollar denominated bond sale, and has since withdrawn from the transaction,” the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. “Due to client confidentiality, we are not able to provide further comment on the matter.” International banks with business in the Gulf have been treading carefully since the regional dispute flared up, seeking to maintain relationships on both sides. HSBC HSBA.L, one of the most active banks in the Gulf, turned down a role in Qatar's bond sale as it had decided not to take high-profile roles in major Qatari debt transactions, sources told Reuters earlier this year. The bank, however, retains a branch in Qatar and has not disengaged from the country. Last week, while Qatari representatives were meeting global investors ahead of the bond deal, Saudi Arabia surprised markets with a jumbo bond transaction, which raised $11 billion. The move was seen by many market players as an attempt to absorb demand from investors and force Qatar to offer higher yields to attract interest in its deal. One Qatari source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday that Mizuho was “pressured to withdraw from the transaction,” especially as “another country” was going to the market at the same time. When asked if the Qatari deal was a consideration in the timing of the Saudi bond, the head of Saudi Arabia’s debt management office told Reuters last week the decision was determined by market conditions. The banks hired as bookrunners for the Saudi bond deal included Citi C.N, Goldman Sachs International GS.N, HSBC, JPMorgan JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N.

Qatar issued $12 billion in bonds last week, its first international debt sale since a boycott imposed by some of its Arab neighbours last year when they accused the country of supporting terrorism. Qatar firmly denies that charge. International banks with business in the Gulf have adopted a cautious stance since the crisis to maintain relationships on both sides of the dispute.
