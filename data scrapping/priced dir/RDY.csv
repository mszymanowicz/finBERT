3.071771500250264," India's Dr.Reddy's ends study of COVID-19 drug Avigan in Kuwait BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian drugmaker Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories said on Wednesday it had terminated its clinical study of Fujifilm Holdings’ COVID-19 treatment Avigan in patients with moderate to severe symptoms in Kuwait. Data from the Kuwait trial, conducted in partnership with United Arab Emirates-based medical alliance Global Response Aid FZCO (GRA), showed that the difference in time taken by Avigan and placebo to resolve a sustained absence of oxygen in the tissues was not significant enough to continue the trial. (bit.ly/3onNbij) Fujifilm, Dr.Reddy’s and GRA had entered into a deal in July to sell Avigan globally excluding Japan, China and Russia. Avigan was approved as an anti-flu drug in Japan in 2014, and Fujifilm has been seeking approval for the drug as a treatment for COVID-19 since October. The Japanese Health Ministry’s medical review board last month concluded that clinical trial data to determine Avigan’s efficacy for COVID-19 was inconclusive. Dr.Reddy’s, in partnership with GRA and Canada’s Appili Therapeutics, will continue a late-stage North American trial of Avigan in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Several Indian drugmakers, such as Cipla, Lupin and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, offer their own generic versions of Avigan to treat COVID-19. India, which has the second-highest number of coronavirus infections in the world, is in the middle of its first phase of COVID-19 vaccinations and has vaccinated nearly 2 million healthcare workers as of Monday."
-1.073740689286572," India pins hopes on locally-tested COVID-19 vaccines given Pfizer constraints NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India hopes five locally-tested vaccines will help it to control COVID-19, as those developed by Pfizer PFE.N and Moderna MRNA.O may not be available to it in big quantities soon. The five candidates include Russia's Sputnik-V whose ""Phase-II going to Phase-III"" trials in India will start next week in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories REDY.NS, Vinod Paul, the head of a committee advising the prime minister, said. The other experimental vaccines are the one being developed by AstraZeneca AZN.L and Oxford University which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India; Bharat Biotech and the Indian government's COVAXIN; Zydus Cadila's ZyCoV-D and lastly one being developed by Biological E. Ltd alongside Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax Technologies Corp DVAX.O. Paul told a news briefing that AstraZeneca vaccine’s last-stage trials in India had gone well and had almost been completed. The country of 1.35 billion people has reported 8.87 million infections, second only to the United States, and 130,519 deaths as a result of COVID-19. “We are very hopeful that we will be successful with the five vaccines,” Paul said on Tuesday. “They are easy platforms, availability of doses is very high. They will be able to control our pandemic in terms of the numbers of doses required.” Paul said the government was also watching the progress of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which have said interim results of last-stage trials of their candidates showed that they were more than 90% effective. Unlike Pfizer’s vaccine which must be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, Moderna’s can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it more suited for poorer countries such as India where cold chains are limited. “This obviously will be a very big hindrance to scale up the vaccine,” Paul said of Pfizer’s, adding that if India finds itself needing to do so it will pursue this option. “If we are required to form our strategy on this particular vaccine, then we will proceed with it. Though, even if we get it, we will get it in a few months only. But talks are ongoing.”"
-2.58252022745365," Indian shares rise as Dr.Reddy's boosts pharma stocks BENGALURU, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Indian shares opened higher on Friday, boosted by pharma stocks after Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd hit a record high, and as broader Asian markets advanced on hopes of more monetary support from central banks. The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.49% to 11,572.75 and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex 0.44% to 39,151.72 by 0350 GMT. Both the indexes closed more than 0.7% lower in the previous session. Dr.Reddy’s rose as much as 4.1% to an all-time high and was among the top boosts to the Nifty 50 after the company settled a patent litigation with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co over cancer treatment Revlimid. That helped the Nifty Pharma Index rise 2.67%. Conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd also helped boost the Nifty, gaining as much as 0.9%.

8.701901505637839," Russia seals another deal to supply and test its coronavirus vaccine abroad MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s sovereign wealth fund will supply 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine to Indian drug company Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, the fund said on Wednesday, as Moscow speeds up plans to distribute its shot abroad. The deal for its Sputnik-V vaccine candidate comes after the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) reached agreements with Indian manufacturers to produce 300 million doses of the shot in India, also a major consumer of Russian oil and arms. The agreement brings the total number of doses Russia has so far announced that it will supply abroad to just over 200 million - half to Latin America and half to India. RDIF has said it has received requests totalling 1 billion doses. Deliveries to India, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, could begin in late 2020, RDIF said, adding this was subject to the completion of trials and Sputnik-V’s registration by regulatory authorities in India. Phase III trials, involving at least 40,000 people, are ongoing in Russia. Initial results are expected in October or November, RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev has said. Dr Reddy’s, one of India’s top pharmaceutical companies, will carry out Phase III clinical trials of Sputnik-V in India, RDIF said. Following the news, Dr Reddy’s shares rallied to close 4.18% higher in India on Wednesday. The Indian trials could start as early as next month, Dmitriev told Reuters, adding trial results could be followed soon after by domestic regulatory approval of Sputnik-V for mass use in India. India said last week it was considering granting an emergency authorisation for a coronavirus vaccine, particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces. Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, and did so before large-scale trials were complete, stirring concern among scientists and doctors about the safety and efficacy of the shot. Several countries are now considering adopting “emergency use authorisation” measures that would fast-track approval of a vaccine in a similar way, however. “We expect emergency use authorisation for Sputnik-V vaccine in major markets,” Dmitriev said. Results of early-stage clinical trials of the Russian shot, which were published in international medical journal The Lancet earlier this month, showed promise, G V Prasad, co-chairman of Dr Reddy’s, was cited in the RDIF statement as saying. “Sputnik-V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against COVID-19 in India,” he said. There was no detail about the price of Sputnik-V, but RDIF has said previously it was not aiming to make a profit, just to cover costs. In a press briefing late on Tuesday, Balram Bhargava, who heads India’s clinical research agency, the Indian Council of Medical Research, said high-level talks between India and Russia around the vaccine had been ongoing. “There is a high-level committee of the government of India for vaccines that is in dialogue with the Russians,” he said, adding Russia had a good track record in vaccine development and the early-stage overseas trials of Sputnik-V had been promising. It was not immediately clear whether those talks had been instrumental in the deal between RDIF and Dr Reddy’s. The agreement comes as India’s coronavirus cases surged past five million on Wednesday, piling pressure on hospitals grappling with unreliable supplies of oxygen that they need to treat tens of thousands of critically ill patients. This is Dr Reddy’s first foray into a coronavirus vaccine. It has struck a licensing deal with Gilead Sciences Inc to make and sell COVID-19 treatment remdesivir in 127 countries, including India; launched its generic version of remdesivir under the brand name Redyx; and has also tied up with Fujifilm Holdings Corp to launch Fujifilm’s anti-flu drug Avigan (favipiravir) in India as a COVID-19 treatment."
8.701901505637839, Russia to sell COVID-19 vaccine to India's Dr. Reddy's Laboratories MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday it will supply India’s Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories with 100 million doses of the Sputnik-V vaccine against COVID-19 once it receives regulatory approval in India. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) added that it had agreed to cooperate on clinical trials and the distribution of the vaccine with the Indian firm.
8.701901505637839," Sensex, Nifty rise on banking, IT boost; Dr. Reddy's hits five-week high BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares on Wednesday notched their best closing levels in nearly three weeks, boosted by gains in large-cap banks and IT firms, while drugmaker Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories jumped on a deal with a Russian fund to cooperate on Moscow’s vaccine trials. The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index closed 0.72% higher at 11,604.55, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.66% to 39,302.85, both marking their highest close since Aug. 28. Gains of around 2% each in index heavyweights HDFC Bank Ltd and Infosys Ltd helped India’s benchmark indexes outperform peers in Asia and Europe, where risk appetite was limited ahead of the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday. However, a rally in the Nifty Smallcap 100 lost steam after four straight sessions of gains. The Nifty Midcap 50 index ended up 0.29%. Gains in the Nifty and Sensex came even as concerns lingered about India’s relations with China on their disputed Himalayan border and as total cases of the novel coronavirus surged past 5 million. Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday that while high frequency indicators point to some stabilisation of economic activity in the second quarter of the current year, the recovery was not yet fully entrenched. “By all indications, the recovery is likely to be gradual as efforts towards re-opening of the economy are confronted with rising infections,” Das told members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry’s national executive committee. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories ended up 4.2% at its best close in over five weeks after it agreed to cooperate with Russia’s sovereign wealth fund on clinical trials and supply of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine in India. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd closed 4.2% higher and lifted the Nifty Auto index 1.53%. Private sector lender IndusInd Bank Ltd slid 1.9% and was the biggest percentage loser on the Nifty."
34.257260783839236," Fujifilm to partner with Dr. Reddy's to sell Avigan as COVID-19 treatment TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp announced a deal with India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Dubai-based Global Response Aid (GRA) to sell its anti-flu drug Avigan for COVID-19 treatment globally excluding Japan, China and Russia. The deal comes as global drug makers rush to get factories ready for large-scale production of potential treatment and vaccines for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and move ahead with clinical trials. Fujifilm is conducting a clinical study on Avigan to treat COVID-19 patients in Japan and the United States and has been seeking to increase the drug’s production by partnering with domestic and overseas companies. The agreement provides for Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, a unit of the Japanese company, to grant Dr. Reddy’s and GRA the right to develop, make and sell Avigan overseas and get a lump-sum license fee and royalties on sales, it said in a statement on Wednesday. Fujifilm will allow Dr. Reddy’s to use its production patents and clinical data to study virus patients in India, the Middle East, and other regions, Dr. Reddy’s said in a statement. India and Russia have already approved Avigan as a COVID-19 therapy, but Japan, whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has touted the drug’s potential and hoped to approve it in May, won’t see a decision until at least July amid a lack of patients for clinical trials. In India, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd received regulatory approval for favipiravir, the generic form of Avigan, as a treatment for mild-to-moderate virus infections in June."

17.10169135955402," UPDATE 2-Cost cuts help drugmaker Indivior as it battles cheap rival * Hit from Dr.Reddy’s copycat to be lower than forecast * Indivior says on track to meet FY targets * Sublocade’s prescription journey falls to 16-22 days * Shares give back early gains to trade lower (Adds details on the company’s drugs, background, comments) Nov 1 (Reuters) - Embattled drugmaker Indivior said on Thursday the hit to revenue this year from a cheap copy of its top-selling opium addiction drug would be less than feared, as cost cutting helped it to deliver a 22 percent rise in quarterly profit. However, shares in the UK-listed company gave back early gains as it stuck to recently lowered full-year financial goals. Indivior has been battling the introduction of a cheaper generic version of its film-based opioid addiction treatment Suboxone, and has also faced distribution challenges with its new injectable opioid addiction drug, Sublocade. The company, spun-off from consumer products group Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, said the revenue hit this year from the generic Suboxone launched by India’s Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd was now expected to be $12-18 million. That is less than its previous warning the impact “could be materially higher” than $25 million. Indivior also said anecdotal feedback from patients and healthcare providers on Sublocade was very encouraging, and reiterated its confidence in reaching its peak net revenue target of more than $1 billion from the drug. The company also managed to reduce Sublocade’s prescription journey - the time from prescription to injection - to 16-22 days as at Sept. 30 from 27-37 days at June 30. It had previously warned the prescription journey was being held back by more than 30 paper-driven steps before doctors can manually administer the injection. Third-quarter adjusted net income rose to $58 million, ahead of analysts’ average forecast of $49 million, according to Jefferies. Revenue came in at $245 million, down 11 percent from a year earlier, but ahead of the average forecast by 3 percent. After rising sharply in early trading, shares in the U.S.-headquartered company were down 3.9 percent to 180.95 pence at 1405 GMT. The stock has more than halved in value this year. One stock exchange market maker said that while there had been no outright bad news in the results, the bearish mood around the company had not yet abated."
10.854765370697923," UPDATE 1-Indian drugmaker Dr. Reddy's Q2 profit soars past market estimates (Adds details, background) Oct 26 (Reuters) - Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories posted a better-than-expected rise in second-quarter profit as higher sales in some emerging countries offset a marginal decline in business in North America, a key market for the Indian generic drugmaker. Dr.Reddy’s net profit soared 69.7 percent to 5.18 billion rupees in the quarter ended Sept. 30, well ahead of analysts’ expectations of 3.52 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue in the global generics segment from emerging markets surged 36 percent to 7.49 billion rupees ($102.16 million), while domestic sales grew eight percent. Net sales were 36.87 billion rupees, up from 34.91 billion rupees last year, the company said here on Friday.

7.527943708005106," British drugmaker Indivior's shares hit by copycat, new drug worries (Reuters) - Indivior shares fell more than 20 percent after the British drugmaker warned of a bigger-than-expected blow from a copycat of its top opioid addiction treatment and posted weak initial sales from its new blockbuster prospect. The company, which reported a second straight drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, said “uncertainties” stopped it from issuing guidance weeks after scrapping its full-year forecast amid market share loss to an Indian copycat rival. Indivior’s shares have dropped more than 40 percent since India’s Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories announced a cheaper version of the UK firm’s blockbuster opiate addiction drug Suboxone Film. The impact on revenue from the copycat “could be materially higher” than the $25 million forecast earlier this month, the company said. Jefferies analysts estimate the hit will be $37.5 million to $45 million for the year. A U.S. court blocked Dr.Reddy’s from selling a cut-price version of Suboxone Film on July 13, but not before the drug’s market share dropped rapidly. Its share stands at 49 percent from 52 percent before it won the injunction. Investors were also disappointed with lower-than-expected sales from the firm’s new opioid addiction drug Sublocade. Instead of going to the pharmacy to pick up tablets or an under-the-tongue film, Sublocade injections are delivered direct to doctors for administration. Indivior has pinned its hopes on the once-monthly injection it launched in February, but the company said it was experiencing “some friction” in the new distribution and reimbursement model for Sublocade, making doctors less willing to prescribe the new drug. Sublocade revenues in the first half were $2 million, below brokerage Jefferies’ expectations but the company said it hopes revenue from the drug will be in the range of $25 to $50 million for the year. Sublocade’s prescription journey - the time from prescription to injection - has been slow, but the company has lowered it from 43-62 days at launch to 27-36 days currently and Chief Executive Shaun Thaxter said he hopes to get that down to 15-18 days. Thaxter said the company was making “good” progress in overcoming Sublocade’s initial challenges and remains confident that Sublocade will deliver peak net revenue of more than $1 billion a year. Adjusted net income fell 21.3 percent to $70 million in the quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, while revenue fell 6.9 percent to $268 million in the quarter."

The company, which also reported a second straight drop in quarterly profit, has had a turbulent few months with its shares down by a third since India’s Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories said it would launch a generic version of Indivior’s blockbuster opioid addiction treatment Suboxone Film. Indivior said it was unable to issue new guidance due to uncertainties around the drug after scrapping its full-year forecast earlier this month due to a significant market share loss in the United States. The impact from the launch of the copycat “could be materially higher” than the $25 million hit on revenue it forecast earlier this month, the company said. Suboxone Film, a dissolvable oral strip form of Indivior’s older tablet, Suboxone, is used to treat patients addicted to heroin and other painkillers and contributed about 80 percent of its annual revenue a year ago. Indivior has been involved in a number of legal battles with generic drugmakers to stop copycats from flooding the market. It won an injunction on July 13 to block Dr.Reddy’s from selling cheaper versions of Suboxone Film, but not before the drug’s market share dropped rapidly. The market share of the film has dropped further to 49 percent from the 52 percent before it got the injunction, the company said on Wednesday. Invidior’s shares were down 23 percent at 255 pence at 0726 GMT. Indivior has pinned its hopes on its new opioid addiction drug, Sublocade, a once-monthly injection launched in February, but the company’s plans have been hit with early stage snags. Sublocade revenues in the first half were $2 million, below brokerage Jefferies’ expectations. The company said that full-year revenue from the drug is expected to be in the range of $25 to $50 million. Chief Executive Shaun Thaxter said on Wednesday the company was making progress in overcoming Sublocade’s initial challenges and continues to expect to deliver peak net revenue of more than $1 billion.

16.05227726260386," Indivior warning on anti-opioid drug competition sends shares tumbling (Reuters) - British drugmaker Indivior INDV.L warned on Wednesday it would miss its full-year profit target as its best-selling opioid addiction drug faces new competitors in the United States, sending its shares down 37 percent. The share slide wiped nearly 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion)from the company’s market valuation, sending the stock to its lowest in two years. Indivior said its full-year guidance was no longer valid given an “accelerated” loss of market share for opioid treatment Suboxone Film as well as slower early uptake levels of its new opioid addiction drug Sublocade, launched in February. In February the company had forecast 2018 net revenue of between $1.13 billion and $1.17 billion and adjusted net profit of $280 million to $320 million. Suboxone Film generates 80 percent of Indivior's revenue but India's Dr.Reddy's Laboratories REDY.NS and U.S.-based Mylan NV MYL.O received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month to launch generic versions of the blockbuster drug. The film, which is placed under the tongue to suppress cravings, lost two-and-half percentage points of market share to 52 percent in the most recent weekly data, the company said. That fall alone would reduce 2018 net revenue by $25 million, it said. Market prices have also fallen by 75 to 80 percent compared to list prices due to the level of discounting of the generic tablets, Indivior said, warning the impact of those price changes could also reduce annual net revenue by $50 million. Indivior filed an injunction last month against the FDA’s decision, and a U.S. court has issued a restraining order blocking Dr. Reddy’s from selling its generic version of Suboxone until the end of June. The UK drugmaker had previously warned that Dr. Reddy’s launch could result in a rapid and material loss of U.S. market share for Suboxone. On Wednesday, Indivior said it was also experiencing “some friction” in the new distribution and reimbursement model for Sublocade, making doctors less willing to prescribe the new drug at higher price levels. As a result, Sublocade’s 2018 net revenue is expected to range between $25 million and $50 million, about $50 million lower than its expectations, the company said. Its shares were down 31 percent at 260 pence by 0900 GMT."
18.267290528948386," Indivior's shares jump 30 pct after U.S. court blocks sale of rival generic July 16 (Reuters) - Indivior Plc’s shares soared as much as 30 percent on Monday after a U.S. court blocked India’s Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories from selling copycat versions of the British drugmaker’s bestselling opioid addiction treatment in the United States. Indivior shares were up 25 percent in early trading on the London Stock Exchange, while Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories shares fell more than 9 percent in morning trading on the National Stock Exchange. The U.S. court granted a preliminary injunction on Friday, preventing Dr. Reddy’s from re-launching its generic product until the patent litigation is concluded or until the company prevails on an appeal of the injunction. The ruling came days after Indivior issued a profit warning, citing an “accelerated” U.S. market share loss of star drug Suboxone Film, which wiped out nearly a billion pounds from the company’s market value. Jefferies said the ruling underlined the strength in Indivior’s intellectual property. Suboxone Film generates 80 percent of Indivior’s revenue and helps drug users beat their addiction to heroin and is dissolved under the tongue. Generic rivals in tablet form are already in the U.S. market, which is grappling with an opioid addiction epidemic that killed 33,000 people in 2015. Indivior, spun-off from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, has been involved in a number of legal battles with generic drugmakers to stop them from flooding the U.S. market with cut-price versions of its Suboxone Film."
8.401996430339604," Indivior gets breather after court extends order blocking generic rival (Reuters) - Indivior Plc got a breather on Friday as a U.S. court extended a restraining order blocking a rival from launching a generic version of its bestselling opioid addiction treatment in the United States. Dr. Reddy’s and U.S.-based Mylan NV received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this month to launch a generic version of Suboxone Film, which generates 80 percent of Indivior’s revenue, forcing the UK company to file an injunction against the decision. Indivior said its temporary restraining order (TRO) issued on June 15 had been extended for another 14 days, during which time the U.S. court for the District of New Jersey will consider the application and issue a ruling on the injunction. Shares of Indivior, which was spun out from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, rose as much as 1.9 percent in early trading, but had edged back to little changed by 0730 GMT. Both Morgan Stanley and Jefferies analysts said the extension was a positive, though the final ruling remained unpredictable. The stock had lost about a third of its value after Dr. Reddy’s said earlier this month it would launch its new drug regardless of the legal stand-off. The company warned earlier that the Dr. Reddy’s launch could result in a rapid and material loss of U.S. market share for Suboxone Film, which is placed under the tongue to suppress cravings. The market share of the drug had declined to 55 percent by the end of April from 60 percent last year, the British firm said last month. Generic rivals in tablet form are already on the U.S. market, which is grappling with an opioid addiction epidemic that killed 33,000 people in 2015. Indivior said it would consider a potential launch of its own generic product if Dr. Reddy’s launched a copycat version. Indivior’s contingency plans would also focus on optimising the launch of Sublocade, a once-a-month injectable drug to suppress opioid craving launched in the United States in February. It tempered expectations for initial sales of Sublocade at the launch, saying it did not want investors to be unrealistic about its prospects in its first year. The company stuck to its 2018 revenue guidance despite Dr. Reddy’s getting the go-ahead for its product launch, but said it would revisit the forecast if the move goes ahead. Indivior is set to report first-half results on July 25. Jefferies analysts said reassurance from the company on the progress of Sublocade will be key to sentiment and share price support."
