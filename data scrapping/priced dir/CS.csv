Switzerland’s second-largest lender posted a 353 million Swiss franc ($392.8 million) net loss for the last quarter after booking 757 million francs in legal charges, beating analysts’ forecasts for a 566 million franc loss but leaving annual profit down 22%. The bank is now looking to boost its wealth management business by building up its China onshore presence and expanding elsewhere in Asia-Pacific, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told Reuters in an interview. It is also looking to allocate more capital to its international wealth management division outside Asia to ramp up lending, and said it saw net interest income beginning to steady after interest rates put pressure on the business last year. The bank’s shares were down 0.8% by 1045 GMT, as analysts pointed to mixed results. The earnings cap a tumultuous year for Credit Suisse, which began with the ousting of Tidjane Thiam as chief executive over a spying scandal, and then the onset of the pandemic just as his replacement Thomas Gottstein took the helm. Wealth managers have profited richly from bumper trading and client demand for greater counsel during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping rivals UBS Group AG and Julius Baer Gruppe AG post windfall gains. Credit Suisse however faced setbacks in its core business last year everywhere except Asia. Outside Asia, only Credit Suisse’s investment bank managed to increase profits in 2020, as higher expected lending losses, headwinds from negative interest rates and a strong Swiss franc bit into earnings. In the fourth quarter, revenue from fixed-income trading was down 8% year-on-year at 713 million Swiss francs, while equity sales and trading earnings were 5% lower at 498 million Swiss francs, underpeforming strong gains at some other investment banks. Barclays on Thursday reported a stellar investment banking year, with strong revenues from its equities and fixed income businesses in line with U.S. peers. Credit Suisse said it had started 2021 with its strongest January in a decade, with pre-tax income up across all divisions and investment bank and trading activities showing particular strength. Factoring out one-off gains that boosted results in 2019 and set it back in 2020, it said it would have seen a 6% pre-tax profit gain for last year. The Zurich-based bank is targeting 10% annual earnings growth in its wealth management business over the next three years. Gottstein, who became chief executive last February as the novel coronavirus was surging in China, is reconfiguring Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and targets branch closures and a digital overhaul of its home business to cut costs. Its standalone international wealth management unit, which covers rich clients outside Asia and Switzerland, saw net revenue fall 17% in 2020 as bumper trading failed to offset the impact of lower interest rates and a depressed U.S. dollar. The division was also hit by a 414 million franc fourth-quarter impairment on a hedge fund equity stake, which impacted its struggling asset management business. Its Swiss private client business, covering both wealthy home-market customers and the bank’s only retail accounts, saw pre-tax profit dip 16% on weaker revenue and higher provisions for loan losses. Its Asia-Pacific business meanwhile saw revenue rise 4% on higher transaction fees and the region’s stronger recovery from the pandemic. That however failed to offset a jump in lending provisions, resulting in a 10% profit decline. In a reversal of fortunes, Credit Suisse’s investment bank, which has been the focus of overhaul efforts over the past five years, saw a surge in 2020 revenue, helping the business to its second consecutive year of profit gain.

The settlement followed a post-trial decision by a court awarding MBIA about $604 million in damages, MBIA said in a statement on Thursday. Pursuant to the settlement, Credit Suisse has paid MBIA Corp $600 million, it said. But following the settlement agreement, the court dismissed the action, it added. MBIA sued Credit Suisse, the second-biggest bank in Switzerland, in 2009 over hundreds of millions of dollars it paid out to compensate investors after thousands of property mortgages failed in the United States. In November, New York Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter ruled that Credit Suisse breached its representations and warranties to MBIA, which indemnified investors in residential mortgage backed securities issued ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. The judge found that more than half of the mortgages in the transaction at issue were non-conforming and that MBIA “did not assume the risk of loss that they posed.” Credit Suisse had already set aside $300 million in connection to the long dispute with MBIA, but it said in December that it expected the figure to rise to $680 million. “We are pleased to have resolved this legacy matter,” a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said in a separate emailed statement. “The settlement amount of $600 million is substantially less than our earlier guidance of up to approximately $680 million and has been fully provisioned for in our 4Q 2020 results, due to be announced on 18th February.” (Reporting by Nandakumar D and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich)"

In January 2020, FINMA appointed an independent auditor to review the bank’s corporate governance and its use of electronic communications in connection with spying into former and current executives that became public in 2019 and led to the ouster of then-CEO Tidjane Thiam. Switzerland’s second-biggest bank had sought to scuttle FINMA’s appointment of Thomas Werlen, of international law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on the grounds that the firm and Werlen lacked sufficient independence, but a lower court in April rejected the bank’s challenge. Switzerland’s Supreme Court, in a decision dated Dec. 28, upheld the lower court ruling, saying that most law firms available to take on such assignments in Switzerland had often gained the requisite know-how by representing counterparties in disputes with major banks. “The fact that the market available to take on FINMA’s auditing assignment into big banks contains few potential providers suggests that the criterion of independence should not be applied too strictly,” the judges said in the ruling, which became public on Wednesday. Credit Suisse said it noted the court’s decision and was fully cooperating with FINMA. FINMA said it welcomed the decision of the Federal Supreme Court.

-23.86952316103639," Brazil's Bolsonaro gives nod to private sector buying COVID-19 shots, AstraZeneca balks BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday said he has approved a group of private sector companies to buy 33 million vaccine doses from AstraZeneca Plc, something the British drugmaker firm said cannot happen “at this moment.” Speaking at a virtual banking conference, Bolsonaro said half of the shots would be for employees of the companies buying them, and the other half would go to the government’s national immunization program. Newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported that the proposal came from a group of business leaders on a conference call on Monday to discuss which firms and organizations would participate. “I want to make it very clear that the federal government is in favor of this group ... bringing the vaccine here to immunize 33 million people, at zero cost for the federal government,” Bolsonaro said. AstraZeneca, however, said in a statement on Tuesday that all of its vaccine supply “at this moment” is only available to governments and multilateral organizations around the world. “It is not possible to make vaccines available to the private sector,” it said. Several companies denied reports that they had joined the initiative, including hospital group DASA SA, which said in a statement it is seeking to understand the commercial availability of vaccines through its suppliers. The national industry lobby CNI, however, said that it was backing an effort by some companies to import vaccines privately, while respecting the priority given to the public immunization plan, a spokesman for the CNI said. Brazil’s nationwide vaccination process got underway just over a week ago but has been slow and patchy thus far, with shipments of doses from India and China subject to delay. Bolsonaro, who has played down the severity of COVID-19, has insisted he will not take a vaccine. Meanwhile, Brazilian biomedical center Butantan expects supplies for around 8.5 million doses of China’s CoronaVac vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech to arrive by Feb. 3, its director said on Tuesday. Butantan Director Dimas Covas said he hopes the initial shipment of about 5,400 liters of active ingredients, enough to fill and finish some 8.5 million doses, would be followed by a similar load shortly after. He also said Butantan plans to have a factory fully producing the Chinese vaccine by early next year. Graphic: Tracking the vaccine race: here Graphic: COVID-19 Global tracker, Brazil: here"
-24.262524483177618," UPDATE 1-European lenders exit Amazon oil trade after scrutiny by campaigners Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Dutch lender ING (INGA.AS) and France's BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) have decided to stop financing trade in crude oil from Ecuador, the banks said on Monday, after pressure from campaigners aiming to protect the Amazon rainforest. The role of European lenders in backing the trade came under scrutiny in August, when a report by advocacy groups Stand.earth and Amazon Watch named six European banks as major financiers of Ecuadorean oil exports to U.S. refineries. Indigenous leaders battling to prevent further oil exploration in their territory said the banks' role had made them complicit in oil spills, violations of land rights and the destruction of rainforest by Ecuador's oil industry. ""The banks' commitment is a milestone,"" Marlon Vargas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, told Reuters. ""The banks should finance other forms of economic development, but not oil extraction."" The August report had named the three banks alongside France's Natixis (CNAT.PA), Switzerland's UBS (UBSG.S) and Dutch bank Rabobank as the main backers of the shipment of about $10 billion of Ecuadorean oil to the United States over the past decade. Campaigners had accused the banks of using double standards for making climate change pledges while backing trade in oil from Ecuador, where the industry plans to drill hundreds of wells in the Yasuni National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Amazon plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. ING said it shared many of the concerns in the report over protecting the Amazon and had decided to review its exposure to oil and gas exports from Ecuador.  'ENGAGEMENT ONGOING' ""Our research and resulting engagements are ongoing,"" the bank said. ""In the meantime, we have decided not to engage in any new contracts for the financing of oil and gas trade flows from the Ecuadorian Amazon."" Credit Suisse said it had decided to phase out financing for oil exports from the Ecuadorean and Peruvian Amazon after completing existing commitments. ""Credit Suisse reviews and updates its sector-specific policies on a regular basis,"" the bank said. BNP Paribas said it had decided in December to exclude oil exports from Ecuador's Esmeraldas region - home to Ecuador's export terminal for oil from its Amazon region. ""BNP Paribas is committed to the continuous improvement of its sustainability strategy,"" the bank said. Rabobank said in August that it had stopped financing Ecuadorean crude cargoes earlier in 2020. UBS, for now, has stopped short of committing to end its financing of Ecuadorean crude oil cargoes. The bank said it maintained dialogue with advocacy groups and was committed to the highest environmental and social standards. ""As such we have declined transactions where the origin of oil is verifiably associated with breaches of our standards, such as indigenous peoples' land rights or UNESCO World Heritage Sites,"" the bank said. Natixis, meanwhile, financed cargoes of 5.5 million barrels of oil from the Ecuadorean Amazon from July to December - more than double the volume it backed in the first half of the year, according to an analysis of U.S. customs data by Stand.earth and Amazon Watch. Natixis said that it continued to ""proactively"" screen transactions for potential environmental or social risks and understood that financing Ecuador's oil exports could encourage plans by the industry to expand into the Yasuni National Park. ""Given this situation, Natixis has declined to finance any new clients involved in oil exports from Ecuador since mid-2020 and has reduced the number of existing clients it works with in this area,"" a Natixis spokesperson said.  'GROWING SCRUTINY' Ecuador's oil industry says that taking care of the environment and maintaining a harmonious relationship with people living in its operational areas is a priority. State-owned oil company Petroecuador did not respond to a request for comment. With oil output of about 0.5 million barrels per day, or 0.5% of global volumes, according to BP's statistical review, Ecuador ranks as a mid-sized producer. Much of its oil is used to pay the country's debts to China. The move by the banks could complicate the export of oil from Ecuador because trading companies that were using their services will have to find other banks to back their transactions. Swiss trading house Gunvor, identified in the report as one of the firms trading Ecuadorean crude, declined to comment. ""Any banks involved in this trade will face growing scrutiny, unless Ecuador's government puts a moratorium on new drilling and addresses the environmental damage and rights violations caused by existing production,"" said Tzeporah Berman, international programmes director at Stand.earth. ""Ecuador is going to need support to get out from under crushing debt, but new drilling in primary forests without consent from indigenous peoples is not the solution."" With asset managers under pressure to rebalance their portfolios to help to slow climate change, tropical deforestation and the loss of biodiversity, the stance of emerging market governments on such issues is facing growing scrutiny. ""We have to position as investors with countries that are taking an active approach to governing and environmental concerns, and obviously some countries are better placed to do that than others,"" said Carlos de Sousa, an emerging market debt portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, which has exposure to Ecuador's sovereign bonds.

-20.014614799233225," Credit Suisse to slide into red as it sets aside $850 million for U.S. litigation ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse said it will sink to a fourth-quarter loss after setting aside hundreds of millions of dollars more than previously expected on Friday for a legal dispute over property debt in the United States. Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, who took the helm at Switzerland’s second-biggest bank last February, said in December he wanted to start the new year with a “clean slate” on legacy matters and has set aside some $850 million to address disputes dating back to the financial crisis. The bank had already set aside $300 million in connection to a decade-long dispute with New York-based municipal bond insurer MBIA regarding a U.S. residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS), but said in December it expected the figure to rise to $680 million. MBIA sued Credit Suisse in 2009 over hundreds of millions of dollars it paid out to compensate investors after thousands of mortgages failed. In November, New York Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter ruled that Credit Suisse breached its representations and warranties to MBIA, which indemnified investors in residential mortgage backed securities issued ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. The judge found that more than half of the mortgages in the transaction at issue were non-conforming and that MBIA “did not assume the risk of loss that they posed.” “This case involves mortgage loans that contributed to a crippling financial crisis over a decade ago after banks securitised residential mortgages that never should have been issued in the first place,” the ruling stated, determining Credit Suisse must pay damages for warranties breached on the loans. “It’s a case that went on for 10 years that Credit Suisse refused to discuss settlement on, and now they’ve got a verdict that’s going to more than double their reserves for it,” said Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for MBIA. “It’s obviously a very substantial win for MBIA.” The bank on Friday said it had completed a review of other RMBS cases, leading it to set aside additional funds to settle a handful of pending civil claims in the United States.

Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, who took the helm at Switzerland's second-biggest bank last February, said in December he wanted to start the new year with a ""clean slate"" on legacy matters and has set aside some $850 million to address disputes dating back to the financial crisis. The bank had already set aside $300 million in connection to a decade-long dispute with New York-based municipal bond insurer MBIA regarding a U.S. residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS), but said in December it expected the figure to rise to $680 million. MBIA sued Credit Suisse in 2009 over hundreds of millions of dollars it paid out to compensate investors after thousands of mortgages failed.

-20.449607758627316," Louis Dreyfus owner rescheduled $450 million in debt due by end-2020 PARIS (Reuters) - Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the main shareholder of commodities merchant Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC), rescheduled deadlines for repaying about $450 million in loans from Credit Suisse that had been due by the end of 2020, a company filing showed. Louis-Dreyfus, who controls 170-year-old LDC through the Akira trust, had borrowed $1 billion from Credit Suisse in early 2019 in order to buy out minority family shareholders. The debt burden of the buyout led her to seek new investors, culminating in a deal announced in November to sell a 45% stake in LDC to Abu Dhabi investment firm ADQ. Louis-Dreyfus later told Swiss business magazine Bilanz she would use some of the proceeds to settle her debt with Credit Suisse. An annual financial filing by Akira in the Netherlands late last month showed the ADQ agreement came just weeks before a deadline to reimburse several hundred million dollars of its debt to Credit Suisse. One portion of the debt, representing just over $300 million and maturing in 2020, was rescheduled on Dec. 21 with a new deadline of Nov. 30, 2021, according to the filing. On Nov. 10, the day before the deal with ADQ was announced, other facilities totalling $145.6 million maturing in 2020 were also extended, of which $45.6 million is now due by Nov. 30, 2021, and $100 million by Nov. 10, 2025. The rescheduling means Akira will have to repay Credit Suisse around $350 million by the end of November this year, plus an undisclosed portion of a $200 million facility that had deadlines in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the filing showed. In May 2020, Akira had repaid $200 million to Credit Suisse, according to the filing. The overall value of LDC’s deal with ADQ has not been disclosed. LDC has said at least $800 million of proceeds would go towards settling a separate $1 billion loan the group made to bail out Brazilian sugar firm Biosev.

3.0612233569367553," UPDATE 1-Switzerland charges Credit Suisse in Bulgarian money laundering probe (Adds further detail, background) ZURICH, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors charged Credit Suisse on Thursday over alleged failings related to a Bulgarian crime ring involving top-level wrestlers accused of laundering cocaine trafficking proceeds more than a decade ago. Switzerland’s attorney general (OAG) said in a statement that an unnamed former Credit Suisse manager and two alleged members of the criminal organisation had also been indicted in the Swiss Federal Criminal Court. “(Credit Suisse) is accused of failing to take all the organisational measures that were reasonable and required to prevent the laundering of assets belonging to and under the control of the criminal organisation,” it said. The trafficking dated to between 2004 and 2008 and the fall of communism in Bulgaria, when top-level wrestlers lacking financial support turned to criminal organisations for help, the OAG said. Credit Suisse said it “unreservedly” rejected the allegations and it was convinced its ex-employee was innocent. “Credit Suisse takes note with astonishment of the decision...to bring charges,” it said. Switzerland’s second largest bank said its anti-money laundering measures have since been improved, adding that the maximum fine Switzerland’s top criminal court could impose was 5 million Swiss francs ($5.7 million). The OAG said that the wrestler involved had since been sentenced to lengthy prison terms in several European countries. “One of (the wrestlers) built up and managed a hierarchical and compartmentalised criminal structure which aimed to make money for its members by trafficking in cocaine,” it said. The proceeds were then paid into accounts in Switzerland, where the money was laundered to buy Swiss and Bulgarian real estate, the attorney general said. It alleged that Credit Suisse acted as a bank for these activities, adding that the indicted former bank executive oversaw transactions worth more than 140 million Swiss francs for the group.

2.120976919816966," Credit Suisse targets annual 10% jump in wealth earnings to hit profit target ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse is targeting 10% annual earnings growth in its wealth management business over the next three years as it tries to get back on track to hit its profit goals after loan losses and legal provisions threw it off course this year. Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, who took over as CEO in February as the coronavirus was surging in China, is reconfiguring Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and is targeting branch closures and a digital overhaul of its home business to cut costs. Kicking off the bank’s investor day on Tuesday, Gottstein said the bank expected to grow wealth-related pre-tax profit to 5.0 - 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($5.64- $6.20 billion) by 2023, from 4.0 billion francs in the first nine months of 2020, as it shifts more of its available capital into the core business and refocuses its investment bank to better serve rich private clients. “We continue to believe wealth management is one of the most attractive segments in financial services, notably in Asia Pacific, and we also expect to further expand the connectivity between our investment bank and the wealth management-related divisions,” he said in a statement. Gottstein said he believed the measures would help the bank deliver on its main profitability goal in a “normalised environment”, as the bank acknowledged further uncertainties in 2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but shied away from restating an ambition previously set for this year for a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of approximately 10%. RoTE for the first nine months stood at 9.8% as a surge in investment banking failed to offset a slowdown in wealth management. The bank said on Tuesday that business in the fourth quarter had continued the trend of the previous three months with investment banking revenues ahead of the last year’s fourth quarter. In its wealth management division, stronger transaction business, especially in Asia, was offsetting headwinds from the stronger Swiss franc and negative interest rates. The bank previously flagged two charges totalling nearly $900 million - one an impairment on a hedge fund equity stake, the other a legal provision - that will hit its earnings in the fourth quarter. The bank confirmed a RoTE target of 10%-12% in the medium term. In July, the bank had said it aimed to generate roughly 400 million francs in annual savings from 2022 onwards, primarily through the merger of its two investment banking units and a digital overhaul of its business in home markets, which is to include the closure of roughly a quarter of its branches. It said on Tuesday it planned to reinvest most or all of those savings into technology as well as wealth management and investment banking growth initiatives, including a push to bring its wealth business onto onshore China, as well as expanding offerings for ultra-wealthy private customers and boosting mergers & acquisitions activity. Reuters earlier this month reported on a new team of senior dealmakers the bank set up in EMEA focused purely on bringing in business as part of its efforts to increase M&A revenue and market share. Credit Suisse also said it expected to turn around its asset management business in 2021 by focusing more on alternative and private market offerings, and those related to sustainable investing.

6.399388314841184," Goldman Sachs shifts to full ownership of China securities joint venture HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has signed a pact to buy out its China joint venture partner to make it the most advanced foreign bank to take full ownership of a mainland securities business. The process to boost its stake in the Goldman Sachs Gao Hua (GSGH) venture from 51% to 100% has also been initiated with regulators, according to an internal memo issued on Tuesday to staff of the Wall Street bank. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong confirmed the memo content. Most of the international banks in China own 51% of their securities businesses, which typically house investment banking operations, with a Chinese partner. JPMorgan took 71% of its joint venture in November when it bought an extra 20% stake in the mainland business and analysts believe it could be the next in line to move to full ownership.. JPMorgan declined to comment. Credit Suisse flagged in July it wanted to own 100% of its China securities venture but declined to comment on how advanced it was in the process. Goldman has previously indicated it would double its headcount in China to 600 people by 2025 as part of its expansion plans. The terms of the Goldman Sachs deal have not yet been made public. Unlike most of the other China JVs, Goldman had day-to-day operational control of its business, which offers investment banking services such as equities and bond underwriting and deal advice, even with its minority ownership. Full ownership could allow foreign banks to expand their operations in the multi-trillion-dollar Chinese financial sector, and better integrate them with their global businesses. “One hundred percent ownership of our franchise on the mainland represents a significant commitment to and investment in China, outlined in our China strategic plan,” the Goldman memo said."

Rohner will be replaced by outgoing Lloyds Bank Chief Executive António Horta-Osório. He declined to comment directly on the rumoured merger talks between Credit Suisse and cross-town rival UBS. Both Rohner and UBS Chairman Axel Weber were reported to support a deal, but talks dropped off after the summer. “I am not saying that the idea is absurd, quite the opposite,” Rohner said in the interview. “Every chairman, if he understands his role correctly, will think through such a constellation as well as other scenarios from time to time. “I have done so several times,” he said, although mergers between big banks tended to be very complex and had to deal with regulatory, cultural and timing issues. “Such factors determine whether a merged company is successful or not,” Rohner said."

The bank has promoted two London-based bankers focusing on financial services - Max Mesny and Chris Williams - and Italy-based Andrea Donzelli to its Client Advisory Group, which was first launched in October to deepen relationships with corporate clients, said the memo whose content was confirmed by a Credit Suisse spokesperson. The trio will join a group of seven investment bankers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and the United States who were promoted on Oct. 23 when the new unit, headed by David Wah, was first announced. It comes as the Swiss bank seeks to win a bigger slice of global dealmaking, hiring former Bank of America executive Christian Meissner in October for a new role to help cross-sell more investment banking services to ultra-wealthy entrepreneurs in its private bank. Its new client advisory structure follows sweeping personnel changes at the top of other investment banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. It also highlights the pressures big investment banks are facing to retain senior staff in the face of increasing competition from rival boutiques which can attract seasoned bankers with more entrepreneurial roles. “With the addition of the Client Advisory Group in EMEA, we are affirming our commitment to investing in and growing this business,” said the memo which was signed by Wah as well as David Miller, who heads capital markets and advisory, and Jens Welter, who heads the EMEA investment bank. The client advisory group, which now comprises 10 bankers overall, also includes global energy chairman Osmar Abib, global co-head of media and telecom Giuseppe Monarchi, and global head of chemicals Spyros Svoronos. Within EMEA, Welter and Monarchi will coordinate efforts to further expand the bank’s so-called “coverage advisory team” with new hires and internal transfers, the memo said. Credit Suisse, which has proposed outgoing Lloyds Banking Group Chief Executive António Horta-Osório as its new chairman, ranks sixth in global M&A league tables so far this year, ahead of UBS and behind Wall Street’s top five banks, while it has an eighth placement in Europe, Refinitiv data shows. In November, it landed a key mandate on S&P’s $44 billion swoop on London-based IHS Markit - the biggest deal so far this year - which has helped it boost its league table ranking. The bank has also reviewed the leadership of its financial institution group (FIG) following the promotions of both Mesny and Williams and in the wake of a series of systemic mergers within the banking industry. In a separate memo, Credit Suisse announced that Armando Rubio-Alvarez - who had been co-heading the FIG team in EMEA with Max Mesny for the past three years - will become the sole head of the EMEA FIG franchise, while Mesny will serve as chairman of EMEA FIG. Williams, who rejoined Credit Suisse in October from boutique advisory firm Perella Weinberg Partners, will continue to focus on EMEA FIG business while taking on a broader role as vice chairman for capital markets and advisory across EMEA. Alejandro Przygoda - who heads global FIG at Credit Suisse - will still have Rubio-Alvarez, Mesny and Williams reporting into him, although both Mesny and Williams will have another reporting line into Wah as members of the client advisory group. Donzelli, a well-known banker in Italy where he advised infrastructure group Atlantia among others, will retain his existing role as co-head of capital markets and advisory for Italy.

LDC this month announced that it had agreed the sale of a 45% stake to state-owned investor ADQ for an undisclosed sum, opening up the family-owned group’s capital for the first time in its 169-year-old history. LDC specified that at least $800 million of the proceeds would go towards a $1 billion loan the group made to bail out Brazilian sugar firm Biosev.

She gave no further details in the article. Contacted by Reuters, LDC’s press office said the matter related to shareholders and was not managed by LDC. The Credit Suisse loan had been taken to buy out minority family shareholders in early 2019, increasing Louis-Dreyfus’s stake in LDC’s holding entity to about 96%.

The properties held by the real estate fund are to be transferred to the Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund International , in the first half of 2021, and the liquidation proceeds will be paid out to the investors, according to the bank. Trading in the fund units on the SIX Swiss Exchange has been suspended with immediate effect, and the units are being delisted, the statement added. “The fund’s performance is no longer consistent with the fundamentally high location and asset quality of the underlying real estate portfolio”, which consisted of 12 top-end commercial properties in America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, it said. The Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund International, which is traded over the counter and aimed at institutional investors, will acquire the properties, whose transfer value will be set by valuation experts and confirmed independently, the bank said. The fund has seen a 13% drop in performance in the past year, according to Swiss Fund Data. Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund Global’s biggest assets were office buildings in Japan, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, according to the fund’s web page. Office and retail property values have fallen this year, according to real estate broker CBRE. Many unlisted property funds in Britain were suspended in March because surveyors could not be certain of property valuations as a result of the pandemic, though several have started to reopen since September as valuations became clearer."
13.075687099315253," Credit Suisse shareholders approve final 2019 dividend payment ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse shareholders on Friday approved payment of the second half of its 2019 dividend. Both big Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and UBS, decided in April to postpone paying part of their 2019 dividends after mounting pressure from authorities over lenders’ payouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Credit Suisse shareholders approved the bank’s final 2019 dividend payout of 0.1388 Swiss francs per share, which followed a payout of the same amount in May, with 99.36% support. Chairman Urs Rohner in a webcast speech defended full payment of the bank’s 2019 dividend, as compared to a steep drop in European banks’ payouts, saying Swiss banks were well-capitalised and the Swiss economy had proven more resilient than others. “As you know, regulators in other jurisdictions, among them the European Union, have thus far taken a different approach to dividends this year,” Rohner said at the virtual extraordinary general meeting. “However, this in no way suggests a more lax approach to the distribution of dividends in Switzerland or that Swiss regulations are less stringent.” Shareholders approved payout of the final tranche of UBS’s 2019 dividend earlier this month."
13.926016894380913," Credit Suisse flags $450 million impairment on York Capital Management stake ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse expects to take a roughly $450 million impairment on alternative investment firm York Capital Management’s retreat from its core hedge funds business, the Swiss bank said. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported the New York-based firm had informed employees and investors about plans to leave its original line of business, wind down its European hedge funds business and convert its U.S. hedge fund into one primarily managing internal money. Credit Suisse, which has been an investor in York Capital since 2010, said on Tuesday it expected to take an impairment on its stake in billionaire hedge-fund manager Jamie Dinan’s firm in the fourth quarter, which would hit its main capital metric - or common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio - by roughly 7 basis points. “The amount of the impairment taken will be assessed as part of our year-end process, but is currently expected to be approximately $450 million,” the bank said. The impairment would not change its existing guidance for dividends and capital distributions in 2020 and 2021, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said. The Swiss bank, which placed an initial $425 million investment into York a decade ago, said it intended to maintain an interest in York’s Asia-Pacific business, which it expects to be spun out as a new and separate hedge fund next year. York Capital, founded in 1991 with a focus on U.S. hedge funds, represented roughly 1% of the 438 billion Swiss francs ($481.00 billion) managed by Credit Suisse’s asset management business at the end of 2019. Credit Suisse is scrutinising its overall strategy for asset management, part of its international wealth management division, after weak earnings within the business, which dropped 26% year-on-year through September. Asset management is spinning out a 3 billion franc Swiss energy infrastructure investment entity, and Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein has signalled further strategic revisions over the coming year. Swiss banks have grappled in recent years with the need to scale up asset management to make the business more profitable, but hefty write-offs over larger acquisitions have proved costly for several. “Experience has shown that it’s almost always the selling hedge fund manager that profits from such transactions, and very seldom the buyer,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said in a note. “Even if the extent of the write-off doesn’t shake Credit Suisse to its core, it does show that big banks need to be prepared for major disruption.” Shares in Credit Suisse were up 2.2% by 1025 GMT despite the potential impairment, amid a wider market ally. York’s new strategy will focus on longer-term assets such as private equity, private debt and collateralised loan obligations, Credit Suisse said. ($1 = 0.9106 Swiss francs)"
16.296468133931363," UBS becomes first major European bank to pay out full 2019 dividend ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS UBSG.S shareholders on Thursday approved payment of the second half of its 2019 dividend, making it the first major European bank to pay a full dividend for the year despite turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic. UBS, along with rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse CSGN.S, in April decided to postpone payment of part of its 2019 dividend after mounting pressure from authorities over lenders' payouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Banks across Britain and the euro zone were halted from paying 2019 dividends during the peak of economic uncertainties in March and April, while Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA took a softer approach, warning banks not to pay out dividends in order to conserve capital without banning them outright. Major Swiss banks have since weathered the pandemic’s economic fallout with strong capital positions. Some 99.49% of the bank’s shareholders on Thursday approved a special dividend of $0.365 per share in a virtual extraordinary general meeting, matching the initial payment made in May. Credit Suisse will hold its extraordinary general meeting on Nov. 27 to request approval for the second tranche of its 2019 dividend payment. UBS has set aside some $2.5 billion to return to shareholders next year. At FINMA’s behest, it is rebalancing the amount of payouts earmarked for buybacks to favour these over dividends, with former CEO Sergio Ermotti saying the approach allowed for greater flexibility amid economic uncertainty."

40.769195812308226," Credit Suisse profit slides as wealth management fees fall ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S on Thursday posted a steeper-than-expected slide in third-quarter profit, as a surge in investment banking failed to offset a slowdown in wealth management and other headwinds it chalked up to exceptional circumstances. Profit slid 38% during the quarter to 546 million Swiss francs ($602 million) as CS contended with its strongest foreign currency adversities in nearly a decade, along with higher credit loss provisioning and a one-off boost which had flattered last year’s numbers. That compared with a median forecast of 572 million francs from 17 analysts compiled by the Swiss bank. A year earlier, Credit Suisse received a 327 million franc revenue boost from the sale of its InvestLab fund platform. Despite the fall in profits the bank followed rival UBS UBSG.S in offering more to shareholders, scheduling up to 1.5 billion francs in share buybacks next year and a 5% rise in the 2020 dividend. Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein in July announced a round of cost cuts, including merging the global markets trading division and advisory-focused investment banking and capital markets unit, as his first major strategic stamp on the bank. The newly merged investment banking unit saw pretax profit rise to 370 million francs, with increased trading helping equity and fixed income sales and trading surge 5% and 10%, while capital markets and advisory revenue rose 33%. A drop in revenue at its international wealth management unit, a sore point in the second quarter, was more pronounced than analysts had anticipated. Shares fell more than 5% in early trade, hitting a five-month low, as analysts noted disappointing wealth management revenue. UBS last week posted a doubling of third-quarter profit as ultra-rich clients scrambled to trade and seal deals amid a boom in markets. Smaller peer Julius Baer BAER.S also reported strong client inflows. Unlike Credit Suisse, UBS derives a large portion of revenue from private banking in the United States, a major market which has seen solid growth yet is absent from CS’s otherwise largely global presence. At Credit Suisse, wealth management suffered from foreign currency moves and lacked one-off items such as the prior year’s InvestLab sale, without which revenue would have risen 5%. In international wealth management, covering clients outside Switzerland and Asia, bumper trading which has buoyed wealth managers throughout the pandemic failed to offset lower recurring commissions and fees, and falling net interest income. On conference calls executives conceded lower interest rates and a depressed dollar meant the unit would be more reliant on transaction revenues and higher lending to grow in coming quarters. The bank aims to grow profit by 10% annually in its international wealth division from next year, particularly through tighter collaboration with its investment bank and greater lending efforts. It earlier this month announced the hiring of former Bank of America Corp BAC.N investment bank chief Christian Meissner to co-lead the unit's advisory efforts. In its home market, where it is closing roughly a quarter of its branches, Credit Suisse saw adjusted revenue rise 1% during the quarter, recording similar gains in both its corporate business as with retail and private banking clients due to strong transaction activity. It hopes the introduction of a digital banking app challenging fintechs like Revolut will help grow its retail market share while saving on costs. Shares in CS have so far this year lost more than a quarter of their value, falling twice as much as those of UBS, but staying ahead of the European banking sector as a whole .SX7P."

28.345871355314102," Australia's Westpac flags $870.4 million hit to second-half cash earnings SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX said on Monday it would take an $870 million hit to cash earnings in the second half, due mostly to write-downs in the value of its life insurance business and the additional costs of a record fine. The announcement, one week before its full-year results and dividend announcement are due, added uncertainty about the ability of the country’s second-largest bank to resume investment payouts. The A$1.22 billion ($870.4 million) hit to cash earnings also includes an increase in provisions related to customer refunds and litigation, and a write-down for capitalised software, the bank said. Credit Suisse said the separate write-downs and provisions were already expected by analysts, following the A$1.3 billion settlement announced last month for allowing illicit payments, for which the lender set a further A$415 million aside. In aggregate, however, they “may contain some ‘sticker shock’” for the market, Credit Suisse said. Westpac this year became the only one of Australia’s four major banks to slash dividend payments in the first half of the year, as it took the largest bad-debt provisions of all majors for possible losses in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. That has left it with one of the weakest capital positions of the four majors. In total, the announced charges and provisions will reduce the bank’s common equity tier 1 ratio by 24 basis points, Westpac said. About A$568 million of goodwill will be written off at Westpac Life Insurance Services and Westpac’s Auto Finance business. A further A$182 million will top up its customer remediation provision, the bank added. An A$26 million pre-tax gain on the sale of its stake in Zip Co Ltd Z1P.AX in the first half of fiscal 2021 partially offset the other write-downs, Westpac said. It will report full-year results and its dividend decision on Nov. 2."
30.87881271226879," Mozambique to seek extradition of ex-Credit Suisse bankers involved in $2 billion debt scandal JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Mozambique's Attorney General's Office said on Wednesday it will seek the extradition of three former Credit Suisse CSGN.S bankers implicated in a $2 billion debt scandal that sent the country's economy into crisis. Andrew Pearse, Detelina Subeva and Surjan Singh, who helped arrange the loans to Mozambique, all pleaded guilty in the United States last year to charges including conspiracy to violate U.S. anti-bribery laws and to commit money laundering and securities fraud in relation to their role in the affair. Lawyers for the three bankers did not immediately respond to requests for comment or could not immediately be reached. Mozambique would now seek their extradition after the country’s Supreme Court granted approval for the Attorney General’s Office to do so, a representative of the AGO told Reuters via WhatsApp. They said following the approval, the next steps would be to go through with the extradition request according to procedure, but did not elaborate on what that meant. The representative also did not immediately answer further questions about whether the three bankers had been charged with any crimes in Mozambique, though a report in state-owned newspaper Noticias said the government wants the trio to come to the country to face unspecified criminal charges. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the loans the bankers helped arrange went missing. The scandal prompted donors including the International Monetary Fund to cut off support to Mozambique, triggering a currency collapse and debt default. The southeast African nation remains on the hook for the money. It has charged a number of people in Mozambique with crimes in relation to the scandal, and is trying to get government guarantees for some of the loans overturned in court."

33.155337850854636," Swiss appeals court reverses acquittal of Credit Suisse climate protesters LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - A Swiss appeals court on Thurday reversed an earlier ruling that had acquitted 12 climate activists of trespassing at Credit Suisse on the grounds their actions were necessitated by the “imminent danger” of global warming. The surprise January verdict had inspired other acts of civil disobedience by climate protesters, including against banks financing fossil fuel projects, and was seen as setting an important precedent for follow-up cases. The case originally went to court after protesters, mostly students, refused to pay a fine for trespassing inside the bank in Nov. 2018. Dressed in tennis whites, they pretended to be tennis superstar Roger Federer to draw attention to his sponsorship deal with the bank which they want him to drop. Judge Christophe Maillard told the appeals court on Thursday that the danger of climate change was “imminent” but that the defendants could have used other means of protesting. He imposed fines of 100-150 Swiss francs ($108.15-$162.23) on each of the defendants. Prosecutor Eric Cottier, who led the appeal, voiced satisfaction with the outcome. “It is a warning in the sense that you need to respect the system like any other citizen in this country,” he told climate activists outside the court. Cottier was heckled by activists carrying tennis rackets. Marie-Pomme Moinat, a defence lawyer, said Thursday’s ruling “favours the interests of a bank to the detriment of our future and this sort of judgment causes us worry and despair. There is no doubt we will appeal it,” she said, to protesters’ cheers. Credit Suisse spokesman Jean-Paul Darbellay said the bank was committed to climate protection and had, for example, made at least 300 billion Swiss francs available for sustainable financing over 10 years. Lawyers for the activists had previously used a novel defence called “state of necessity”, saying their actions were required by the urgency of climate change, and the judge handling the original proceeding agreed. Switzerland’s climate is warming at about twice the pace of the global average and dramatically changing its famed mountain landscapes, breaking up once-mighty glaciers. As part of this week’s court proceeding, European scientists and experts submitted contributions to the defence to back up their claims, saying Switzerland was “lagging far behind” in implementing legislation to reduce greenhouse emissions. In another blow, climate protesters camped out illegally near parliament in the capital Bern were evacuated by police on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9246 Swiss francs)"

16.30339523396696," Credit Suisse tie-up takes back seat as UBS board meets ZURICH (Reuters) - The board of UBS UBSG.S is gathering to discuss strategy this week but a merger with Credit Suisse, which had recently been examined, is not on the official agenda, said a person familiar with the matter, suggesting subdued interest in the idea. The person said staff, working under UBS chairman Axel Weber, had examined the possibility of a tie-up with Credit Suisse CSGN.S in recent months but that such a deal was now considered internally as unlikely. Chances for a takeover of Credit Suisse have faded because the combined banks’ Swiss retail and investment bank would have to be pared back so as not to become a monopoly, while some wealthy clients also would likely leave, the person said. The examination of this scenario, widely reported this week, sets the backdrop for a meeting of the board of Switzerland’s biggest bank at its Wolfsberg conference centre near the German border. While the idea will doubtless be discussed by board members, some of whom will participate remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, it is not on the official agenda, indicating that Weber is putting it on the back burner. Both banks have declined to comment. Former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam, ousted in February over a spying scandal, previously floated the possibility of a back office tie-up between the country’s two big banks but the idea never took off. UBS, which is due to be run by former ING INGA.AS CEO Ralph Hamers from November, is on the lookout for growth opportunities in wealth management. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, under the new leadership of CEO Thomas Gottstein, has announced plans to cut costs particularly in investment banking and Swiss retail, and continues to be scrutinised over its spying scandal. A tie-up between Switzerland’s two largest lenders, both giants in banking for the world’s rich, could run afoul of regulations that seek to prevent banks from becoming too big to fail without damaging the financial system, according to the source. Such a big deal would also be complex to carry out, he added. ZKB analyst Jose Javier Lodeiro said there was some logic to a merger because the banks’ profits have been sinking for years. “But even with the recent rumours, we don’t expect a large-scale merger to actually occur,” Lodeiro said, adding many client advisers - valued for their close ties with rich customers - would likely depart."

20.66097345673823," Credit Suisse launches Switzerland's first major digital banking rival ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse will launch a digital banking app in October challenging fintechs like Revolut in the Swiss bank’s home market by offering free foreign transactions and fully digital wealth management, the bank said on Thursday. Credit Suisse’s new CSX banking app will offer free online banking from next month, a move it hopes will attract new customers to more lucrative services it will add over coming months, including taking out mortgages, making investments and planning pensions, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said. “We want to grow with our clients,” Swiss head Andre Helfenstein told journalists. “We thought we needed to do more for young people.” Digital competitors like Britain’s Revolut and Germany’s N26 have amassed millions of customers and billion-dollar valuations by offering cheap, user-friendly alternatives to traditional banking services. Undercutting incumbents on pricing for foreign exchange, stock trading and money transfers, they are particularly popular with younger customers. Credit Suisse’s move makes it the first major bank to roll out a comprehensive digital package in Switzerland, with a fully digital wealth management service to be added to the app in November. “CSX falls somewhere in the upper mid-level of what’s available,” said Ingo Rauser, head of business consultancy Capco, adding basic capabilities rivalled those of online-only “neobanks”. “But, in contrast to the neobanks, Credit Suisse can draw from its full range with digital versions of its investment and pension products in a next step.” Credit Suisse aims to cut costs in its Swiss retail business by closing roughly a quarter of its branches, while bringing in new customers --- particularly in the younger client segment, where it says it has catch-up work to do -- by expanding upon other digital solutions in the market. That will include “digital bars” where customers can receive advice and connect to specialists via video conference, as well as co-working and event spaces to attract start-ups and entrepreneurs. Cash withdrawals at ATM machines are not covered by the free version of the app, but clients who do so regularly can reduce costs via a premium version costing 3.95 Swiss francs ($4.34) a month. That undercuts rival UBS’s banking package for general Swiss retail customers, priced from 10 francs a month. ($1 = 0.9105 Swiss francs)"

Credit Suisse’s new CSX banking app will offer free online banking including a free-of-charge online debit card and other capabilities to be rolled out over months enabling customers to take out mortgages, make investments and plan their pensions, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said. Digital competitors like Britain’s Revolut and Germany’s N26 have amassed millions of customers and billion-dollar valuations by offering cheap, user-friendly alternatives to traditional banking services. Undercutting incumbents on pricing for foreign exchange, stock trading and money transfers, they are particularly popular with younger customers. Credit Suisse aims to cut costs in its Swiss retail business by closing roughly a quarter of its branches, while bringing in new customers --- particularly in the younger client segment, where it says it has catch-up work to do -- by expanding upon other digital solutions in the market and offering brick-and-mortar presence to those seeking it. Its CSX app will roll out a fully digital wealth management service in mid-November, it said. Cash withdrawals at ATM machines are not covered by the app, but clients who do so regularly can reduce costs via a Mastercard debit card that costs 3.95 Swiss francs ($4.34) a month. Branches in the future will offer “digital bars”, while specialists will provide personal advice via video conference, Credit Suisse said. Some locations will offer co-working spaces as well as “event zones” designed to attract start-ups and other event organisers."
26.936449274093494," Evidence of further surveillance at Credit Suisse mounts up - SonntagsZeitung ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S may have spied on more employees under its former chief executive Tidjane Thiam, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday, citing evidence of two further instances that had previously been undisclosed. Switzerland’s market watchdog, FINMA, opened an enforcement case on Wednesday over the spying scandal to examine the bank’s culture and governance and whether management control failures allowed snooping on former executive board members. Revelations of corporate espionage had rocked the discreet world of Swiss banking last year when it emerged that Credit Suisse had been spying on former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who was leaving for rival UBS UBSG.S, and former human resources head Peter Goerke. The bank had hoped that the departure of Thiam over the scandal and his replacement with Thomas Gottstein, a Credit Suisse veteran, would draw a line under the affair. SonntagsZeitung, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, said that two further instances had come to light. One was connected with an employee in Asia, who had made threats against other bank employees; and one was connected with a former high-level manager and an employee with whom the manager may have had intimate relations in the United States, SonntagsZeitung reported. The paper cited one source as saying neither the bank’s executive committee nor board of directors had been aware of the two instances. A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment on the SonntagsZeitung report, referring to the bank’s statement from Wednesday which said it was cooperating with FINMA and seeking to “incorporate lessons learned”. It reiterated that spying was not part of its culture. FINMA declined to comment on ongoing proceedings, referring to its statement from Wednesday, in which it said it will pursue indications of violations of supervisory law and, in particular, the question of how these activities were documented and controlled. Gottstein, who stepped in after Thiam left his role at the head of Switzerland’s second-biggest bank in February, had said FINMA’s ramp-up of proceedings had been expected after an auditor visited the bank in recent months. Credit Suisse had tried to remove the FINMA-appointed auditor, Thomas Werlen, because his law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan had been involved in legal cases against it. Its appeal of a lower court decision backing his appointment is pending in the Swiss Federal Supreme Court."

18.579251608247123," Switzerland raises the stakes for Credit Suisse in spy affair ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland has opened an enforcement case against Credit Suisse over a spying scandal that led to the ouster of its former CEO, a rare challenge to one of the country’s major lenders. The move means deeper public scrutiny of Credit Suisse’s top brass as markets watchdog FINMA examines its culture and governance and whether management control failures allowed snooping on former executive board members. FINMA said on Wednesday it will pursue indications of violations of supervisory law and, in particular, the question of how these activities were documented and controlled. Such processes often take a few months, the agency said. Credit Suisse said it would cooperate “to ensure a complete and expeditious conclusion of the review of this episode and incorporate lessons learned.” The move is a set-back for Chairman Urs Rohner who is due to step down in 2021 after about a dozen years as head of the board. Revelations of corporate espionage rocked the discreet world of Swiss banking last year when it emerged Credit Suisse had been spying on former wealth management boss Khan, who was leaving for rival UBS, and former human resources head Peter Goerke. The bank had hoped that the departure of former Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam over the scandal and his replacement with Thomas Gottstein, a Credit Suisse veteran, would draw a line under the affair. An internal Credit Suisse probe concluded that Thiam didn’t know about the spying, and that Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee was responsible. Bouee, a longtime confidant of Thiam, was fired late last year and has not commented publicly on the scandal. The Swiss watchdog’s rules allow it to take action against individuals if it finds that a bank broke its own internal communication rules or if it strayed from its usual framework for recording management decisions. Among actions FINMA could take include forcing Credit Suisse to comply with supervisory laws if it finds violations, issue industry bans or even file a complaint with criminal authorities. It cannot levy fines. Its decision to take enforcement proceedings comes after it hired an auditor to review the bank’s corporate governance and its use of electronic communications in connection with the surveillance. Credit Suisse tried to remove the auditor, Thomas Werlen, because his law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan had been involved in legal cases against it. Credit Suisse’s appeal of a lower court decision that backed his appointment is pending in the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. FINMA declined to comment on how Credit Suisse’s appeal and the pending court decision could impact its enforcement proceedings. Credit Suisse reiterated on Wednesday that spying on employees was not part of its culture."

13.673664368432156," Credit Suisse applied for banking licence in Spain after Brexit MADRID (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S has applied for a licence to set up an investment bank hub in Madrid after Britain has left the European Union, a spokesman said on Monday confirming a report from Spanish newspaper Expansion. The Swiss lender sought a licence from the Bank of Spain and the European Central Bank in July to upgrade its brokerage in the country to a bank, the spokesman said confirming the article that quoted Wenceslao Bunge, Credit Suisse’s chief for Spain and Portugal. The bank expects to get the licence within a year and to be fully operational by mid 2021. In July, the EU’s banking watchdog told banks using Britain as a gateway to the European Union to fully execute their plans for serving EU customers before a Brexit transition period ends in December. Britain left the EU in January, but financial firms have unfettered access across the bloc under transition arrangements that end on December 31.. Credit Suisse said in a statement its priority has always been to ensure it maintained access to European Union clients and markets regardless of the outcomes of the Brexit process. “Over the last three years, we have added to our existing capabilities in Spain, Germany and Luxembourg to provide this continuity for our clients. London will remain a key part of the bank’s strategy and footprint after the UK’s exit from the EU,” the bank said. The decision to move part of its operations to Madrid was made after considering costs, employees’ preferences among other factors, Bunge told Expansion. “We believe in the country and the advantages it offers. Spain has a very important competitiveness position,” he said. Many big banks have already opened up hubs in Frankfurt, Paris and elsewhere in the bloc to continue serving customers there, while EU banks in London like ING have begun shifting some staff home.

Announced on Tuesday, the overhaul is the latest stage in a revamp of the lender’s Swiss retail business and will see the bank fold subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank into its overall Credit Suisse brand and close about a quarter of its branches across the country. It is part of a group-wide 400 million franc savings package unveiled at the end of July. “The changes to Credit Suisse’s branch network across Switzerland, including branches in Canton Aargau, are expected to be implemented by the end of 2020,” Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said in a statement. “With a goal of 109 locations - compared to 146 at present -Credit Suisse will continue to have a strong regional presence in the future.” Other European lenders have also announced branch closures as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the switch to digital banking. Credit Suisse is also hoping to attract younger clients by launching a new digital offering in October. “Historically, we’re less well established with younger customers,” Swiss executive Andre Helfenstein told journalists on a call. “We want to make a step forward in this area.” The Swiss Bank Employees Union on Tuesday urged the bank to avoid dismissals at least until the end of 2020 and criticised it for announcing restructuring during great economic uncertainty and despite solid financial results. Helfenstein said the bank would do its best to offer affected personnel - primarily in the region of Aargau but also elsewhere in Switzerland - new roles, adding further positions would be generated as the bank reinvests in its digital push.

0.9856612931857122," Credit Suisse eyes cooperation with insurers: Rohner ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S is looking to expand cooperation with insurers, Chairman Urs Rohner told a Sunday newspaper, adding the search for his successor at Switzerland's second-biggest bank was well under way. “In the retail business in particular, there will be more partnerships with us. There are good examples abroad of how insurance and banking services can be merged, such as Ping An in China,” SonntagsZeitung quoted him as saying in an interview. “Working with third parties is interesting, but we always have to be careful to protect the strength of our brand. This is particularly important for very wealthy customers.” He said cooperation projects may cover insurance, credit cards or events, which could help improve access to younger retail clients. Rohner, whose term ends next year, said the bank’s succession planning continued. “I am confident that we will find a good solution in a timely way,” he said, adding the candidate’s name would be announced as soon as a decision was made. Rohner said the government and private sector should be planning now how to help companies while the coronavirus pandemic continues, noting emergency Swiss state-backed loans that provided quick liquidity would not suffice. “It would be wrong to believe that the aid we have decided so far has let us already master the economic consequences of the crisis. I suggest we start thinking now about how we can give the economy new impetus. The crisis will preoccupy us all of next year.”"

The move is the latest in a string of announcements by banks looking to display their green credentials and capture demand for cash from companies to help a shift to a low-carbon economy. Governments around the world are tightening rules on industry to try to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Credit Suisse also said it would cut exposure to the oil and gas sector, including restricting lending and capital markets underwriting to companies operating in thermal coal extraction, coal-fired power generation and Arctic drilling. Specifically, the bank said it would stop financing any onshore or offshore oil and gas projects in the Arctic, and stop lending to companies making more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal mining or coal power. The move follows a similar announcement by Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, which this week said it would stop business altogether with companies making more than half their revenues from coal mining. Credit Suisse also said it would also give “enhanced consideration” to biodiversity in both its lending and capital markets business, without giving details. The bank’s action comes as part of a broader overhaul which will bring together global markets and investment banking in a single business and make changes to international wealth management. This includes creating a divisional unit focused on sustainability."

With costs of around 17 billion Swiss francs ($18.63 billion), this meant around 400 million francs in annual savings, he said after Credit Suisse announced an overhaul of its investment bank and beat profit forecasts in its results on Thursday. “We look at where there are duplicates and inefficiencies that can be remedied without compromising,” said Gottstein, citing the example of merging the risk and compliance functions. The rest of the savings would come from other group-wide functions, as well as its business in wealth management, Asia, and reducing the branch network in Switzerland. “With higher digitisation and automated processes, we can basically get even more out of it. However, we will reinvest all of these savings in the business,” said Gottstein, who took over as CEO from Tidjane Thiam in February. Looking ahead, Gottstein said the bank’s M&A business was only seeing a slow pick-up in activity, but he expected high market volatility to continue which was good for the bank’s trading business. “I am also convinced that the capital market will continue to be active. Companies have to refinance themselves, many through capital increases,” he told the newspaper. “And as far as private banking is concerned, we were able to increase sales in the first half of the year by 4% and even currency-adjusted by 7%, which is very solid in this environment.

Credit Suisse has been expanding its energy coverage for some time now. While confirming the memo, a company spokesman said the latest move will help the bank bridge the gap between its different sub-sectors in energy. The changes also come at a time when a growing number of traditional oil and gas companies like European oil majors BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are trying to transition towards renewables and other ‘cleaner’ sources of energy. “The new group will be optimally positioned to work with our clients seamlessly across the entire spectrum of energy, utilities, renewables and infrastructure while allowing us to better capitalize on opportunities for the Firm in areas such as the ongoing energy transition,” the memo said. The new ‘energy and infrastructure’ group will be led by company veteran Tom Greenberg, who co-headed Credit Suisse’s global oil and gas business, and Jonathon Kaufman, who joined the bank from rival Deutsche Bank AG in 2014 and was recently appointed as head of the global infrastructure, utilities and renewables group.

-10.03824422515523," Credit Suisse to merge investment banking units; second-quarter profit beats ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S trounced quarterly profit expectations and unveiled an overhaul of its investment bank on Thursday, as Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein puts his first major strategic stamp on the lender. Global markets, where frenzied trading powered a 24% jump in group net profit, is to be merged with investment banking in a shift away from the structure introduced by previous CEO Tidjane Thiam, who repositioned the lender to focus on wealth management and split the investment bank into separate divisions. Gottstein, who took over as CEO in February, wants to generate approximately 400 million francs in annual savings from 2022 onwards through the revamp, which is also to include Swiss branch closures and a combination of its compliance and risk functions. The chief executive said jobs would be cut across all regions but new jobs would also be added, including in wealth management, where he is aiming to grow profits by 10% annually in the group’s standalone wealth division from next year, according to an internal memo. Gottstein said overall headcount would stay roughly the same. The investment banking integration also includes its Asia-Pacific markets business, which previously sat under a regional division. Re-confirming a number of financial targets, and setting investment bank capital allocation at one-third of group total, the bank said it was planning to pay the second half of its 2019 dividend later this year and consider share buyback plans following a shareholder vote on the dividend in November. Shares reversed early morning gains to trade down 0.5% by 1018GMT. Rival UBS UBSG.S earlier this month signalled the possibility of resuming share buybacks later this year after a stronger-than-expected performance from its investment bank helped it beat expectations for the quarter. As part of the overhaul, Credit Suisse also said it would carve out an executive-level sustainability group and earmark more than $300 billion for sustainable finance. M&A SHINES Credit Suisse has faced criticism over the drag of its capital-intensive investment banking operations, which typically generate far less income than wealth management versus their costs, but has insisted the activities are necessary to service its ultra-wealthy clients. Both its trading and dealmaking units have hurt results over recent years, with trading marking an improvement in late 2018, just as its dealmaking began to slide. However, the units performed well in the second quarter ahead of the integration, as a surge in trading activity and companies shoring up their balance sheet meant group earnings were nearly double the mean estimate for 700 million Swiss francs in the bank’s own poll of 17 analysts. The bank posted a 71% rise in profit at its global markets division, fuelled by a 42% jump in fixed income revenue. The investment bank’s profit also jumped, with a strong rise in earnings across debt and equity underwriting as well as from advising on M&A deals - outperforming much of Wall Street which saw advisory revenue fall. Wealth management, meanwhile, saw earnings flag slightly after bumper trading in the first quarter, with its international wealth management unit posting a 22% drop in profit as lower rates ate into margins and it set aside money for potential loan losses. The bank’s Asia division posted a record quarterly profit of 298 million Swiss francs, driven by investment banking."
-10.03824422515523," Breakingviews - Credit Suisse takes right leaf out of rival’s book LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Credit Suisse has already been through the wringer. Former Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam cut 4.3 billion Swiss francs ($4.7 billion) of costs at the Zurich-based lender between 2015 and 2019. Now, his successor, Thomas Gottstein, will make further annual savings of 400 million francs, merge his investment banking units and may shrink the proportion of capital allocated to that business. His plan, which amounts to mimicking UBS, is likely to narrow a valuation discount to the local rival. It may seem like an odd time to re-examine the group’s markets and banking businesses. Second-quarter results on Thursday showed that Gottstein’s traders and bankers brought in 33% and 61% more revenue respectively compared with a year earlier. Yet that performance will prove fleeting: markets are quieter and pandemic-hit companies seem to have raised all the cash they need for now. Credit Suisse’s battered valuation, by contrast, would prove more long-lasting without action by Gottstein. He initially ruled out major structural changes after taking over from Thiam in February, but he has little choice: the bank trades at 57% of tangible book value, compared with UBS’s 82%. Gottstein inherited outsized investment banking and trading businesses compared with his Swiss rival. Those volatile units, which merit a lower valuation multiple, brought in 43% of group revenue on average over the past three years, compared with 26% at UBS. They consume about two-fifths of Credit Suisse’s risk-weighted assets, UBS analysts reckon, compared with one-third at the bigger Swiss bank. The new plan offers hope. Merging investment banking and trading, and folding in the Asian trading operations, will boost transparency. It would make sense for Gottstein to focus cost cuts on businesses offering debt, equity and M&A advice: they had a higher cost base last year than in 2015, after stripping out one-offs. Finally, his ambition to allocate two-thirds of capital to wealth management over time means sidelining capital-intensive trading operations. There’s still scope to improve. Gottstein wants to reinvest his savings, whereas shareholders might prefer to receive them in the form of buybacks or dividends. But it’s a step in the right direction. Credit Suisse would be worth 45% more than its current 23.1 billion franc market capitalisation if the lender were to trade on UBS’s multiple of tangible book value. Imitation looks like the surest route to riches."

-10.03824422515523," Credit Suisse wealth management revamp aims for 10% profit boost: memo ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S is hoping a revamp of its international wealth management, tightening its regional structure and centralising advisory and lending, will help the unit grow profits by 10% annually from next year, the bank said in an internal memo on Thursday. Both Credit Suisse and its international wealth management (IWM) unit have been under fresh leadership over the past year, since an acrimonious fall-out between former IWM head Iqbal Khan which led to Khan leaving for rival UBS UBSG.S last summer and in February cost former CEO Tidjane Thiam his job. On Thursday, the bank announced it was wrapping its global markets and investment banking divisions into a single unit, and reported an 24% rise in second quarter net profit. Wealth management saw earnings flag after bumper trading in the first quarter, as lower rates ate into margins and as the bank set aside money for potential loan losses. In the internal memo seen by Reuters, wealth management executive Philipp Wehle said the unit would create three new strategic groups, concentrating its lending activities within an International Financing Group under Yves-Alain Sommerhalder, as well as setting up a new investment banking advisory group and a unit focused on sustainability. Wehle said the changes would help the lender scale its business. “This will allow us to take our client service to the next level and increase pretax income by 10% annually in the coming years,” he said in the memo. Also, in a move undoing Khan’s regional split from two years ago, Wehle said northern and southern Europe would be merged into one region, led by Robert Cielen, while the Middle East and Africa would be combined under the leadership of Bruno Daher. Growth is to be driven by revenue increases, both in emerging markets such as the Middle East as well as in mature European markets, through increased lending and investment banking advisory services for entrepreneurs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The unit is not looking at cost-cuts as a primary profitability driver, the person said, but will look to optimise efficiencies in certain areas to fund the growth initiatives. The new investment bank advisory group, led by Babak Dastmaltschi, will look to increase business primarily in Europe by serving entrepreneurs who own mid-sized companies, or privately held corporations with revenues between $50 million and $500 million, on corporate deals and bond and equity issuance. As well as promoting sustainable investments, the new sustainability group led by Emma Crystal could refine the bank’s lending activities, promoting those with sustainable impacts and restricting loans not aligned with responsible investment criteria, the person said. In Brazil, Marcello Chilov will take over the wealth manager’s operations, aiming to increase collaboration between investment banking and the private bank, as well as optimising its onshore and offshore capabilities. Emerging Europe, previously managed by Cielen, will be led by Anton Cherny. While asset management will see no change in leadership and structure, the unit will look to launch a number of new offerings, while certain “non-strategic businesses” will be “right-siz(ed)”. Further management changes, one level below the management committee, will be communicated on Aug. 20, the memo said. The moves will result in a slight reduction in the size of the management committee, two sources said, but will not focus on headcount adjustment across the unit.

Both Credit Suisse and its international wealth management (IWM) unit have been under fresh leadership over the past year, since an acrimonious fall-out between former IWM head Iqbal Khan which led to Khan leaving for rival UBS last summer and in February cost former CEO Tidjane Thiam his job. On Thursday, the bank announced it was wrapping its global markets and investment banking divisions into a single unit, and reported an 24% rise in second quarter net profit. In the internal memo seen by Reuters, wealth management executive Philipp Wehle said the unit would create three new strategic groups, concentrating its lending activities within an International Financing Group under Yves-Alain Sommerhalder, as well as setting up a new investment banking advisory group and a unit focused on sustainability. Speaking to both challenges and growth opportunities, Wehle said the changes would help the lender scale its business. “This will allow us to take our client service to the next level and increase pretax income by 10% annually in the coming years,” he said in the memo. Also, in a move undoing Khan’s regional split from two years’ ago, Wehle said northern and southern Europe would be merged into one single region, led by Robert Cielen, while the Middle East and Africa would be combined under the leadership of Bruno Daher. Growth is to be driven by revenue increases, both in emerging markets such as the Middle East as well as in mature European markets, through increased lending and investment banking advisory services for entrepreneurs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The unit is not looking at cost-cuts as a primary profitability driver, the person said, but will look to optimise efficiencies in certain areas to fund the growth initiatives. The new investment bank advisory group, led by Babak Dastmaltschi, will look to increase business primarily in Europe by serving entrepreneurs who own mid-sized companies, or privately-held corporations with revenues between $50 million and $500 million, on corporate deals and bond and equity issuance. As well as promoting sustainable investments, the new sustainability group could refine the bank’s lending activities, promoting activities aligned with sustainable impacts and restricting lending not aligned with responsible investment criteria, the person said. In Brazil, Marcello Chilov will take over the wealth manager’s operations, aiming to increase collaboration between investment banking and the private bank, as well as optimising its onshore and offshore capabilities. Emerging Europe, previously managed by Cielen, will be led by Anton Cherny. While asset management will see no change in leadership and structure, the unit will look to launch a number of new offerings, while certain “non-strategic businesses” will be “right-siz(ed)”. Further management changes, one level below the management committee, will be communicated on Aug. 20, the memo said. The moves will result in a slight reduction in the size of the management committee, two sources said, but will not focus on headcount adjustment across the unit. Over time, the number of client-facing relationship managers is expected to grow, particularly as the bank builds out its business in emerging markets, one person said.

Switzerland’s second-largest bank is also looking to hire more staff and invest in China, the world’s second-biggest economy, as its most significant business opportunity in the world, its APAC boss Helman Sitohang told Reuters. China has gained in relevance for Credit Suisse and other international banks after Beijing fast-tracked the opening of its financial markets to foreigner investors. After gaining 51% control of its securities joint venture in June and appointing Janice Hu as chairwoman, Credit Suisse aims to take on full ownership from Founder Securities as it seeks to build out its private and investment banking businesses. Credit Suisse has placed great faith in Hu, a “veteran investment banker” who has been with it for almost two decades, to grow its business in China, where the timing of it gaining full ownership of the venture is in the hands of regulators. The bank did not disclose the value of the joint venture. While it does not break down its business by individual markets, Asia-Pacific accounted for roughly one-fifth of its overall pre-tax income in 2019, with Greater China its most important market in the region. The bank ranks first in M&A revenues in Asia, excluding Japan, with a 12.4% market share for the first half of 2020, and first in investment banking revenues, with a 8.3% share, Dealogic says. In Asia-Pacific Credit Suisse not only competes with larger Zurich rival UBS UBSG.S, but also with other Swiss private banks including Geneva-based Pictet and listed lender Julius Baer BAER.S for wealth management business. Meanwhile in investment banking, Morgan Stanley MS.N and JPMorgan JPM.N are both major competitors, while Chinese investment bank CITIC Securities counts as a key rival in Asia. China is producing the most new billionaires and Credit Suisse last month hired a new head of wealth management for onshore China, Jing Wang, from China Merchants Bank. This followed two senior appointments this year for prime sales, and Credit Suisse is now looking to fill other key positions for its Chinese business over the next few months. “We will continue to invest across our platforms in China and closely integrate our onshore operations with our businesses in Hong Kong and across the region. There will be more hires, some of which we will announce shortly,” Sitohang said. “It is clearly about tactical hiring: We want to capture opportunities. We know exactly where these are, where we see the potential to improve, and that is what we are focused on,” the 54-year-old Singaporean native said from his office in Singapore. Hong Kong’s future as a global financial centre has been under scrutiny after the mainland Chinese government last month introduced tough new national security laws for the city. Some analysts suggest investors could shift money to other offshore hubs, like Singapore, to cushion the impact of the growing political and economic uncertainty. Sitohang reiterated Credit Suisse’s commitment to Hong Kong and said it had not registered any outflows. “Hong Kong has been an important hub for Credit Suisse for decades ... (and) there will be no changes to our presence,” Sitohang said, adding that it was an “integral part of our footprint for China overall”. As well as its role in the largest equity capital markets deal in Hong Kong last year with Alibaba's BABA.N secondary listing, Sitohang said Credit Suisse did another recently for Netease, NTES.O which was about $2.8 billion, as well as ""a couple of large bond deals"".

1.0607602400920164," UPDATE 1-Brazil's Cosan says reorganization may entail capitalization of all operating units (Adds Credit Suisse’s comments) SAO PAULO, July 7 (Reuters) - Brazilian energy company Cosan SA said on Tuesday its planned reorganization may involve fundraising by all the operating units it controls or co-controls, as it detailed a long-awaited move to simplify its corporate structure. The viability of the potential capitalizations of each of the units, which operate in segments such as energy, sugar and logistics, would be weighed separately and depend on variables the company does not control, Cosan said in a securities filing. Cosan’s reorganization was a long time coming, Credit Suisse said in a note to clients on Monday, and could potentially bring upside to shareholders of entities such as Cosan Limited and Cosan Logística. After the restructuring, Cosan would still be controlled by owner Rubens Ometto through the family’s investment vehicle, Credit Suisse said. Cosan said the restructuring should be completed in about 180 days and depends on several approvals, including that of all stake holders as well as Brazilian and U.S. capital market regulators. On the potential IPOs of Cosan’s subsidiaries and co-controlled companies Raízen and Compass, Credit Suisse said assuming both entities would have a minimum 25% free float, “the capital raise would have to be very substantial.” Credit Suisse said it values Raízen and Compass equities at respectively 51 billion reais ($9.63 billion) and 8.3 billion reais ($1.57 billion)."

Banco Safra SA, Banco BV, BTG Pactual and Banco Alfa SA are also in talks with state development bank BNDES, which is leading efforts to assemble the emergency loans, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Itaú Unibanco SA, Banco Bradesco SA, Santander Brasil SA and Banco do Brasil have already joined the syndicate, the sources said. BTG Pactual and Bradesco declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. More than 10 unidentified banks are in talks to take part in the so-called “COVID account,” BNDES President Gustavo Montezano said on Wednesday. Costs for the five-year loans will be passed on to consumers through electric bills, according to energy sector regulator Aneel, noting that the interest rate has yet to be determined. The loans are set to benefit companies including those controlled by Italy’s Enel Spa, Spain’s Iberdrola , Portugal’s EDP and China’s State Grid, in addition to major local utilities such as Cemig, Equatorial Energia SA and Energisa SA. Caixa Econômica Federal withdrew from the transaction, someone involved in the bank talks said. “BNDES, BB, Santander, Itau and Bradesco are the cornerstone of the operation. They are likely to get the biggest tickets,” the source said. Those five banks have more incentives to participate because of their significant exposure to the Brazilian power sector.

The Swiss investment bank expects a swift global recovery from the coronavirus crisis, with the steepest rebounds in Europe and the U.S., and encouraged clients to seek out risk. The call follows similarly bullish forecasts from Morgan Stanley and Citi, among others, just as global markets pause a rally that has carried world stocks some 40% higher since March. “We think investors should be engaged in markets, and pro-risk in general,” Ray Farris, Credit Suisse’s chief investment officer for South Asia, told journalists on a conference call. With monetary policy accommodative and signs of recovery in growth, underperforming markets - such as Asian equities - will find support, Farris said, calling out Hong Kong in particular. Issues from U.S.-China tensions to discontent on the streets have hit prices hard, despite most Hong Kong-listed stocks being exposed to China far more than to the local economy. “That bad news is very much in prices,” Farris said. “Hong Kong, at these valuations, is an attractive, interesting opportunity.” The bank also pointed out Asian investment-grade credit spreads are about 130 basis points wider than those in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve has been buying - a gap it expects to close as liquidity fans out to Asia in coming months. It also expects the U.S. dollar to weaken to $1.2000 per euro over the next 12 months as European economies recover. It forecast the dollar falling to 1.34 Singapore dollars and 6.90 yuan, moves beneficial for local trade balances and likely to lure investors.

In mid-March, as the S&P 500 .SPX plummeted 34% from its peak, TVIX's total net assets temporarily swelled to more than $6 billion, and the ETN traded as high as $1,000 a share. TVIX, along with the other ETNs, will be delisted as of July 12. Credit Suisse will suspend further issuance of TVIX on July 3. Previously issued notes will remain outstanding and may trade over the counter. On Monday, TVIX shares were trading 2.4% higher at $159.55."

This favourable situation is attributable to risk reduction and, in particular, to the build-up of capital buffers over recent years,” it said, adding these development fell in line with ‘too big to fail’ regulations. UBS and Credit Suisse had until the end of 2019 to prepare so-called resolution plans that would prevent taxpayers from having to bail them out in the event of a crisis. The Swiss National Bank (SNB), which helps oversee the stability of the country’s financial system, said thanks to capital build-up, the two banks would be able to cope with significantly worse economic developments than assumed under its baseline scenario. It said it expected a number of domestically focused banks to incur losses as their profitability fell from an already low level, adding a longer and deeper downturn would have a more negative impact on the quality of domestically focused lenders’ loan portfolios."

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank was also seeing a “very high degree” of appetite from its corporate customers to refinance themselves either through equity or debt, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers said, adding capital markets activity was picking up across the market.

-4.566212901673138," Risk-taking billionaires offer rich reward for Credit Suisse ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S is banking on risk-taking billionaires to drive revenue growth at its wealth management division. While most private banking clients are trying to shield their wealth from the coronavirus uncertainty by buying hedges or shifting into cash, the world’s super-rich are using the market tumult as an opportunity to bargain-hunt for acquisitions and invest in higher-risk assets such as stock options and high-yield bonds. Philipp Wehle, the head of Credit Suisse’s international wealth management division, estimates this sort of activity could bring in around $400 million in additional revenues between now and the end of 2022. “My ambition for strategic clients is to double the growth contribution over the next three years,” said the German native, who took over as Credit Suisse’s top banker for international jet-setters last July after former boss Iqbal Khan left to head wealth at UBS. “We, myself included, are now having more discussions with clients on how to invest or reinvest into the markets, how to build strategic positions,” he said. “Some of our strategic clients are looking to go into more risky assets, after deleveraging before.” “This trend is visible from conversations with ultra wealthy clients but also from business activity we were seeing. The level of transactions in April was still above pre-crisis levels.” Wehle’s division grew revenues 6% to 1.5 billion francs in the first quarter due to clients trading more. The division accounts for just under half of the bank’s overall pre-tax profit. Credit Suisse set aside $1 billion to cover the impact of the coronavirus, primarily to its corporate lending business, in the first quarter. Lending to wealthy clients, a business built up under previous CEO Tidjane Thiam, was reined in as markets went into freefall in March and some share-backed loans faced margin calls. “At the peak of the crisis, there were some shortfalls and margin calls. They have been mitigated down to almost zero at this stage, without material losses so far,” Wehle said. While single-stock lending--often deemed a more high risk business--had been more active before the crisis, Wehle said such lending was still on offer, with the unit recently undertaking a major single stock transaction with a long-standing emerging market client. As company valuations have dropped, ultra-wealth clients are also looking to build strategic stakes in companies. “There is more interest now in terms of conducting smaller acquisitions,” said Wehle. “Our ultra wealthy clients across all regions are asking: are there good opportunities that are priced right? Are there undervalued companies where we can build a stake?”"

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank had sought to scuttle watchdog FINMA’s appointment of Thomas Werlen, of international law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on grounds the firm and Werlen lacked sufficient independence. “Credit Suisse can confirm that it is having the ruling of the Federal Administrative Court reviewed by the Federal Supreme Court,” the bank said in a statement after the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported the appeal. “Like before, the focus is on the question of the independence of the law firm Quinn Emanuel, which has been appointed to conduct the audit. We take the view that Quinn Emanuel does not meet the legal requirement of independence because it is engaged in numerous legal proceedings against the bank,” it added. Credit Suisse continued to cooperate fully with the appointed auditor, it said. In its probe, FINMA is examining whether management control failures led to snooping on two former executives in an affair which toppled former CEO Tidjane Thiam and sent shock waves through Swiss finance.

34.98787756607814," Credit Suisse CEO expects mid-term headcount reduction in post-COVID adjustment: NZZ ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S expects to get by with fewer staff in coming years as automation kicks off, Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein told Swiss newspaper NZZ, and as the bank positions itself toward more digital interactions and remote working in the post-COVID-19 world. “Medium-term, we will certainly be able to get by with fewer staff - primarily, as we continue to automate business,” Gottstein said in the interview, published on Saturday. “Many processes can still be streamlined. That is one of my priorities. But we also want to grow, especially in our business with very wealthy clients and in our Asian business.” Gottstein, the former head of Credit Suisse’s Swiss business, who became CEO in February, does not expect Credit Suisse to post a loss this year, even as he expects higher credit losses for the bank’s Swiss and international business in the next six to 12 months on global fallout of the coronavirus pandemic than the bank has seen over the past five years. “I’m convinced we will absorb (these losses) and are correctly positioned from a strategic standpoint,” he said, noting the bank’s return on tangible equity in the first quarter had exceeded its full-year target. Gottstein expects employees to spend 10%-20% of their time working from home in the future, he told the newspaper, leading to savings on office space. The bank will also benefit from a reduction in travel, as video conferencing takes off, he said, and in the future will operate fewer branches, as online banking receives a lasting boost following coronavirus lockdowns. “As universal banks, we can learn a great deal from (digital providers such as Revolut and N26), especially when it comes to offering customers services via digital channels in the simplest, quickest and most convenient way possible,” Gottstein said. “In the coming months, we will respond to these new competitors with various offerings.” Under Gottstein’s predecessor, Tidjane Thiam, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank had repositioned itself to focus on wealth management while whittling down its investment bank. Gottstein now sees “optimisation potential” within Credit Suisse’s investment banking and capital markets division, which has posted consecutive losses over recent quarters, but maintained the necessity of keeping the business."
34.17568067256248," Regulator asks for Credit Suisse directors' mobile data in spy inquiry: sources FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss regulators have requested electronic messaging data from the mobile phones of several Credit Suisse managers and supervisory board directors as part of a probe into spying at the bank, three people familiar with the matter said. Switzerland’s markets watchdog FINMA is examining the culture and governance at one of Europe’s largest banks and whether management control failures allowed spying on former executive board members Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke, the sources told Reuters. The sources did not identify which managers and board directors FINMA was seeking the mobile phone data for. FINMA declined to comment. Credit Suisse has been under investigation after revelations in September that it had hired a private investigator to spy on Khan, its former international wealth management head, and Goerke, which eventually led to the ousting of CEO Tidjane Thiam in February. Credit Suisse was trying to establish whether Khan was seeking to take clients with him in his move to rival bank UBS. The bank later apologised to Khan, saying no evidence was found. Reuters could not determine why Credit Suisse had spied on Goerke. Thiam, who has long said he was not aware of the activity, could not be reached for comment. Khan declined to comment, while Goerke could not be reached for comment. As part of the broader investigation, FINMA is examining whether people used encrypted messaging apps to hide some discussions, another person with knowledge of the inquiry told Reuters. “What they are more focused on now is who knew what, when, and who should have known,” said the person. Homburger, a Swiss law firm that investigated the affair for Credit Suisse last year, said at a press conference in October that it had been inhibited by the deletion of messages sent on an encrypted communication app Threema, used by the company’s then chief operations officer, Pierre-Olivier Bouee, and security personnel. Credit Suisse has publicly blamed Bouee for organising what it described as a rogue spying operation in which all executives and directors, including Thiam, were kept in the dark. “Credit Suisse made public statements on the observation matter on several occasions this year and last year and informed the public of the results of internal and external investigations,” a bank spokesman said in a statement to Reuters. “Due to the ongoing review by the investigating auditor appointed by Finma, with whom Credit Suisse has been cooperating since the beginning, we are not commenting further on the matter at this time,” the statement said. Bouee, who has not spoken publicly about the affair, could not be reached for comment. Urs Rohner, the chairman of Credit Suisse, had used Threema, two people familiar with the matter said. One added that Rohner had used it for personal use only. “The Chairman has never used Threema in a business context,” a spokesman for Credit Suisse said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday. FINMA has not accused anyone of wrongdoing as it continues to investigate. The Swiss watchdog’s rules allow it to take action against individuals if it finds that a bank broke its own internal communication rules or if it strayed from its usual framework for recording management decisions. Credit Suisse declined to comment on its policy on employees using messaging apps, which Reuters was unable to independently review."

17.77962349769245," Shareholder support for Credit Suisse chairman drops, successor search 'well under way' ZURICH (Reuters) - Shareholder support for Credit Suisse CSGN.S Chairman Urs Rohner dropped to its lowest level ever on Thursday, as Rohner told the Swiss bank's annual meeting that its search for his successor was well under way. Shareholders voted to re-elect Rohner for a final term in office with 77.5% support. The 21.6% opposition he faced was the highest in his nearly a decade as chairman. It follows a spying scandal that cost former CEO Tidjane Thiam his role in February and divided investors over who ultimately should bear responsibility in the bank’s highest ranks. “Having been a board member for 11 years now, I am standing for re-election as chairman for the last time today,” said Rohner, 60, who is due to step down next year having reached a maximum term on the board. “The Governance and Nominations Committee is leading the succession process for my function, which is well under way and progressing according to plan,” he told the meeting, which was hosted without shareholders physically present and broadcast online due to restrictions on gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Proxy adviser Ethos had recommended shareholders vote Rohner out for governance shortcomings, joining adviser Glass Lewis in asking investors to deny approving the leadership’s performance and to reject compensation proposals over reputational and other damages incurred last year. “We want a new chairman who will enter this from scratch, someone who does not have this entire legacy,” Ethos director Vincent Kaufmann told Reuters ahead of the meeting. At 79.61%, shareholders voted to approve the 2019 performance of directors and management at just a slightly higher rate than Rohner received. Shareholders approved all the bank’s proposals, including its revised dividend plan. Speaking publicly to shareholders for the first time, new Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein noted he would make restoring the bank’s reputation a priority. “Our reputation suffered during the winter months in particular, and our share price is not satisfactory for any of us,” he said. “I assure you that my management team and I, together with our employees, will do everything in our power to ensure that you, our valued shareholders, can once again look at our bank with pride and take satisfaction in our financial results.”"

36.926197465490226," Credit Suisse warns over coronavirus uncertainties after first-quarter earnings beat ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S has bulked up on provisions for expected credit losses and cautioned over uncertainty during the coronavirus outbreak, even as it posted a 75% rise in first-quarter net profit on Thursday, far outpacing expectations. The first major European lender to report earnings since the pandemic upended markets and brought businesses and economies to a halt, Credit Suisse said it built up over one billion Swiss francs in reserves during the quarter to reflect the challenging environment and pressure on oil prices. “I’m actually taking a lot of comfort in how we have managed so far in this crisis... We are very cautious, we are very aware of the overall slowdown in the economy,” said Thomas Gottstein, presenting the bank’s results for the first time since taking over as chief executive from Tidjane Thiam in February. “But I’m not losing any sleep.” Thiam quit after a scandal over spying on senior executives hit the bank’s reputation. Credit Suisse saw net profit rise to 1.314 billion Swiss francs ($1.35 billion) for January-March, well above analyst expectations for 997 million francs. Earnings were helped by tax rebates and one-off gains, and as a boost to trading revenue from volatile markets and “exceptionally high levels of client activity” helped cushion a rout in deal-making. Excluding one-off items, a 2% gain in revenue was erased in pre-tax income as provisions for credit losses increased seven-fold. U.S. banks have already set aside billions of dollars to cover potential loan defaults due to the virus, and other European lenders are expected to do likewise when they start reporting results over the next two weeks. “It’s clear that in the short term, over the next two or three quarters, with COVID-19 and the impact of it, (returns) are going to be challenged,” said Gottstein. Credit Suisse, which generates the bulk of profit from managing money for the rich, said its corporate lending business was starting to see some signs of stress. Provisions for credit losses jumped to 568 million francs from 81 million francs in the first quarter of 2019, as each of the bank’s divisions - led by investment banking - increased expectations for loan losses. Of the total, 376 million francs related to new U.S. accounting guidelines introduced in January. “We view these as decent results, with a good revenue and cost performance,” Citi analysts said in a client note, adding cost of risk appeared to have been front-loaded. Credit Suisse shares pared back early trading gains to fall 1.1% by 0815 GMT. The bank’s capital ratio fell to 12.1% from 12.7%, in part due to companies drawing down from their credit facilities. Chief Financial Officer David Mathers said the bank broadly expected a ratio of around 11.5% for the year. Its investment banking and capital markets division posted a 47% drop in revenue to 189 million francs as deal-making and IPOs ground to a standstill after a bumper start. However, its global markets trading division benefited from a spike in trading volume as frenzied markets pivoted sharply downward - with slighter upward spikes - as investors reacted to evolving news about the virus’ spread and authorities’ reactions. The investment bank saw $147 million of mark-to-market losses in its leveraged underwriting portfolio and net losses of $51 million on hedges in uncollateralised corporate derivatives exposure. The bank overall saw roughly $11 billion of drawdowns on corporate revolving credit facilities. Fixed income revenue was up 17% to $1.2 billion, helped by higher volume in macro and global credit products, though unrealised loss in leveraged finance offset some of the gains. Equities revenue was up 22% on the year. International Wealth Management, the bank’s only standalone wealth division, meanwhile, benefited from higher levels of client activity, with revenue up 6% to 1.5 billion francs. Assets under management fell by 0.1 trillion francs to 1.4 trillion francs as a result of negative market moves. The fall in managed assets is widely expected to hurt earnings in coming quarters, as the bank generates lower fees from managing fewer assets. Prior to the bank’s January-March results, analysts had on average expected full-year net income to fall by a quarter to 2.6 billion francs. Larger rival UBS UBSG.S has said it expects to report a first-quarter profit of around $1.5 billion on Tuesday."

The envoy team, which was named by the AU chairman, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, also includes former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, and Donald Kaberuka, former president and chairman of the African Development Bank. Manuel is now chairman of insurer Old Mutual. Ivory Coast-born banker Thiam left Credit Suisse in February this year after a scandal over the surveillance of another executive. The envoys will be tasked with “soliciting rapid and concrete support” pledged by the G20, the European Union and other financial institutions, the AU said in a statement. “These institutions need to support African economies that are facing serious economic challenges with a comprehensive stimulus package for Africa, including deferred debt and interest payments,” Ramaphosa was quoted as saying. Thiam is one of several prominent Africans who has called for a standstill on debt to private creditors amid the outbreak of coronavirus, which threatens many African economies already facing headwinds from factors such as plummeting oil prices. In just two years from 2015 to 2017, African external debt payments doubled from an average of 5.9% of government revenue to 11.8%. At 32%, the proportion of debt owed to private lenders is almost equal to the 35% owed to multilateral institutions.

17.512269506482948," UBS and Credit Suisse bow to regulator pressure on dividends ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss banks UBS UBSG.S and Credit Suisse CSGN.S will postpone paying out part of their 2019 dividends until later this year after mounting pressure from authorities over lenders' payouts during the coronavirus epidemic. The move follows bank dividend cancellations or postponements across much of Europe as regulators have heaped pressure on lenders to conserve profits and capital in order to assist the economy. The two banks were the remaining major European lenders to resist requests to change their dividend policy. But they stopped short of steps taken by British and euro zone banks who have either suspended or canceled all their 2019 payouts. Switzerland’s two biggest banks said their strong capital and liquidity positions would have allowed them to support the Swiss economy and their clients in the crisis while also paying out their dividends, but were bowing to requests from Swiss financial markets watchdog FINMA. “Our financial strength well above regulatory requirements and prudent risk management allow us to deliver on our current capital returns policy,” UBS Chairman Axel Weber said in a statement. “Nevertheless, at FINMA’s request, we have adjusted the 2019 dividend payout proposal given the high and unprecedented uncertainty.” The regulator had warned banks not to pay out dividends in order to conserve capital to lend to companies during an economic downturn caused by coronavirus restrictions. It toughened its stance last week by blocking upcoming dividend payments from capital relief measures. “We believe that this response to FINMA’s request, in alignment with the similar decisions made by our peers, is a prudent and responsible step,” Credit Suisse said. Both Credit Suisse and UBS are participating in a Swiss government emergency loan scheme to support businesses hit by the pandemic. UBS said it had already provided 2.1 billion Swiss francs ($2.2 billion) in liquidity to more than 16,000 mostly small- and medium-sized companies. UBS also offered a sweetener to investors, saying it expected on April 28 to report a rise in first-quarter net profit to around $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion a year ago. Credit Suisse confirmed upbeat trading updates given last month. UBS said it intended to pay out its dividend of $0.73 in two installments, half of it as a regular dividend and the rest as a special dividend - to be separately approved by shareholders on Nov. 19 - after the publication of its third-quarter results. Credit Suisse will propose a cash distribution of 0.1388 francs per share at its upcoming annual shareholders’ meeting, half its original proposal, and a second distribution of the same amount to be approved by an extraordinary shareholder meeting in the third quarter of 2020. FINMA said it welcomed the banks’ decisions."

26.306641204447327," Citi replaces Credit Suisse in WeDoctor's $1 billion Hong Kong IPO: sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N has picked up a senior role on the WeDoctor initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong that could be worth up to $1 billion after Credit Suisse CSGN.S was dropped from the deal, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The deal, slated to occur later this year dependent on financial market conditions, will be led by China Merchants Bank International, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and could value the Chinese online health platform at up to $10 billion. The people with direct knowledge declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media on the matter. Citigroup and WeDoctor spokesmen declined to comment on the bank’s appointment. Credit Suisse was working on the transaction but was dropped due to uncertainty surrounding a regulatory probe of Luckin Coffee Inc LK.O. The Swiss bank worked on Luckin Coffee's IPO last year and follow-on equity deals in January. Investment bankers from rival firms began pitching to WeDoctor this week to pick up the extra role, people close to the process told Reuters. Luckin Coffee is at the centre of a Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) investigation after the firm said an internal review found its chief operating officer and other staff fabricated sales transactions worth about 2.2 billion yuan ($311.58 million). Credit Suisse, together with Morgan Stanley MS.N, CICC and Haitong International Securities Group Ltd 0665.HK, worked on Luckin Coffee's $645 million U.S. IPO in May last year. The four banks also worked on a follow-on share sale and a convertible bond worth a combined $980 mln in January."

WeDoctor's decision comes days after China's securities regulator said it would investigate claims of fraud at coffee startup Luckin Coffee LK.O where an internal investigation had found that its chief operating officer and other staff fabricated sales transactions worth about 2.2 billion yuan. Credit Suisse, together with Morgan Stanley MS.N, CICC 3908.HK and Haitong International Securities 0665.HK, worked on Luckin Coffee's $645 million U.S. IPO in May last year. “WeDoctor’s executives have concerns over Credit Suisse’s role in Luckin-related deals. Given uncertainty over the outcome, the bank is probably no longer suitable to work on WeDoctor’s IPO,” said one of the people, who declined to be named as the information is confidential. Credit Suisse declined to comment. WeDoctor said: “WeDoctor is scrupulous in our consideration of partners. A selection of sponsors is underway and a final decision has not been made.” WeDoctor declined to comment further on its IPO plans. CICC and Morgan Stanley have begun informal investigations into the due diligence they did for the Luckin IPO since the Chinese coffee chain’s announcement on Thursday, Reuters reported last week, citing sources. These two banks, Haitong and Credit Suisse had declined to comment last week. WeDoctor, which is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK and Goldman Sachs GS.N, in March mandated Credit Suisse, JPMorgan JPM.N and China Merchants Bank International for its float, which could value the company at up to $10 billion.

25.23378469271964," Credit Suisse weighs curbing bonuses at time of coronavirus: CEO ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse CSGN.S bank could restrain 2020 bonuses in a show of unity with victims of the coronavirus epidemic in Switzerland, Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said on Monday. In three business days, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank has paid out 1.24 billion Swiss francs ($1.29 billion) in loans to around 7,800 companies since the government last week unveiled a 20 billion franc program of state-backed loans at no or low interest to companies hit hard by the epidemic. “It is a bit early to talk about 2020 bonuses but we are certainly thinking in the direction that we want to show solidarity,” Gottstein told Swiss broadcaster SRF’s Eco program when asked about willingness to make sacrifices. The disease has killed around 300 people and sickened more than 15,000 in Switzerland. The Swiss financial watchdog and government have urged banks to curb dividend payments as a way to accumulate capital they could use to support the economy, but Credit Suisse is sticking to plans to pay out its 2019 dividend. Gottstein said the bank’s board would decide in autumn what dividend to propose for 2020, but noted it had stopped a share buyback that accounted for two-thirds of payouts to shareholders. Rival UBS Group UBSG.S stuck to plans to pay a 2019 dividend that is more than half its annual profit. ($1 = 0.9580 Swiss francs) (This story adds dropped word ‘about’ in paragraph 3.)"

Thiam “has led by example in terms of personal commitment to the group’s conduct and ethics standards, but recognizing that the observation matter had a significant impact on the group, his non-financial assessment score has been reduced,” it said. Thiam quit in February after the scandal over secret spying on senior executives hit the reputation of one of Europe’s largest banks and shocked Switzerland’s financial community. Switzerland’s second-biggest bank also confirmed that Chairman Urs Rohner would step down as of the 2021 annual meeting and that a search for his successor was making progress. Despite higher profit in 2019, Credit Suisse’s collective bonus pool edged down to 3.17 billion francs, the report showed. Credit Suisse had pledged to pay out more of its profit to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. Thiam remained one of Europe's best-paid bankers even though UBS Group UBSG.S CEO Sergio Ermotti, who is leaving his post this year, made 12.5 million francs last year. Rohner’s compensation for 2019 was flat at 4.7 million. Briton Richard Meddings is set to join the board as chair of the audit committee if approved at the annual meeting on April 30.

37.077755513746716," UPDATE 2-Credit Suisse to preserve liquidity as crisis impact unclear (Adds comments from conference; share price) ZURICH, March 19 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse executives were cautiously optimistic about the bank’s long-term outlook on Thursday, but said the uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus crisis meant it was a good time to preserve liquidity. Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said it had continued to see profitability grow during the first two months of 2020, although it was difficult to assess the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its future financial results and it was monitoring its credit exposures. “Notwithstanding the problems we are seeing currently in the market surrounding COVID-19, the long-term structural growth story around the wealth management industry is still true,” new Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said. Gottstein was addressing the Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference, which was held virtually, after the bank provided a trading update which showed a rise in pre-tax income and profitability in January and February. “The crisis might actually even provide some opportunities going forward, as we look to the next 6-12 months.” Pre-tax income for the first two months had already exceeded the 1.06 billion Swiss francs ($1.10 billion) Credit Suisse reported for the first quarter of 2019, the bank said, echoing upbeat comments by larger Swiss rival UBS on Wednesday. Shares in Credit Suisse were up 1.4% by 1200 GMT after presentations by Gottstein and CFO David Mathers, while cross-town Zurich rival UBS saw 0.7% gains. The executives said Credit Suisse expected to see draw-downs across its corporate bank over the coming weeks and that now was a prudent time to “preserve liquidity”. Credit Suisse said restructuring efforts in recent years had strengthened its capital base and its stronger focus on wealth management and lower exposure to leveraged finance and the oil and gas sector, which its CFO said was down 20% to roughly $7.5 billion at the end of February, had put it on a resilient footing amid economic disruption and volatile financial markets. Higher trading revenues had thus far helped offset the impact of a market rout, Credit Suisse said, which has brought a slowdown in dealmaking and which is expected to hit the fees that banks charge clients for managing their assets. Credit Suisse, however, cautioned it was difficult at this point to assess the impact of the pandemic, and analysts expect the it could hit banks harder in the second quarter if markets and economies do not recover. Swiss financial supervisor FINMA on Thursday said the country’s lenders were solidly capitalised and well equipped to deal with extreme stress scenarios, but cautioned them to consider their capital distribution policies. Echoing comments by the UBS finance chief, Mathers said Credit Suisse had seen a number of margin calls, but no significant loan losses on its loans.
