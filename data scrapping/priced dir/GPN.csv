16.252292782487192," Global Payments explores $2 billion-plus sale of prepaid card unit Netspend - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global Payments Inc GPN.N is exploring a sale of its Netspend unit, aiming to secure a valuation of more than $2 billion for the prepaid debit card business, three people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The parent, valued at $53 billion, is working with an investment bank on the potential divestment and began marketing Netspend to buyers last month, the sources said on condition of anonymity as the information is private. Selling Netspend would provide Global Payments with extra cash to invest in core parts of its business and those which are considered key growth drivers for the future, one of the sources added. A spokeswoman for Global Payments declined to comment. Founded in 1999, Netspend offers rechargeable debit cards for personal and business usage, a product which is primarily focused on those less well-served by traditional banks and financial institutions. The Austin, Texas-based company also has partnership agreements with the likes of Walmart Inc WMT.N, 7-Eleven and Western Union Co WU.N to offer branded cards, according to its website. Netspend was bought in 2013 by Total System Services (TSYS) for $1.4 billion, which itself was acquired by Global Payments for $21.5 billion in 2019 amid a raft of blockbuster consolidation deals among the largest U.S. payment processors."

9.787280119050285," Global Payments to buy TSYS for $21.5 billion in latest fintech deal (Reuters) - Payment technology company Global Payments Inc said on Tuesday it would buy peer Total System Services Inc (TSYS) for about $21.5 billion in stock, adding scale in a fiercely competitive and fast-growing industry. The deal, Global Payments’ biggest ever and the sector’s third major acquisition this year, comes as payment technology companies consolidate to battle competition from banks making inroads into digital payments and fintech start-ups such as Adyen and Stripe chipping away market share. The global payment market is set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as customers increasingly shift to digital payments from cash, according to consulting firm McKinsey. “We believe the deal marks a shift from (Global Payments’) pursuit of software and differentiated assets into more of a scale play,” Jefferies analysts wrote on a note on Sunday. “We do not believe a deal would face antitrust considerations nor do we expect another offer although we note that several banks have mentioned renewed focus on payments.” After the deal Global Payments will process more than 50 billion transactions annually across the world, making it one of the biggest players in integrated payment technology, it said in a statement. In March, Fidelity National Information Services Inc agreed to buy Worldpay for about $35 billion, months after Fiserv Inc announced a $22 billion takeover of First Data Corp. Global Payments itself bought Heartland Payment Systems Inc in a $4.3 billion cash-and-stock deal in 2016. The deal is expected to immediately add to Global Payments’ adjusted profit by mid-single digits in 2020. The combined company, which will take the name Global Payments and have dual headquarters in Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia, will be led by a 12-member board with six directors from each firm. Global Payments Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sloan will become the CEO of the merged entity and TSYS CEO Troy Woods will become chairman. Global Payments shareholders will own 52% of the combined company, and TSYS shareholders will own 48% upon closing of the deal. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, the company said. Reuters had reported about the possible deal on Friday, citing a source familiar with the matter. BofA Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan Securities LLC are financial advisers to Global Payments, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is the legal adviser. Goldman Sachs and Greenhill are financial advisers to TSYS and King & Spalding LLP is the legal adviser."

17.08930059782736," Ex-Heartland CEO settles SEC insider trading charges he tipped partner about merger (Reuters) - The former chief executive of Heartland Payment Systems Inc agreed to pay a $250,628 civil fine to settle U.S. insider trading charges that he tipped his longtime romantic partner about the payment processor’s $4.3 billion takeover by Global Payments Inc. Robert Carr, who founded Heartland, did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which was filed this week with the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut. The SEC accused Carr of repeatedly discussing merger talks with his partner Katherine Hanratty and writing a check so Hanratty, who had expressed worries about her finances, could buy $900,000 of Heartland stock before the merger was announced. Hanratty sold her stock for a $250,628 profit in April 2016, four months after Atlanta-based Global Payments agreed to buy its smaller rival, the SEC said. The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill. He also will decide whether to ban Carr, who is in his mid-70s, from serving as an officer or director of a public company. A lawyer for Carr did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a similar request. Hanratty agreed last October to pay $528,608, including a $250,628 civil fine, to settle related SEC charges. The case is SEC v Carr et al, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 18-01135."
-0.4235514955037859," SEC charges ex-Heartland Payment CEO with insider trading (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday charged the former chief executive of Heartland Payment Systems Inc with insider trading for tipping his longtime romantic partner about the payment processor's $4.3 billion takeover by Global Payments Inc GPN.N. Robert Carr, 73, who also founded Heartland, was accused of repeatedly discussing the late-2015 merger talks with Katherine Hanratty, 65, whose relationship with him had begun in 2011. Carr was also accused of having given Hanratty a $1 million check before the merger, with instructions to open a brokerage account and buy $900,000 of Heartland stock. The SEC said Hanratty, whom it also charged, did what Carr asked, and sold her stock for a $250,628 profit in April 2016, four months after Atlanta-based Global Payments agreed to buy its smaller rival. Hanratty, who co-owns a staffing agency, had repeatedly expressed concern to Carr about her finances, and after opening the brokerage account - which named Carr as the beneficiary - emailed him that “for the first time ever I feel a sense of relief knowing that I have some security,” the SEC said. Global Payments agreed on Dec. 15, 2015 to buy Princeton, New Jersey-based Heartland for $100 per share, a 17.5 percent premium, and more than 28 percent above where it traded on Dec. 9 before media began reporting a possible merger. The SEC said Carr, of New London, New Hampshire, had bragged to his children and their spouses that a merger was in the works, and given Hanratty, of Watertown, Connecticut, a draft quotation for the press release announcing it. “Love it,” replied Hanratty, even as she suggested an improvement, the SEC said. The SEC complaint filed with the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, seeks civil fines, the recouping of illegal profit, and an officer and director ban for Carr. Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Global Payments declined to comment. The company in May sued Carr and Hanratty in the federal court in Trenton, New Jersey to recoup trading profits it said arose from Carr’s alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The SEC case is SEC v Carr et al, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 18-01135."
