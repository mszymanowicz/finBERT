14.017413690089272," Royal Caribbean to sell Azamara brand for $201 mln, focus on bigger cruise lines (Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Group said it would sell its Azamara line to private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $201 million in cash, to focus more on its bigger brands as the cruise operator deals with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sycamore would acquire Azamara’s three-ship fleet and associated intellectual property, Royal Caribbean said on Tuesday. The company said the deal would allow it to focus on expanding its Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea brands, which as of its latest annual filing operated more ships than Azamara. Royal Caribbean would incur a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of about $170 million, even as it said the sale would not have a material impact on its financials. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Cruise operators have been rushing to shore up cash reserves over the last few months as the global health crisis brought the industry to a virtual standstill."
8.283731501534357," Coronavirus scare on Singapore cruise ship was false alarm, authorities say SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A suspected COVID-19 case aboard a “cruise-to-nowhere” from Singapore which forced the ship to return to dock and nearly 1,700 guests to isolate was a false alarm, the government said on Thursday. Passengers on Royal Caribbean’s Quantum of the Seas vessel were held in their cabins for more than 16 hours on Wednesday after an 83-year-old man was tested positive for COVID-19 aboard the ship when he sought medical help for diarrhoea. But Singapore’s health ministry said on Thursday the man did not have the virus after three subsequent tests on land came back negative. While authorities praised the response to the incident, tourism experts said it highlighted testing frailties and the burden that puts on businesses trying to resume operations even in a country that has largely tamed the virus. “We have to live with less-than-perfect testing kits,” said Michael Chiam, a senior tourism lecturer at Singapore’s Ngee Ann Polytechnic. “This may be costly to businesses.” The health ministry said close contacts of the guest to would no longer need to quarantine and that it would help review testing processes aboard the ship. Miami-based Royal Caribbean, which had just started offering the trips after it halted global operations in March due to the pandemic, said in a statement it welcomed the news and that it would work to “refine” its protocols. The cruises-to-nowhere were part of Singapore’s efforts to revive a tourism industry which has been battered by the pandemic as borders around the world have closed. Singapore’s tourism board chief Keith Tan said the cruise incident was a learning experience but also a validation of precautions like pre-departure testing and requirements that guests carry an electronic contact tracing device at all times. The mishap will be closely watched by other firms relying on testing like event venues and airlines, said Sherri Kimes of the National University of Singapore’s Business School. The city-state, which has reported only a handful of cases in recent weeks, is rolling out rapid antigen tests for large events such as weddings and business conferences."

8.728899767066897," Relieved passengers leave Singapore cruise after COVID-19 scare SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Royal Caribbean “cruise-to-nowhere” from Singapore began disembarking its nearly 1,700 passengers who were confined to their cabins for more than 16 hours on Wednesday after a COVID-19 case was detected onboard, forcing the ship back to port. All passengers aboard the Quantum of the Seas had cleared a mandatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the virus up to three days before the four-day cruise began on Monday. Authorities said close contacts of the COVID-19 patient among the 1,680 guests and 1,148 crew members on board had so far tested negative. The passengers were stuck in their rooms while contact tracing was being conducted. “I feel relieved, it was obviously a very boring wait,” said Isaac Lung, a 16-year-old student, who had taken the cruise with his parents. The “cruise-to-nowhere” by Royal Caribbean is one of its first sailings since the Miami-based company halted global operations in March due to the pandemic. The sailing in waters off Singapore is open only to Singapore residents and makes no stops. The coronavirus patient, an 83-year-old male, had reported to the ship’s medical centre with diarrhoea and a subsequent onboard test revealed the infection. He was taken to hospital on Wednesday after the ship returned to port. However, two further tests from the patient have come back negative for COVID-19 infection, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said. Another test will be conducted on Thursday to confirm his infection status. Other guests were awoken with the news of the infection in the early hours. “I was like: ‘there it goes, the worst fear has happened’,” said passenger Melvin Chew, a 31-year-old business development manager, who said he learned about the infected guest via an announcement on the ship’s tannoy in the early hours. All passengers will undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing before leaving the terminal. The STB said the ship, which returned to Singapore in the morning, began disembarking all passengers at 7.30 p.m. and will complete the process around midnight. It was also being deep-cleaned. “I am terribly sorry that the cruise ended a day early and ended this way,” the captain told passengers over the tannoy. The crew will rest overnight and take PCR tests in the morning, he added. Royal Caribbean said it was cancelling its upcoming trip on Thursday. The cruises are a part of Singapore’s plans to revive its tourism industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Singapore, which has reported just over 58,000 COVID-19 cases and 29 deaths, has barely seen any new local cases in recent weeks. Precautions for the resumption of cruises in Singapore involved pre-departure testing and for guests to carry an electronic contact tracing device, wear masks and social distance at all times."

Third-quarter revenue was negative $33.7 million, a rare event for an S&P 500 company, as it reversed previously recorded income from refunds and cancellations. Analysts were expecting revenue of $12.4 million. “It’s been almost 7 months since we paused our cruise operations, and every single day has been extremely frustrating and challenging on so many levels,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain told analysts. The cruise industry has come to a virtual standstill after many vessels became hotbeds of infection and some operators even faced lawsuits for onboard outbreaks. To resume operation and stem the losses, the company and its peer Norwegian Cruise Line have submitted their recommendations, detailing health protocols, to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Royal Carribean said it was planning to start a series of trial sailings with just the crew to rehearse the COVID-19 protocols before bringing in consumers on one or two of its ships on short voyages.

The cruise operators detailed 74 steps, including enhanced sanitation practices, controlling shore excursions and better protection for crew members, to protect guests should they begin sailing again. Recommendations also include rigorous screening and testing before boarding, plans to address positive infection on board, rapid evacuation and reducing transmission, the companies said. In July, the two companies announced a joint task force to help develop safety standards for restarting their businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. “We studied the industry’s experiences combating the pandemic – and we then incorporated the many lessons learned and advances made by medicine and science over the past six months,” the task force’s co-chair and Utah Governor Mike Leavitt said.

The company’s shares rose as much as 11% in early trading. “We have not yet reached a point in our protocols where we’re ready to publish and release for discussion. But it’s very likely that testing will occur,” said Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International.

Royal Caribbean said it expected the panel to approve a return-to-sailing plan by the end of the month for submission to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). “They’re going to have to be able to test, because if you get one infected person on a ship - that’s going to create a big problem,” said Ivan Feinseth, Chief Investment Officer at Tigress Financial Partners, adding that implementing testing may be the only way the CDC lifts its no-sail order. U.S. cruise operators have said ocean liners would not ferry passengers again until at least the end of October, as coronavirus cases rise in the United States. Royal Caribbean said booking trends for the second half of 2021 were encouraging, with guests willing to pay more than what they did in 2019.

On Monday, Royal Caribbean Group RCL.N and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH.N announced a joint task force to help develop safety standards for restarting their businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The “Healthy Sail Panel,” co-chaired by former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt and former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, is advising the companies on restart plans they will submit to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other regulators at the end of August.

They are effectively building up that war chest,” said Jeremy Swan, managing principal at accounting and tax advisory firm CohnReznick LLP. Royal Caribbean said on Tuesday it increased its credit capacity by $550 million to boost liquidity. The company’s stock plunged this month, amid concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would curtail travel. “These are extraordinary times and we are taking these steps to manage the company prudently and conservatively,” Royal Caribbean Cruises Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Fain said in a statement. Exxon, which has one of the corporate world's strongest balance sheets, filed paperwork on Tuesday for an unspecified board offering for what it called general corporate purposes, as the oil major grapples with the collapse in Brent crude LCOc1 prices. Oreo maker Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O on Monday announced a $2.5 billion credit facility, in addition to a similar agreement worth $1.5 billion agreed less than two weeks ago. United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O also said on Tuesday it had raised an extra $2 billion in financing while slashing its 2020 capital expenditures by more than a third. “We also believe we have good options to raise additional liquidity in the weeks to come, if needed,” United President Scott Kirby said. Other companies which chose not to raise new funds yet touted their financial strength to calm investors. In an investor presentation on Tuesday, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O flagged more than $7.3 billion in cash and unused bank lending in reserve. “American Airlines has more liquidity than any other airline in the world, which is exactly where we want to be in an environment like this and exactly why indeed we’ve held so much for so long,” American Airlines Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said at a conference on Tuesday.

The epidemic, which originated in China’s Hubei province and has killed more than 1,300 people, has taken a toll on cruise operators as travel restriction and fear of the virus spreading have led to cancellations of trips to the Far East. Last week, Royal Caribbean said it canceled eight cruises out of China through March 4 and warned of a 25 cent impact to its first quarter earnings. The company said the 18 canceled cruises would cut its full-year earnings per share by 65 cents, warning that cancelling all its remaining sailings in Asia through the end of April, would reduce its earnings per share by another 55 cents in 2020. Royal Caribbean had previously forecast 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.40 to $10.70 per share, which did not include the impact of the virus. Shares of company were down 1.4% at $112 in extended trade, dragging peers Carnival Corp CCL.N and Norwegian Cruise Line NCLH.N lower.

-64.5926743122927," Royal Caribbean warns of more cruise cancellations on coronavirus threat (Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Tuesday warned of more cruise cancellations after calling off eight trips out of China through March 4 due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company said it expects the cancellations to trim its first-quarter earnings by 25 cents per share, but added that there are too many uncertainties to give a good estimate of the impact. “It seems likely that we will have to cancel more, but we don’t yet know how many,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain said on the post-earnings conference call. Royal Caribbean also said it would deny boarding to people who had visited mainland China or Hong Kong over the past 15 days. It will also screen Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders and people showing flu-like symptoms, including its own staff. The company had expected China to account for 6% of its overall capacity in 2020 and 4% of the total capacity in the first quarter, Fain said. Royal Caribbean, the second-biggest cruise operator by market valuation, currently has one ship, Spectrum of the Seas, whose port of origin is Shanghai in China, with two more cruise liners expected to join in May and July.

-73.852475563025," Royal Caribbean liability for volcano deaths may turn on 'act of God' defense (Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd’s potential liability for a deadly excursion to a volcanic island in New Zealand could hinge on whether the eruption was an unforeseeable “act of God,” according to maritime lawyers. Cruise ship passengers were among the tourists on White Island on Monday when it erupted. While no lawsuits have yet been filed, legal experts said they expected action in U.S courts by injured passengers and families of those who died. There were 47 people on the island at the time. Eight have been officially declared dead and more than 20 are being treated for severe burns. The New Zealand military was carrying out an operation to recover eight other bodies still on the island. Royal Caribbean ticket terms posted on its website spell out that the company is not liable for any injury, death or loss of property caused by an act of God, as well as war, terrorism or other events beyond the company’s control. Royal Caribbean will likely argue the disaster was an extraordinary event no one could reasonably foresee, said Robert Kritzman, an attorney with Baker Donelson in Miami. “If a volcano were to erupt, clearly that isn’t negligence on anyone’s part, that’s nature,” said Kritzman, a former general counsel with Norwegian Cruise Line. Royal Caribbean did not respond to questions about missing passengers or whether it told passengers of the risks of visiting the island. “We grieve this tragic loss. We will to continue to offer our support and services to the families during this difficult time,” the company said in an email. Part of the case will turn on what the cruise line knew or should have known and what they told passengers about indications of increased volcanic activity. “There are tremors, there are earthquakes and people monitor that,” said Carlos Llinás Negret, an attorney with Nelson & Fraenkel who represents passengers. “It all depends on what the cruise knew, and when they knew it.” Geological hazard tracker GeoNet raised the alert level for the White Island volcano in November and said on Dec. 3 that “the volcano may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal.” The cruise line described White Island as “one of the most active volcanoes in the world,” according to a cached version of its website. “Get close to the drama: Gas masks help you get near roaring steam vents, bubbling pits of mud, hot volcanic streams and the amazing lake of steaming acid,” it promised. Virginia parents of one woman who was severely burned told a TV station that her daughter said she believed Royal Caribbean would not have let her visit the island if it were not safe. The experts said in a typical shore excursion accident the cruise line tries to put blame on the third party that is hired to run the tour. On its website, Royal Caribbean does not identify the company that ran the White Island excursion. Passengers would have to show Royal Caribbean did not take proper care to vet the operator, lawyers said. But lawsuits face the added challenge of overcoming the argument the eruption was unforeseeable. Norwegian Cruise Line was able to fend off a class action lawsuit about a large “freak wave” hitting one of its ships in 2005 by arguing it was an unforeseeable event. Regulators had concluded there was no wrongdoing by Norwegian. Royal Caribbean is using the act of God defense against a class action about a powerful storm in 2016 that hit the ship Anthem of the Seas off the eastern United States. Passengers said the company knew of the risks of the storm, but tried to outrun it. The dramatic description of the White Island tour on Royal Caribbean’s website will likely be a focus of any lawsuit, with lawyers seizing on it to show the company knew a disaster was possible, legal experts said. The company could argue passengers were fully informed of the dangers and received proper safety equipment. “If they hand out gas masks that says automatically you know you have a risk,” said Bob Parks, a Miami attorney who represents passengers."
-10.382730378803014," UPDATE 1-Norwegian Cruise Line says Cuba travel ban to hit 2019 earnings (Adds details on Cuba cruises, statement from Royal Caribbean) June 7 (Reuters) - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd said on Friday the Trump administration’s sudden ban on cruises to Cuba would hit its 2019 profit. Cruise operators are scrambling to adjust their itineraries after the United States said it would no longer permit visits to the Caribbean island via passenger and recreational vessels, including cruise ships and yachts. Norwegian said on Friday it was modifying its itineraries and would offer “substantial” discounts to guests to remain on their booked cruises despite the ban. Those expenses, along with likely cancellations, changes to reservations and the commissions to travel agents, will lower full-year 2019 adjusted earnings by about 35 cents to 45 cents per share, the company said. Norwegian had previously forecast 2019 earnings of $5.40 to $5.50 per share, while analysts were expecting a profit of $5.48, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Rival Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said on Thursday the travel restrictions would reduce its 2019 adjusted earnings by 25 cents to 35 cents per share.

0.5564199888154044," Royal Caribbean starts 2019 with record bookings, sees strong China demand (Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said on Wednesday it was heading into 2019 with record bookings for cruises and seeing higher demand from Chinese tourists, sending its shares up as much as 7 percent. A slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy which has been flagged by several U.S. companies over the past few weeks, did not dampen demand, Royal Caribbean said. Over half a million Chinese passengers sail with Royal Caribbean every year and the company said it was seeing rapid growth in tourists vacationing in Europe and Alaska. The Miami-based company said 75 percent more Chinese guests opted for a non-China itinerary in 2019, compared to three years ago. Rising demand, especially in the Caribbean, led the company to add four cruise liners to its fleet in 2018, including the world’s largest Symphony of the Seas. Demand from wealthier customers also prompted the company to take a majority stake in Silversea Cruises, adding ultra-luxury and expedition cruises to its offerings. “Consumers are spending more on travel and experiences and the cruise industry is benefiting,” Ivan Feinseth, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners said. Tigress owns Royal Caribbean shares on behalf of clients. “The all-inclusive nature and the broad itineraries ... there’s just so much going on that cruises continue to grow in popularity.” Overall, Royal Caribbean said it expects to raise total capacity by 8.6 percent in 2019, deploying just over half of those ships for Caribbean cruises. The company said it expects adjusted first-quarter earnings of $1.10 per share, above analysts’ estimates of $1.06, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “This outcome should encourage those who watch on the sidelines concerned about weather politics, trade wars, supplies whatever,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain said, describing the company’s 2018 earnings. But while demand for cruises on both sides of the Atlantic has been strong from North American passengers, Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said uncertainties surrounding Brexit were creating “inconsistencies” in demand in the United Kingdom. The company’s total revenue rose 16.4 percent to $2.33 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, edging past analysts’ average estimate of $2.31 billion. On-board spending, an increasingly more important part of Royal Caribbean’s overall revenue, rose 16.5 percent as passengers spent more on entertainment activities like laser tag and dance classes. Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.53 per share, ahead of estimate of $1.51. The company’s shares were up 6.2 percent at $119.00 in early afternoon trade.

13.911875996973002," Royal Caribbean adds ultra-luxury cruises with $1 billion stake in Silversea (Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N said on Thursday it would buy a 66.7 percent stake in privately owned Silversea Cruises for about $1 billion to add ultra-luxury and expedition cruises to its fleet. Silversea Cruises, which has nine ships, sails to destinations including Antarctica, the Arctic and Greenland, with most of its tickets selling for more than $5,000. In contrast, the most expensive cruises run by Royal Caribbean under its Azamara Club Cruises brand cost around $3,000. “Ultraluxury and expedition cruises are gaps in our portfolio today,” Royal Caribbean Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain said on a conference call. The two segments are the fastest growing areas in the industry that the company could not develop on its own, Fain added in an interview with Reuters. Shares of the U.S. cruise operator rose as much as 7 percent to $115.50, with the company also maintaining its full-year profit forecast despite higher fuel prices and a stronger dollar. Including debt, the deal is valued at $2 billion. Royal Caribbean said it plans to finance the purchase through debt. The 2018 total worldwide ocean cruise industry is estimated to reach $45.6 billion in revenue, a 4.6 percent increase over 2017, according to the industry analytics firm Cruise Market Watch. Royal Caribbean had nearly $9 billion in revenue at the end of 2017. Silversea Chairman Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio will get about 472,000 Royal Caribbean shares, payable after the Miami-based company achieves some 2019-2020 performance targets. This translates to about $51 million, based on Royal Caribbean’s closing price on Wednesday. “Silversea had a fantastic plan of growing on its own, but I did realize that the potential that the market was offering Silversea was beyond the means that I could put in place,” Lefebvre d’Ovidio told Reuters. Royal Caribbean does not expect the transaction, which will likely close later in the year, to materially impact its near-term adjusted earnings per share, the company said. Silversea CEO Roberto Martinoli will continue in his role. Perella Weinberg Partners LP was financial adviser to Royal Caribbean and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP provided legal counsel.
