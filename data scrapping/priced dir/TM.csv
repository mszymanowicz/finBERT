4.698603545753077," Toyota investing $210 million to expand West Virginia engine production WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said Thursday it is investing $210 million to expand engine production in West Virginia and add 100 new jobs. The Japanese automaker said it would boost capacity by 70,000 engines a year at the Buffalo, West Virginia plant, up from the nearly 1 million transmissions and engines it produces annually for vehicles assembled in North America. The investment will increase assembly capacity of its four-cylinder engine line. The plant makes four- and six-cylinder engines for Avalon, Camry, Corolla, Highlander, Lexus ES, Lexus RX350, RAV4 and Sienna. The investment comes as automakers around the world are shifting more focus to electric vehicles and away from vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. Toyota says hybrid vehicles, which includes internal combustion engines, will be a key part of its vehicle strategy in the coming decade as other automakers focus more heavily on battery electric vehicles, which only run on electric power. Toyota said last week that 16% of its U.S. sales were hybrid vehicles in 2020, a figure that will jump to at least 20% in 2021."
4.698603545753077," Japan's Toyota, Honda can likely cope with global chip shortage: Fitch (Reuters) - The global semiconductor chip shortage is not likely to significantly affect the financial profiles of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp or Honda Motor Co, ratings agency Fitch said in a statement on Wednesday. The automakers have enough financial flexibility to absorb more costs and maintain significant rating headroom, even if the shortage persists till the second half of 2021, according to the statement. The automobile industry has been grappling with a shortfall in chip supply since the end of last year, driven by coronavirus lockdowns in Southeast Asia and bulk-buying by U.S. sanctions-hit Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, among other reasons. The shortage prompted top U.S. automaker General Motor Co to extend production cuts at three North American plants last week, while Honda Motor and Nissan Motor were set to sell a combined 250,000 fewer cars in the current financial year. Meanwhile, Toyota shrugged off the issue in its quarterly report last week and said it has up to a four-month stockpile of chips, with no immediate hit to production expected. “We believe the shortage should ease or even be resolved in the second half of 2021 as suppliers boost production for automotive clients,” Fitch said. Top economic and national security officials in the White House have launched a new effort to help the U.S. auto industry fight the chip shortage, a White House official said on Thursday. The issue could impact nearly 1 million units of global light vehicle production in the first quarter, according to data firm IHS Markit."

The company also said it expects that 40% of its U.S. sales by 2025 will be hybrid vehicles or electric vehicles, rising to 70% by 2030. One of the new EVs next year will be a sport-utility vehicle and Toyota will also unveil a new plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Toyota said in 2017 it would market more than 10 electric vehicles globally in the early 2020s. The new vehicles for the U.S. market are “the first of many,” Bob Carter, executive vice president of sales for Toyota Motor North America. “Electrification is the future of this industry. There is no doubt about that,” Carter said. “The only debate we have is that rate of change.” Toyota forecasts by 2025 that industry sales will be 7% electric vehicles rising to around 15% to 18% in 2030. In 2020, Toyota sold 337,000 hybrid vehicles in the United States, accounting for 16% of U.S. sales, and hybrids will grow to more than 20% this year as it adds more hybrid versions. Toyota shares rose more than 5% on the news in New York trading. There is growing interest in EVs in the industry. General Motors said last month it was setting an aspirational goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift. Barra on an earnings call Wednesday expressed optimism about the 2035 goal. “There’s not one big factor that’s going to hold us up. We have all the assets to achieve this.

-4.023273137203183," Toyota, Lyft offer hydrogen-powered vehicles for Vancouver ride-hail drivers Feb 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motors Corp and Lyft Inc said on Wednesday they have launched a partnership to provide an initially limited number of ride-hail drivers in Vancouver, British Columbia, with access to hydrogen-powered Mirai sedans. Lyft drivers in the city will be able to rent one of 24 Mirais for C$198 ($156) a week, a price described as extremely competitive by Lyft’s general manager for British Columbia, Peter Lukomskyj. The partnership is part of Lyft’s efforts to switch every vehicle on its platform to zero emissions by 2030. For Toyota, the tie-up offers the opportunity to introduce consumers to vehicles powered by hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. “Everybody who sits in the back seat of (a Mirai) is going to be able to learn a little bit more about hydrogen technology. There’s no way that we could do that on our own,” said Stephen Beatty, Toyota Canada’s vice president, corporate. Beatty called the Lyft partnership a proof of concept, saying Toyota considered it a test to see how the vehicles were performing before eying nationwide expansions. Toyota launched the Mirai roughly six years ago, but by the end of September had sold only 11,100 vehicles, with consumers concerned over the lack of fueling stations and resale values. Toyota in December launched a revamped version with a wider range of 500 km (310 miles). British Columbia has four hydrogen stations, of which three are in Vancouver, according to HTEC Hydrogen Technology & Energy Corporation, which operates the stations and said that refueling takes around 5 minutes. Hydrogen vehicles’ shorter fueling time and longer ranges make them a more practical option for ride-hail drivers than electric vehicles, Lukomskyj and Beatty said. Canada in December unveiled a hydrogen strategy aimed at spurring growth in the clean fuel sector and created a C$1.5 billion investment fund for low-carbon fuels.

-4.023273137203183," Toyota hikes profit forecast 54%, shrugs off global chip supply issues TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it has an up to four-month stockpile of chips and was not immediately expecting a global chip shortage to hit production, as it jacked up its full-year earnings forecast by a bigger-than-expected 54%. Unlike other automakers, including Japanese peers Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Honda Motor Co Ltd, that have had to cut production because of semiconductor shortages, Toyota raised output for the fiscal year ending March. Shares in Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker by vehicle sales, closed up 1.7% after hitting their highest level since July 2015. “For the near term, we do not see any decrease in production volume due to the chip shortage, but we do see risks of a chip shortage,” Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon said during a briefing. Kon said Toyota had heard chip shortages globally might continue until the summer, though the situation might resolve itself earlier. Asked about why the automaker is seeing limited impact compared with competitors, Kon said Toyota has been constantly providing its short-term and long-term production volume plans to suppliers. The automobile industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, which has in some cases been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration’s sanctions on Chinese chip factories. But the maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and Prius hybrid said it expects to sell 9.73 million vehicles this year, up 3.3% from a previous forecast of 9.42 million yet still down from last year’s 10.46 million. “The fact that Toyota isn’t largely affected by the chip shortage now is an encouraging catalyst,” said Hideyuki Suzuki, a general manager of investment research at SBI Securities. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Toyota now expects record operating profit of 2 trillion yen ($19.13 billion), far higher than an earlier projection of 1.3 trillion yen, and well above an average 1.542 trillion yen profit forecast based on estimates from 23 analysts, Refinitiv data showed. The automaker now expects the yen to trade at 105 yen against the U.S. dollar, versus a previous forecast of 106 yen. Toyota said operating profit rose to 987.9 billion yen in the three months ended Dec. 31 versus an average 565.51 billion yen profit from nine analysts surveyed by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

0.6883103896103944," Toyota, Denso team with Aurora on self-driving cars for Uber, others DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and longtime supplier partner Denso Corp will team up with self-driving car startup Aurora to develop and build autonomous minivans for ride hailing networks, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal gives San Francisco-based Aurora a clearer path to profitability as it competes with Alphabet Inc’s Waymo, General Motors Co’s majority-owned Cruise and Argo AI, whose principal investors are Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG. Toyota Sienna minivans will be equipped with Aurora’s self-driving system, with a test fleet to be deployed by the end of 2021. The plan is to deploy the vehicles some time after that in Uber Technologies’ ride-hailing fleet and those of unspecified other companies. In December, Aurora said it was buying Uber’s self-driving unit, the Advanced Technologies Group (Uber ATG), in a deal valued at $4 billion, well below ATG’s earlier valuation of $7.25 billion. Toyota and Denso were investors in Uber ATG, along with Japan’s SoftBank Group. Toyota was working with Uber ATG to develop a self-driving system to be deployed on the Sienna, according to ATG executives. Aurora’s new agreement with Toyota and Denso expands on the earlier collaboration between the two Japanese companies and Uber ATG. Toyota remains an investor in Uber and transferred its equity stake from ATG to Aurora as part of the December transaction, according to a source familiar with the deal. As part of the December transaction involving ATG, Uber agreed to invest $400 million in Aurora, in a deal that values Aurora at $10 billion. The two companies agreed to collaborate on self-driving vehicles for Uber’s ride hailing and food delivery networks. Aurora said it will explore with Denso the mass production of self-driving components, and with Toyota the development of mobility services, including financing, insurance and maintenance. Aurora also has a deal with heavy-truck maker PACCAR to develop self-driving systems for long-haul freight delivery. Earlier, Aurora had development pacts with Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor. VW eventually bought a significant stake in Argo, while Hyundai formed a joint venture called Motional with supplier Aptiv to develop self-driving vehicles for robotaxi fleets."

8.475653758165276," New Toyota tech unit promises world's safest drive TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled its Woven Planet research unit at a virtual media event on Friday, promising to deliver the world’s “safest mobility” as competition heats up to develop self-driving and connected cars. In the online presentation, dubbed “The Genesis”, Woven Planet executives provided few hints into specific features in the pipeline, but said a new assisted-driving system would be mounted on the company’s passenger cars by the end of this year. The company also said it would be ready to unveil a fully self-driving prototype “in the near future”, without elaborating. As traditional automakers face competition from the likes of Apple, Amazon and Sony, Toyota is looking to marry Woven Planet’s Silicon Valley approach with its storied Toyota Production System manufacturing process to develop the next generation of cars. Fully self-driven cars are still likely to be years away, but rival General Motors Co this month made a splash at the virtual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) with a fully-autonomous all-electric flying Cadillac concept, while Chinese search engine operator Baidu unveiled a partnership with local car brand Geely. Led by ex-Google roboticist James Kuffner, Woven Planet also says it has the advantage of scale in collecting data - key to developing artificial intelligence-aided software - through the tens of millions of Toyota cars on the road worldwide. Toyota retook the crown as world’s best-selling automaker in 2020, unseating Volkswagen AG. “This is really only the beginning,” Kuffner said in a pre-recorded presentation, where he introduced key executives from the Woven Planet Group, including founding family scion Daisuke Toyoda, son of Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda. “We’re just getting started with our technology and innovation to change the world,” Kuffner said. Toyota last year unveiled plans to build a prototype “city of the future” called Woven City at the base of Mount Fuji powered by hydrogen fuel cells that would be a laboratory for autonomous cars."
6.950447865657057," Toyota beats Volkswagen to become world's No.1 car seller in 2020 TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp overtook Germany’s Volkswagen in vehicle sales last year, regaining pole position as the world’s top selling automaker for the first time in five years as the pandemic demand slump hit its German rival harder. Toyota said on Thursday its group-wide global sales fell 11.3% to 9.528 million vehicles in 2020. That compared with a 15.2 percent drop at Volkswagen to 9.305 million vehicles. Automakers have suffered as coronavirus lockdowns have stopped people from visiting car showrooms and forced manufacturing plants to reduce or halt production. Toyota, however, has weathered the pandemic better in part because its home market Japan, and the Asian region in general, have been less affected by the outbreak than Europe and the United States. “Our focus is not on what our ranking may be, but on serving our customers” a Toyota spokeswoman said. As demand for cars rebounds, particularly in China, Toyota, Volkswagen and other manufacturers are scrambling to tap growing demand for electric cars. Toyota said that the ratio of electric vehicle it sold last year grew to 23% of total sales from 20% in 2019."

The Frenchman, who was born and grew up in Gap where the rally is based, beat Welsh team mate Elfyn Evans by 32.6 seconds in a Toyota one-two. Last year’s winner Thierry Neuville of Belgium denied the Japanese manufacturer a podium sweep with third place for Hyundai. Ogier, whose eight wins have been with five different manufacturers, had previously been level with compatriot and nine-times world champion Sebastien Loeb with seven Monte Carlo rally wins each. One of Ogier’s wins, in 2009, came when the rally was part of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge rather than the world championship. The 37-year-old reigning world champion took a maximum 30-point haul from this year’s asphalt event in the French Alps, run without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after also winning the final power stage for five bonus points. “The car has been amazing. I really enjoyed the weekend, it has been such a pleasure. I almost have tears in my eyes now and it was a good decision to do one more year,” said the Frenchman, co-driven by compatriot Julien Ingrassia. Ogier had planned to retire last year but decided to stay for one more year because he wanted to leave after a proper season and not one ravaged by the pandemic. Estonian Ott Tanak, whose rally ended on Saturday, had led after Thursday’s first two stages and then Evans was in front on Saturday. Finland’s Kalle Rovanpera was fourth for Toyota with Spaniard Dani Sordo fifth for Hyundai and Japana’s Takamoto Katsuta sixth in a Toyota."

Reuters first reported the expected settlement, which resolves the violations of the Clean Air Act. Toyota first disclosed in 2016 it was under investigation for the delayed reports to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Justice Department had not previously confirmed the investigation until Thursday’s announcement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan that the government had filed a civil lawsuit against the Japanese automaker. It simultaneously announced the settlement, which includes a consent decree that requires semi-annual compliance reports. Toyota will record $180 million in after-tax charges against earnings in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, for costs relating to the agreement. The government said the settlement resolved Toyota’s “systematic, longstanding violations of Clean Air Act emission-related defect reporting requirements, which require manufacturers to report potential defects and recalls affecting vehicle components designed to control emissions.” Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in New York said: “Toyota shut its eyes to the noncompliance, failing to provide proper training, attention, and oversight to its Clean Air Act reporting obligations.” She added that “Toyota’s actions undermined EPA’s self-disclosure system and likely led to delayed or avoided emission-related recalls, resulting in financial benefit to Toyota and excess emissions of air pollutants.” Toyota said in a statement the company nearly five years ago “identified and self-reported a process gap that resulted in a delay in the filing of certain non-public EPA reports for emissions-related defects in vehicles.” The automaker added that “while this reporting delay resulted in a negligible emissions impact, if any, we recognize that some of our reporting protocols fell short of our own high standards, and we are pleased to have resolved this matter.” Over a 10-year period ending in 2015, Toyota “routinely filed emission defect reports to EPA materially late and, in many cases, failed to file such reports at all until a self-disclosure of non-compliance” in 2015, the Justice Department said in a court filing. The government initially sought a substantially higher civil penalty from Toyota, sources briefed on the matter said. The $180 million fine is the largest civil penalty for violation of EPA’s emission-reporting requirements. “Toyota failed to report mandatory information about potential defects in their cars to the EPA, keeping the agency in the dark and evading oversight.

0.346744507160833," Hyundai says in early talks with Apple after electric vehicle tie-up report SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co said on Friday it was in early talks with Apple, after local media reported the firms were discussing an electric car and battery tie-up, sending Hyundai shares surging 25%. The report comes weeks after Reuters reported that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology and was aiming to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024. Earlier on Friday, Korea Economic Daily TV said the iPhone maker and Hyundai were in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. The broadcaster didn’t cite sources. “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided,” Hyundai said in a statement. It didn’t say what the talks were about and omitted a reference in an earlier statement to Apple being in discussions with other global automakers as well as Hyundai. In a regulatory filing issued later, the automaker said it was “getting requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies”, without identifying any of them. Apple declined to comment. The iPhone maker is known to keep product plans under tight wraps. An Apple-branded car could be a big challenge to electric vehicle (EV) market leader Tesla Inc. It remains unclear who would assemble such a car, but analysts have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner. “We continue to strongly believe Apple ultimately announces an EV strategic partnership in 2021 that lays the groundwork to enter the burgeoning EV space,” Wedbush analysts said in a note. Hyundai and Apple already work together on CarPlay, Apple’s software for connecting iPhones to a variety of vehicles. “Apple outsourcing car production to Hyundai makes sense, because (the Korean firm) is known for quality,” said Jeong Yun-woo, a former designer at Hyundai and a professor at UNIST in South Korea. “But I’m not sure whether it is a good strategy for automakers to be like the Foxconn of Apple as automakers face risks of losing control to tech firms,” he added, referring to the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer’s supply contract with Apple on iPhones. Analysts said Apple may be interested in using Hyundai’s electric car platform and facilities to cut costs to develop and make vehicles. “Apple could see Hyundai as an ideal partner, because when it comes to legacy U.S. automakers, they all have strong unions, which Apple would like to avoid,” said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities. “Moreover, their (legacy U.S. automakers) labour cost is much higher than that of Hyundai, which often plays a big role when it comes to car production.” A tie-up with Apple would be a major boost to Hyundai, whose global sales last year fell more than 15% as the pandemic took a toll on demand. Friday’s share price surge added nearly $8 billion to Hyundai’s market value. A longtime champion of rival hydrogen fuel cell cars, Hyundai recently increased bets on battery-powered electric cars, a move welcomed by investors eyeing the recent success of Tesla. The South Korean company, which sources batteries from SK Innovation Co Ltd and LG Chem Ltd and others, is expected to launch its first car based on a dedicated electric car platform known as E-GMP early this year. In 2019, Hyundai and auto parts supplier Aptiv launched a $4 billion venture to develop self-driving technologies, naming it Motional. Last month, ride-hailing firm Lyft and Motional said they would launch a multi-city U.S. robo-taxi service in 2023. Hyundai does not have dedicated electric car factories in the United States and it may have to gain consent from its powerful union in South Korea were it to seek to build EVs overseas, analysts said. It is not known whether Apple is in talks with other carmakers. Japanese automaker Honda Motor has not held talks with the iPhone maker, a spokesman told Reuters. Bigger rivalToyota Motor Corp said it does not comment on speculation, as did Foxconn. Shares in Hyundai Motor jumped as much as 24.8%, hitting a more than seven-year high of 255,000 won, before closing up 19%. Auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd ended the session 18% higher, while Kia shares jumped 8.4%. Battery makers also gained ground, with SK Innovation closing up 7.6%. The broader KOSPI market closed up 3.97%."
1.3296646535621255," Toyota's sales in China rise 11% in 2020 even as pandemic hits market BEIJING (Reuters) -Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it sold 1.8 million vehicles last year in China, up 11% from a year earlier, narrowing the gap with Volkswagen AG and General Motors CO in the world’s biggest car market. In China, an increasingly important market for top Japanese automaker Toyota, the company has partnerships with FAW and GAC and is adding new car plants for electric vehicles to meet government requirements. It also sold 223,700 imported premium Lexus vehicles in China, an increase of 11.5% from 2019. Automakers’ sales slumped in the first months of last year in China as the government implemented travel restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. But overall sales recovered in the second half and China’s auto industry now expects sales to have declined just 1.9% last year. Toyota did not offer a sales target for China this year in the statement. Rival GM sold 2.9 million vehicles last year in China, down 6.2% compared with 2019. Volkswagen, which sold more than 3 million vehicles in 2019, has not announced its 2020 China sales yet. The Japanese company has also launched a new joint venture for hydrogen fuel cell systems with several Chinese automakers as it touts own technology in the country. It is also developing autonomous driving technologies with startup Pony.ai, which has a Chinese background."
1.3296646535621255," Corporate group urges officials consider Trump's removal 'to preserve democracy' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a major U.S. business group that represents 14,000 companies including Exxon Mobil Corp, Pfizer Inc and Toyota Motor Corp urged senior U.S. officials to consider removing President Donald Trump from office after supporters of the outgoing president stormed the U.S. Capitol. National Association of Manufacturers Chief Executive Jay Timmons said Trump “incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy. ... Vice President (Mike) Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy.” Trump has 14 days remaining in office before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. The mayhem at the Capitol forced Congress to temporarily postpone a session to certify Biden’s victory. The chaotic scenes unfolded after Trump, who before the election refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost, addressed thousands of supporters near the White House, repeating unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him due to widespread fraud and irregularities. Other business groups issued strong statements but did not go as far as the manufacturers’ group. Under the amendment’s Section 4, never invoked, the vice president and a majority of either Cabinet officials or “such other body as Congress may by law provide” may declare in writing that the president “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Several Democratic lawmakers in Congress also urged Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of some of America’s biggest companies, said that “the chaos unfolding in the nation’s capital is the result of unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election.” They called on Trump “and all relevant officials to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power,” the group said in a statement. ‘TIME TO COME TOGETHER’ Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said “those responsible for this insurrection should be held to account, and we must complete the transition to President-elect Biden’s administration.” JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said: “Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power. Now is the time to come together to strengthen our exceptional union.” Blackstone Group Chief Executive Steve Schwarzman, a Trump ally, said in a statement: “The insurrection that followed the President’s remarks today is appalling and an affront to the democratic values we hold dear as Americans. I am shocked and horrified by this mob’s attempt to undermine our constitution.” Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an internal message reported earlier by Axios and confirmed by a company official that “we need our political leaders to lead by example and put the nation first.... We removed the recent video of President Trump’s remarks expressing support for the people causing the violence. We are treating this situation as an emergency.” General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Twitter that “the violence at the U.S. Capitol does not reflect who we are as a nation. It’s imperative that we come together as a country and reinforce the values and ideals that unite us.” The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful business lobby based near the White House, said that “attacks against our nation’s Capitol Building and our democracy must end now.” “The Congress of the United States must gather again this evening to conclude their Constitutional responsibility to accept the report of the Electoral College,” Thomas Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Lawmakers reconvened shortly after 8 p.m. (0100 GMT on Thursday) to resume the election certification. “To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today - you did not win,” Pence said as the session resumed. “Let’s get back to work,” he said,"
1.2907503764309265," Increased new-car demand during pandemic has U.S. industry optimistic about 2021 (Reuters) -Increased demand for new vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic helped General Motors Co and other automakers report strong fourth-quarter U.S. sales on Tuesday, and executives voiced optimism the rebound from low sales during the April-May production shutdown will continue in 2021. GM reported a 4.8% increase in U.S. sales in the fourth quarter, while Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG saw their sales rise 9.4% and 10.8%, respectively. Industry officials expect the U.S. auto sector to finish the year with 2020 sales in the range of 14.5 million to 14.6 million, which would be down from 17.1 million in 2019. But with vaccines being rolled out, low interest rates and strong consumer savings, officials expect demand this year to rebound. Toyota officials said they expect 2021 U.S. new-vehicle sales of 16 million, while VW forecast 15.6 million. “We’re ready to rock 2021,” David Christ, Toyota Motor North America group vice president and general manager of the Toyota division, told reporters on a conference call, describing the U.S. consumer as resilient. Volkswagen of America Chief Executive Scott Keogh agreed on 2021 expectations in a separate call. “I’m as optimistic as one can be.” GM Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg said the U.S. automaker sees an “inflection point” for the U.S. economy in the spring. The Detroit automaker’s average transaction price per new vehicle set a full-year record of $39,229 in 2020. “Widening vaccination rates and warmer weather should enable consumers and businesses to return to a more normal range of activities, lifting the job market, consumer sentiment and auto demand,” she said in a statement. Consumers in the financial position to buy a new car during the coronavirus pandemic aren’t holding back on upsizing their purchases in favor of bigger vehicles with more amenities, according to industry consultant Edmunds. The average down payment for a new vehicle climbed to $4,734 in the fourth quarter, from $4,329 a year ago, Edmunds said."
-0.42384039735098605," Toyota unveils new fuel cell car in fresh push on hydrogen technology Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) put its revamped Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car, with 30% greater range, on sale on Wednesday in a fresh push to promote zero-emission technology amid growing demand for electric vehicles, including its own. Toyota has failed until now to win drivers over to fuel cell vehicles (FCV), which remain a niche technology despite Japanese government backing, amid concerns about lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions. ""The new Mirai will serve as a new departure point for creating a hydrogen-based society of the future,"" Toyota said in a statement. It will cost about 5 million yen ($48,000) after subsidies, about the same as its predecessor. By the end of September Toyota had sold only 11,100 of its first generation Mirai, almost six years after its launch. Most other automakers have eschewed FCV in favour of electric vehicles (EV). In 2019, automakers sold 2.1 million electric cars, 40% more than the previous year, the International Energy Agency says. The new Mirai launch comes after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a goal in October to cut Japan's carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Toyota had planned to use the postponed 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo as a platform to showcase its fuel cell technology, with 100 buses meant to shuttle visitors between venues. The Japanese firm is also looking to China, the world's biggest automarket, which has just about 7,000 FCVs, versus more than 4 million EVs, to boost demand. Fresh support measures for FCVs announced in September included requiring projects with government subsidies to boost the number of hydrogen-charging stations and efforts to cut the price of the fuel.

7.566714666144423," Toyota unveils new fuel cell car in fresh push on hydrogen technology TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp put its revamped Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car, with 30% greater range, on sale on Wednesday in a fresh push to promote the zero-emission technology amid rapidly growing demand for electric vehicles, including its own. Toyota has failed until now to win drivers over to fuel cell vehicles (FCV), which remain a niche technology despite Japanese government backing, amid concerns about a lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions. The new Mirai launch comes after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a goal in October to cut Japan’s carbon emissions to zero by 2050, in line with a European Union target and ahead of a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping to make his country “carbon neutral” by 2060. “The use of hydrogen is going to be an important factor in achieving carbon neutrality,” Yoshikazu Tanaka, Mirai’s chief engineer said. The car, he added represented a “departure point” for a broader use of hydrogen fuel cells beyond cars. Hydrogen backers say it is cleaner than other carbon cutting technologies because water and heat are the only byproducts and it can be made from sources, including methane, coal, water, even garbage. Resource-poor Japan also sees it as a route to energy security. By the end of September Toyota, however, had sold only 11,100 of its first generation Mirai, almost six years after its launch. Most other automakers have eschewed the technology in favour of electric vehicles (EV), with only Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor in neighbouring South Korea competing in hydrogen FCVs. The new Mirai, like its predecessor, is still beyond the budget of most drivers at about 5 million yen ($48,000) even after more than $10,000 in Japanese government subsidies. Rather than produce a cheaper car, Toyota said it wants to lure drivers with longer range - enough to drive around 800 kilometres (497 miles) without refueling - added features such as autonomous parking and a lower, sleeker design achieved by moving the hydrogen power unit to the front of the vehicle from under the car. Accompanying the Mirai’s launch Toyota said it planned to increase the production capacity for all FCVs, including buses and trucks, to 30,000 a year from 3,000. That output, however is still far behind sales of electric vehicles. In 2019, automakers sold 2.1 million electric cars alone, 40% more than the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency. Toyota had planned to use the postponed 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo to showcase its fuel cell technology, with 100 buses meant to shuttle visitors between venues. The games organizer also planned to power the Olympic flame with hydrogen. The Mirai revamp comes after Toyota on Tuesday, announced plans to test small FCV trucks with Japan’s three major convenience store operators, Seven & i Holdings’ Seven Eleven, Itochu Corp’s FamilyMart and Lawson Inc . Toyota’s best chance of selling the Mirai and other FCV may, however, be in neighbouring China, where it has an FCV partnership with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) and FAW Group. There are around 7,000 FCVs are on the road in the world’s biggest automarket, versus more than 4 million EVs. China, which is aiming for more than 1 million FCVs in service by 2030 compared with a Japanese target for 800,000, in September announced fresh support measures for FCVs that included requiring projects receiving government subsidies to boost the number of hydrogen-charging stations and make efforts to cut fuel prices."
7.2964187027036775," Japanese companies form industry group to support hydrogen supply chain TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies including Toyota Motor Corp have established a new organisation, the Japan Hydrogen Association, to promote the creation of a hydrogen supply chain in the country, its board member companies said on Monday. The move comes as Japan targets the creation of a commercial hydrogen fuel distribution chain by around 2030 to cut carbon emissions, and follows Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s declaration of an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral in 2050. The association, co-headed by the chairmen of Toyota, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc and Iwatani Corp, plans to make policy recommendations to the government in February next year. “To implement hydrogen in society in earnest, discontinuous innovation that goes beyond previous efforts is necessary ,” Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada told a news conference, referring to dramatic changes in an industry that alter end-user behaviour. “Deregulation is also important,” he added. Other board members include oil refiner Eneos Holdings Inc and trading house Mitsui & Co. As of Monday, 88 companies from a wide range of industries had participated as member companies. Industry Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said he would fully support the movement by the private sector. “We will create a market environment where the CO2-free value of hydrogen can be fairly evaluated,” he said. The government plans to use part of the 2 trillion yen ($19 billion) fund aimed at helping research and development for decarbonisation announced by Suga last Friday to support hydrogen technology, Kajiyama said. “We will consider using all policy tools including regulatory reforms, tax incentives and international standardization,” he said. “We want to map out an action plan as a package for a green growth strategy later this year.”"
7.506341259775956," Rallying: Ogier wins seventh world title in eight years MILAN (Reuters) - Sebastien Ogier clinched the world rally championship for the seventh time in eight years after the Frenchman won the season-ending Rally Monza on Sunday. French drivers named Sebastien have now won 16 of the last 17 titles, with Sebastien Loeb winning nine in a row with Citroen before Ogier, 36, took over at the top from 2013. His Toyota team mate Elfyn Evans, who had a 14-point lead before the final round in northern Italy, crashed out on a snowy Saturday but returned for the final three stages at Monza circuit on Sunday. Ogier won the rally by 13.9 seconds, with Hyundai’s outgoing champion Ott Tanak runner-up to finish third overall in the championship. Ogier, who has now won titles with three different manufacturers after four with Volkswagen and two for Ford, finished eight points clear of the Welshman in a championship reduced to seven rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Evans finished outside the top 10 but banked three points from the final Power Stage in wet conditions. “It was a difficult weekend and this last stage was not enjoyable,” said Ogier, whose car’s wipers failed him momentarily on the muddy final stage. “I knew there were still a couple of narrow gates to pass and it would have been challenging without seeing anything,” he added. “We feel sorry for Elfyn. We had great fun fighting each other this season, and I am sure next year will be the same.” Tanak finished 1.4 seconds ahead of Spanish team mate Dani Sordo, to clinch the manufacturers’ title for Hyundai -- five points clear of Toyota -- for the second season in a row."
7.405268349763292," Ogier set for seventh title after Evans crashes in Monza MILAN (Reuters) - Sebastien Ogier was set for a seventh world rally title in eight years after championship-leading Toyota team mate Elfyn Evans crashed in the season-ending Monza Rally on Saturday. The Frenchman, who completed the penultimate day with a 17.8-second lead over Hyundai’s Spaniard Dani Sordo, cannot rest easy however since he still has to overhaul Evans’s 14-point advantage. He faces three more stages on Sunday at the Monza circuit, the historic ‘Cathedral of Speed’ that hosts Italy’s Formula One Grand Prix, after Saturday’s snowy stages in the Alpine foothills near Como. Evans had hoped to become the third Briton, and first Welshman, to win the title after the late Colin McRae in 1995 and Richard Burns in 2001. He was running in third place when he skidded off on an icy stage 11, the car going down a bank and into trees. The crew were unhurt but could not get the Yaris back on the road. The Welshman ran back on to the road to warn the approaching Ogier of the danger. “It was incredible, there is nothing Elfyn could do. I am very sorry for him. The championship is not over,” said Ogier after negotiating the stage and saluting the sporting gesture. “It was just like glass and there was no chance of us slowing down at all. It completely caught me by surprise,” said Evans. “You’re not going to win anything by sitting around at the back and I think everybody was having to take some sort of chance.” Team boss and retired four-times world champion Tommi Makinen commiserated with the Welshman, who could still return for Sunday in the hope of scoring points in the final Power Stage where a maximum five are available. “Elfyn handled it very well and had an incredible drive. It’s so difficult to understand what is the correct speed in these kinds of conditions,” he said. Reigning champion Ott Tanak, who remains in mathematical contention, ended the day third for Hyundai who were on course to take the manufacturers’ title."

The Frenchman is 14 points behind championship-leading Toyota team mate Elfyn Evans after six rounds of a COVID-19 ravaged season. “I need to win, so I need to give everything. The conditions will still play a big part so we have to be good,” said the Frenchman. Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville and reigning champion Ott Tanak also remain in contention mathematically, the Belgian 24 points off the lead and the Estonian 28 behind Evans with a maximum 30 to play for. Neuville was half a second behind Ogier after stage one with Tanak a further 1.5 adrift and Evans fourth with another 0.7 to make up. “I was a bit careful and we’re going to have to go quicker than that during the weekend. It was key to get through this one,” said Evans, who would be the third British world rally champion if he prevails on Sunday. The rally is held at the Monza circuit near Milan and in the foothills of the Alps around Lake Como."

5.9858184367580085," Toyota halts operations at Indian plant again as union strike continues BENGALURU (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp again halted operations at its car plant in southern India from Monday, as the majority of members of its workers’ union continued a sit-in strike, the automaker said. Both the Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) factories in the industrial hub of Bidadi, Karnataka, had declared a “lock out” on Nov. 10 after the union went on strike, saying that their demand to withdraw the suspension of a worker was not met. The local state government’s labour department had prohibited the strike by the workmen, as well as the “legal lock out” declared by the management from Nov. 19 and directed operations to resume, a spokesperson for the automaker’s India unit said on Tuesday. Even after the lock out was lifted by TKM, only a few team members have reported to work, the company said. “For plant operations to run smoothly and effectively, a minimum workforce of 90% in each shift is required. In view of the current situation, it is not viable to carry on with manufacturing activity.” The disruption follows several months of a slump in sales, and comes at a time when vehicle deliveries to dealers are picking up in anticipation of strong demand during the November festive period in India. The country’s top car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd last month said sales between October and December were expected to be good due to demand for personal transport and big-ticket purchases during the festive season."

The Note’s first full model change in eight years is part of a plan by the carmaker to revamp an aging vehicle line up and return to profitability as it pulls back from the expansion pursued by former Chairman Carlos Ghosn to focus on sales in Japan, China and the United States. The Note will feature “e-Power” hybrid technology, which uses a gasoline engine to charge a battery that powers the vehicle. New autonomous drive functions will help drivers slow down on curves using data from the car’s navigation system. Nissan, which expects to post a record operating loss of 340 billion yen ($3.25 billion) in the year to March 31, is cutting production capacity and model numbers by a fifth and aims to slash operating expenses by 300 billion yen over three years. At the same time, it has promised to launch a slew of vehicles in Japan, China and the United States, including new electric vehicles to lure increasingly environment-conscious drivers. In Japan, the Note, which uses a platform designed with French alliance partner Renault SA, will compete With Toyota’s Yaris and Honda’s Fit. A Nissan spokeswoman said the automaker has not made any decision on selling the redesigned vehicle in other markets."
8.034895939108699," Auto group sues to block Massachusetts vehicle data initiative WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and other major automakers filed suit on Friday to block a Massachusetts state ballot initiative that seeks to dramatically expand access to vehicle data. Earlier this month, voters in Massachusetts overwhelmingly approved an initiative to revise the state’s 2013 “Right to Repair” law to require automakers to provide expanded access to mechanical and electronic repair data and allow independent shops to repair increasingly sophisticated technology. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation trade group said if the law takes effect “years of manufacturers’ work and billions of dollars in investment to protect and secure vehicle data will effectively be obliterated.” The court battle may help determine who will control the $390 billion U.S. auto data aftermarket in the digital age. The auto group asked a U.S. district court judge in Boston to block the law, which is set to take effect in the 2022 model year. The Massachusetts attorney general’s office declined to comment. Unprecedented advancements in modern vehicles and crash avoidance systems have prompted many automakers to limit information and warranties to only parts and repairs from authorized dealers to ensure safety and privacy. They argue such data is complex and sensitive, and that using content to repair modern cars requires extensive training by those with proprietary technology. Independent repair groups have rebuked those restrictions as an attempt to seize control of the lucrative repair market and a way to force consumers into more expensive manufacturer-affiliated dealer shops. They are also concerned by automakers increasingly pushing for wireless repair data transfers, which will limit third-party access. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in July the measure “requires vehicle manufacturers to redesign their vehicles in a manner that necessarily introduces cybersecurity risks, and to do so in a timeframe that makes design, proof, and implementation of any meaningful countermeasure effectively impossible.”"

The 36-year-old Frenchman is still in the running for a seventh title but is 14 points behind Welsh team mate Elfyn Evans with one round remaining, the Monza Rally in Italy next month. The season has been limited to just seven rounds due to the pandemic, with Ogier winning in Mexico in March. “We have had a short season with only a few rallies, but enough for me to see that I really enjoy working with the team, I enjoy driving this car,” said Ogier, who had planned to retire at the end of 2020. “The fact that I had to spend like most people a lot of time at home this year, I didn’t do the last season that I had expected to do and to end my career with such a strange season was not great. “So, for sure, that was one of the reasons to change my mind about my retirement. The plan is to keep pushing in 2021 and hopefully have a better, normal season and try to push for a last title.” Ogier won four titles with Volkswagen from 2013-16 and then two with M-Sport Ford in 2017-18. He has won 48 world championship rallies. He joined Toyota from Citroen at the end of last year."

The alliance which currently includes a cooperation deal on fuel cell cars and joint development of a sports-car, should continue beyond 2025, Zipse said. Fuel cell cars, which are powered by hydrogen, may benefit from a concerted push by policymakers, to industrialise the production of hydrogen, Zipse said. Separately, Zipse said BMW is seeking ways to save costs by slimming down its portfolio of models. “Coupés, convertibles and roadsters, we will see what will be left,” Zipse said, commenting about one of the areas where BMW is reviewing its product offering."
11.55250313173787," Toyota halts production at Indian plant after labour union strike NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has been forced to halt production at its car plant in southern India after members of a workers’ union went on a sit-in strike within the premises, the automaker said on Wednesday. “Due to the current volatile atmosphere and to protect the safety of employees, Toyota Kirloskar Motor is forced to declare a lock-out until further notice,” a spokesperson for the automaker’s India unit said in a statement. There has not been any production at the Toyota Kirloskar Motor plant on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the lock-out, the spokesperson added, saying that operations would resume once the situation returns to normal. The disruption comes at a time when, after several months of slumping sales, vehicle deliveries to dealers are picking up in anticipation of strong demand during the festive period in November. Wholesale dispatches of passenger cars rose 14% in October from a year ago, industry data showed, as Indians typically make large purchases in the run up to major festivals like Diwali later this week. Toyota’s sales to dealers were 4% higher in October from a year ago and jumped 52% compared with September as supply chain disruptions eased and consumer demand returned. Toyota will try and meet customer demand from the vehicles it has in stock at its factory and with its dealers, the spokesperson said. The union went on strike earlier this week after their demand to withdraw the suspension of one of the workers was not met. The employee was involved in a “breach of discipline and unacceptable behaviour which is in violation of law and service policy of the company,” the spokesperson said, adding that the person has been suspended pending an enquiry. “The union resorted to an illegal strike, including team members unlawfully staying in the company premises,” the spokesperson said, adding the company is in talks with relevant stakeholders to resolve the issue."
9.956271354728976," Toyota more than doubles profit outlook as China sales rebound from pandemic TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp more than doubled its full-year operating profit forecast on Friday, as vehicle sales rebound in China from a coronavirus pandemic squeeze earlier this year that contributed to a 24% slide in second-quarter earnings. Japan’s top automaker said it now expects an operating profit of 1.3 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) for the year through March, 2021, up from the 500 billion it predicted previously. Operating profit for the previous financial year was 2.47 trillion yen. That topped the 1.25 trillion yen average estimate for full-year profit from 26 analysts polled by Refinitiv. For the second quarter, from July to September, operating profit fell to 506 billion yen from 662.4 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to Reuters’ calculations, as sales dipped amid the coronavirus impact globally. Still, the numbers already showed progress compared with April-June, Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon said. “If you compare the second quarter to the first you can see a dramatic recovery,” Kon said, speaking during an online press briefing. Reaction from investors was muted, with shares up just 0.5% near the close of trading in Tokyo, while the Nikkei benchmark index rose 0.9%. “Investors are looking at how Toyota is faring overseas and given the yen’s appreciation (versus the dollar) and a resurgence of the coronavirus, we have to consider the (profit forecast) revision cautiously,” said Kazuo Kamiya, a fund manager at Nomura Securities. A strong yen reduces the value of sales booked in the United States. The maker of the RAV4 sports utility vehicle (SUV) crossover and the Prius gasoline hybrid now expects to sell 9.42 million cars this year - up 3.5% from a previous forecasts of 9.1 million this year, but still well below last year’s sales of 10.46 million. Although still weaker than last year, demand has bounced back, particularly in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Toyota and rivals are pinning recovery hopes on winning business there as China recovers from the pandemic faster than other countries. Overall vehicle sales in China in September increased 12.8%, a sixth straight monthly gain, although sales were still 6.9% lower than the same time a year earlier. Toyota has seen demand in China increase for its electric cars and Lexus luxury brand. A senior Toyota executive in China said in September that annual global sales of electrified vehicles could reach 5.5 million in 2025, five years earlier than initially planned. ($1 = 103.5700 yen)"

The funding was led by Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board’s (Ontario Teachers’) Teachers’ Innovation Platform (OTPP), Pony.ai said in a statement. “The company will explore mobility services with Toyota,” Chief Executive James Peng said, without disclosing further details. Fremont-based Pony.ai, which is also backed by Sequoia Capital China and Beijing Kunlun Tech Co, plans to use the funding to develop technology and expand its fleet. Pony.ai started developing its autonomous truck technologies by early 2019, Peng told Reuters. The company tests its vehicles in Fremont, Irvine, and in Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Beijing and also recently launched an operation site in Shanghai. The firm is showcasing its autonomous Lexus sport-utility vehicle and an FAW’s truck at the China International Import Expo, or CIIE, an annual import show in Shanghai that started on Wednesday and runs into the next week.

The team also announced that Mike Wheeler will be Wallace’s crew chief. “My main goal for 23XI Racing is to be competitive for a championship as soon as possible,” Jordan said in a statement. “Our partnership with Toyota and Joe Gibbs Racing gives us the equipment, resources and expertise to do it.” Hamlin added in a statement, “Toyota has been a big part of my NASCAR career. We’ve achieved multiple milestones together including back-to-back Daytona 500 victories. I know how they support their teams, and when I decided move to team ownership, I knew that I wanted Toyota to be alongside our team. “Toyota supports my vision with this team and will be integrated with our team members to support us as we grow and strive to achieve race wins and championships.” Ed Laukes, group vice president of Toyota division marketing at Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. “As a Chicago native, I saw firsthand Michael’s determination as he led his team to multiple NBA championships. I know he brings that same drive and work ethic to this new opportunity. “Denny has been a valuable part of the Toyota family for over a decade, and we are happy to support him as he takes the next step into NASCAR team ownership. “We are also thrilled to bring Bubba back to the Toyota family. Bubba achieved many firsts with Toyota, and we are counting on him earning many more victories with 23XI Racing behind the wheel of a Camry.” Wheeler’s first experience as a NASCAR Cup Series crew chief was a six-race interim stint in 2014 for Hamlin’s car when the normal crew chief, Darian Grubb, was suspended. Wheeler was Hamlin’s full-time crew chief from 2016-18, and the pair teamed for five wins, including the 2016 Daytona 500. Wheeler worked the past two years as a crew chief for Leavine Family Racing’s No. 95 car, driven last year by Matt DiBenedetto and this year by Christopher Bell. Wallace has spent four years on the NASCAR Cup Series driving for Richard Petty Motorsports, piloting the iconic No. 43 car, which was a Ford in 2017 and then a Chevrolet the past three years. Wallace previously drove the No. 54 Toyota for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the NASCAR Truck Series, and his debut in the second-tier Xfinity Series came in the No. 20 Toyota. --Field Level Media"

14.122104021747248," Japan looks to AI as coronavirus challenges go-and-see quality control mantra TOKYO (Reuters) - At a factory south of Japan’s Toyota City, robots have started sharing the work of quality-control inspectors, as the pandemic accelerates a shift from Toyota’s vaunted “go and see” system which helped revolutionise mass production in the 20th century. Inside the auto-parts plant of Musashi Seimitsu Industry Co Ltd 7220.T, a robotic arm picks up and spins a bevel gear, scanning its teeth against a light in search of surface flaws. The inspection takes about two seconds - similar to that of highly trained employees who check around 1,000 units per shift. “Inspecting 1,000 of the exact same thing day-in day-out requires a lot of skill and expertise, but it’s not very creative,” Chief Executive Hiroshi Otsuka told Reuters. “We’d like to release workers from those tasks.” Global manufacturers have long used robots in production while leaving the knotty work of spotting flaws mainly to humans. But social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have prompted a rethink of the factory floor. That has spurred the increased use of robots and other technology for quality control, including remote monitoring which was already being adopted before the pandemic. For a chart on global installations of manufacturing robots, click here here In Japan, such approaches represent an acute departure from the “genchi genbutsu”, go-and-see methodology developed as part of the Toyota Production System and embraced by Japanese manufacturers for decades with almost religious zeal. That process tasks workers with constantly monitoring all aspects of the production line to spot irregularities, and has made quality control one of the last human hold-outs in otherwise automated factories. Yet even at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T itself, when asked about automating more genchi genbutsu procedures, a spokesman said: ""We are always looking at ways to improve our manufacturing processes, including automating processes where it makes sense to do so."" Improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) have come in tandem with increasingly affordable equipment but also stricter quality requirements from customers. ""We're increasingly seeing a gap between the quality of products made on regular production lines and the quality our customers demand,"" said Kazutaka Nagaoka, chief manufacturing officer at Japan Display 6740.T, a supplier to Apple Inc AAPL.O as well as numerous automakers. “The quality of products made on automated lines is overwhelmingly higher, and more consistent.” However, automating inspections is challenging, given the need to teach robots to identify tens of thousands of possible defects for a specific product and apply that learning instantly. Musashi Seimitsu’s low defect rate of one per 50,000 units left the firm without enough defective examples to develop an efficient AI algorithm. But a solution came from Israeli entrepreneur Ran Poliakine, who applied AI and optics technology he had used in medical diagnostics to the production line. His idea was to teach the machine to spot the good, rather than the bad, by basing the algorithm on up to 100 perfect or near-perfect units - a modification of the so-called golden sample. “If you look at human tissue, you are teaching an algorithm what is good and what is not good, and you only have one second to perform the diagnostic,” he said. ‘ON STEROIDS’ Since the breakthrough, Poliakine’s startup SixAI and Musashi Seimitsu have established MusashiAI, a joint venture which develops and hires out quality control robots - a first in the field. Enquiries from automakers, parts suppliers and other firms in Japan, India, the United States and Europe have quadrupled since March when the novel coronavirus went global, Poliakine said. “COVID-19 has accelerated the move. Everything is on steroids now, because working from home is showing that remote work can work,” he said. For a chart on the five biggest users of manufacturing robots, click here here Earlier this year auto parts maker Marelli, which has operational headquarters in Japan and Italy, also began using AI quality inspection robots at a plant in Japan, and told Reuters last month that it wanted AI to play a bigger role in quality inspections in the coming years. Printer maker Ricoh Co Ltd 7752.T, plans to automate all of the production processes for drum units and toner cartridges at one of its Japan plants by March 2023. Robots perform most of the processes already, and since April, technicians have been monitoring equipment on the factory floor from home. “Of course, you need to be on site to assess and execute solutions when issues come up, but identifying and confirming are tasks we can now do from home,” said Kazuhiro Kanno, general manager at Ricoh’s printer manufacturing unit.

It was also a third triumph in a row at the famed Sarthe circuit for the Japanese driver’s Swiss team mate Sebastien Buemi in the last Le Mans before the start of a new Hypercar era in 2021. New Zealander Brendon Hartley, who replaced double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso in the eight car lineup after the Spaniard’s wins in 2018 and 2019, previously won with Porsche in 2017. The race, first held in 1923 and now in its 88th edition, was held for the first time without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year’s event attracted 250,000, many of them British motor racing fans making the trek to the circuit in northwest France. “We miss the fans. It doesn’t feel quite the same as it normally does,” said Hartley, before clambering onto the roof of the winning car with Buemi when Nakajima brought it back to the pitlane. “To win it with two different manufacturers feels amazing. I feel at home here, I love it.” Swiss-based Rebellion Racing’s number one R13 Gibson car driven by Brazilian Bruno Senna, American Gustavo Menezes and France’s Norman Nato, finished second and Toyota completed the podium with their number seven car. That meant heartache for Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi, Britain’s Mike Conway and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez, runners-up to the sister car in the last two years, after starting from pole position. Toyota, the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category and again crowned World Endurance Champions, had led one-two as night fell over the circuit on Saturday but the order was soon to change. The number seven car lost half an hour in the garage with a turbo problem that could have proved terminal just after the halfway mark. That dropped the number seven to fourth overall but they managed to overhaul the number three Rebellion to secure a podium finish in a race that stayed dry throughout. United Autosports’ number 22 car finished fifth to win the LMP2 category with Britons Paul di Resta and Philip Hanson along with Portugal’s Filipe Albuquerque.

15.66072461773568," Toyota heading for Le Mans 24 Hours hat-trick LE MANS, France (Reuters) - The sun rose over Le Mans on Sunday with Toyota heading for a third successive 24 Hours title with the number eight car shared by Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima, New Zealander Brendon Hartley and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi. Hopes of a one-two finish receded in the early hours when the team’s number seven car lost half an hour in the garage with a turbo problem just after the halfway mark. That was a blow for World Endurance Championship (WEC) leaders Kamui Kobayashi of Japan, Britain’s Mike Conway and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez, who had started on pole position seeking their first Le Mans win. The trio have been runners up for the past two years. Nakajima and Buemi won in 2018 and 2019 alongside Spain’s double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso, who is absent this year. The problems dropped the number seven Toyota to fourth overall, with the numbers one and three Rebellion Racing cars running second and third at the 18-hour mark but three and four laps off the pace respectively. Toyota had led one-two into the night. The 88th edition of the race at the Sarthe circuit is being held without spectators for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year’s event attracted 250,000 spectators, many of them British motor racing fans, to the circuit in northwest France. Le Mans is the world’s oldest sportscar race, first run in 1923, but Toyota are now the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category in the last year before the new Hypercar era. Only four LMP1 cars remained in the race - the Toyotas and two Rebellion R13 Gibsons - after the ByKolles Racing entry retired on Saturday evening."
14.5481474074074," Automakers in India should reduce royalty payments to foreign parents - official NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian automakers should reduce royalty payments to foreign partners to bring down costs instead of seeking tax cuts, a finance ministry official said on Thursday, days after reports that Toyota would halt expansion in the country due to high taxes. Having suffered a 50% fall in passenger vehicle sales in the five months through August as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have lobbied the government to lower taxes. But on Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s biggest carmaker, issued a statement saying it is committed to the Indian market after a senior executive at its local unit said the automaker would not scale up in the country if taxes remain high. The Japanese automaker issued another statement earlier on Thursday saying it plans to invest more than $272 million in India over coming years. Taxes on cars sold in India are as high as 28% and after additional levies can rise to up to 50% for some models. The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has urged the government to cut the tax on cars, motorbikes and buses to 18% while warning that it would take three to four years for sales to return to their peak levels of 2018. India’s tax policy on automobiles has been quite consistent for the last three decades in the form of allowing foreign investment and incentivising local manufacturing by providing reasonable protection from imports, said the finance ministry official, who did not want to be named. Automakers in India are accustomed to the country’s regulatory and taxation environment and have flourished in this regime, the official said, adding that this is evident from “the huge payouts in the form of royalty” made to their parent companies abroad. India’s commerce minister told representatives of automakers in the country that they should find ways to reduce royalty payments to foreign parent companies, Reuters reported last month. Representatives of Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest carmaker, and Toyota were among those that met with the minister.Maruti Suzuki paid 38.2 billion rupees as royalty to its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor in the fiscal year ending March 31, amounting to 5% of its revenue, according to its annual report. While Toyota’s India arm paid $88 million or 3.4% of revenue to its Japanese parent, government data shows."

Taxes on cars sold in India are as high as 28% and after additional levies can rise to up to 50% for some models. “The message we are getting, after we have come here and invested money, is that we don’t want you,” Bloomberg quoted Shekhar Viswanathan, vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, as saying on Tuesday. “We won’t exit India, but we won’t scale up,” Viswanathan said, in the absence of any reforms. Toyota Kirloskar Motors said in a statement it is committed to the Indian market after Viswanathan also said punitive taxes discourage foreign investment, erode automakers’ margins and make the cost of launching new products “prohibitive”. The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has urged the government to cut the tax on cars, motorbikes and buses to 18% to help boost sales that have been hit further during the coronavirus pandemic. India’s minister for heavy industries Prakash Javadekar said on Twitter that the automaker’s chairman Vikram Kirloskar has said that Toyota will invest more than 20 billion rupees ($272 million) in India over the next 12 months. Toyota has capacity to produce more than 400,000 vehicles a year at two plants in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, but data shows it made just over 100,000 cars last fiscal year."

2.9024912418180255," Toyota U.S. August sales fall 23% as pandemic weighs on inventory (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday reported a 23% drop in U.S. new vehicle sales in August versus the same month in 2019, as a two-month industrywide shutdown of auto production in the spring to halt the spread of COVID-19, as well as an uncertain economic recovery, weighed on sales. This was Toyota’s fifth straight month of U.S. sales declines. South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co said its U.S. sales fell 8.4% in August, largely due to a decline in fleet sales to rental car companies, government agencies and corporations. Hyundai had posted a slight sales gain in July. Automakers have struggled to get inventory to dealers to replenish stocks following the pandemic-fueled shutdowns. This has enabled them to scale back consumer discounts on popular models and raise vehicle prices. According to consultancies LMC and J.D. Power, which had predicted industrywide U.S. new vehicle sales to be down 20% in August, nearly 45% of vehicles sold during the month spent fewer than 20 days on dealer lots, 35 percentage points more than the previous year. TrueCar Inc subsidiary ALG said on Tuesday that the average transaction price for vehicles was up 3.9% in August versus the same month in 2019. While U.S. demand for new vehicles has remained stronger than expected after driving off a cliff in March and April as a number of states shut down because of the coronavirus, there is plenty of uncertainty over whether a sustained recovery is possible. Outbreaks of COVID-19 across southern and southwestern U.S. states during the summer appear to have slowed the economic recovery. Unemployment remains high and could weigh further on sales moving forward."

1.5328959505419548," CORRECTED-Japan looks to AI as coronavirus challenges go-and-see quality control mantra (Corrects 17th paragraph to say Marelli is not Italian; it has operational headquarters in Italy and Japan) TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - At a factory south of Japan’s Toyota City, robots have started sharing the work of quality-control inspectors, as the pandemic accelerates a shift from Toyota’s vaunted “go and see” system which helped revolutionise mass production in the 20th century. Inside the auto-parts plant of Musashi Seimitsu Industry Co Ltd, a robotic arm picks up and spins a bevel gear, scanning its teeth against a light in search of surface flaws. The inspection takes about two seconds - similar to that of highly trained employees who check around 1,000 units per shift. “Inspecting 1,000 of the exact same thing day-in day-out requires a lot of skill and expertise, but it’s not very creative,” Chief Executive Hiroshi Otsuka told Reuters. “We’d like to release workers from those tasks.” Global manufacturers have long used robots in production while leaving the knotty work of spotting flaws mainly to humans. But social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have prompted a rethink of the factory floor. That has spurred the increased use of robots and other technology for quality control, including remote monitoring which was already being adopted before the pandemic. For a chart on global installations of manufacturing robots, click here tmsnrt.rs/34yOHYz. In Japan, such approaches represent an acute departure from the “genchi genbutsu”, go-and-see methodology developed as part of the Toyota Production System and embraced by Japanese manufacturers for decades with almost religious zeal. That process tasks workers with constantly monitoring all aspects of the production line to spot irregularities, and has made quality control one of the last human hold-outs in otherwise automated factories. Yet even at Toyota Motor Corp itself, when asked about automating more genchi genbutsu procedures, a spokesman said: “We are always looking at ways to improve our manufacturing processes, including automating processes where it makes sense to do so.” Improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) have come in tandem with increasingly affordable equipment but also stricter quality requirements from customers. However, automating inspections is challenging, given the need to teach robots to identify tens of thousands of possible defects for a specific product and apply that learning instantly. Musashi Seimitsu’s low defect rate of one per 50,000 units left the firm without enough defective examples to develop an efficient AI algorithm. But a solution came from Israeli entrepreneur Ran Poliakine, who applied AI and optics technology he had used in medical diagnostics to the production line. His idea was to teach the machine to spot the good, rather than the bad, by basing the algorithm on up to 100 perfect or near-perfect units - a modification of the so-called golden sample. “If you look at human tissue, you are teaching an algorithm what is good and what is not good, and you only have one second to perform the diagnostic,” he said. ‘ON STEROIDS’ Since the breakthrough, Poliakine’s startup SixAI and Musashi Seimitsu have established MusashiAI, a joint venture which develops and hires out quality control robots - a first in the field. Enquiries from automakers, parts suppliers and other firms in Japan, India, the United States and Europe have quadrupled since March when the novel coronavirus went global, Poliakine said. “COVID-19 has accelerated the move. Everything is on steroids now, because working from home is showing that remote work can work,” he said. For a chart on the five biggest users of manufacturing robots, click here tmsnrt.rs/3hxNlB1. Earlier this year auto parts maker Marelli, which has operational headquarters in Japan and Italy, also began using AI quality inspection robots at a plant in Japan, and told Reuters last month that it wanted AI to play a bigger role in quality inspections in the coming years.

4.94160384758315," SoftBank, Toyota venture unveils van with enhanced airflow as COVID-19 measure TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese mobility venture has unveiled two adapted vans, one which can serve as a workspace or a mobile shop, and another that pumps fresh air through the vehicle to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading between passengers. It is the first commercial offering from Monet, a joint venture between SoftBank Corp 9434.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. In one version, the adapted Toyota Hiace van takes in outside air and circulates it through the interior, which is also fitted with screens and curtains to limit virus transmission. It can seat eight passengers in the back. The other version of the van allows users to fix fittings to the floor and arrange the interior as a shop or work space. The Monet joint venture was first announced in October 2018 with the goal of becoming a platform for driverless services. Neither design incorporates self-driving technology and, in the case of the multi-purpose design, Japan’s road rules require fittings such as tables to be stored before moving off. The venture hopes to sell 100 units in Japan to customers from government and companies this financial year. Monet is the first alliance between Japan’s largest automaker and its No.3 wireless carrier and has attracted support from other domestic automakers as the industry races to develop autonomous vehicles and services."

4.225455552241981," Toyota to offer cars in India on lease, subscription NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will offer its cars in India on leases or shorter-term subscriptions, hoping to tap growing demand for private transport as travelers cut down on communal journeys in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Japanese automaker said on Tuesday it would offer leasing plans to corporate and retail customers of three to five years across its portfolio of cars - including the Glanza hatchback, Yaris sedan and Fortuner sport-utility vehicle - for as little as 21,000 rupees ($281) a month. Naveen Soni, senior vice president, sales and service at the carmaker’s India unit, said the need for safe transport was growing and leasing or subscription models offered a more cost-effective solution than buying a car. So far, leasing and subscription services in India have largely focussed on the higher end of the auto market and therefore make up a fraction of the overall numbers, said Soni. “The lower end of the market is where the bulk is,” he said, adding that was where Toyota would also focus. Toyota's competitors in India, such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, have formed partnerships to offer similar services, as carmakers look to boost revenues amid the pandemic. Toyota’s India unit has formed a separate team to drive the business and it will partner with its Japanese parent’s global mobility services brand, KINTO, as well as ALD Automotive and SMAS Auto Leasing."

Production is expected to start next year building up to 150,000 future Mazda crossover vehicles and 150,000 Toyota sport utility vehicles annually. The Japanese automakers are expected to receive $97 million in additional tax incentives for the added investment, a person briefed on the matter said. The automakers have faced challenges as they continued construction work during the coronavirus pandemic on the plant, which will now cost about 50% more than first estimated. The companies said the higher investment “accommodates production line enhancements made to improve manufacturing processes.” The plant continues to target up to 4,000 new jobs and has hired approximately 600 employees to date. “Mazda and Toyota’s increased commitment to the development of this manufacturing plant reiterates their belief in the future of manufacturing in America and the potential for the state of Alabama to be an economic leader in the wake of unprecedented economic change,” Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said in a statement. The companies said the plant’s roofing, siding, floor slabs, ductwork, fire protection and electrical work is 75% to 100% complete. State and local governments in Alabama previously provided more than $700 million in tax incentives.

9.814137958660481," Japanese automakers post double-digit China sales growth in July BEIJING (Reuters) - Japanese automakers’ China sales grew by more than 10% from a year earlier in July as the world’s biggest auto market sustained its recovery. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said on Wednesday its sales in China rose 11.6% last month from a year earlier to 120,945 vehicles. China is a market that Nissan is focusing on as the embattled car maker struggles to fix problems from ousted leader Carlos Ghosn's aggressive expansion drive. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T sold around 165,600 cars last month in China, up 19.1% year-on-year. Of the total, 22,300 came from its premium Lexus brand, which showed a 38.6% sales jump compared to a year earlier.

12.344958453035234," U.S. auto sales pandemic recovery continues as Toyota decline slows DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales in July continued to show signs of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Monday posted its lowest sales decline since the COVID-19 outbreak slammed the sector in mid-March. The Japanese automaker said that its sales in July fell 19% versus the same month in 2019, to 169,484 units. That was Toyota’s best month since before the pandemic shuttered North American production for two months and led to closed showrooms across numerous U.S. states. The rebound in U.S. auto sales since hitting a bottom in April has seen major automakers scramble to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships, especially in states where they remained open throughout the shutdowns. The rebound in sales, though, could be threatened by spiking cases in southern and southwestern U.S. states, which have increased uncertainty over the U.S. economic recovery. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS reported a modest year-on-year 0.6% gain in U.S. sales for July, selling 57,677 units. “Achieving an overall sales increase despite the ongoing pandemic is a tremendous accomplishment and speaks to the depth and quality of our product lineup and resiliency of our dealers,” Hyundai’s North American sales chief, Randy Parker, said in a statement."
5.67083469553564," How Tesla defined a new era for the global auto industry FRANKFURT/BEIJING/DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O rapid rise to become the world's most valuable carmaker could mark the start of a new era for the global auto industry, defined by a Silicon Valley approach to software that is overtaking old-school manufacturing know-how. Tesla's ascent took many investors by surprise. But executives at Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, had a close-up view starting in 2009 of how Tesla and its chief executive Elon Musk were taking a new approach to building vehicles that challenged the established system. Daimler, which bears the name of the man who invented the modern car 134 years ago, bought a nearly 10% Tesla stake in May 2009 in a deal which provided a $50 million lifeline for the struggling start-up. That investment gave Mercedes engineers an inside view of how Musk was willing to launch technology that wasn’t perfect, and then repeatedly upgrade it, using smartphone style over-the-air updates, paying little regard to early profitability. Mercedes engineers helped Tesla develop its Model S luxury sedan in exchange for access to Tesla’s partially hand-assembled battery packs, but in 2014 Daimler decided to sell their stake amid doubts Tesla’s approach could be industrialized at scale. Tesla would go on to pioneer new approaches in manufacturing, designs in software and electronic architecture which enable it to introduce innovations faster than rivals, leaving analysts to draw comparisons with Apple AAPL.O. Three people directly involved with the Mercedes side of the collaboration said the brief partnership highlighted the collision of old and new engineering cultures: the German obsession with long-term safety and control, which rewarded evolution, and the Silicon Valley carmaker’s experimental approach which embraced radical thinking and fast innovation. “Elon Musk has been walking on the edge of a razorblade in terms of the aggression with which he pushes some technologies,” said a former Mercedes engineer who worked on the partnership. By contrast, Mercedes and other established automakers are still not comfortable about releasing a new technology, such as partially automated driving, without years of testing. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Investors favor the Tesla model, in an industry undergoing fundamental and dizzying change even though the U.S. carmaker will face an onslaught of competing electric vehicles from established automakers during the next few years. They are putting their money on Musk and his company, even though Mercedes-Benz alone sold 935,089 cars in the first half of 2020, dwarfing the 179,050 delivered by Tesla in the same period. Today, Tesla is worth nearly $304.6 billion, more than six times Daimler’s 41.5-billion-euro ($47.7 billion) market capitalization. Daimler and Tesla began collaborating after Mercedes engineers, who were developing a second-generation electric Smart car, bought a Tesla Roadster. They were impressed by the way Tesla packaged batteries, so arranged a visit to Silicon Valley to meet Musk in January 2009 and ordered 1,000 battery packs. The collaboration expanded. At a joint press conference in the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart in May 2009, Tesla said the partnership would “accelerate bringing our Tesla Model S to production and ensure that it is a superlative vehicle”. For its part, Mercedes wanted to use Tesla’s batteries to power an electric version of its compact Mercedes-Benz B-Class. The Tesla Model S would hit the road in 2012. An electric B-Class, arrived in showrooms two years later. Despite having batteries supplied by Tesla, the Mercedes had a shorter operating range after Daimler engineers configured the B-class more conservatively to address their concerns about long-term battery degradation and the risk of overheating, a second Daimler staffer who worked on the joint projects told Reuters. German engineers found that Tesla engineers had not done long-term stress tests on its battery. “We had to devise our own programme of stress tests,” the second Daimler engineer said. Before starting production of a new car, Daimler engineers specify a “Lastenheft” - a blueprint laying out the properties of each component for suppliers. Significant changes cannot be made once the design is frozen. “This is also the way you can guarantee that we will be profitable during mass production. Tesla was not as concerned about this aspect,” the second Daimler source said. Daimler’s engineers suggested the underbody of the Model S needed reinforcing to prevent debris from the road puncturing a battery pack, the first Daimler engineer said. To quash doubts about safety and security, following a series of battery fires, Tesla raised the ride height of its vehicles, using an over-the-air update, and a few months later, in March 2014, said it would add a triple underbody shield to new Model S cars and offered to retrofit existing cars. Musk was able to make adjustments quickly thanks to Tesla’s ability to burn through more cash during development. “At Mercedes you can make such adjustments every three years at best,” the engineer said. The Model S, a four-door electric sedan would go on to outsell the flagship Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the United States in May 2013, and outstrip S-Class deliveries globally by 2017. Musk's relentless focus on innovation explains, in part, why he has disrupted the traditional auto world. In an interview here at the 2020 Air Warfare Symposium, published on YouTube, he was asked about the importance of innovation among his employees. “We certainly need those that do advanced engineering to be innovative,” Musk said. “The incentive structure is set up ... such that innovation is rewarded. Making mistakes along the way does not come with a big penalty. But failure to try to innovate at all ... comes with a big penalty. You will be fired.” Established automakers are playing catch-up to Tesla, designing their own software operating systems and dedicated electric cars. Mercedes will release its EQS next year - a four-door limousine built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform, with an operating range of 700 km. A new version of the Mercedes S-Class, which will have combustion and hybrid powertrains and semi-autonomous driver assistance systems, is due this year. From an investor perspective, traditional players face billions of dollars in restructuring costs as they transform product lines and factories to move away from internal combustion technology “No one is going to give an OEM (established automaker) a five-year window to say ... you can totally retool your business, and I am going to buy in and fund this journey,” said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of automotive and industrials practice at consulting firm AlixPartners. Start-ups, however, get time from investors to learn, make mistakes and grow, he added. Investors are betting on Tesla's ability to scale up manufacturing just as they once backed Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, which defined the auto industry's last era with its mastery of highly efficient, high-quality lean production. Toyota overtook the market capitalization of former industry leader General Motors GM.N in 1996, though it wasn't until 2008 that it sold more vehicles than its Detroit rival. The Japanese giant also cultivated ties with Tesla, with the U.S. startup helping it design an electrified RAV4 compact sports utility vehicle under a 2010 deal. Toyota was impressed by the speed with which Tesla came up with the new design, but ultimately decided Tesla’s methods were not suitable for mass production by a mainstream manufacturer when Toyota’s standards for product quality and durability were applied, two company insiders familiar with the partnership said. Toyota said the joint project involved cooperation on the development of electric cars, parts and production system. “Toyota accomplished what the project set out to achieve, and it ended in October 2014 after Tesla delivered roughly 2,500 electric powertrain systems over three years” for an electrified RAV4 crossover SUVs, a spokeswoman said. Both the Toyota and Daimler collaborations were agreed before the Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE emissions-cheating scandal in 2015, which prompted a global regulatory backlash and forced carmakers to step up investments in electric cars. “That was all before dieselgate, which changed the economics of electric and combustion-engined cars,” a senior Daimler manager said. “Tesla has a lead. Let’s see if they can scale up.”"
5.44072397499145," Toyota sees further recovery in global car production in August TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will make 2% fewer vehicles globally in August than originally planned, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday, as output recovers gradually from a steep drop because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company said it aimed to make 15,000 fewer vehicles than its initial plan, which was around 750,000, according to Reuters’ calculations. August’s reduction is smaller than the cut of 10% seen in July, and June’s 40% reduction.

6.677939477025445," Tesla becomes most valuable automaker in latest stock rally (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday became the highest-valued automaker as its shares surged to record highs and the electric carmaker’s market capitalization overtook that of former front runner Toyota Motors Corp. Tesla shares gained 5% in early morning trade to a record of $1,133, boosting the company’s market cap to $209.47 billion - roughly $6 billion more than Toyota is currently valued by investors. Tesla is now worth more than triple the combined value of U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. The shares’ meteoric rise, up more than 163% since the start of 2020, highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla’s shift from a niche carmaker into a global leader in cleaner cars. After several years of losses, Tesla has delivered three straight profitable quarters since the third quarter of 2019 and surprised investors with solid first-quarter deliveries despite the virus outbreak. Toyota, one of the world’s most profitable automakers, sold 10.46 million vehicles during its 2019 financial year, ending on March 31, 2020. It reported net revenues of 30,226 billion yen, or roughly $281.20 billion, during that time. Tesla, in comparison, ended 2019 with $24.6 billion in revenues, having delivered 367,200 vehicles last year. Chief Executive Elon Musk in the past said Tesla would deliver at least 500,000 vehicles in 2020, a forecast the company has not changed despite the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla is expected to report second-quarter delivery numbers this week."
3.2154802460204293," Toyota sees July vehicle output down 10% on initial plan TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it would make 10% fewer vehicles next month than originally planned, as it gradually resumes output following factory closures earlier this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Japanese automaker said it planned to make 71,000 fewer vehicles globally in July than its original goal of about 700,000. While production has yet to return to normal, the July reduction is smaller than the 20% output cut for June. “We expect the recovery trend to continue in August,” a spokesman said. Global automakers are trying to get their plants back up and running after many were closed earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus. For the April-July period, Toyota anticipates a global production drop of 30% from its initial plans, made before the virus outbreak and a plunge in demand for vehicles. The automaker produced nearly 3.7 million vehicles during the same period last year. At home, Toyota plans to make 39,000 fewer vehicles in July, or 10% less than initially planned. It will stop making its Coaster minibus model for six days, while lines producing the Land Cruiser and Prado SUV models, and the Porte subcompact, will stop for two days. These adjustments will affect six production lines at three of the automaker’s plants. Second shifts at some of these plants will remain cancelled, potentially until September. In total, Toyota operates 28 production lines at 15 vehicle factories in Japan. Toyota will also cancel some Saturday shifts next month on four lines that produce models including its popular RAV4 SUV crossover model and the Prius gasoline hybrid, many of which are exported overseas."

The drop in Toyota’s production underscores the challenging conditions for carmakers around the world due to the fallout from the virus. Besides weak demand, problems with procurement and social distancing measures at plants are also expected to hit output. The automaker said it would halt production at all of its 15 plants for four days next month, while stopping output for up to 7 days on 10 of its production lines, which make models including the Prius gasoline hybrid, Corolla sedan, and 4Runner SUV. In addition, it plans to operate only single shifts on five production lines next month, an arrangement which would continue on two lines through July, and through August on another, it said in a statement.

13.539156420723236," Toyota sees 80% profit drop as virus wipes $14 billion off car sales TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Tuesday it expects profit to drop by 80% to its lowest in nine years, as Japan's biggest automaker grapples with the impact of the novel coronavirus which has sapped global demand for vehicles. The expected damage to Toyota’s bottom line highlights how carmakers will struggle to recover from the virus in the coming months as they gradually restart factories after curbs on public movement prevented workers in many countries from commuting. The industry expects limited output due to fractured supply chains and social distancing measures at plants, along with weak demand as job losses and concern about an economic downturn weigh on consumer spending on major purchases like cars. Toyota, one of the world’s most profitable automakers, expects to take a whopping 1.5 trillion yen ($13.95 billion) hit from a fall in global vehicle sales this year due largely to the virus, yet it still expects to eke out an operating profit of 500 billion yen in the year to March. “The coronavirus has dealt us a bigger shock than the 2008 global financial crisis,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda said at a livestreamed media briefing. “We anticipate a big drop in sales volumes, but despite that we are expecting to remain in the black. We hope to become a leader of the country’s economic recovery.” Toyota sees its operating profit in free fall from 2.44 trillion yen in the year just ended, to its weakest profit since the 2011/12 financial year. The automaker forecast global sales of 8.9 million vehicles - a nine-year low - versus 10.46 million in the year just ended. It expects sales to recover to 2019 levels next year. Toyota's outlook came as rivals including Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and General Motors GM.N have refrained from issuing forecasts, citing uncertainty about the coronavirus. On Tuesday, Honda posted its weakest annual profit in four years, after a 28% drop in fourth-quarter vehicle sales plunged the automaker into an operating loss of 5.2 billion yen, its first quarterly loss since the March 2016 quarter. Japanese automakers are bracing for a year of falling car sales as economists anticipate a slow and patchy recovery from the pandemic. As a result, some analysts see a cut in annual global vehicle sales by around a third, compared with an 11% fall in 2009/10 after the global financial crisis. Toyota expects sales to remain weak through December, before returning to 2019 levels sometime next year. In the year ended March, Toyota said it took a 160 billion yen profit hit from the virus due to a cut in annual sales of 127,000 vehicles from a record high of 10.6 million last year.

Toyota is gradually resuming output at its seven North American sites from Monday. Its production in many countries ground to a halt in mid-March as governments locked down economies, forcing factories to close as workers were unable to commute. The source said Toyota plans to keep May production at less than 10% of last year’s levels - after zero output in April - before ramping up to normal levels in July. By September, monthly vehicle production will be outpacing levels the previous year, as Toyota catches up with lost output. North America is a major production centre for Toyota with the United States alone accounting for about 14% of its global output in 2019, making it the carmaker’s third-largest factory hub after Japan and China. Toyota announces its full-year financial results on Tuesday."

-0.9143110579921072," Toyota supplier Denso halves output on virus as profit hits 11-year low TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts maker Denso Corp 6902.T said on Thursday it has slashed global production by around 50% due to the coronavirus, adding its supply chain could be affected in the coming months if the outbreak is prolonged. Earlier in the day, the world's fourth-biggest components producer and a key supplier to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T posted an 81% drop in operating profit for the year ended March at 61 billion yen ($571.8 million), its lowest since 2009. But Denso retained its annual dividend of 140 yen per share. Tumbling profits at Denso and other suppliers are a reflection of plummeting demand for cars as people have been ordered to stay indoors in many countries to control the spread of the coronavirus, leaving motorways deserted and causing deep uncertainty about the longer-term impact on the global economy. “It will take considerable time for economies to recover to pre-coronavirus levels,” Chief Executive Koji Arima told a live-streamed media briefing. “This will be a long-term battle... The industry is fighting for its survival.” The impact of the virus also weighed on fellow Toyota group supplier Aisin Seiki Co 7259.T which on Thursday posted a 73% drop in full-year operating profit to a decade-low of 56.1 billion yen, and cut its annual dividend to 120 yen per share, down from 150 yen last year. Toyota holds a nearly one-quarter stake in both Denso and Aisin. Denso said that as of April, global production was down by roughly half, largely due to production stoppages at plants in North America, Europe and Asia, brought about by a fall in demand as automakers stopped output due to the virus. The firm said it did not see any major bottlenecks in its supply chain, but that it could have problems procuring parts if plant closures continued into June and beyond. Denso, which specialises in vehicle air conditioning, powertrain and automated driving systems, declined to issue a financial forecast for the current final year, citing uncertainty about the lasting impact of the coronavirus. The company, which counts on Toyota for nearly half of its revenue, said it suffered a 43 billion yen hit due to the coronavirus in the year ended March, while it took a 222 billion yen hit due to increased product recall-related costs. Shares of both Denso and Aisin rose 6.5% on Thursday afternoon, in a strong broader market .N225 that gained 2.9%. Global vehicle sales by Japanese automakers dropped 34% in March when the coronavirus spread worldwide, showed Reuters calculations based on automakers’ sales figures, and are set to fall further as the crisis continues. Analysts expect this will put consumers off buying new cars, cutting 2020 global vehicle sales forecasts by around a third. That would compare with an 11% fall in vehicle sales after the 2008-09 global financial crisis."
-3.0267503282750616," VW, Toyota delay U.S. production restart, citing supplier concerns (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday they will delay restarting U.S. production amid the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about the automotive supply network. VW said it is indefinitely delaying the resumption of production at its Tennessee assembly plant that had been set to restart on May 3. Toyota said it will delay the resumption of North American manufacturing operations to the week of May 11 from the week of May 4 after an “extensive review with our supplier and logistics network.” The German automaker in a statement said that before it sets a new date it “will weigh the readiness of the supplier base, as well as market demand and the status of the COVID-19 outbreak.” VW’s U.S. production has been suspended since March 21. Automakers had hoped to begin restarting production in early May but face hurdles including orders in key states like Michigan that limit non-essential business operations. Germany's BMW AG BMWG.DE said Wednesday it plans to restart work at its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant on Monday at about half the factory's capacity and then ""carefully ramp up production."" Detroit’s Big Three automakers have been in regular talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on the conditions needed to resume production, but the companies not appear likely to resume U.S. production before May 18 at the earliest. UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the union continues to “have discussions about key health and safety issues and science that need to be in place for a restart.” No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co F.N said on Wednesday it still had no date to restart work at its North American plants, but scheduled a Thursday conference call to explain how it will protect its workers. Ohio on Monday outlined its plan, which included reopening the construction and manufacturing sectors on May 4. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has not set a reopening date for manufacturing yet, and the UAW, which represents many hourly auto workers in Michigan and other states, has said early May is “too soon and too risky” to reopen. On Wednesday, Whitmer said she is allowing the state’s construction sector to reopen on May 7, and emphasized worker safety was paramount. “Workplace safety cannot be an afterthought,” she said at a press conference. “It’s an essential part of how we achieve a strong, vibrant economy.” Kristin Dziczek, vice president, Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, said to restart production there needs to be a tremendous orchestration and “synchronization” across many different regions with different challenges like COVID-19 and different state orders on what is essential manufacturing."

The largest Japanese automaker said it expects production will be slow next month. The company added it is not yet clear when the industry will be allowed to resume operations in Mexico. Toyota will add temperature checks for all plant employees, personal protective gear, use “touchless” entrances and exits and will even bar non-emergency use of elevators. “There is no going back to normal for the foreseeable future,” said Toyota Motor North America chief administrative officer Chris Reynolds, who said he expects production will ramp up later in May “to meet consumer demand.”"
3.4352407955292485," China's BYD, Toyota's Hino partner in electric commercial vehicles BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD 002594.SZ said on Thursday it has partnered with Toyota-owned truck maker Hino Motors 7205.T to develop electric commercial vehicles, as BYD deepens electric collaboration with Japan's top automaker. The partnership will focus on electric buses and trucks, in addition to BYD and Toyota's 7203.T joint development on electric passenger cars. Shenzhen-based BYD, which is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett, has been building electric commercial vehicles including London’s electric double-decker buses and electric road sweepers in Beijing. Hino has been developing battery electric trucks but so far has yet to bring a fully electric model to market. In China, Hino makes trucks with Guangzhou-based GAC 601238.SS, which is also a partner of Toyota.   Toyota, which expects to achieve half of its vehicle sales from electrified models by 2025, has been developing its own electric vehicle batteries and has been tapping new suppliers to avoid a shortfall in supply as demand for electrified vehicles is expected to increase in the coming decades."
3.4352407955292485," Japanese governor pledges support for Toyota suppliers as production dips NAGOYA (Reuters) - As Toyota 7203.T prepares to nearly halve production at Japanese factories, a regional governor said on Thursday he would offer 400 billion yen ($3.72 billion) in emergency loans for small and mid-size companies including Toyota's suppliers. Toyota Motor Corp’s headquarters are in Aichi Prefecture, at Toyota City, which was named after the company in the 1950s to reflect its role as the biggest employer in the region. “(Toyota is) not only the backbone of Aichi prefecture’s economy but all of Japan,” Aichi governor Hideaki Ohmura told Reuters, adding that it kept valuable manufacturing jobs in Japan while other companies exported their factories abroad. Japan is a major production hub for Toyota and its domestic manufacturing network is heavily concentrated in Aichi, Japan’s industrial heartland where more than 40% of the cars built in Japan are made. Toyota and its affiliates operate more than half of Aichi’s plants. Ohmura said Toyota and its top tier suppliers supported more than 55,000 jobs in the region and thousands more through smaller suppliers. “We need to be able to support the demand when there’s a rebound and to do that we need to properly support the auto companies’ small and medium suppliers,” he said. He said his proposal for the 400 billion yen in loans would be part of a package of measures the prefectural assembly was due to adopt on Friday. Toyota has said it expects to produce 40% fewer cars than initially planned in May after it began to significantly reduce output at its Japanese plants this month, due to plummeting demand for export models including those shipped to the United States and the Middle East due to the coronavirus. Toyota has said it will stop production on a staggered basis through mid-May at five of its domestic plants which produce high-volume models including the Prius gasoline hybrid, the Corolla hatchback and the Camry sedan. For years, Toyota has pledged to maintain an annual domestic production level of 3 million vehicles, roughly one-third of its global output, in Japan to support jobs and hone manufacturing skills. More than 11,500 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Japan and nearly 300 have died. Aichi has had 443 confirmed cases. Manufacturing plants in Japan have been permitted to keep operating during the outbreak, and the powerful auto lobby has said it would try to avoid suspending output while prioritising worker safety. Automakers and their suppliers are also considering industry-led financial support for struggling firms."

3.977601910565752," Toyota's South African unit sees 15-20% hit to production due to virus JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African unit of Toyota 7203.T could see its production drop by around 15-20% in 2020, its president and CEO Andrew Kirby said on Wednesday. South Africa’s auto industry is the continent’s most developed, but with only a very small local market for new cars it relies heavily on global demand. Kirby told a virtual media briefing that Toyota South Africa, which produces between 135,000 and 150,000 units per year, had seen an around 15% cut in export orders from its biggest market, Europe, as well as an around 10% cut in orders from Africa, which it expects to increase. “I think by and large somewhere around the 15% and 20% mark is probably where it’s going to end up for the year,” he said when asked how production would be impacted in 2020, adding South African sales had also declined. The division had already lost production of around 13,500 units due to a nationwide lockdown in the country, set to last five weeks, he said. Sales stood at “basically zero” in April, senior vice president of sales and marketing Leon Theron added, noting the South African sales were expected to fall by at best 16% for the year. South Africa considers the auto industry its most important manufacturing sector, and had been due to launch a 2035 plan to develop it in January 2021 with targets to double production and grow jobs. The sector is now discussing postponing its launch to July that year, Kirby said."

3.8249987059837744," Toyota-backed Pony.ai to offer autonomous delivery service in California BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota-backed self driving company Pony.ai said on Friday it would provide an autonomous delivery service to residents of Irvine, California, as demand for online orders surges because of the coronavirus lockdown. As some 90% of U.S. shoppers are under stay-at-home orders, a jump in demand for package and grocery delivery has left e-commerce platforms struggling to cope. In response, Amazon has said it plans to hire 75,000 more people for jobs ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers. Pony.ai said in a statement it would use autonomous electric vehicles to deliver packages from local e-commerce platform Yamibuy to customers in Irvine, California, which has a population of more than 200,000. The autonomous fleet comprises 10 electric Kona sport-utility vehicles, made by Hyundai and its deliveries will mark Pony.ai’s first attempt to deliver goods, rather than transport passengers. As part of efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, self-driving technology companies, including Alphabet Inc unit Waymo, General Motors Co unit Cruise and Uber, have suspended autonomous car testing that involves back-up drivers. Pony.ai said in March it would pause its public robotaxi service in Fremont, also California, and Irvine for three weeks. The company is testing cars in the Chinese cities of Beijing and Guangzhou and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) eased regulation on autonomous delivery service last year. The DMV said at the time it would allow the testing and commercial use of light-duty autonomous delivery vehicles on California’s public roads with certain permission. Pony.ai, founded in 2016, raised $462 million in its latest funding round in February, led by an investment by Japan’s largest automaker Toyota.

3.8249987059837744," Individual ashtrays, hourly disinfection: French carmakers eye production restart PARIS (Reuters) - Peugeot-owner PSA and Renault are planning new safety measures in a push by France’s major industrial groups for a breakthrough with workers to reopen some factories before the government lifts its lockdown from mid-May, unions said. Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T on Wednesday became the first auto company with a plant in France to agree with unions a gradual restart of production from April 21 at its factory in northern France, where it makes the Yaris model. The ramp-up comes as auto rivals elsewhere look to resume manufacturing from next week, including in Germany where some restrictions to contain the new coronavirus outbreak will be eased shortly. In France, negotiations with labour unions have been tough, however. PSA PEUP.PA and Renault RENA.PA told Reuters they were preparing for a restart of operations, but no date had officially been set yet. At PSA’s gearbox factory in Valenciennes, where a first plan to resume production on a voluntary basis was rejected by unions in March, management and workers’ representatives are to hold fresh talks on Friday. New safety protocols are being developed by the carmakers, union members said. These could include wearing masks, giving out individual ashtrays so that smokers do not gather in one area, and keeping the doors open to avoid contact with the handles. They would also entail disinfecting tools and work surfaces every 60 minutes and doubling the number of buses that pick up workers. The French government has encouraged companies to resume production, mindful of a major hit to the economy, already expected to contract 8% this year. “I believe that there is a way to do it: it is not about choosing either the resumption of activity, or the health of the employees, it is both at the same time, it is doable,” French labour minister Muriel Penicaud told LCI radio on Thursday, citing Toyota as a potential model. Restrictions on movement in France will not be eased until at least May 11, starting with the reopening of some stores and schools. French train maker Alstom ALSO.PA told Reuters on Thursday it had been progressively ramping up its activities since the beginning of April at its plants in France. The hard-left CGT union, however, has said it still considers it premature for carmakers to resume production in late April or early May, arguing that masks are still reserved as a priority for the health workers and may not be available. The country’s metals lobby said on Sunday that French companies in the automotive, aerospace and steel sectors were ready to return to work and assure “impeccable, sanitary conditions”. Renault already restarted production in Portugal and Russia on Monday."

Nakamura’s addition is seen as unlikely to tip the balance of the board, as members who hailed from the corporate sector in the past tended to vote with the majority of the board. The central bank’s board is currently split between those who see room to increase stimulus, and those more worried about the rising cost of prolonged easing, particularly the hit to banks’ profits from years of ultra-low interest rates.

0.34032735304018996," Japan's economy faces extreme uncertainty as coronavirus spreads: central bank head TOKYO (Reuters) - Uncertainty over Japan’s economic outlook is “extremely high” as the coronavirus pandemic hits output and consumption, central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said, stressing his readiness to take additional monetary steps to prevent a deep recession. While aggressive central bank actions across the globe have eased financial market tensions somewhat, corporate funding strains were worsening, Kuroda told a quarterly meeting of the Bank of Japan’s regional branch managers on Thursday. “The spread of the coronavirus is having a severe impact on Japan’s economy through declines in exports, output, demand from overseas tourists and private consumption,” he said. Japan recorded 503 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday - its biggest daily increase since the start of the pandemic - as a state of emergency took effect giving governors stronger legal authority to urge people to stay home and businesses to close. In contrast to stringent lockdowns in some countries, mandating fines and arrests for non-compliance, enforcement will rely more on peer pressure and a deep-rooted Japanese tradition of respect for authority. The balancing act underscores the difficulty authorities have in trying to contain the outbreak without imposing a mandatory lockdown that could deal a major blow to an economy already struggling to cope with the virus outbreak. Hideaki Omura, the governor of the central Japan prefecture of Aichi, said he would declare a state of emergency for his prefecture on Friday. Omura said Aichi, which includes the city of Nagoya and hosts Toyota Motor Corp, was talking with the central government about being included in the national state of emergency as well, but felt he could not wait any longer to restrict movement. “Looking at things the past week and watching the situation - the rise in patients, the number without any traceable cause - we judged that it was a very dangerous situation and wanted to make preparations,” he told a news conference. Even with less stringent restrictions compared with other countries, analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan to slip into a deep recession this year as the virus outbreak wreaks havoc on business and daily life. Shares of Oriental Land Co 4661.T fell on Thursday after the operator of Tokyo Disneyland said it would keep the amusement park shut until mid-May. Entertainment facility operator Uchiyama Holdings 6059.T said it was closing 43 karaoke shops and 11 restaurants until May 6. “For the time being, we won’t hesitate to take additional monetary easing steps if needed, with a close eye on developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak,” Kuroda said. Kuroda’s remarks highlight the strong concern policymakers have over the outlook for Japan’s economy and how companies continue to struggle to generate cash, despite government and central bank promises to flood the economy with funds. At its policy meeting later this month, the BOJ is likely to make a rare projection that the world’s third-largest economy will shrink this year, sources have told Reuters. The BOJ eased monetary policy in March by pledging to boost purchases of assets ranging from government bonds, commercial paper, corporate bonds and trust funds investing in stocks. The government also rolled out a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow.

1.5136821959391087," Toyota extends North American plant shutdown; will stop paying 5,000 temporary workers WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said Wednesday it plans to reopen its North American auto plants on May 4, extending its current shutdown by two additional weeks. The Japanese automaker cited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and decline in vehicle demand to extend the halt of production at all of its automobile and components plants in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Toyota will not furlough its direct employees, but has asked its hourly plant employees to take two days out of the 10 day extension as paid time off or they can go without pay if they don’t have accrued leave. For Toyota’s 5,000 workers provided by outside agencies, Toyota is releasing those workers back to their agencies. Toyota will continue to pay the benefits of those workers for the time being, and they may be eligible for unemployment. On Tuesday, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co on Tuesday said they had furloughed thousands of workers at their U.S. operations as the coronavirus pandemic slashes demand for cars in the country. A spokesman for Honda, which employs about 18,400 workers at plants in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio, said the Japanese automaker would guarantee salaries through Sunday, having suspended operations on March 23. The plants will be closed through May 1. Nissan said it was temporarily laying off about 10,000 U.S. hourly workers effective April 6. It has suspended operations at its U.S. manufacturing facilities through late April due to the impact of the outbreak. Automakers are facing a dramatic drop in sales in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, after some states barred dealers from selling new cars while “stay-at-home” orders are in place.

7.273806654218308," China's GAC says Toyota and Honda ventures plan to sell 1 mln cars a year by 2025 BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - GAC’s joint ventures with Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd are aiming for a big boost in annual China sales to a million vehicles each by 2025, a recording of a GAC earnings call reviewed by Reuters showed. For its venture with Toyota, that would represent a jump of 47% from 2019 levels while for the venture with Honda that would be a 30% surge. Vehicles made by the JVs are mostly sold under the Japanese brands. The state-owned automaker will also aim to sell 1 million units annually under its own brand by 2025, Feng Xingya, GAC’s general manager told investors and analysts on the call on Wednesday which was not open to media. It was not clear when the plans were formed. For the current year, it expects industry-wide China auto sales to tumble 10% due to the impact of coronavirus outbreak although it expects its sales, which include sales of its JV partners, to climb 3%. The long-term plans come as the state-owned automaker expands manufacturing capacity. GAC Honda currently has annual production capacity of 770,000 vehicles while GAC Toyota is building new electric vehicle plants which will take its capacity to around 1 million vehicles per year. Those capacity figures, however, exclude potential overtime shifts. In 2019, when GAC Honda recorded a 4% rise in China sales to 770,884 cars, its capacity utilisation rate was around 119%. GAC Toyota, which saw an 18% jump in China sales to 682,008 cars was operating at 140% of annual production capacity. “We can reach higher production by arranging extra shifts at current plants...Capacity will not be a big problem,” GAC Chairman Zeng Qinghong told the call. Toyota and Honda declined to comment on the sales plans. GAC did not respond to a request for comment. Sales of GAC-branded cars tumbled 28% to 384,578 units in 2019. For the year, GAC’s revenue tumbled 17.5% while net profit attributable to shareholders dropped 39%, according to a company filing. Asked about its loss making venture with FCA, GAC executives said the automaker will explore more opportunities to export China-made vehicles to Southeast Asian countries. To meet government quotas for sales of new-energy vehicles, Zeng said the venture with FCA will also sell some models under the GAC brand, a strategy it is also employing at its joint ventures with Toyota and Honda."

The two companies will develop a data platform which will compile and analyze information from homes, vehicles, and public institutions, which will be used to create new services focusing on transportation, health, and energy usage. Under the agreement, Toyota will take a 2.07% stake in Japan’s biggest telecoms company, while NTT will take a 0.9% stake in the automaker. The platform will be rolled out at the prototype, zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered city near Mt. Fuji in Japan which Toyota is developing to incorporate smart homes, robotics as well as autonomous driving and AI technologies. After decades spent focusing on making and selling cars, Toyota is increasingly turning to partners in the technology sector to help develop expensive new vehicle technologies as it tries to transform itself into a mobility services company. “It is necessary not only for each company to engage in its own projects but also for both companies to work closely in jointly building and operating the ‘Smart City Platform’,” the companies said in a statement. A growing number of global tech giants including China’s Tencent Holdings, Alphabet, Samsung Electronics, and Panasonic, are looking at developing hi-tech, connected cities, although many remain in the early planning stages. The partnership between Toyota and NTT will build on an existing collaboration under which the companies are jointly developing technology for connected cars. Toyota has also tied up with other domestic telecoms firms to come up with new technologies, including its partnership with SoftBank Corp to design and market an on-demand, self-driving service platform which will be used in Toyota’s prototype city. NTT sees smart city-related solutions as a growth area as phone usage plateaus at home. It has partnered with the city of Las Vegas to use its data systems technology to analyze real-time car traffic and crowd density data to enhance public security."

Toyota invested around $400 million in the round, Pony.ai said in a statement, marking its biggest investment in an autonomous driving company with a Chinese background. The latest fundraising values the three-year-old firm, already backed by Sequoia Capital China and Beijing Kunlun Tech Co, at slightly more than $3 billion. Reuters reported the funding earlier on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The sources added that some of Pony.ai’s existing investors had joined the financing, but did not specify names. The investment by Toyota comes at a time when global car makers, technology firms, start-ups and investors - including Tesla, Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and Uber - are pouring capital into developing self-driving vehicles. Over the past two years, 323 deals related to autonomous cars raised a total of $14.6 billion worldwide, according to data provider PitchBook, even amid concerns about the technology given its high cost and complexity. The Silicon Valley-based startup Pony.ai - co-founded by CEO James Peng, a former executive at China’s Baidu, and chief technology officer Lou Tiancheng, a former Google and Baidu engineer - is already testing autonomous vehicles in California, Beijing and Guangzhou. The firm is focusing on achieving “Level 4”, or fully autonomous standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention. The latest funding will support Pony.ai’s future robotaxi operations and technology development, one of the sources said. Pony.ai, which has partnerships with automakers Hyundai and GAC, said it will explore “further possibilities on mobility services” with Toyota. Pony.ai is not the first time that Toyota, which sold more than 10 million cars globally last year, has invested in firms focused on autonomous driving and mobility services. Its autonomous vehicle partnerships include a venture with SoftBank Corp and an investment in robotaxi developer Uber ATG. Last year, it invested $600 million in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and a new joint venture to develop mobility services. However the Japanese car maker, which has researched into autonomous driving technologies mostly through in-house engineers and this year will launch its first vehicle with autonomous highway driving capabilities, has been lagging rivals in bringing self-driving cars to market. It has taken a long view toward the technology, saying it will take decades for cars to drive themselves on roads."
-15.168294779761684," Nissan, Honda delay restart of some China plants due to coronavirus TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers delayed on Friday the restart of plants in China near the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak, complying with authorities’ directives, but raising the risk of further supply disruptions that could hit global car production. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said it would keep its plants in Xianyang in the central province of Hubei, and Zhengzhou in the neighboring province of Henan, shuttered after Monday, when it had planned to resume operations, but did not set a new date. Honda Motor Co 7267.T said operations at its plants in Wuhan, Hubei's provincial capital in which the outbreak began, would remain suspended until March 11. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it would resume production on Monday at its plant in Chengdu in the southwestern province of Sichuan, returning all four of its China assembly plants to operation from next week, but output would be limited at some. In an email, Nissan said its delay was due to a directive by government authorities in Hubei asking firms to keep operations shut through March 10. Output issues at suppliers were also affecting vehicle production, it said. The virus, which has killed more than 2,200 in mainland China, has wreaked havoc on the global automotive supply chain, stalling production at plants there and leaving automakers scrambling to source the roughly 30,000 parts each car needs. “Wuhan is a city which produces virtually every type of component used in vehicles,” said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. “So not only are vehicle assembly plants in the city unable to source parts, vehicle plants all over the world which source parts from Wuhan are being affected.” He added that, where possible, automakers were securing parts from suppliers’ plants elsewhere. Some automakers were taking more direct approaches to procurement. This week, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said it had flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production, and could run out of components in two weeks. China’s manufacturing sector is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine curbs across the country. The suspension of output at Nissan's two plants, which make the X-Trail SUV crossover and the Altima sedan in a joint venture with China's Dongfeng Motor 0489.HK, comes as the automaker struggles to recover profitability after the arrest of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, in 2018.

The Japanese automaker, which operates 12 vehicle and components factories in China, said it would extend its production stoppage “after considering various factors, including guidelines from local and region governments, parts supply, and logistics. “For the week of Feb. 10, we will be preparing for the return to normal operation from Feb. 17 and beyond,” it said in a statement. The decision extends Toyota’s initial plans to suspend operations through Sunday, and comes as the threat from the coronavirus crisis closes in on the global auto industry. South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS said on Friday that they plan to restart production at their Chinese factories on Feb. 17, from a previously planned Feb.9. “We will take preventive measures against infection at factories,” a spokeswoman said. A growing number of car makers, including those who do not make cars in China, are flagging the possibility that their global operations could take a hit if they cannot access parts supplies from the country, where there are transportation bans to stop the virus spreading. Suzuki Motor Corp said it was looking at the possibility of procuring “made in China” car parts from other regions if it cannot access parts due to ongoing stoppages. The Japanese automaker does not produce or sell any cars in China, but procures some components there for its plants in India, where it controls around half of the passenger vehicle market via its local unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI on Thursday said one of its European plants could close within two to four weeks if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work soon, while Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS earlier this week suspended production at its South Korean plants due to a shortage of China-made parts. Parts made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled elsewhere, and China’s Hubei province - the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak - is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments. To limit the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities have announced an extended holiday period in Hubei and 10 other provinces, which account for more than two-thirds of the country’s vehicle production. IHS Automotive projects plant closures through Feb. 10 would result in a 7% cut in vehicle production in China for the first quarter. In a note, its analysts said extended closures into March may result in lost production of over 1.7 million vehicles for the period, a decline of roughly one-third of pre-virus output expectations. “If the situation lingers into mid-March, and plants in adjacent provinces are also idled, the China-wide supply chain disruption caused by parts shortages from Hubei, a major component hub, could have a wide-reaching impact,” they said. Other industry experts said suppliers had built up a cushion of parts in inventory and in-transit ahead of the long Lunar New Year holiday in late January. Those will start to run out if factories cannot get back to work next week, or if flights to and from China remain limited. Toyota said its plants outside China were operating as normal for the moment but it has said it was also considering the possibility of manufacturing parts commonly made in China in other regions."

-15.481406375471416," Toyota to make more pickup trucks at Mexican plant in shift from U.S. APASEO EL GRANDE, Mexico (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will ramp up production at its new Mexican plant to 100,000 vehicles a year by 2021 in a major step to shift production of its popular mid-size Tacoma pickup truck to Mexico from the United States, the company said on Thursday. The plant in the central state of Guanajuato, along with an older facility near the U.S. border, will bring Toyota’s Mexican production to 266,000 trucks a year when at full capacity, Japan’s largest automaker said. Toyota said it expects to send 95% of pickups from the two plants to the United States, where the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacomas last year, up 1.3%. “Tacoma production will be concentrated right here in Mexico,” Christopher Reynolds, a chief administrative officer for Toyota in North America, said at an event to inaugurate the Guanajuato plant. “What this means is that the Mexican manufacturing facilities of Toyota will build all the Tacomas that serve the mid-size pickup segment in the North American market.” Toyota said last month it will move Tacoma production from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America. It said the decision would “improve the operational speed, competitiveness and transformation at its North American vehicle assembly plants based on platforms and common architectures.” Asked about the possibility of angering U.S. President Donald Trump with the decision to move Tacoma production to Mexico, Luis Lozano, head of institutional relations for Toyota Mexico, said, “We don’t make business decisions based on politics. We are a company that thinks about the very long term and that we’re going to be here long after many people have gone.” Lozano noted that Toyota maintains a big production footprint and employs more than 30,000 workers in the United States. Toyota has pumped $700 million into the Guanajuato site, which began operating last December. Toyota began making Tacoma trucks in 2003 at its plant in Mexico’s northern border city of Tecate, where last year it turned out close to 167,000 pickups. Automotive exports from Mexico fell for the first time in a decade last year, dragged down by weak demand from outside the United States, and industry groups project another drop in 2020. Lozano said the company will not need to make major supply changes on the back of the new regional U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade accord that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump had criticized. One of the biggest changes requires increased North American content in cars and trucks built in the region - to 75% from 62.5% under NAFTA - with new mandates to use North American steel and aluminum. In addition, 40% to 45% of a vehicle’s value must come from “high wage” areas paying workers at least $16 an hour, namely the United States and Canada, a provision aimed at slowing the industry’s migration to lower-wage Mexico. Vehicles that fail to meet the standard would be subject to U.S. tariffs. “We don’t have to make very large adjustments within our value chain in North America because for a long time we have had a value chain which is very deep, very sophisticated and very integrated,” Lozano said. “It is not an issue that will require greater efforts or investments to comply. We will fulfill it to the letter.”"

Automakers have suspended output at many factories in China in line with government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus which has led to some 560 deaths in the country. The epidemic is likely to wreak havoc on China auto sales and production in the first quarter, and has disrupted the supply of parts for some car makers with Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS this week saying it would have to suspend production in South Korea. “We are looking very closely at inventories of components which are made in China and used in other countries, including Japan, and at the possibility of alternative production,” Operating Officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told a news conference. S&P credit analyst Vittoria Ferraris has estimated “up to one-half” of vehicles and components that would normally be produced in China could be affected if shutdowns are extended further. Production at many plants across China, including Toyota’s, has currently been halted through to Feb. 9. Toyota has said it plans to resume production on Feb. 10 although this could change if the situation worsens. Japan’s biggest automaker said it now expects operating profit for the year to end-March to climb to 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion), up from 2.47 trillion yen a year earlier and in line with market estimates. For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit and vehicle sales, click on tmsnrt.rs/312ftUg The outlook is based on a new assumption for the Japanese currency to average around 108 yen to the U.S. dollar during the current business year versus 107 yen previously. It also expects to sell 10.73 million vehicles, slightly higher than a previous forecast for 10.7 million. Third-quarter profit, however, declined 3.2% to 654.4 billion yen as the yen trended higher than expected during the period and due to softer vehicle sales, though the result was slightly higher than market expectations. Sales in Asia tumbled 12.5% with demand slow in Indonesia and Thailand, while sales in North America, Toyota’s biggest market, slipped 1.8%. Toyota also said it was seeking more discussion with the British government, which announced plans this week to ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars in the country from 2035. That is five years ahead of many other countries with similar targets in what has been seen as a victory for battery-electric cars. “We don’t believe it’s possible to suddenly say ‘OK, let’s move to something like this and ban everything in one shot’. We should have steps to do this kind of thing,” Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said. “It’s going to create big trouble for all carmakers in the world and even for customers in the UK.” Toyota operates a plant in Derbyshire, central England and produced roughly 8% of the 1.52 million cars made in Britain in 2018. It also produces engines at a factory in Wales."

-13.115463045140554," Toyota-Panasonic venture to start EV battery development in April TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T have agreed to set up a joint venture that will begin developing electric vehicle (EV) batteries from April, as the Japanese companies gear up for an expected surge in demand. The new company, called Prime Planet Energy and Solutions, will develop prismatic - or square-shaped - batteries that will be available to any automaker, the two companies said in a statement on Monday. It will begin operations on April 1 with more than 5,000 employees, with Toyota owning 51% and Panasonic holding the remainder, the pair said. The venture reflects the aim of the Japanese companies to become bigger global players in the automotive battery industry, which is vital for the development of affordable EVs, as stricter environmental regulations worldwide accelerate a shift toward environmentally friendlier cars. “Batteries - as solutions for providing energy for automobiles and various other forms of mobility, and as solutions for various kinds of environmental issues - are expected to fulfill a central role in society going forward,” the companies said in the statement. Panasonic has been the exclusive supplier of cylindrical batteries for U.S. EV maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O, but has been looking to expand its list of customers by stepping up development of the prismatic batteries more widely used in the industry. Tesla last month announced it would also source batteries from South Korea's LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS and China's CATL 300750.SZ. Toyota, which pioneered the petrol-electric hybrid Prius in 1997, aims to get half of its sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, and is both developing its own batteries and tapping new suppliers to avoid a shortfall. The two Japanese companies have been cooperating on battery research since at least 1996 when they set up a joint venture to make hybrid car batteries, called Primearth EV Energy."

-13.115463045140554," Toyota uses big data to guard against accelerator-brake mix-up TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled an emergency safety system on Monday that uses big data to ignore the accelerator if it determines the driver steps on the pedal unintentionally. Japan’s biggest car maker will roll out what it calls an “accelerator suppression function” in new cars from this summer, beginning in Japan. The system is a response to an increasingly common cause of traffic accident in ageing Japan where the driver, often elderly, mistakes the accelerator for the brake. Some 15% of fatal accidents on Japanese roads in 2018 were caused by drivers who were 75 years or older, showed a report from the government, which actively encourages elderly drivers to give up their licenses. Toyota’s announcement comes as automakers globally invest heavily in so-called active safety features as they work to develop fully autonomous cars. It also comes in the same year Toyota will act as exclusive mobility sponsor for the Tokyo Olympics, where it will showcase its fully self-driving e-Palette transportation pods carrying athletes around the Olympic village at low speeds. Among competitors, Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to launch a car this year capable of full autonomy in highway traffic jam situations. Nissan Motor Co Ltd released the second generation of its ProPilot driver-assist system last spring, offering hands-free operation for single-lane highway driving. Toyota rolled out its first-generation Safety Sense package in 2015, which included automated emergency braking and a lane departure alert. The second generation became available in 2018, adding assisted single-lane highway driving and making the car capable of recognizing pedestrians at nighttime and bicycles. Its new feature was developed using data collected from the internet-connected cars it has on the road. Unlike the car maker’s existing safety options, the new system does not require the presence of an obstacle to function."

-9.671495379622144," Proton-packed Geely takes on Honda and Toyota in Southeast Asia KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Li Chunrong was hired by Chinese automaker Geely to revive the fortunes of the Proton brand in Malaysia, and it took him two years to eclipse Japanese giants Honda and Toyota. Now he plans to take the fight across Southeast Asia and beyond. Li, appointed Proton CEO in 2017 when Geely acquired 49.9% of the company, has turned around a once-celebrated Malaysian marque that had to rely on state aid after a string of losses, with his success built on an aggressive cost-cutting drive. Now Geely has told the Proton boss to expand across the region, initially focusing on Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei, Li told Reuters - the first time concrete details of the brand’s expansion plans have been disclosed. Like Malaysia, they are right-hand drive markets so require fewer car modifications. Proton also aims to drive into the Middle East and increase sales to Egypt, said the 56-year-old Chinese national. Li did not give specific timeframes for expansion into individual markets, but said Proton wanted to raise overseas sales - which stood at about 1,000 cars last year, or 1% of total sales - at least four-fold this year. The carmaker wants 40% of its sales to come from foreign markets by 2027, he told Reuters in two interviews, identifying Thailand and Indonesia as the key markets but declining to outline his strategy to crack them. “We have a good foundation,” he said. “We commit that, every year, we will launch a new model.” The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region of over 500 million people is promising territory; car sales are forecast by consultancy IHS Markit to grow at a compound annual rate of 3% in 2016-2020, compared with a 1% drop globally. But IHS said Proton was still a small player compared with the Japanese brands, and that it could struggle to compete. ASEAN sales are led by Toyota with a 30% market share, Honda with 13% and Mitsubishi 7211.T with 10%, according to the consultancy. Proton is in 11th place with about 3%, mainly from Malaysia. Proton’s goals are ambitious and it may not have the production capacity to make inroads regionally, said Mayuree Chaiyuthanaporn, a senior IHS analyst. “In terms of sales, Proton may not be successful outside Malaysia,” she added. Geely said Proton had performed well in the past two years and it was committed to seeing the Malaysian company be a leading brand in Southeast Asia. Proton, majority-owned by Malaysian conglomerate DRB-HICOM DRBM.KL, has launched products at a breakneck speed in its home market. It dropped many old models the first year of the joint venture, and then launched six new ones within eight months, including the X70 SUV based on Geely's Boyue. It became the second-largest car seller with a 16.7% share last year - when it made its first profit in about nine years - climbing above Honda and Toyota from fourth position. Li said Proton could beat Malaysia's top seller Perodua, backed by Japan's Daihatsu 6023.T, by 2022 - five years ahead of the target announced after Geely's investment. Proton outlined to Reuters some of the cost-cutting measures that have bolstered its Malaysian fortunes - and that could be key for success in its expansion drive. Some of the rapid changes have, however, jarred local sensitivities, a problem that it could also encounter in other countries. The carmaker has increasingly switched to sourcing cheaper components from China, and let go of many small local distributors, stoking some resentment. It has also been trying to get more Malaysian vendors to partner with Chinese suppliers, in a bid to get them to cut costs by 30%. Proton, which saved 250 million ringgit ($61.5 million) in costs in 2018, has also cut its warehouses to four from 16 and sold 1,000 of its 1,500 company cars. Its drive has even extended to stopping newspaper subscriptions for all executives apart from Li’s deputy. The automaker has also faced accusations from politicians and industry groups of favoring Chinese or ethnic Chinese-Malaysian dealers. All the 47 dealers who left the brand since Geely’s entry are Malays, and the number of Malay dealers has fallen to 32% from 42% before the Chinese investment, the trade and industry minister told parliament last month. Many left as they were unable meet Proton’s demand of investing around $1 million to upgrade their sales-only centers to offer aftermarket services, said the Malaysian Association of Malay Vehicle Importers and Traders. “It was a culture shock,” said Nik Izani Nik Ibrahim, deputy president of the association, adding that most dealers were losing money before Geely’s entry. Li denied that there had been any discrimination, saying decisions were driven by business logic. He said nearly a dozen Malaysian ministers had raised the concerns of Malay dealers in his first year but that those worries had eased now. The automaker has since changed its strategy for dealership, allowing some basic sales-only centers to continue, dealers and company officials said. Proton, launched in 1983, was Malaysia’s market leader in its early years. Its market share plunged in the last decade, however, as customers shunned its lower-standard cars and limited after-sales service, Proton officials have said. The turnaround under Li has forced Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a car aficionado, to reverse his initial opposition to Geely’s investment in Proton. “Now, it’s selling 100,000 cars and it’s making profit,” Mahathir, whose fleet of cars now includes a red X70, told reporters this month. “Why? Because of management, because of good technology.” ($1 = 4.0650 ringgit)"

Tesla’s stock has more than doubled in value in the last three months, with its market capitalization piercing $100 billion on Wednesday, a first for a listed U.S. automaker. During the rally, its value has leapfrogged more established global rivals: Honda 7267.T, BMW BMWG.DE, General Motors GM.N and Daimler DAIGn.DE. On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW's $99.4 billion value. Toyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion. The recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter. Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. But the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla’s shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars.

-14.220117465669926," Toyota to recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide, air bags may not deploy in crashes WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide because of an electronic defect that can result in air bags not deploying in crashes. The recall, which includes 2.9 million U.S. vehicles, covers 2011-2019 Corolla, 2011-2013 Matrix, 2012-2018 Avalon and 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid vehicles and is tied to a report of one fatal crash. The vehicles may have an electronic control unit that does not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can occur in crashes, which could lead to incomplete or non-deployment of the air bags. It could also impede the operation of seat-belt pretensioners. In April, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) expanded a probe into 12.3 million potentially defective air bags covering a number of automakers, including the vehicles Toyota is recalling. NHTSA said in April it had identified two frontal crash events, including one fatal crash “involving Toyota products where (electrical overstress) is suspected as the likely cause” of air bags not deploying. Both involved newer Corolla cars. NHTSA said the air bags under investigation were installed in more than 12 million vehicles from 2010 through 2019 sold by Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Mitsubishi. They were equipped with an air bag control unit initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp, which is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen. In total, NHTSA said as many as eight deaths could be tied to the issue. Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler previously issued recalls for more than 2.5 million vehicles with the TRW air bag control units in question that might not deploy in crashes.

The news comes as Subaru has strengthened capital ties with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, in a trend of global automakers joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. To supplement the mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars already in its lineup, Subaru plans to develop a so-called “strong hybrid” vehicle using Toyota technology and intended to debut later in the decade. It is also developing an all-battery electric car with Toyota for release around the same time. “Although we’re using Toyota technology, we want to make hybrids that are distinctly Subaru,” Chief Technology Officer Tetsuo Onuki told a briefing. “It’s not only about reducing CO2 emissions. We need to further improve vehicle safety and the performance of our all-wheel drive.” Subaru said that by 2030 at least 40% of its cars sold worldwide will comprise battery electric vehicles or hybrids. The Japanese automaker, which produces the Outback and Forester SUVs, is known for its horizontally placed boxer engines, along with its EyeSight autonomous driver assist and all-wheel-drive technologies. Car manufacturers worldwide are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development of the self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services that are upending the industry. “Subaru’s strong commitment and dedication toward car-manufacturing that we have cultivated throughout our history remain unchanged,” President Tomomi Nakamura added."
-11.018275329391091," Toyota to move Tacoma truck production to Mexico from U.S. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it will move production of its mid-size Tacoma pick-up truck from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America. The largest Japanese automaker also said it will end production of the Toyota Sequoia in Indiana by 2022 as that facility focuses on mid-size SUVs and minivans. Toyota will shift production of the Sequoia in 2022 to Texas and that plant will end production of the Tacoma by late 2021. Toyota has been building Tacoma trucks at its Baja California plant in Mexico since 2004. Last month, Toyota’s Guanajuato plant began assembly of the Tacoma. Toyota said its production capacity for the Tacoma in Mexico will be about 266,000 per year. Last year, the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacoma pickup trucks in the United States, up 1.3%. Toyota said the product moves were to “improve the operational speed, competitiveness and transformation at its North American vehicle assembly plants based on platforms and common architectures.” The new North American trade agreement approved by the U.S. Senate on Thursday ensures that automakers will still be able to build pickup trucks in Mexico without facing new punitive tariffs. In February, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI said it was reversing plans to shift production of heavy-duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, freeing a Michigan facility to produce Jeeps. Toyota said Friday it completed a $1.3 billion modernization investment in its Indiana operations to add 550 jobs. Toyota said there would be no reduction to direct jobs at any of Toyota’s facilities across North America as a result of the vehicle moves."

-13.85767344561068," Toyota to build prototype city of the future in Japan LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it planned to build a prototype ""city of the future"" at the base of Japan's Mt. Fuji, powered by hydrogen fuel cells and functioning as a laboratory for autonomous cars, ""smart homes,"" artificial intelligence and other technologies. Toyota unveiled the audacious plan for what it will call “Woven City”, in a reference to its origins as a loom manufacturer, at the big annual technology industry show, CES. “It’s hard to learn something about a smart city if you are only building a smart block,” James Kuffner, chief executive officer for the Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development, told Reuters. The “Woven City” idea, under discussion for a year, is aimed at creating safer, cleaner, more fun cities and learning lessons that could be applied around the world, he added. It will have police, fire and ambulance services, schools and could be home to a mix of Toyota employees, retirees and others, Kuffner said. The development, to be built on the site of a car factory that is planned to be closed by the end of 2020, will begin with 2,000 residents in coming years, and also serve as a home to researchers. Toyota did not disclose costs for the project, whose construction is scheduled to start next year, and which seeks to re-imagine a city, but executives said it had been extensively vetted and had a budget. The plan for a futuristic community on 175 acres (71 hectares) is a big step beyond proposals from Toyota’s rivals. Executives at many major automakers have talked about how cities of the future could be designed to cut climate-changing emissions, reduce congestion and apply internet technology to everyday life. The company’s proposal showcases not only the ambition of Chief Executive Akio Toyoda, but also the financial and political resources Toyota can bring to bear, especially in its home country. “You know if you build it, they will come,” said Toyoda, who called the project “my personal ‘field of dreams.’” Toyota Housing, a company unit, has sold more than 100,000 homes in Japan in 37 years. Toyota said it had commissioned Danish architect Bjarke Ingels to design the community. Ingels’ firm designed the 2 World Trade Center building in New York and technology giant Google’s offices in Silicon Valley and London. Toyota said it is open to partnerships with other companies seeking to use the project as a testing ground for technology. Still Toyoda acknowledged not all may see the wisdom of what could be an expensive and lengthy project. “You may be thinking, ‘Has this guy lost his mind?’” Toyoda asked an audience in Las Vegas, to laughter. “‘Is he like a Japanese version of Willy Wonka?’ Perhaps.”"
-9.937713122435685," China fines Toyota 87.6 million yuan over Lexus price-fixing BEIJING (Reuters) - China's market regulator on Friday has fined Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor 7203.T 87.6 million yuan ($12.5 million) for price-fixing on its premium Lexus cars in eastern Jiangsu province, according to a document on its website. The decision comes as China steps up regulation over auto sales in the world’s biggest vehicle market, where more than 28 million cars were sold last year. The anti-monopoly bureau of State Administration for Market Regulation said that between 2015 and 2018, the Japanese carmaker set a minimum sales and resale price for its cars in coastal Jiangsu province, which deprived dealers of pricing autonomy and harmed customers’ rights. Lexus also fixed sales strategies in the region over the period, including offering customers discounts while asking them to purchase accessories at fixed prices, a sales tactic usual among individual auto dealers in China but frowned upon for carmakers. A spokesman at Toyota, Lexus’ parent firm, told Reuters the firm acknowledged the penalty and respects the decision. He did not comment further. China’s auto sales are declining, but Lexus’ sales keep growing. It sold 180,200 vehicles in the first 11 months this year, a 21% jump from a year earlier. In June, China's market regulator imposed an 162.8 million yuan fine on Ford Motor Co's F.N joint venture with Changan Automobile Group 000625.SZ for violating anti-monopoly law.

-13.296140845083343," Toyota names new North America CEO as industry faces unprecedented shift (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Wednesday said its North America chief executive, Jim Lentz, would retire on April 1, and tasked the unit's chief operating officer, Tetsuo ""Ted"" Ogawa, with navigating an industry shift to electrification and automation. Ogawa has worked for Japan’s biggest automaker and the United States’ third-largest vehicle seller in a number of posts since 1984. He was appointed to his current role at Toyota Motor North America in November 2018. In a statement, he said Lentz “was instrumental in the restructuring and bringing our North American region together.” Lentz, a 38-year-veteran of Toyota, said his long tenure including almost seven years at the helm was in part a function of the automaker’s culture. “We have a long-term view of things and try to keep our eyes on the horizon and not get sea sick with all the dips and twists and turns,” Lentz, 64, said in an interview. “The new normal in the world is a little more chaotic and so we have to do a better job of scenario planning.” While the industry is facing a dramatically different future with the rise of electric, connected and autonomous vehicles as well as mobility as a service, Lentz said he saw the change as more evolutionary and revolutionary. Lentz also noted automakers are still grappling with the continuing shift in U.S. consumer preference toward sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Toyota is building a $1.6 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama with compatriot Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T that it expects to open in 2021. In July, Toyota said it would build SUVs at the plant rather than its Corolla line of cars. Lentz said overall U.S. auto sales were around 400,000 vehicles higher than the firm forecast last year, and estimated the industry would sell about 17 million vehicles in 2019. Lentz guided Toyota in the United States through a number of challenges, most notably the 2010 unintended acceleration crisis that prompted the recall of millions of vehicles. In 2014, Toyota agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department after it admitted to misleading consumers in relation to the matter. More recently, Toyota under Lentz improved its relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump and helped stave off vehicle import tariffs. Lentz attended a White House event in July after presidential adviser Ivanka Trump toured Toyota’s Kentucky operations in March."

The two companies said in a statement that they would each invest 50% of the capital needed to establish the company, which will be set up next year and be based in China. The companies did not disclose the value of the venture. Widely considered a late comer in embracing battery EVs, compared with rivals including Nissan, Toyota had flagged in June that it aimed to get half of its global sales from EVs, including gasoline hybrids, by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. The venture aims to develop vehicles that run solely on batteries, rather than plug-in hybrid or gasoline-electric vehicles which also have a combustion engine. In July, the companies said they would develop battery-electric sedans and sport utility vehicles, which would then be sold under the Toyota brand in China before 2025. Toyota also develops hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and plans to launch fuel-cell car models with its Chinese partners, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) and FAW Group, in China, as the world’s largest auto market increases support for fuel-cell vehicles. Shenzhen-based BYD, backed by Warren Buffett, whose models include the Song series and the Qin plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, aims to move to completely electric-powered vehicles.

Operating profit rose 14% to 662.3 billion yen ($6.1 billion) for the three months to September 30 as Toyota enjoyed its strongest second quarter since 2015. The profit beat an average forecast of 592.3 billion yen, based on estimates from nine analysts, Refinitiv data showed. It sold 2.75 million vehicles globally, up from 2.18 million a year earlier. Sales in North America, Toyota’s biggest market, rose 5.6%, while sales in Asia climbed 3.4%. Operating profit in North America, which has been a sore spot for Toyota over the past two years, more than doubled helped by less discounting. “New models of the RAV4 and the Corolla, as well as last year’s Camry, have been well received in North America, so we’ve been able to lower incentives,” Operating Officer Kenta Kon told reporters at a briefing. For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit and vehicle sales, click on tmsnrt.rs/312ftUg Toyota said it would buy back up to $1.8 billion worth of its common stock, or 34 million shares, by end-March. It maintained its forecast for operating profit in the year to March to fall 2.7%, after three years of gains, as it expects a strengthening yen to weigh. It lowered its forecast for annual global car sales by 2.7% to 10.7 million units, weighed by weakening demand in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Still, it expects record sales topping last year’s 10.6 million. ‘EVERY LAST DROP’ Toyota's projected profit slip is subdued versus smaller rivals including Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T Subaru Corp 7270.T and Mazda Motors Corp 7261.T, which have slashed their full-year outlooks by up to 67% this month amid weaker demand for their cars. Many of them acknowledge they are struggling to contain costs amid the need to invest heavily to develop self-driving cars and electric vehicles. Toyota also said higher R&D investments and rising labor costs had made cost-cutting a challenge, but it managed an additional 45 billion yen in cost savings during the quarter. Executive Vice President Mitsuru Kawai told reporters that the company was looking at every possible way to cut production costs and improve efficiency at its factories, including scraping out “every last drop” of vehicle body paint from the can before opening a new one. “(Each drop of paint) on its own would represent only a fraction of a yen in savings, but if we add up these efforts we can build a savings effect,” he said."

Japan's smallest major automaker, which is owned a fifth by top-ranked Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, cut its forecast for operating profit to 220 billion yen ($2 billion) for the year ending March 2020, from a previous forecast of 260 billion yen. Subaru revised its forecast for the yen to average 107 versus the dollar over the period, from 110 previously. A stronger currency eats into profits because cars exported from Japan become more expensive and the value of earnings made overseas decreases. The United States is Subaru’s biggest market, accounting for about 60% of overall sales. Typhoon Hagibis forced Subaru to halt production at its factories in Gumna, north of Tokyo, for more than a week in October due to supply chain disruptions. The stoppage, which lasted until Oct. 25, resulted in lost production of 11,000 vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Tomomi Nakamura told a briefing in Tokyo on Wednesday. Hagibis was the worst typhoon to hit Japan in decades, leaving at least 80 people dead, according to national broadcaster NHK. “We have restarted production, but we couldn’t return to full capacity immediately,” Nakamura said. “Some of our suppliers’ factories were completely submerged.” Subaru also said vehicle sales rose nearly 20% in the first half of the fiscal year compared with a year earlier, driven almost entirely by an improvement in the United States amid strong demand for the Forester SUV crossover.

3.2398004284046893," Toyota's not alone in the slow lane to self-driving cars TOKYO (Reuters) - When Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T launches its all-battery Lexus next year, the luxury model will be able to drive autonomously on highways, a big step for the Japanese automaker, which has so far trailed rivals in bringing self-driving cars to market. Announced at the Tokyo Motor Show this week, the new Lexus shows how Toyota is putting its research on self-driving technology to work in cars that have limited automation. That strategy comes as more automakers - and even governments - are taking a longer view toward artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving cars, paring back development targets after fatal accidents in Tesla Inc TSLA.O cars have shown the complexity of the technology. Right now, component manufacturers and venture companies working on the technology “are revising their timeline for AI deployment significantly,” Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told a small group of reporters this week. While Toyota is using the motor show to tout its push to become a “future mobility company” showcasing futuristic, AI-based driving companions and miniature delivery robots, on the sidelines, Tomoyama injected a dose of reality about the pace of developing future cars. “Right from the get-go, we figured it’s going to be a time-consuming endeavor,” he said. “There’s no particular need to rethink the time frame for our AI self-drive technology investment and development.” Toyota next year will release its first so-called “Level 2” autonomous car, capable of driving itself on the highway, “from entrance to exit, with traffic merging capability,” Tomoyama said. Other automakers already market “Level 2” cars, but a growing number are pushing out their schedules to develop future autonomous technologies, citing the high hurdle to clear before enabling cars to perform more driving tasks. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T also has abandoned an earlier in-house target to develop cars which can drive themselves on city streets by 2020. At the moment, its cars are able to drive on highways and park autonomously. To develop the more advanced “Level 3” hands-free automated driving technology, Nissan will need at least until the late 2020s, Tetsuro Ueda, an expert at Nissan’s mobility service research center, told reporters this month. ‘HUGE COMPLEXITIES’ German automaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE is also grappling with the size of the challenge. “We really thought at the beginning, it would be just maybe next year or so,” said Aria Etemad, a project manager at Volkswagen Group Research. “But as we dig into that topic, we see huge complexities that we are facing.” Tesla is a notable exception to the cautious view. Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors on Wednesday that Tesla could release software to enable “fully functional full self-driving” capability by the end of this year. However, Musk qualified that by saying cars would still need to be “supervised” by a human driver. By the end of next year, Musk said Tesla hopes to release autonomous driving software “reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention”. But he added “acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction.” It’s not just car manufacturers that are tempering expectations. Singapore, a pioneer for practical testing of autonomous vehicles, has struck a more cautious tone. “We are not in a rush to be the first adopter,” Khaw Boon Wan, the transport minister, said this week. “I look forward to a larger-scale adoption of AV (Autonomous Vehicle) technology in Singapore, but I think this will not be in the near future.” The comments surprised industry experts who view Singapore as the ideal test bed for driverless vehicles given its wealth, small size and top-notch infrastructure. The city state has even created a test zone for driverless vehicles with traffic lights, bus stops and a rain simulator. “If Singapore is saying this, then maybe other governments will follow suit,” said Hussein Dia, professor of future urban mobility at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia. “Whatever comes out of Singapore, the world watches and listens,” he added, referring to its driverless expertise. General Motors Co's GM.N self-driving unit, Cruise, said earlier this year it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as more testing of the vehicles was required. In GM’s case, unexpected technical challenges, including the difficulty for cars to identify whether objects are in motion, are requiring the company to take more time and caution to develop its technology, sources have told Reuters. The Japanese components maker Denso 6902.T, Toyota's biggest supplier, believes it will take years for the technology for fully self-driving cars to hit the roads. For now it is working toward developing cars that can accelerate and brake on their own with driver monitoring. “The most difficult aspect of developing these driving systems is to anticipate unexpected movements in the vehicle’s surroundings,” said Hajime Kumabe, the head of Denso’s engineering R&D center in Tokyo."

3.1598369101477384," Toyota unveils revamped hydrogen sedan to take on Tesla TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T unveiled a completely redesigned hydrogen-powered fuel cell sedan on Friday in its latest attempt to revive demand for the niche technology that it hopes will become mainstream. Japan's biggest automaker has been developing fuel-cell vehicles for more than two decades, but the technology has been eclipsed by the rapid rise of rival battery-powered electric vehicles promoted by the likes of Tesla Inc TSLA.O. Ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show starting on Oct. 24, Toyota unveiled a prototype of the new hydrogen sedan built on the same platform as its luxury Lexus brand’s LS coupe. The new Mirai model boasts longer driving range than its predecessor and completely redesigned fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks, the company said. “We wanted to make a car that people really want to buy, not just because it’s an eco car,” Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the new Mirai, said at the unveiling. “We wanted something that’s fun to drive.” Its sporty redesign with longer wheelbase and lower-slung chassis is a marked departure from the first-generation Mirai, which looks like a bulked-up Prius hybrid. The new car also has a 30% improvement in driving range over the previous iteration’s approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles), according to the company. Tanaka said the latest Mirai would cost less to make than its predecessor, because of a shift to mass production. The current model is mostly assembled by hand. Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,500) after subsidies in Japan, the original Mirai is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T leases out the Clarity. Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. By contrast, Tesla sold 25,000 of battery-powered Model S sedans in its first year and a half. Toyota declined to disclose a price for the model and said it would be available from late next year in Japan, North America and Europe."

Japan’s biggest automaker whose annual global vehicle sales are 10 times that of Subaru, said its investment would amount to up to 80 billion yen ($742 million) based on Subaru’s stock market value. The smaller automaker will reciprocate by buying a stake in Toyota of equal value. Traditional car makers, especially smaller ones such as Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry which is shifting to a business model of providing transportation services from simply selling cars to drivers. Their deepening partnerships with Toyota, which already oversees a vast, closely knit network of group companies that include suppliers, vendors and commercial vehicle makers, has raised speculation that these smaller automakers may be absorbed into the Toyota fabric in the future. “The plan appears to be to ultimately make Subaru a fully owned subsidiary, to help create a ‘mega Toyota’. This is the first step toward that,” said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. “It’s all about building scale.” But Subaru President Tomomi Nakamura was adamant that his company would remain independent for now. “I can assure you that there was absolutely no talk of Subaru becoming a Toyota subsidiary ... either from our side or theirs,” Subaru President Tomomi Nakamura told reporters after the announcement.

3.668916962642478," With bigger stake in Subaru, Toyota expands reach over Japan automakers TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday announced plans to raise its stake in Subaru Corp 7270.T to more than 20% as Japan's biggest automaker cements ties with its smaller rival to better compete with overseas automakers to develop new technologies. Toyota’s stakeholding in Subaru is the biggest of its investments in other Japanese automakers, and is the latest in a long history of stakeholdings which date back more than half a century: October 2005 Toyota takes an 8.7% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI), currently known as Subaru, after General Motors Co GM.N sells its stake in FHI when the two automakers dissolve their strategic alliance and capital relationship. April 2008 Toyota increases its stake in FHI to 16.5%. The two companies also decide to cooperate in research and development, developing a rear-wheel drive sports car, which becomes known as the Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRX. They also decide that Subaru will stop producing mini-cars for the Japanese market, and instead procure them from Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu. August 2017 Toyota takes a 5% stake in Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T as the two companies announce they will work together on developing electric vehicles and build an assembly plant in the United States. Mazda takes a 0.25% stake in Toyota. October 2016 Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Toyota announce they will explore a business partnership to leverage each others' strengths to develop new vehicle technologies. Since then, they have announced they would produce EVs and compact cars for each other. August 2019 Toyota takes a 4.94% stake in Suzuki. Suzuki takes a 0.2% stake in Toyota. Mini-car maker Daihatsu Motor Co joins the Toyota group, supplying the company with compact cars. August 1998 Toyota increases its stake in Daihatsu to 51% from 34.5%, and the company becomes a subsidiary of Toyota. January 2016 Daihatsu becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Truckmaker Hino Motors begins a business partnership with Toyota and enters the Toyota group. March 2000 Toyota raises its stake in Hino to 33.8% from 20.1%, enabling the struggling truckmaker to shore up its weak finances and effectively giving Toyota managerial control of the company. April 2001 Toyota raises its stake in Hino to 50.1%, making it a subsidiary. March 2000 Toyota buys 5% stake in Yamaha Motor Co 7272.T, while Yamaha Corp 7951.T and Yamaha Motor take stakes in Toyota. Previously, the two automakers had co-developed the Toyota 2000GT sports car, which was launched in 1967. June 2010 Toyota acquires around a 3% stake in Tesla Inc TSLA.O as the automakers partner up to develop electric cars and develop production systems. Toyota begins selling down its stake in Tesla as the two companies end their collaboration. It says it had completed its sale as of the end of 2016."

2.320699709044983," Jaguar Land Rover to stop output at UK factories for a week due to Brexit GAYDON, England (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, will halt production at its British factories for a week in November, its boss said on Thursday, joining BMW and Toyota in plans to help mitigate any immediate disruption from a no-deal Brexit. The industry, Britain’s biggest exporter of goods, has been vocal about its concerns that a disorderly departure from the European Union could disrupt the flow of components and vehicles, ruining production processes and damaging the viability of factories. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU, with or without an exit deal, on Oct. 31. However, it remains unclear whether that will actually happen or if Brexit will be delayed, put back to a referendum or even cancelled. Chief Executive Ralf Speth said that Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)had to make plans now, including a stop to production at its four British factories during the first week of November. “We cannot think about it, we just have to do it,” he told reporters at an event in Gaydon, central England, to mark the opening of a new advanced product creation centre. “I need 20 million parts a day and that means I have to make commitments to my suppliers, I have to have every and each part available and I have to have it just in time,” he said. The move will affect the firm’s three car factories, which built just under a third of Britain’s 1.5 million cars last year, and its engine facility in Wolverhampton. Japanese carmarker Toyota said in August it would not build cars at its British factory on Nov. 1 while BMW will halt production at its Oxford plant on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. Speth said JLR would also change shift patterns at its Halewood factory near Liverpool leading to a cut in output due to the “cyclical challenge” facing the car industry, which has prompted profit warnings and forecast cuts at a number of firms. Speth, who has led JLR for nearly a decade, has taken the company through a rapid expansion overseas but more recently the firm has posted losses due to a slowdown in China and a hit to diesel sales, particularly in Europe. Speth’s current term at JLR is due to end next year, a source previously told Reuters. Speth said he was still enjoying his time at the carmaker. “I started here in 2010 and all my predecessors only survived for two years or so,” he said. “Working for this iconic and authentic brand is a lot of fun, so as long as it’s fun, it’s just wonderful to be there.”"
2.320699709044983," Toyota to develop hydrogen fuel cars with Chinese partners FAW, GAC BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor plans to launch hydrogen fuel-cell car models with its China partners Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) and FAW Group [SASACJ.UL], as the Japanese automaker tries to boost its presence in the world’s biggest auto market. Toyota will also equip GAC and their joint venture’s car models with fuel cells, according to a filing by GAC to the Shanghai stock exchange on Thursday. The companies did not disclose financial details of the projects which deepen cooperation among the partners to develop new energy vehicle and connectivity technologies. Fuel-cell cars use a stack of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity to propel the vehicle, with water being the only byproduct. Toyota will also expand cooperation on hybrid vehicles and aim to launch more battery electric vehicles with “good quality and low prices” separately with FAW and GAC. Sources told Reuters last year Toyota planned to sell electric vehicles with GAC’s logo in their joint venture’s dealerships, in a move to meet China’s strict green car quotas. The new development plan reflects gestures of goodwill to Beijing by Toyota, whose Chief Executive Akio Toyoda wants to “step on the accelerator in China”, while needing “to strike a fine balance between China and the United States”, according to minutes of internal meetings seen by Reuters. Toyota sold around 1.5 million cars in China in 2018, far below its global rival General Motors and Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE China sales. However, it is laying the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, Reuters reported last year. Toyota in April said it had started supplying fuel-cell parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Beijing SinoHytec Co Ltd. In July it said it would supply key hydrogen fuel-cell parts to Chinese automakers FAW and Higer Bus. Toyota will also share resources and talent to develop “intelligent connected” vehicles with GAC and FAW."

3.8963851755625174," Toyota banks on Olympic halo for the humble bus to keep hydrogen dream alive TOKYO (Reuters) - Buses may not be the most glamorous mode of transport but at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games, they will represent Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T best bet for wider acceptance of hydrogen power - technology so far eclipsed by electric vehicles. Japan’s biggest automaker plans to roll out 100 hydrogen fuel cell buses to shuttle visitors between venues, a stepping stone to a big ramp up for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. There, more than 1,000 buses are planned in partnership with Beiqi Foton Motor Co 600166.SS, according to people familiar with the project, which aims to make the most of a push by China to start adopting the zero-emissions technology. The plans to promote hydrogen with its exclusive Olympic ‘mobility’ sponsorship deal - one Toyota holds until 2024 - underscore its determination to keep backing the technology. That’s despite an increasing number of electric cars on the road and Toyota’s own efforts to speed up EV development. But its reliance on buses for hydrogen publicity also highlights the lack of traction for its fuel cell cars, and the risk that hydrogen-powered transport may never be more than a niche market despite a quarter century of development and Japanese government backing. Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,200) in Japan after subsidies, it is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T leases out the Clarity. By contrast, Tesla Inc TSLA.O sold 25,000 of its all-electric Model S sedans in its first year and a half. The disappointing Mirai sales reflect insufficient refueling stations, consumer worries about resale values and concerns over the risk of hydrogen explosions. A hydrogen tank blast in South Korea that killed two in May was followed by another at a Norway hydrogen station in June. “Hydrogen still has this image of being dangerous - that it might explode - and our aim with the Olympics is to erase this image,” Masaaki Ito, Toyota’s general manager of its Olympic and Paralympic division, told Reuters. The company will also provide 500 Mirai sedans to ferry officials between venues at the Tokyo Olympics. “We want to expose the technology to as many people as possible.” Toyota, which is also developing fuel cell delivery trucks and big rigs, has not disclosed how much money it has poured into the technology but it has been emboldened by support from the Japanese government, which sees hydrogen as a key way to reduce its reliance on oil. Both envision a “hydrogen society” where homes, trains, ships, and even lunar rovers can be powered by fuel cells that turn the invisible, odorless gas into electricity. The city of Tokyo, which will showcase the Olympic village for athletes as a hydrogen society in miniature, is buying most of the buses for its Toei municipal transport service, with 15 already in operation. Unlike cars, buses have fixed routes, making it easier to plan fueling stations and give them a shot at being profitable. Local and national government subsidies cover 80% of the cost, bringing them in line with the 23 million yen ($213,000) price tag for a regular diesel bus, a Toei representative said. But lofty government goals remain unmet. Three years ago, Japan declared that by 2020 it wanted 40,000 fuel cell vehicles on the road and 160 hydrogen fueling stations in operation. Today, just 3,400 fuel cell vehicles have been sold in Japan and it has 109 hydrogen stations. Though vital for fuel cell cars to catch on, the stations are not easy to build, costing five times as much as a gasoline stand. Due to stringent safety regulations, they also require large plots of land which are in scarce supply. Yet for all the slow progress, some analysts don’t fault Toyota’s pursuit of hydrogen power, pointing to China’s backing of the technology and its vast auto market. “China is actually moving ahead a lot faster and although they suffer the same issue with lack of refueling infrastructure, China has shown in the past that they can get infrastructure done pretty quickly,” said Janet Lewis, head of Asian auto research at Macquarie. For the Beijing games, Toyota will supply powertrain components for the Foton buses. They will be emblazoned with “Powered by Toyota” branding during the event, the sources said, declining to be identified as the plans have not been made public. Toyota said the number of fuel cell buses for the Beijing Olympics has not been decided and that branding would be up to Foton. Foton did not respond to requests for comment. Toyota has similar deals with Higer Bus Co and China FAW Group Corp. The project with Higer will likely have a fleet of 20 buses ready for deployment in early 2020 whereas FAW plans to have its first prototype ready by the end of the year, said Audrey Ma, a director at Shanghai ReFire Technology Co, which is doing the system integration. Outside of China, the only other similar deal Toyota has announced is one to supply fuel cell systems to Portugal’s Caetanobus. Although the technology remains unprofitable, Toyota says costs will fall with scale. It is building new fuel cell stack and hydrogen tank factories so it can lift production of fuel cell vehicles to 30,000 a year."

The company said the investment will be used to introduce advance manufacturing technologies at the plant and also to help with the development and education of the local workforce. Christopher Reynolds, Toyota Motor North America’s chief administrative officer, told Reuters the investment could allow the company to eventually boost the plant’s capacity but no decision has been made. Reynolds added that the company was “bullish” on the future of its U.S. truck sales, which are up 4% this year. Toyota’s San Antonio truck plant assembles full-size Tundra and mid-size Tacoma pickup trucks and along with its on-site suppliers employs more than 7,200 workers at the plant complex. Separately, Aisin AW said it was investing $400 million in a future facility to produce automatic transmisions for Toyota and other automakers that will employ 900 people in Cibolo, Texas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott praised the investment announcements, which came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington had struck trade agreements with Tokyo that could be implemented without congressional approval. But Trump’s announcement left unclear whether he had agreed not to impose threatened national security tariffs on Japanese vehicles and auto parts. Avoiding the “Section 232” tariffs of up to 25% was a major motivating factor for Tokyo in negotiating with Washington on trade. Over much of the past year, the scope of talks has narrowed to exclude the automotive sector, the source of most of the $67 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in August announced an agreement in principle on a deal that covered reductions in tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods, but not autos. Abe has repeatedly emphasized the significant U.S. investments of Japanese automakers and parts manufacturers to Trump."

Faced with stagnant sales in developed economies, automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, BMW BMWG.DE, and Nissan 7201.T are seeking to break into Africa, considered one of the world's last untapped markets for new cars. Thursday's agreement was signed at a Japan-Africa development conference in Yokohama, Japan, by Gon Coulibaly and Ichiro Kashitani, CEO of Toyota Tsusho 8015.T, a unit of the automotive and industrial group. The statement did not give details on the number or type of vehicles Toyota will produce in Ivory Coast, but it said the process for establishing the plant would be launched before the end of the year. As part of its push into the continent, Toyota Tsusho acquired French automobile retailer CFAO, which operates in 35 countries in Africa, in 2016. Toyota already produces cars in South Africa, which has a well-developed auto industry. VW and Nissan have also set up operations in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana or have pledged to do so.

7.613795788599037," Toyota pulls Suzuki firmly into its orbit through stake deal TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T will take small equity stakes in each other, the Japanese car makers said on Wednesday, as they seek to develop newer technologies and meet sweeping changes upending the global auto industry. The tie-up is the latest example of automakers chasing scale to manage costs and boost development. Car makers - especially smaller ones like Suzuki - are struggling to meet the breakneck growth of an industry transformed by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), ride-hailing and autonomous driving. Toyota will pay around 96 billion yen ($910 million) for a 4.94% stake in Suzuki, while Suzuki will acquire in the market around 48 billion yen worth of shares in Toyota. That is equivalent to 0.2% of Toyota’s shares as of Wednesday’s closing price, before the announcement. The companies said in a joint statement they intended to overcome challenges facing the industry by “building and deepening cooperative relationships in new fields while continuing to be competitors”. They said they would strengthen technologies and products in which each of them specialize in. The firms had said in 2016 they were exploring a partnership, citing technological challenges and the need to keep up with industry consolidation. Earlier this year they said they would produce EVs and compact cars for each other. Automakers around the globe have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. Ford Motor Co F.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles. Shares of Toyota and Suzuki closed little changed before the announcement. The deal brings Suzuki firmly into Toyota' orbit, alongside Daihatsu Motor Co, Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T, Subaru Corp 7270.T, Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Yamaha Motor Co 7272.T. Rival Nissan Motor Co 7201.T has an alliance with France's Renault RENA.PA, although that has been shaken following the ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, and with Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T. Honda Motor Co 7267.T has a tie-up with General Motors Co GM.N. Toyota has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for EV motors and power control units. It believes that move would help it cut by as much as half the outlays for expanded electric and hybrid vehicle components in the United States, China and Japan. Supplying rivals would greatly expand the scale of production for hardware. Suzuki, which specializes in affordable compact cars, had been struggling to keep pace with the huge costs of investing in research and development for automated driving functions. Toyota said in June it aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and will tap Chinese battery makers to meet the accelerated shift to electricity-powered cars."

11.417875437389846," Toyota turns to AI startup to accelerate goal of robots for the home TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has designs on making robot helpers for your home, and has enlisted a Japanese startup that specializes in artificial intelligence to jump-start its plan. Japan’s biggest automaker and Tokyo-based Preferred Networks Inc will carry out joint research to develop so-called service robots that are “capable of learning in typical living environments”, the companies said in statements on Wednesday. The two firms have already been collaborating on driverless vehicles since 2014. Eighty-year-old manufacturing giant Toyota is trying to transform itself and adapt to technology, such as ride-hailing and automated driving, that is disrupting the auto industry. Toyota sees robots as part of that effort, particularly in Japan, where it aims to have them in homes and hospitals to support one of the world’s fastest ageing populations. For the project announced on Wednesday, Toyota said it would provide a dozen units of its Human Support Robot, or HSR, to Preferred Networks. The companies will cooperate on development over the next three years, including the sharing of intellectual property. Preferred Networks is already using the robot as a platform for its advanced artificial intelligence software. At an exhibition in Tokyo last year the robot tidied a messy room, distinguishing between trash and dirty towels. Toyota has been working on service robots since 2004, and has a number of models under development. But HSR is the one it sees as closest to being ready for commercial applications. Basically a single arm on a wheeled base with a sensor-filled head on top, the robot will also be used at next year’s summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, to help with simple tasks such as fetching drinks for some spectators."
8.437382902769677," Stronger yen prompts Toyota to trim profit forecast, saps Honda TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T lowered its annual profit forecast while Honda Motor Co 7267.T turned in a double-digit decline in quarterly earnings as a resurgent yen hurt two of Japan's biggest automakers. The quarterly earnings unveiled on Friday by Japan’s biggest and third-biggest automakers highlight how “safe-haven” demand for the currency - buoyed by global uncertainties and falling U.S. interest rates - could eat into profits at Japanese exporters in the months to come. A strengthening yen hurts Japanese automakers as cars exported from Japan become more expensive, while it also decreases the value of earnings made overseas. Toyota cut its operating profit forecast for the year ending March 2020 by nearly 6% to 2.4 trillion yen ($22.4 billion), from a previous forecast of 2.55 trillion yen. The 2.7% drop on the year means it will snap a three-year run of rising profit. “We have factored in cost reduction efforts for the year, but there are still some uncertainties. We cannot be complacent,” Toyota Operating Officer Kenta Kon told reporters at a results briefing. It expects the yen to trade around 106 to the U.S. dollar and 121 to the euro in the current financial year, from a previous assumption of 110 yen and 125 yen, respectively. For the quarter just ended, however, Toyota posted an 8.7% rise in operating profit to 741.9 billion yen ($6.93 billion), its highest since the September 2015 quarter, helped by a slight increase in global vehicle sales. (For a link to an interactive graph on Toyota's financial performance, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Xzf8Xl) But the stronger domestic currency took a toll on Honda’s profits. Japan’s No. 3 automaker posted an operating income of 252.4 billion yen for the April-June period, down 16% from 299.3 billion yen a year ago and lagging analyst forecasts. Still, Honda reiterated its forecast for a 6% increase in operating profit to 770 billion yen for this fiscal year, and said it expected the yen to average around 110 to the U.S. dollar, unchanged from its previous forecast. (For a link to an interactive graph on Honda's financial performance, click on tmsnrt.rs/310ZCoU) Easing demand for cars has also dented earnings at Honda and other automakers including Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Ford Motor Co F.N, prompting the latter two to announce job cuts and plant closures. An escalating trade war between China and the United States, the world’s top two auto markets, and slowing economic growth have prompted a broad-based sales downturn in the global auto sector. “Conditions in the U.S. market continue to be severe, including the effects of the trade friction between the U.S. and China,” Honda Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi told reporters, adding that tensions could also have a negative impact in China, where demand for cars is already slowing. “How the Chinese market reacts to the U.S.-China trade friction will be key to setting our business strategy.” A downturn in the global auto sector could weigh on profits just as automakers invest heavily in new technologies including electric cars, autonomous driving technologies and ride-sharing services to survive a industry shift away from car ownership. Toyota has been pouring money in ride-sharing services including Uber UBER.N, Grab and Didi Chuxing while deepening alliances with SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T to develop on-demand transportation services in Japan, to position itself as a provider of mobility services. Investors have backed this strategy, pushing Toyota shares roughly 10% higher this year, outperforming its domestic rivals. Honda too has been scrambling to reinvent itself to compete with tech firms such as Google parent Alphabet GOOGL.O and Uber, by expanding partnerships and investing in General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise self-driving vehicle unit."

7.876876557509525," Toyota faces Australian class action over claims of faulty diesel filters SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian lawyers filed a class action lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T local unit on Thursday, claiming some models of the carmaker's top-selling vehicles Hilux, Prado and Fortuner were fitted with defective parts. According to a statement on its website, Banister Law, together with Gilbert + Tobin, filed the suit in the Federal Court alleging some vehicles were fitted with defective diesel particulate filters meant to trap and burn soot from the engine. “The affected vehicles ... require time consuming and costly repairs, including repeated vehicle servicing and repeated replacement of the (diesel filters) in its entirety,” Bannister Law said in the statement. Representatives from Toyota’s Australian unit did not immediately return emails seeking comment. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of customers who purchased the cars between Oct. 1, 2015 and July 26 2019, seeks compensation for the alleged loss and damage suffered by the group, the statement said, without giving any details on the amount. The lawsuit also alleges Toyota made misleading statements because the vehicles “could not, and did not, deliver the advertised combination of durability, reliability, quality, comfort and convenience, and the (diesel filter) in the affected vehicles was not durable, reliable and of good quality”. Toyota’s Hilux is Australia’s top selling car, according to comparison website Canstar.

4.3622633962264175," Toyota to invest $600 million in China's Didi, new JV to develop mobility services SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it will invest $600 million in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing as well as a new joint venture as the companies seek to develop connected and electric vehicle technologies in China. The move accelerates a trend in China which has seen automakers launch their own ride-hailing services, and ride-hailing firms such as Didi team with automakers to develop purpose-built cars for their services. It also comes as the auto and communications industries develop the next generation of connected vehicle technologies, including self-driving and so-called vehicle-to-everything technology, with the advancement of 5G network technology. Toyota said the new joint venture would include the Japanese automaker’s Chinese partnership with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (GAC), and would see the companies combining services and technologies to work on fleet management, car maintenance and car rental services. That collaboration will utilize Toyota’s connected technologies and next-generation battery electric vehicles, Toyota’s Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement. Toyota, which has said it aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, has tapped Chinese battery makers including Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and BYD Co Ltd to aid it in the shift to electricity-powered cars. The move is in line with global regulations and a push among automakers to develop the new-energy vehicle industry. It has also said it would set up a joint venture to develop connected vehicles with Japanese auto parts maker Denso Corp. Toyota and Didi on Thursday did not specify whether their collaboration will involve car design or manufacturing, which is part of Didi’s goal to ultimately develop purpose-built cars for its services. Toyota and Didi have previously teamed up on other vehicle projects and services for Didi drivers. Didi has also set up ventures with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, BYD and BAIC' new-energy vehicle unit. Sources told Reuters in June that Didi was in talks with Nissan Motor Co Ltd and its China partner, Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd, to form another fleet-management venture.

6.060604542013973," China considers limited support for petrol-electric hybrids in boon for Toyota, Honda BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering re-classifying petrol-electric hybrid vehicles so they get more favorable treatment than all-petrol or diesel counterparts under clean car rules, making it easier for automakers to meet environment quotas and offer more choice. Global hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T would be among the biggest beneficiaries of such change, which could allow them to make more hybrids and less of the more costly all-electric vehicles, experts said, after reviewing the draft policy proposal published on Tuesday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China has some of the world’s strictest rules regarding the production of greenhouse gas-emitting vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities. Those rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of so-called new-energy vehicles (NEVs), such as those powered solely by electricity and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as plug-in hybrids. Under a system that kicked in this year, automakers in China are obliged to make up for a portion of the “negative” points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehicles with points won for producing NEVs. Though more fuel-efficient than petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles, hybrids, introduced in 1997 with Toyota’s Prius, are currently classed alongside those powered by fossil fuels. In the draft proposal, hybrids would still be considered fossil-fuelled but re-classified as “low fuel consumption passenger vehicles”. Significantly, the number of negative points incurred for making hybrids will be less than for traditional vehicles. That could see more of those traditional vehicles replaced with hybrids, experts said, because when automakers produce hybrids, they would have to make up for fewer negative points. The proposed change came as a surprise, some experts and industry officials said, because the government has never given any preferential treatment for hybrid technology. Previously, the government offered subsidies for, for instance, the purchase of all-electric cars. “The new proposed policy is a roundabout way to promote hybrid cars,” Cui Dongshu, secretary general of China Passenger Car Association, wrote in a social media post. Hybrid cars sold in China include versions of Toyota’s Corolla, Levin and Camry sedans, and versions of Honda’s Accord and CR-V. Beijing-based spokesmen for both Japanese automakers declined to comment. Local automaker GAC Motor 601238.SS, which makes hybrids in partnership with Toyota and Honda, said it ""keeps close attention to national policies and will actively respond to the promotion and development of relevant policies and standards."""
4.137224936502385," Toyota to build new SUV, rather than car at Alabama plant WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it will build a new sport utility vehicle at a $1.6 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama rather than produce Corolla cars. The largest Japanese automaker announced in January 2018 would build the factory in Alabama with Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T. Toyota, which said the shift was due to ""a growing consumer appetite for light trucks and SUVs,"" still expects to start production in 2021. Last week, the company said U.S. Corolla sales fell 5% in the first six months to 152,868, while overall Toyota car sales fell 8%. Its U.S. SUV sales only fell 1% over the same period. In recent years, American vehicle buyers have dramatically shifted away from cars to crossovers, SUVs and pickup trucks. Still, U.S. auto industry sales have been declining, and there is some concern the new plant could exacerbate overcapacity and pressure vehicle prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2.2% in the first half of 2019. Toyota will continue to build Corolla cars at its Mississippi plant. Mazda said previously it would build a new SUV at the joint venture plant that will assemble up to 300,000 vehicles annually. The plant is on a 2,500-acre site about 14 miles from Toyota’s engine plant in Huntsville, Alabama. Among U.S. states, Alabama is already the fifth largest producer of cars and light trucks. The state has more than 150 major auto suppliers and 57,000 automotive manufacturing jobs. Early in 2017, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized Toyota and threatened hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico. Toyota said in October 2017 it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than Guanajuato, and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead. Toyota will now rely on its Mississippi plant and Japan for Corolla production, a spokesman said."

4.147907877064084," Toyota to supply hydrogen fuel-cell tech to China's FAW, Higer Bus BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will supply key hydrogen fuel-cell parts to Chinese automakers FAW and Higer Bus, as the Japanese automaker tries to promote the technology it continues to view as superior to rapidly spreading battery-powered vehicles. Toyota is betting the move, part of a broader offensive, will help push rapid adoption of fuel-cell technology in China. Fuel-cell cars use a stack of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity to propel the vehicle, with water being the only byproduct. Toyota, along with peers Honda Motor Co Ltd, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Germany’s Daimler AG, has been trying to promote the technology for nearly two decades. But efforts have been hampered by the technology’s high price tag and lack of refueling infrastructure. “Toyota hopes to cooperate with more Chinese commercial vehicle companies,” Toyota said in a statement on Friday, to “promote the application and popularization of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) in China.” The Japanese carmaker will supply fuel-cell components to China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL] and Higer Bus Co, with Shanghai Re-Fire Technology Co acting as local supplier. Re-Fire will be system integrator and develop fuel-cell powertrain technology that the Chinese automakers can use to make hydrogen buses, Toyota officials told Reuters. Similarly, Toyota in April said it had started supplying fuel-cell parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Beijing SinoHytec Co Ltd."

Monet is building up members as it joins the ride-sharing sphere which is dominated by startups such as Uber Technologies Inc, Didi Chuxing and Lyft Inc, as traditional automakers band together to compete in an industry which is placing growing emphasis on offering vehicle services rather than selling cars to individual drivers. Automakers are increasingly joining forces with technology companies as well as each other as they grapple with the massive investment and software expertise required to develop these new services for which demand has yet to be tested. The new investment will see Suzuki, Mazda and Subaru deepen their partnership with Toyota, as they have already agreed to tap the R&D firepower of Japan’s biggest automaker for electric cars and other future vehicle technologies.

9.056787868834668," Toyota snub dents Saudi Arabia's manufacturing drive RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia began courting Toyota two years ago to build a large car plant as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s grand plan to wean the kingdom off oil revenues and create jobs for young Saudis. But the Japanese carmaker has rebuffed Riyadh’s overtures following talks that dragged on without tangible results because high labor costs, a small domestic market and a lack of local supplies gave Toyota pause for thought, four sources said. Securing a deal with a major automaker by 2020 for a car plant is a key target in the Gulf state’s national industrial strategy, part of a broader agenda to diversify the economy of the world’s largest oil exporter. Failure to do so would be a setback for Prince Mohammed, coming after the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco was shelved and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi tarnished the kingdom’s image. “Nobody would say ‘No, full stop’ ... but they politely conveyed they’re not interested,” said an industry source familiar with the Toyota talks. Toyota said it could not comment on the current internal discussions and communication with the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia’s ministry of energy, industry and mineral resources and the government media office did not respond to requests for comment. As part of measures designed to create 1.6 million manufacturing and logistics jobs by 2030, Prince Mohammed wants to localize half the production of imported vehicles and weapons - which are expected to account for up to $100 billion in spending by Saudi government entities and consumers by 2030. Under the deal Toyota signed in March 2017, the Japanese company agreed to conduct a feasibility study for an industrial project to make vehicles and car parts in the kingdom. Two sources familiar with the matter said Toyota concluded after the study and negotiations that Saudi Arabia would need to provide huge subsidies for the project to be viable. “They found that production costs will be similar to other countries only if there is a 50% government incentive. But even then, they aren’t sure it will be profitable,” said one source with knowledge of the negotiations. (GRAPHIC: Saudi Arabia GDP breakdown - tmsnrt.rs/2WDjAZb ) When it comes to establishing manufacturing, Riyadh hopes to replicate its 1980s push into petrochemicals - the cornerstone of an industrial drive that turned Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) into the world’s fourth biggest petrochemicals firm. Hundreds of thousands of Saudis work in petrochemicals, one of the biggest contributors to the economy outside oil. But it took decades to build up the industry, even with huge government funding and cheap raw materials. Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, is spearheading the drive to localize military spending. It aims to generate $10 billion in revenue over the next five years and hopes to generate 30% of revenues from export markets by 2030. For cars, the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) wants half the roughly 400,000 vehicles bought each year in Saudi Arabia to be made there by 2030, one source said. But Toyota, which has a 30 percent market share, only proposed a small plant producing up to 10,000 vehicles using imported goods and the Saudis wanted a bigger factory, the industry source and the source familiar with the talks said. A strategy document posted on NIDLP’s website acknowledged that Saudi Arabia had a major competitive disadvantage and state incentives would be needed to create “substantial commercial justifications” to attract carmakers. It did not provide specifics about the disadvantages, nor the size and kind of state incentives required. At NIDLP’s launch in January, the state approved 45 billion riyals ($12 billion) of incentives to develop an auto sector, including duty rebates, human resources subsidies and tax holidays, but it wasn’t enough, the industry source said. NIDLP did not respond to requests for comment. Asked if it would consider the project if the economic conditions changed, Toyota said: “We do not comment on assumptions about the current and future situations.” (GRAPHIC: Economy by sector in 2018 - tmsnrt.rs/2IUeZbs) The NIDLP is aiming to create 27,000 jobs in the automotive sector by 2030 by attracting so-called original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). One obstacle, though, is the absence of a local supply chain for car parts, three automotive industry executives said. Riyadh would need to build integrated economic districts producing components such as windows, batteries and wheels to lower costs, a senior executive at a Western auto firm said. “If I have to open a manufacturing process in Saudi and then import every single component from abroad, I do not have any economical plus,” he said. “The problem is not really setting up a plant, but having the entire value chain.” The local market is also relatively small. Demand for cars in Saudi Arabia has fallen by some 50% over three years to about 450,000 cars in 2018, as a drop in oil prices and departure of expatriates hit consumption, said Subhash Joshi, director of mobility practice at research firm Frost & Sullivan. “Saudi Arabia and (Gulf) countries have been persistently disappointing in terms of sales in recent years, so it’s not as if OEMs would be entering a booming market,” said Justin Cox, director of global production at LMC Automotive. Cox said countries such as Egypt and Turkey had more advantages for carmakers. Toyota has a 1.2 billion euro plant with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles in Turkey, which is in a customs union with Europe. A plant Nissan set up in Egypt in 2005 with a $200 million investment will produce 28,000 cars this year. Cars imported into the GCC customs union which includes Saudi Arabia only attract a 5% tariff, offering little protection against cheap imports for countries trying to get domestic car production off the ground. Turkey and Egypt also provide experienced, cheap manpower while Riyadh has been reducing the number of foreign laborers to create jobs for Saudis, who prefer higher-paying public jobs. Some 10 million foreigners have been doing the strenuous, lower-paid jobs largely shunned by the 20 million nationals. Khalid al-Salem, who oversees the development of industrial cities, said the authorities were working on incentives to lure Saudis to industrial jobs instead of retail, where entry requirements are easier and pay is higher. He did not elaborate. It’s not the first time Saudi Arabia has attempted to lure automakers. In 2012, Jaguar Land Rover signed a deal to explore producing 50,000 Land Rovers a year in the kingdom at a cost of 4.5 billion riyals ($1.2 billion), but it never moved forward. The industry source said the British luxury brand, owned by India’s Tata Motors, got a better offer from a European country. “We continually review our global manufacturing footprint. At this time, our focus remains on our manufacturing presence in the UK, China, Brazil and mainland Europe,” Jaguar Land Rover said in an emailed response when asked about the Saudi project. Two of the sources said Riyadh has also approached Nissan Motor Co in recent years. They said the Japanese firm considered contract manufacturing through a 75% Saudi-owned venture - without the Nissan brand - but the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year meant it was off the table for now. Nissan declined to comment. While Saudi Arabia is struggling to lure carmakers, it does have a truck assembly industry. But analysts say assembling vehicles imported in kit form requires less investment and doesn’t create as many jobs as building cars from scratch. Economists say, however, that Saudi Arabia does have the potential to build competitive industries and create jobs in the mining and pharmaceutical sectors. The state is looking to triple mining’s contribution to gross domestic product by 2030 by focusing on untapped reserves of bauxite, phosphate, gold, copper and uranium. Saudi authorities estimate the country holds 500 million tonnes of phosphate ore, about 7% of global proven reserves and a new mining law to boost foreign investment is being drafted. Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said investment in mining infrastructure would likely have the most direct impact on developing new manufacturing industries. Pharmaceuticals is another strategic sector for NIDLP. About 25 local manufacturing plants produce 30% of prescription drugs consumed now and the government wants to double the sector’s contribution to non-oil gross domestic product to 1.97% by 2020. Suhasini Molkuvan, program manager at Frost & Sullivan, said the target was almost close to reality though a lack of investment in research and development and intellectual property left local firms dependent on multinationals. “Diversity is easier said than done,” said a senior Riyadh banker. “It might be achievable in 15 to 20 years if they continue to make the push.”"

8.44868002958125," First stop Southeast Asia: SoftBank, Toyota's autonomous car venture heads overseas TOKYO (Reuters) - The self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank Corp and Toyota Motor plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia next year, in its first overseas foray, its chief executive said on Tuesday. The move would mark a shift for Japan’s third biggest telco as it looks abroad for growth and potentially bring it into competition with portfolio companies of parent SoftBank Group Corp and its $100 billion Vision Fund, which has invested in major ride-hailing firms around the world. Monet, which is developing an on-demand self-driving service platform, is planning to export a basic version of the system, Chief Executive Junichi Miyakawa told Reuters. “Our first step will likely be to Southeast Asia, as applications like transportation services in smart cities, or airport shuttle systems,” Miyakawa said, adding that Monet could begin introducing such services in 2020. Monet is the first-ever alliance between Japan’s No. 3 telco and its largest automaker. SoftBank Corp is the largest shareholder in the venture, which was announced last October, with a 40.2% share, while Toyota owns 39.8%. It plans to roll out on-demand bus and car services in Japan in the next year, and a services platform for electric vehicles as early as 2023 based on Toyota’s boxy “e-palette” multi-purpose vehicle. Honda Motor Co and Toyota’s truck making subsidiary Hino Motors took a roughly 10% stake each in the venture in March, and Miyakawa said that it would soon take more investment from the domestic auto industry. “We’re planning to announce an expansion in our stakeholders sometime this month,” he said. Currently chief technology officer of SoftBank Corp, Miyakawa began looking for projects outside of its core telco business, which faces a mature market and shrinking population, on his return from a stint at SoftBank’s struggling U.S. wireless unit Sprint. The son of a Buddhist priest who is known for his frank style and big ideas like flying cellphone antenna company HAPSMobile, Miyakawa settled on the idea of developing a platform for autonomous cars after flirting with the idea of making cars. While Monet’s global ambitions will initially be limited to basic transport services, any expansion could eventually put it in competition with SoftBank portfolio companies, which include Uber Technologies , Didi Chuxing, Grab and Ola and the self-driving units of Uber and General Motors. Miyakawa, a key lieutenant of SoftBank Group founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, said he has no qualms about competing with those companies, adding that the knowledge of ride-hailing firms gained by SoftBank’s investing helps Monet develop its own services. “Monet is part of the SoftBank Corp camp (and not the Vision Fund),” Miyakawa said. “As a company, we will go up against rivals which the Vision Fund invests in if it means we can provide the best services we can.” SoftBank and Toyota’s investments into those ride-hailing services could benefit Monet’s overseas expansion, one analyst said, as the companies could tap them for partnerships to help their entry into new markets. “If Monet were to enter the Chinese market, it could approach Didi; for the U.S. market it could partner with Uber, and collaborate with Grab in Southeast Asia,” said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama."

7.892805032215092," Toyota speeds up electric vehicle schedule as demand heats up TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and will tap Chinese battery makers to meet the accelerated global shift to electricity-powered cars. The change illustrates the breakneck growth in the electric vehicle (EV) market, which is transforming the auto industry, and is also an acknowledgment by Japan’s top car maker that it may not be able to meet demand for batteries on its own. Toyota is now faced with a higher-than-expected demand for cars that use batteries, rather than gasoline, Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told a briefing on Friday. Also, increasingly stringent emissions regulations require more lithium-ion batteries in the next five years than the automaker plans to produce, he added. “We consider ourselves as a maker of electric vehicle batteries, going back to when we developed the battery for the Prius,” he said, referring to the pioneering gasoline hybrid. “But there may be a gap between the amount of batteries we can produce, and the amount of batteries we may need.” Toyota, which already makes batteries for hybrids and hybrid plug-ins, said it will partner with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and EV maker BYD Co Ltd for battery procurement. It also announced an ultra-compact two-seater designed for short-distance trips, with a maximum speed of 60 km (37 miles) per hour and 100 km range on a single charge. However, Terashi said while demand for EVs grows, profits will be slower in coming, given the economies of scale. EV technology has come a long way since 2010, with battery technologies improving and costs coming down. Still, EV sales are expected to trail gasoline hybrid vehicle volumes by 2025, with the former expected to be fewer than 1 million vehicles, Terashi added. The key to creating a profitable battery EV operation could be in combining new mobility technologies, including on-demand ride services, with battery-powered electric cars, he said. Tapping CATL signals a widening of Toyota’s procurement pool. The Chinese firm already has relationships with other automakers such as Honda Motor, Nissan and a multi-billion dollar battery supply deal Volvo Car Group. Toyota has for decades been developing its own lithium-ion EV battery technology and has partnered with Panasonic to develop and make rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries. The automaker, which launched the Prius, the world’s first mass-market “green car” over two decades ago, has led in technologies for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Its cars account for more than 80% of the global hybrid vehicle market. But it has trailed rivals such as Nissan Motor, Volkswagen and Tesla in bringing all-battery EVs to showrooms. Toyota is looking to partnerships with rival automakers and tech firms as it seeks to reduce its capital outlay for developing new-vehicle technologies. On Thursday, it announced it was teaming with Subaru Corp to develop a battery-electric SUV on a platform produced together as they seek to split costs. Toyota is, however, not changing its long-held belief that hydrogen FCVs will be the ultimate zero-emissions vehicles in the future, Terashi said. “We haven’t changed our policy towards battery EVs,” Terashi said. “We are not shifting our focus to prioritize battery EVs, nor are we abandoning our FCV strategy.” The firm has also long espoused the benefits of hybrids and how they are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that they do not need charging infrastructure."
7.892805032215092," Toyota to tie up with China's CATL to accelerate electrification - Nikkei TOKYO, June 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will tie up with leading Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), in a move to accelerate the electrification of its products, the Nikkei newspaper said on Friday. The Japanese automaker will sign a memorandum of understanding on a “strategic partnership” with the Chinese company, the Nikkei said, without citing sources. Toyota, which was due to have a media briefing on its electrification strategy on Friday, did not comment on details when contacted by Reuters.

8.862324595325855," Toyota, Subaru team up to develop electric SUV in battle against costs TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Subaru Corp on Thursday said they plan to jointly develop a battery-electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV) on a platform produced together as they seek to split the cost of producing the lower-emissions car. The pair will apply Subaru’s all-wheel-drive technologies and Toyota’s vehicle electrification technologies to the new SUV, which each will sell under its own brands, the automakers said in a statement. The move to share technology underlines the conundrum facing Toyota and other global automakers, which are competing to develop new vehicle technologies including all-battery electric cars and self-driving cars, which require massive investment. “Subaru and Toyota believe that it is necessary to pursue a business model that goes beyond convention, crossing over industrial boundaries,” the automakers said. Toyota is looking to partnerships with rival automakers and tech firms to reduce its capital outlay for developing these new technologies. In April, it announced it would supply other automakers with its hybrid technology, an area it has led since it pioneered the Prius in 1997. While the Japanese automaker has led in technologies for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, it has trailed behind rivals such as Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc in bringing fully electric vehicles to showrooms. As the smallest of Japan’s major automakers, Subaru is struggling to independently invest in and develop lower-emission vehicles and on-demand transportation services widely seen as necessary to survive technological upheaval in the global auto industry. It is also struggling with a spate of recent production- and quality-related issues, the side effects of rapid growth to keep up with booming for its Legacy sedans and Forester SUV crossovers in the United States, its biggest market. Thursday’s announcement builds on a partnership between Toyota and Subaru which goes back to 2005. Toyota is the largest shareholder in Subaru with a stake of 16.77%, showed Refinitiv data."

10.506947377388764," Automakers say Trump's threatened Mexico tariffs would cost billions DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to slap tariffs on Mexican-made goods could cost its major suppliers $1 billion, highlighting growing concern in the U.S. auto sector about the potential damage of a new front in the Trump administration’s trade wars. Trump has said he will apply tariffs of 5% on Mexican goods on June 10 if Mexico does not halt the flow of illegal immigration, largely from Central America, across the U.S.-Mexican border. Those tariffs would gradually rise to 25% by Oct. 1 if Mexico does not satisfy Trump’s demands. Faced with this threat, major automakers are also planning to delay some vehicle shipments from Mexico, people briefed on the plans told Reuters on Tuesday. The shipment delays would affect vehicles with high inventory levels on U.S. dealer lots if the tariffs take effect as threatened. Automakers are trying to speed some critical parts shipments this week ahead of the Monday deadline. Consultancy LMC Automotive said on Tuesday the industry could absorb a 5% percent tariff for a month, but that a sustained period at the 25% tariff level would have a potentially devastating impact on the auto industry and cut U.S. new vehicle sales by up to 1.5 million units annually. “A prolonged period of tariffs on Mexican imports would likely push Mexico into recession and could also threaten a recession in the United States,” LMC said. In 2018, automakers sold 17.3 million new vehicles in the United States. LMC said prices on models imported from Mexico could increase by an average of $8,500, while the average price of a vehicle sold in the U.S. market could rise by as much as $2,500-3,000 when parts for assembly in the United States are factored in. In an email seen by Reuters, Toyota Motor Corp told its U.S. dealers the duties could cost its major suppliers between $215 million and $1.07 billion. The email, dated June 3, from Toyota’s North American sales chief, Bob Carter, also told dealers that 65% of the Tacoma midsize pickup trucks the Japanese automaker plans to sell in the U.S. market in 2019 will be imported from its plant in Baja, Mexico. On Tuesday Kevin Clark, chief executive at auto supplier Aptiv PLC told investors at a conference in Boston that a 5% tariff would cost it around $17 million per month. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Montreal on Tuesday, Steve Kiefer, senior vice president, global purchasing and supply chain at General Motors Co, declined to discuss how much tariffs could cost but said “the single biggest problem we have is the uncertainty with tariffs.” “Right now, we’re asking all of our suppliers to be calm and not do anything drastic,” Kiefer said. Automakers are pressing Republican senators on Capitol Hill to contact the White House to try to convince the president not to move ahead with the tariffs, the people briefed on the matter told Reuters. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday there was “not much support” among his fellow Republicans for the tariffs."

9.835099365750539," Exclusive: A delicate balance - Toyota took care to make offering to U.S. before China deals BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp last month announced two deals in China that were small in size but large in strategic planning. The automaker said it would establish a green-tech research institute with Tsinghua University and provide state-owned BAIC Group’s Foton unit with fuel-cell technology for buses. But before it could feel comfortable unveiling those plans, Toyota put in months of work to pledge fresh investment - in the United States. The technology transfers represent gestures of goodwill to Beijing by the Japanese automaker, which wants to “step on the accelerator in China” as CEO Akio Toyoda told an internal management group, according to minutes of meetings on March 19 and April 23 viewed by Reuters. Announcing U.S. investment first was a strategy Toyoda felt the company needed to pursue to avoid U.S. President Donald Trump’s wrath, the minutes showed - providing a rare window into how it has sought to tread carefully as the United States and China battle for investment, jobs and influence in the global economy. “For Toyota to operate globally, we need to strike a fine balance between China and the United States,” the March 19 minutes quoted Toyoda as saying. “It’s imperative to avoid making enemies.” According to the April 23 minutes, the Japanese automaker is making what one unnamed senior executive described as a “significant move to steer its focus to China” — a market where it is far behind industry leaders Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. Toyota declined to comment on its internal meetings. Its pivot to China - one that many other global automakers are also making - has been made easier by a thaw in ties between China and Japan but complicated by Trump’s trade policies. That includes the trade war between Washington and Beijing as well as threats from Trump to impose tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars made by foreign automakers. On Friday, Trump declared that some imported vehicles and parts pose a national security threat, although he delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs. In response, Toyota issued one of its strongest messages on potential tariffs to date, calling the designation “a major set-back for American consumers, workers and the auto industry” and saying it sent the message “our investments are not welcomed.” Toyota has been at pains to show its commitment to the United States, and in the March 19 minutes Toyoda explained a fresh investment of $749 million in U.S. manufacturing capacity and jobs as “an essential” step before it could speed up efforts to expand in China. Announcing the new investment on March 14, Toyota stressed the sum helped bump up a five-year investment pledge made in 2017 to almost $13 billion from $10 billion. The day following the announcement, Toyoda also spoke before the Economic Club of Washington, declaring: “I love America”. “I just don’t understand why we are called a national security threat and it pains my heart,” Toyoda said in answer to a question after his speech. “One thing I would promise, no matter what direction the discussion takes us is that Toyota will not leave America.” Though many other automakers, including U.S. automakers, have announced investments in the United States since Trump came to power in 2017, the near $13 billion pledged by Toyota is the biggest amount by far. Toyota would have pressed ahead with fresh U.S. investment even without its China plans, but there was much internal planning around how the announcements should be timed, company sources with knowledge of the matter said. The sources, who were not authorized to speak to media, declined to be identified. In a further sign of Toyota’s careful approach to relations with Washington, board member Ikuro Sugawara was dispatched in April to meet with U.S. Ambassador William Hagerty at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo to give him the heads up that the two China deals would be announced. “I didn’t think we needed to do that but the Ambassador commended our effort more than I had expected,” the April 23 minutes quoted Sugawara, a former vice minister for trade, as saying. The U.S. embassy in Tokyo declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting, saying only it was in regular contact with Toyota and many other Japanese firms about their plans to continue investing in the United States. For many automakers, the U.S. auto market is a key profit center that generates industry-wide sales of about 17 million vehicles annually. But China has rapidly grown in importance - with 28 million vehicles sold in 2018 - and is drawing new investment from global automakers eager to keep up with its heavy promotion of electric cars. Toyota commands 14% of the U.S. market, but in China it had just 5.3% share last year and the 1.49 million vehicles it sold were less than half the volume sold by VW and GM. It is aiming to lift sales 10% every year over the next five or six years - roughly equivalent to 3 million cars annually by the mid-2020s, according to a source at a Toyota parts supplier, who declined to be identified as he did not work for the automaker. Asked about Toyota’s China ambitions, a company spokesman said China was an important market and the automaker was looking at strengthening its base there so that it could propel the business forward. China has sometimes been a difficult market for Japanese companies due to historical reasons, with sales in 2012 taking a battering in the wake of diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. But company sources say Toyota’s pivot has gained steam on the back of an official visit to Japan in May last year by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, during which Toyoda accompanied Li on a tour of Toyota’s facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido. Since then, Toyota has embarked on an expansion of its manufacturing muscle in China, with plans to add annual production capacity of 120,000 vehicles each at its Tianjin plant and at its Guangzhou plant. It is also expanding distribution networks and is sharing technology to promote goodwill among Chinese leaders, Toyota sources have said. “We have full backing of the Chinese government, but we shouldn’t take it for granted and must continue to make efforts consistently,” the April 23 minutes quoted Toyoda as saying. In contrast to the automaker’s efforts in the United States, Toyota is content to keep a relatively low profile with regards to its plans in China. Neither the Tianjin nor the Guangzhou plans were formally announced by Toyota. Investment amounts have also not been disclosed. Last month a news conference for international media at the Shanghai auto show was canceled - a move that one company source said was the result of a warning by Toyoda to be circumspect when dealing with the media on the topics of tariff hikes or U.S. import quotas.

8.095873281930949," Panasonic flags first profit drop in eight years, EV battery costs bite TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp warned profit this financial year would fall for the first time in eight years as costs to boost battery output rise and it moves to overhaul some businesses amid investor pressure to find new avenues of growth. The Japanese conglomerate expects operating profit for the year through March 2020 to slump 27 percent to 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) from a year earlier. That is well below analyst expectations of a 12 percent decline, according to Refinitiv. The company is looking at a 15 billion yen loss at its automotive unit this year, it said on Thursday. Panasonic expects costs to ramp up battery production in Japan and China for a planned electric-vehicle (EV) battery joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp to weigh heavily. Panasonic switched its focus to corporate clients such as automakers a few years ago to escape price wars in lower-margin consumer electronics. The shift, which involved a vast migration of TV engineers to the automotive unit, helped the company restore profit growth, but its non-consumer businesses did not grow as fast as the company had hoped. “Over the last three years, we aimed for stable revenue and profit growth focusing mainly on the automotive business ... but development costs and insufficient abilities to adjust to rapid battery production expansion limited our profits,” Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga said. The business was also squeezed last year due to production delays for Tesla Inc’s mass-market Model 3 sedan. Panasonic is Tesla’s exclusive supplier of battery cells and industry watchers have said the Japanese company needs to cut its reliance on the U.S. electric carmaker. Elon Musk, Tesla’s mercurial CEO, last month blamed Panasonic for the production delays. He previously said Tesla was looking for other battery suppliers for its new Shanghai car factory. Tsuga, however, told a post-earnings press conference on Thursday that Panasonic’s relationship with Tesla remained good. “We are not just a supplier but a partner,” he said. Panasonic is set to deepen its partnership with Toyota, announcing earlier on Thursday they would establish a joint company to develop “connected” services to be used in homes and urban development. Panasonic also said it would sell its solar battery research arm and a solar battery plant in Malaysia to China’s GS-Solar for an undisclosed amount."
8.095873281930949," Toyota, Panasonic to set up company for 'connected' homes TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp said they plan to establish a joint company to develop “connected” services to be used in homes and urban development. The tie-up deepens the partnership between the companies, which in January announced a joint venture to build electric-vehicle (EV) batteries, pooling the R&D and manufacturing strengths of one of the world’s largest automakers and battery makers to compete in the fast-growing EV market. In their latest venture, Toyota and Panasonic said they will set up a new company early next year to focus on technology that could be used to offer personalized services in the home. The pair plan to be 50-50 partners in the new firm and will increase cooperation at their respective housing operations in Japan. “We will put our respective strengths together to offer new value in everyday life,” Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga said in a joint statement on Thursday. The move comes at a time when lower-emissions vehicles and ride-sharing services have opened up the auto industry to new competitors, leaving traditional car makers and their suppliers scrambling to find alternate revenue streams. Toyota has been developing connected cars that can share information on usage - data that could be leveraged for on-demand ride-sharing, insurance and maintenance. The automaker has said it will tap into its partner network and its operations which range from building and selling cars, homes and companion robots to expand into new transportation and home energy services. “If we are able to use this network going forward not only to manufacture and sell vehicles but to also provide new services, our future possibilities will greatly expand,” President Akio Toyota told reporters on Wednesday. “In addition to cars, I think that having our own housing business and connected business will be a big advantage for us.”"

6.233577427175147," Toyota, Honda plan to attack costs to free up cash for new tech TOKYO (Reuters) - Two top Japanese automakers said they planned to tighten their belts in the years ahead to free up cash to develop electric cars and ride-sharing services, underscoring the hard task ahead as traditional automakers face a rapidly changing industry. Toyota Motor Corp, the country’s top automaker, said that higher costs to develop new technologies like connected cars was ramping up pressure to generate savings wherever possible, while Honda Motor Co said it would strip down its vehicle lineup to cut production costs. “We still weren’t able to improve our costs enough last year,” Toyota CFO Koji Kobayashi told reporters, adding that mounting investment required for new technologies and other R&D costs was making cost-cutting efforts more challenging. “We need to work to find new ways to reduce costs this year,” he said, adding that penny pinching would apply to all aspects of the business, from producing lower-cost prototypes to limiting the number of pencils employees use at any given time. Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said Japan’s No. 3 automaker would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10 percent and redirecting those savings toward advanced research and development. “We recognize that the number of models and variations at the trim and option level have increased and our efficiency has declined,” he told reporters at a briefing. Toyota expects cost reduction efforts will help to lift operating profit by 3.3 percent to 2.55 trillion yen ($23.20 billion) in the year to March 2020. In the year just ended, Toyota posted an operating profit of 2.47 trillion yen. The profit outlook for one of the world’s biggest car makers was slightly lower than the 2.61 trillion yen average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Toyota also announced a 300 billion yen share buyback. (For an interactive chart on Toyota's financial year, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Xzf8Xl) Honda forecast cost reductions would help boost operating profit by 6 percent to 770 billion yen in the year to March. That is less than the 834 billion yen average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Profit fell 13 percent to 726 billion yen in the year ended March due to currency fluctuations and costs related to Honda’s plan to shutter production plants in the UK and Turkey in 2021. (For interactive charts on Honda's financial year, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Ix5Zep) Toyota expects to sell a record 10.74 million vehicles globally in the current year, up 1.3 percent on the year and lifted by higher sales in Asia as it continues to grow sales in China despite an overall slowdown in the world’s biggest auto market. But sales in North America are expected to struggle for another year due to weak U.S. demand for its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry as drivers continue to shift to larger, higher-margin trucks and SUVs. Toyota expects sales in the region to slide 1.6 percent. Kobayashi said Toyota wanted to raise its operating margin in North America to 8 percent in 2020, in line with the global margin, from around 1 percent, but acknowledged it was not confident of meeting the target. To do so, the automaker would need to further ramp up its sales ratio of SUVs and trucks from around 60 percent of total vehicle sales in 2018 and slash discounting, he said. Toyota, Honda and their rivals are facing stiff competition as ride-sharing technology and the race to develop self-driving cars has caused rapid - and costly - disruption to the auto industry. These new technologies have opened the industry to tech firms and other players, forcing traditional automakers to rethink their strategy of selling gasoline-powered passenger cars to individual drivers, a business model which has been essentially unchallenged for the past century. “From here on will be an age in which the difference between victory and defeat will be decided by the last one mile, which will be our contact point with customers,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters. “Merely depending on the business model of the past will not lead to the future.”"

6.3968969614231055," Toyota to produce Lexus NX for North America at Canada plant OTTAWA/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will build its Lexus NX luxury crossover vehicle at a Canadian plant starting in 2022, the company said on Monday, a decision that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said demonstrated the value of the country’s international trade agreements. The plant will invest hundreds of millions of dollars to produce the Lexus NX and its hybrid version at the factory in Cambridge, Ontario, “supplying the entire North American market”, Trudeau said in a presentation with Fred Volf, president of Toyota’s Canadian unit. Citing Canada’s trade agreements with Mexico, the United States, Europe and Asia, Trudeau said: “We have preferential trade access to two-thirds of the global economy. In fact, we’re the only G7 country that has free trade deals with every other G7 country.” Trudeau, who faces a tough re-election contest in October, said the plans by Toyota, one of the world’s largest carmakers, will help guarantee 8,000 jobs and the factory. This is the first time that the Lexus NX and NX hybrid sport utility vehicles will be produced outside of Japan. The automotive sector is Canada’s largest export industry, supporting over 525,000 jobs, the prime minister’s office said, and Toyota is the country’s largest automotive manufacturer. The announcement is a “counter narrative” for Canada’s automaking industry following recent bad news from other automakers, said Flavio Volpe, president of the Toronto-based Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, especially in the province of Ontario. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in March it would cut a shift at its Windsor assembly plant, leading to 1,500 job losses, and General Motors Co said last year it would shut its Oshawa factory by the end of 2019. Plans to assemble the NX in Canada “means that Toyota’s Canadian manufacturing operations are here to stay,” Volf said, adding that the cars are “the most technologically advanced and the most in-demand cars in Toyota-Lexus global lineup.” On Sunday, Trudeau hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Ottawa. Both touted the benefits of a Pacific trade deal that U.S. President Donald Trump walked away from. Trudeau said he had discussed the project to build the Lexus NX in Canada with Chief Executive Akio Toyoda on April 1. “When we last chatted just a few weeks ago, we discussed the potential of this new Lexus mandate,” Trudeau said."
6.738386828869435," Toyota abandons plan to install U.S connected vehicle tech by 2021 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it was halting plans to install Dedicated Short-Range Communications technology on U.S. vehicles aimed at letting cars and trucks communicate with one another to avoid collisions. Automakers have been divided over whether to proceed with the DSRC system or use a 4G- or 5G-based system in the United States. Toyota’s announcement is a major blow to advocates of DSRC. The Japanese automaker announced plans in April 2018 to begin the installation of DSRC technology in 2021 “with the goal of adoption across most of its lineup by the mid-2020s.” On Friday, it said in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that “unfortunately we have not seen significant production commitments from other automakers.” Automakers were allocated a section of spectrum for DSRC in the 5.9 GHz band in 1999 but it has essentially gone unused. Some FCC and cable company officials want to reallocate the spectrum for WiFi and other uses. Testing has gone on for years to see if the band can be shared. DSRC supporters note the U.S. Transportation Department has invested over $700 million in the system’s development. The cellular option has issues, including problems with interoperability, and is not mature enough to be deployed in the 5.9 GHz band, they say. Toyota said Friday’s decision was based on “a range of factors, including the need for greater automotive industry commitment as well as federal government support to preserve the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for DSRC.” The chance that the band could be subjected to “harmful interference from unlicensed operations... creates a substantial and arguably insurmountable risk,” the company said. It said that it would “continue to re-evaluate the deployment environment” and said it is still a strong backer of DSRC “because we believe it is the only proven and available technology for collision avoidance communication.” Toyota’s announcement means it is “imperative that the FCC provide clear guidance and certainty to the private sector companies and road operators that are trying to create a safer environment,” said the Intelligent Transportation Society of American, a group representing public, private and academic organizations. DSRC transmissions enable vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications and broadcast precise vehicle information up to 10 times per second, including location, speed and acceleration. NHTSA has estimated that connected vehicles technologies could eliminate or reduce the severity of up to 80 percent of crashes not involving impaired drivers. General Motors Co backs DSRC and has installed the technology on a small number of Cadillac CTS sedans it has sold since 2017. In December 2016, the Department of Transportation proposed to mandate DSRC in all new vehicles. The Trump administration has not acted on the proposal. Last year, the acting head of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Heidi King, said the agency’s “past research has centered around DSRC — because that was the only technology available.” The NHTSA was “exploring other technologies” including cellular-based services being pursued by Ford Motor Co, she said. Ford said in January it planned to deploy cellular vehicle-to-everything technology,  or C-V2X , in all new U.S. vehicle models beginning in 2022. The Transportation Department plans a meeting on Monday with automakers and state transportation officials about connected vehicle efforts, officials said on Friday."

4.255318274414614," Toyota to sell first hybrid car made in Brazil SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it will begin building a new version of the Corolla sedan in Brazil that will run on electricity, ethanol and gas, which it says will be the first vehicle of its kind in the world. Brazil, which is South America’s largest auto producer, has largely resisted the shift toward electric and hybrid vehicle production that has swept through more developed markets. Some of Toyota’s competitors in Brazil, including General Motors and Volkswagen AG , have said they will import electric vehicles but do not plan to produce them domestically. The announcement was made in a news conference hosted by Sao Paulo state governor Joao Doria. Toyota said the car will be produced in the state, at its Indaiatuba plant, which will receive an investment of 1 billion reais ($254.73 million). Toyota said in a statement that it made the decision to build the Corolla in Brazil in part thanks to a package of tax incentives passed by the country’s Congress, known as Rota 2030. Unlike in most markets around the world, ethanol is a common car fuel in Brazil. Toyota already imports the hybrid Prius to Brazil."

4.640482047712705," Exclusive: Toyota sells electric vehicle technology to Chinese startup Singulato BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to sell electric car technology to Singulato, its first deal with a Chinese electric vehicle startup, allowing the fledgling firm to speed up development of a planned mini EV. In return, Toyota will have preferential rights to purchase green-car credits that Singulato will generate under China’s new quota system for all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. It will also gain a bird’s-eye view into how Chinese EV startups operate and the strategies they pursue in a fast-changing marketplace, said Singulato Chief Executive Shen Haiyin and two sources at the Japanese automaker. “With electrification, autonomous driving and car-sharing shaking up the industry, old ways need to be re-examined,” one of the Toyota sources said, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter. “We have a century’s lead in automotive technology, but we also need to be humble enough to learn from newcomers.” Singulato will acquire a license to use the design of Toyota’s eQ - a battery electric microcar. The deal is due to be announced on Tuesday at the Shanghai auto show, where Singulato will unveil a concept car based on the eQ. Singulato plans to redesign the car, tailoring it to local tastes to come up with a model by early 2021 that is more affordable and offers a longer driving range. “This deal gives us a way to save on time and costs to develop a reliable car and focus on what we excel in,” Shen told Reuters. Financial terms are not expected to be disclosed. A Singulato source said the startup agreed to pay “several tens of millions of dollars” for eQ’s design. Toyota said it was taking various measures to accelerate its business in China, a key market, but it would not comment on specific steps. The agreement is a vote of confidence by Toyota in Singulato’s prospects, said Shen. Founded in 2014 and backed by Intel Corp and Japanese trading house Itochu Corp, Singulato is one of at least 50 Chinese EV startups seeking to survive in a competitive market. It plans to sell its first self-developed battery electric car called the iS6 this year, competing with models from rival startups like Nio and WM Motor as well as those from global automakers. Singulato’s version of the eQ will be a so-called connected car offering young buyers a host of entertainment, safety and navigation features. The car, which will be called the iC3, will also feature some self-driving technology. Toyota sold about 100 eQ cars in 2012 and then discontinued it due to concerns over the limits of EVs, including their high price tags, short driving range and long charge time. But Singulato believes technological advances, especially in batteries, have made the car much more marketable. Shen said the iC3 should be able to go as far as 250-300 km (160-190 miles) on a single full charge and will be priced around 100,000 yuan ($15,000). Singulato aims to sell 200,000 units over five years. According to the two Toyota sources, the deal is part of efforts to share more technology with China as the Japanese automaker seeks more growth in the world’s largest auto market by beefing up manufacturing capacity and distribution channels. The deal dovetails with Toyota’s announcement this month that it would be offering automakers and suppliers free access to nearly 24,000 patents for EV technologies. Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told Reuters the Japanese automaker intended to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems and that it had already received more than enquiries from more than 50 companies. The green-car credits are also an important part of the Singulato deal. Keen to combat smog, jump-start its own auto industry and lower reliance on imported oil, China is aggressively pursuing the adoption of electric cars. Under a production quota system taking effect this year, automakers are required to produce and sell a certain number of new-energy vehicles in proportion to their overall sales volume. A carmaker that fails to achieve its quotas will have to acquire NEV points from an automaker with surplus credits or face penalties. Toyota has said that initially it won’t be able to meet its quotas without buying credits from others. It has also agreed to produce and help sell a car for GAC Motor, a joint venture partner, to generate credits. According to the Toyota sources, the deal with Singulato has already yielded intriguing glimpses into the thinking of Chinese EV startups and their non-traditional approach to engineering. One such example was Singulato’s idea to look at linking headlights with satellite, cellular network location data and the driver’s planned trip. That could help turn the headlights along the driver’s route for enhanced visibility and driving safety. It might not something Toyota would consider but as an idea, “it was eye-opening,” one of the sources said."
4.338232772251096," Exclusive: Toyota sees new business opportunity in leveraging hybrid tech TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - The head of Toyota Motor Corp’s electric vehicle (EV) business told Reuters the automaker has received enquiries from more than 50 companies since announcing last week that it would offer free access to patents for EV motors and power control units. The executive also said Toyota aims to use partnerships to cut by as much as half the outlays for expanded electric and hybrid vehicle components production in the United States, China and Japan. “Until now we have been a tier 1 automaker, but now we also intend to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems,” Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi said. Supplying rivals would greatly expand the scale of production for hardware such as power control units and electric motors that are used in gasoline-electric hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fully electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, he added. Toyota last week outlined plans to offer automakers and auto suppliers royalty-free access to nearly 24,000 electrified vehicle technologies patented by the Japanese auto giant. In an interview on Thursday at Toyota’s global headquarters in Toyota City, Japan, Terashi provided new details of Toyota’s strategy, and its anticipated impact on the company’s investment plans. By offering to supply rival automakers with parts used in Toyota’s gasoline-sipping hybrid vehicles, the Japanese automaker sees a way to slash capital outlay by roughly half for new plants required to build electric car components for future models, Terashi said. “We believe that this approach will reduce investment costs significantly,” he said. Terashi said Toyota projects a surge in demand for electrified vehicles globally as regulators insist new vehicles emit substantially less carbon dioxide, and that working with Toyota would offer others a low-cost path to compliance. Toyota’s internal goal is to sell 5.5 million electrified, Toyota-brand vehicles annually by 2030, up from about 1.6 million vehicles now, he said. Already, Terashi said, Toyota believes it could reach the 5.5 million target as early as 2025. The company is working on plans for a new round of capital spending to expand capacity for producing the hardware required. (For an interactive chart on global powertrain sales forecasts, click here tmsnrt.rs/2IdNUC7) By offering to supply electric vehicle hardware, and the know-how to integrate it into vehicles, Terashi said Toyota wants to reduce its capital outlay, and create a new source of revenue. “We anticipate that there will probably be very few automakers who use our patents to develop their own hybrids from scratch, so by using our system and our components, and offering our support, we can work together to develop these cars,” Terashi said. In the last 20 years, Toyota has managed to dominate the global market for hybrid cars by constantly improving and lowering the cost of the technology it pioneered in the Prius - and keeping this expertise a closely guarded secret. Toyota’s new business foray underlines the challenges facing even the largest global automakers as they confront some of the most profound technological changes for automobiles in a century. Toyota is now trying to take advantage of its lead in refining hybrid vehicles, even as it runs behind global rivals such as Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc in bringing fully electric vehicles to showrooms. Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor. Roughly 15 percent of Toyota’s annual global sales are hybrids, including the Corolla and the RAV4. Last year it sold 1.6 million hybrids globally, more than the 1.3 million all-battery EVs sold by Tesla Inc, Nissan Motor Co and all other automakers combined. To meet the expected surge in hybrid demand, Terashi said he is planning to increase production capacity for hybrid components mainly by adding capacity at existing plants. Toyota has initially courted its partner automakers. It already supplies the plug-in hybrid system for Subaru Corp’s Crosstrek SUV crossover model, and last month Toyota announced that it would be a global supplier of hybrid systems to compact car maker Suzuki Motor Co. The success of the Prius has helped to brand Toyota as a maker of affordable, reliable green cars and has been key to the automaker’s reputation as a leader in low-emissions vehicle technology. Terashi brushed off the risk that Toyota could lose this edge by offering its hybrid technology to other automakers, arguing that it held a crucial, 20-year head start over its rivals. “Even if an automaker is able to develop and produce a car using our systems and parts which complies with emissions regulations, its overall performance would never be the same as ours,” he said."
4.757579912447345," Toyota to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp will offer free access to its hybrid-vehicle patents through 2030, it said on Wednesday, seeking to expand use of the lower-emission technology even as the global industry shifts toward fully electric cars. The pledge by one of the world’s biggest automakers to share its closely guarded patents, the second time it has opened up a technology, is aimed at driving industry uptake of hybrids and fending off the challenge of all-battery electric vehicles(EVs). Toyota said it would grant licenses on nearly 24,000 patents on technologies used in its Prius, the world’s first mass-produced “green” car, and offer to supply competitors with components including motors, power converters and batteries used in its lower-emissions vehicles. “We want to look beyond producing finished vehicles,” Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told reporters. “We want to contribute to an increase in take up (of electric cars) by offering not just our technology but our existing parts and systems to other vehicle makers.” The Nikkei Asian Review first reported Toyota’s plans to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents. Terashi said that the access excluded patents on its lithium-ion battery technology. Toyota’s move to unlock its patents underlines its belief that hybrids are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that they do not need charging infrastructure. Toyota vehicles account for more than 80 percent of the global hybrid vehicle market. “Toyota has realized that they made a mistake by protecting their hybrid technology for years. This prevented diffusion” said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities. “Toyota on its own can’t get key technology accepted, but if other companies use it, that offers the best chance of expansion,” she added. Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor. Hybrid vehicles account for around 3 percent of all vehicles sold globally, eclipsing the roughly 1.5 percent share of all-battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive. Global automakers have pledged to electrify their offerings as a growing number of countries slash vehicle emissions by as much as half by 2030, but many say that shifting to fully electric cars will take time given high cost of batteries. Lewis at Macquarie said automakers in China and Europe could be keen to access Toyota’s hybrid-vehicle patents as they look for lower-emission cars to sell in lower-tier cities where costly battery EVs are out of reach for many drivers. Toyota is also betting on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as the ultimate zero-emissions vehicle, and as a result, has lagged many of its rivals in marketing all-battery EVs. In 2015, it said it would allow access to its FCV-related patents through 2020."

5.263156149802633," U.S. March and quarter one auto sales drop in weak start to 2019 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday reported weak U.S. sales for March and the first quarter, citing a rough start to the year, but said a robust economy and strong labor market should encourage consumers to buy more vehicles as 2019 rolls on. Passenger-car sales suffered throughout the January-March quarter compared with the same period in 2018 as Americans continued to abandon them in favor of larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs, which are far more profitable for automakers. The battle for market share in the particularly lucrative large-pickup truck market intensified in the quarter, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’S (FCA) Ram brand outsold the U.S.’ No. 1 automaker General Motors Co’s Chevrolet-brand trucks. The two automakers have both launched redesigned pickup trucks. Ford Motor Co has for decades built the single best-selling truck brand in its F-Series trucks, with the Chevy brand a solid No. 2 and Ram a distant third. In the fourth quarter, the Chevy and Ram brands were tied for second place behind Ford. GM said versions of its new Silverado pickup trucks that are already on the market rose 20 percent in the first quarter versus sales of the old model in 2018. GM said it is still ramping up production of remaining variants of the truck. Overall, U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to decline in 2019 after a long bull run since the end of the Great Recession, led by falling passenger car sales. Competition in the high-margin SUV market is intensifying. Ford on Tuesday unveiled details of the latest version of its Escape SUV, heavily emphasizing comfort features including a movable rear seat to provide more leg room for passengers, plus consumer-friendly features such as an 8-inch (20.3 cm) touchscreen and Wi-Fi connection for up to 10 devices within 50 feet (15.2m) of the vehicle. GM’s first-quarter sales fell 7 percent, with declines across all brands. Sales of Silverado pickup trucks fell nearly 16 percent and the high-margin Chevy Suburban large SUV dropped 25 percent. GM and Ford do not report monthly sales. Ford is due to release its first-quarter sales figures on Thursday. According to industry data, Ford’s sales fell 2 percent in the quarter and 5 percent in March. Ford representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. FCA reported a 7 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and a 3 percent drop for the first quarter. All of FCA’s brands dropped in March, except for Ram, which saw a 15 percent increase in pickup truck sales. “The industry had a tough first quarter, but with spring finally starting to show its face and continued strong economic indicators ... we are confident that new vehicle sales demand will strengthen going forward,” FCA’s U.S. head of sales, Reid Bigland, said in a statement. Toyota Motor Corp reported a 3.5 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and 5 percent for the first quarter, hurt by declining demand for its Corolla sedans and Camry vehicles. “While some of our competitors are abandoning sedans, we remain optimistic about the future of the segment,” Toyota said in a statement. Nissan Motor Co Ltd posted a 5.3 percent drop in sales in March, and its first-quarter sales were down 11.6 percent. Honda Motor Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co bucked the trend. Honda’s U.S. sales rose 4.3 percent in March and 2 percent in the quarter, while Hyundai’s were up 1.7 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive had predicted a 2.1 percent drop in U.S. auto sales in March, partly due to bad weather, mixed economic data and lower tax refunds."

5.122424252066919," Toyota, Suzuki charge up partnership for electric cars NAGOYA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp on Wednesday said they planned to produce electric vehicles (EVs) and compact cars for each other to better compete with fast-changing technologies in the global auto industry. The agreement follows an initial R&D tie-up announced by Japan’s No. 1 and No. 4 automakers in 2017, and will see more vehicles produced by Suzuki for Toyota, one of the world’s biggest carmakers. Although Suzuki is far smaller, it is a dominant force in the fast-growing Indian market. The two automakers have been pooling their strengths. Toyota is a leader in hybrid technology and is investing heavily in automated driving, while Suzuki specializes in affordable compact cars -- as many automakers struggle to keep pace with ballooning investment in EVs and self-driving cars. Under the latest agreement, Suzuki will source gasoline hybrid systems for cars it sells worldwide from Toyota, which pioneered hybrid vehicles with the Prius more than 20 years ago, the companies said in a joint statement. In return, Suzuki will produce two compact models for Toyota in India based on its Ciaz and Ertiga models. Further cooperation with Suzuki will help Toyota expand its presence in India, the world’s fifth-largest passenger car market where it has struggled to grow sales due to lean demand for its lower-cost models. The deepening partnership between the two automakers will enable cost-conscious Suzuki to tap into Toyota’s R&D firepower to develop lower-emission vehicles and self-driving cars - areas which Suzuki has admitted it is struggling to keep up. “We believe that the expansion of our business partnership with Suzuki ... will help give us the competitive edge we will need to survive this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in a statement. The two automakers will deepen their cooperation in India, where Suzuki’s hybrid vehicles will be made using engines and batteries locally produced by Toyota. They will also join forces in Europe, where Toyota will produce electric vehicles based on its RAV4 SUV crossover and Corolla wagon for Suzuki, while Suzuki will supply Toyota with gasoline engines for compact vehicle models sold in the region. Suzuki will also produce its Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz, and Ertiga models for Toyota which will be rebranded and renamed as Toyota models for the African market."

President Donald Trump has prodded Japanese automakers to add more jobs in the United States as the White House has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles, on the grounds of national security. “All this activity I hope shows that we’re a plus factor to the economic national security of the United States,” Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told reporters on a conference call. “We believe in America.” Toyota and other automakers have been lobbying heavily to block any new tariffs on imported vehicles. Toyota said it will invest $288 million in Alabama to increase annual engine capacity from 670,000 to 900,000 by the end of 2021 and will add new 4-cylinder and V6 engine lines. It will also invest $238 million in a Kentucky plant to build hybrid versions of the Toyota RAV4 and Lexus ES 300h. Toyota announced last year it would jointly build a new $1.6 billion plant with Mazda Motor Corp in Alabama. Toyota said it will exceed a 2017 pledge to invest $10 billion over five years with a new commitment to reach nearly $13 billion over the same period, including Thursday’s announcement. Toyota President Akio Toyoda will be in Washington Friday to deliver a speech in which he is expected to tout the new investments. Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a “Section 232” national security report to Trump with recommendations that auto industry officials expect to include at least some tariffs on fully assembled vehicles or on technologies and components related to electric, automated, connected and shared vehicles. Lentz told reporters the automaker is eager to find out the findings, including for the 137,000 Americans he said design, build or sell Toyota vehicles in the United States. “They deserve to know if they’re a security threat,” he said. “Consumers need to know because they need to understand if their costs for every vehicle they purchase ... is going to go up.” Lentz said the new trade deal the Trump administration has negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement had played a role in the new investment decisions, but he did not elaborate on how significant that role was."

The rover “will be an important element supporting human lunar exploration, which we envision will take place in the 2030s”, JAXA Vice President Koichi Wakata told a symposium in Tokyo. “We aim to launch such a rover into space in 2029.” The rover is still in the conceptual stage, but an illustration in the news release showed a six-wheel vehicle that somewhat resembled an armored personnel carrier. A spokesman for Toyota, which plans to ramp up fuel-cell cars as a zero-emission alternative to gasoline vehicles, said the project would give the company a chance to test its technologies in the moon’s harsh environment and improve them. Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi stressed the excitement that comes with taking part in a space project. “As an engineer, there is no greater joy than being able to participate in a lunar project by way of Toyota’s car-making,” Terashi told the symposium. “Being allowed to be a member of ‘Team Japan’, we would like to take up the challenge of space,” he said."

A report here released by Global Automakers Canada (GAC) said passenger car sales dropped 16 percent, while sales of trucks rose 1.2 percent, with the heavy goods vehicles representing nearly 75 percent of all sales in the month. The results were not unexpected said GAC President David Adams in a statement, adding that both January and February last year were very strong in terms of sales. “Also, when you factor in the significant snow and weather events that have occurred over the month of February across the country, the results are actually pretty good.” Separately, General Motors Co said its total vehicle sales in Canada fell 9 percent to 16,350 vehicles in February. Ford Motor Co’s Canada division reported total car sales of 2,057 and truck sales of 16,2014 in February, while total auto sales for Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp in Canada rose 1.4 percent in the same period with 13,419 units sold, according to the GAC report. Total February auto sales for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , which is among the top four carmakers in Canada, fell 2 percent to 18,461 vehicles. Sales dropped 11 percent for its brand Jeep. The company’s sales in the United States also dipped 2 percent, hurt by weak demand for Fiat 500 small city cars and Jeep Compass sport utility vehicles. General Motors and Ford Motor, the top two U.S. automakers, have stopped reporting monthly auto sales numbers. Toyota Motor reported a 5.2 percent drop in U.S. sales to 172,748 vehicles due to declines in its flagship Camry sedan as well as its Tundra pickup trucks and Sienna minivans."

Industry consultant J.D. Power’s closely watched study measures the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles during the past 12 months by original owners of 2016 model-year vehicles, with a lower score reflecting higher quality and dependability. Lexus had a score of 106 problems per hundred, the 2019 U.S. vehicle dependability study showed. Porsche and Toyota ranked second, with a score of 108 each. Overall, the study showed a 4 percent improvement in vehicle dependability from 2018. “Vehicles are more reliable than ever, but automakers are wrestling with problems such as voice recognition, transmission shifts and battery failures,” said Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power. Chrysler, which was at the bottom of the survey that covered 31 brands in 2018, improved its ranking in 2019 to 16, but Fiat slipped by two ranks to the last position.

1.5943824470619736," China sales buoy Toyota's profit, but U.S. weakness persists TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s quarterly profit edged up as demand for its bread-and-butter car models from cost-conscious Chinese buyers helped offset bleak North American sales, although the firm’s shares slipped as it cut its annual net income outlook. Japan’s biggest automaker attributed the smaller forecast to unrealised losses from equity investments, but, in an indication that business was still strong, it kept its full-year operating profit view unchanged at 2.4 trillion yen ($22 billion). The automaker posted Asian sales of 464,000 units in the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, as strong demand in China for its cheap-and-cheerful Corolla and Levin sedans continued into the end of 2018. Popularity of its luxury Lexus brand also helped it buck a broader slowdown in the world’s biggest auto market. Toyota’s global sales rose 2.8 percent to 2.71 million units with Asia making up for the slack in North America, where its sales slid 7.5 percent to 680,000 units. “When one region is underperforming, other regions can compensate for that weakness. Likewise, when some vehicle models are underperforming, other models can compensate,” Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told reporters at a briefing. “It’s a work in process, but as we diversify our markets and our models, little by little we’re starting to see this happen.” Toyota shares dropped as much as 1.5 percent on Wednesday, but recovered slightly to end down 0.7 percent in a broader market that was mostly steady. (For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit, vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2Ro1enH) Toyota has been hit hard in the United States by slowing sales of its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry, as well as by its steep discounting to boost sales over the past two years as overall demand stagnates. In contrast, the Corolla, Levin and Camry were Toyota’s top three selling models in China in 2018, outselling larger ones like the RAV4 SUV crossover, as buyers reined in expenses amid an economic slowdown exacerbated by a Sino-U.S. trade war. (For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' vehicle sales in the U.S., China, see tmsnrt.rs/2RjnBuA) Toyota sold 1.47 million vehicles in China in 2018, up 14 percent, and aims to lift sales to 1.6 million this year, even as it and other automakers brace for another tough year there. Auto sales in China last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s, hurt by the phasing out of purchase tax cuts on smaller cars and the trade war. The world’s No.2 economy grew at its slowest in almost three decades in 2018, and the pace is expected to weaken further this year. But Japanese automakers, such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, are expected to benefit from warming political ties between Tokyo and Beijing at a time when the Sino-U.S. trade war is weighing on rivals such as Ford. However, niche players such as Japan’s Mazda Motor have not been able to escape the broader China weakness. Mazda’s China sales sank 36 percent to 62,000 units in the third quarter, due partly to bleak sales of its Axela sedan that is priced slightly above than sold by many of its competitors. Mazda’s global sales fell 7 percent, but the lower-volume automaker still raised its annual earnings view as its quarterly operating profit dropped less than expected. (For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' annual global vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2RnFOr2) Toyota cut its full-year net profit forecast by about 19 percent to 1.87 trillion yen. It did not say which investments hit its net profit, but it is a major shareholder in Subaru, whose shares tumbled more than 30 percent in 2018, and Akebono Brake Industry, whose shares tanked 40 percent. Toyota booked an operating profit of 676.1 billion yen for the third quarter, slightly below the market’s average estimate of 680.8 billion, according to Refinitiv, but up 0.4 percent from a year earlier.

0.6102522276606636," Toyota reports fall in U.S. auto sales in January (This Feb 1 story corrects headline to say only Toyota’s sales fell in January, not Fiat’s) (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday reported a 6.6 percent fall in U.S. vehicle sales for January, hurt by lower demand for its Camry and Prius cars. The No.3 automaker in the United States by sales said it sold 156,021 vehicles in January, down from 167,056 vehicles a year earlier. Camry sales fell 3.4 percent, while Prius sales slumped 57 percent, the company said. Auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast January auto sales to decline about 1 percent from the same month in 2018, partly due to uncertainty over the recent government shutdown. The auto consultants also forecast total light vehicle sales this year to fall 1.9 percent to about 17 million units, compared with 2018. However, major automakers are bullish about 2019 sales even as economists warned that rising interest rates may discourage consumers from buying cars this year. General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , the two big automakers that together commanded a 32 percent market share in 2018, have stopped reporting monthly sales numbers, opting to report on a quarterly basis. Bloomberg, however, reported late on Friday that Ford’s sales rose 7 percent, while GM’s fell 7 percent in January, citing people familiar with the matter. GM declined to comment, while Ford was unavailable for comment. Smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reported a 2 percent rise in U.S. auto sales for January, helped by higher demand for its Ram pickup trucks and said it expects strong sales in 2019. “In spite of some frigid January weather, we remain bullish on 2019 given the continued underlying strength of the U.S. economy,” Reid Bigland, Fiat’s U.S. head of sales, said. Fiat said it sold 136,082 vehicles last month, compared with 132,803 units for the same period a year earlier. Sales of Ram pickup trucks surged 24 percent to 39,649 vehicles in January, compared with the same period a year earlier."

According to a report here by Global Automakers Canada (GAC) released on Friday, passenger car sales fell 13.7 percent, while truck sales were down 4.9 percent. Auto sales in Canada has been steadily falling as rising interest rates have dampened appetite of buyers. However, the Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady in January while signaling that more increases would be necessary. Canada’s central bank had raised interest rate five times since July 2017 to tackle rising inflation. “We’ve known for some time the sales are slowing down, last year was evidence of that, but the sky is not falling - January’s sales were still above the average for the last 5 years of sales for January,” David Adams, president of GAC, said in a statement. In January, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reported about a 20 percent fall in total auto sales, while Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp’s Canadian division reported a 14.1 percent rise in sales to 14,245 units. Fiat, which is among the top four carmakers in Canada, sold 14,191 vehicles in the month, where demand for its Ram brand was offset by drop in sales in Jeep and Dodge brands. Earlier in the day, Toyota, the No.3 automaker in the United States, reported a 6.6 percent fall in U.S. vehicle sales, hurt by lower demand for its Camry and Prius cars.

0.4551340990317414," Japan's Akebono Brake seeking capital from Toyota, debt relief TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Akebono Brake Industry Co Ltd is seeking a capital infusion from top shareholder Toyota Motor Corp and a moratorium on debt repayment as part of a revival plan, sending its shares tumbling by a quarter on Wednesday. The brake maker, a supplier to automakers including General Motors Co which makes up about a quarter of Akebono’s sales, said in a statement it has filed for assistance with a government-certified third-party body which had been accepted. Akebono, whose troubled U.S. business has hit its earnings, said it was confident its operations would be turned around under an out-of-court scheme and that it will present a revival plan to lenders at a meeting next month. The Nikkei first reported Akebono’s move to seek capital from Toyota and a debt moratorium. A spokeswoman for Akebono told Reuters that “the content written in Nikkei is true”. “We are not facing any financing issues at the moment, but we will prepare to seek assistance from our main lenders should such a situation arise,” the company said in a statement, which did not make mention of Toyota. Toyota, which owned 11.6 percent of Akebono as of September, said in a statement it has not received a request from the brake maker for capital assistance. Founded in 1929, Akebono manufactures brakes and brake pads for passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, rolling and industrial machinery. It operates plants in Japan, North America, Europe and Asia and generates roughly half of its sales from North America, its biggest market. Besides General Motors, it also supplies Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and other major automakers. Akebono’s latest financial woes date back to around 2014, when the company was struggling to fill a surge in orders from customers in the United States, where vehicle sales were climbing to record highs. The scramble to manufacture more products beyond its production capabilities resulted in additional manufacturing costs, including labor and shipping costs, leading to a three-year run of operating losses in North America to the 2016 financial year. Years of production issues have taken also led to a slump in sales in the region, as Akebono has failed to secure orders for new models from U.S. automakers. Akebono’s shares fell as much as 26 percent on Wednesday to 158 yen, their lowest in 17 years. The shares had slid more than 40 percent in 2018."

Toyota sold 1.47 million vehicles in China last year, up 14.3 percent from 2017. Toyota’s forecast comes at a time when automakers in China in general are bracing for a tough year after weakness in sales emerged last year. China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) this month said it expects sales to show no growth, forecasting flat sales of 28.1 million vehicles for 2019. Other government and industry bodies see a 0-2 percent growth in overall demand. China’s automotive market last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s. Despite the slowdown in the overall market, sales by Japanese companies especially Toyota remain strong. Last year China and Japan pledged to forge closer ties during a three-day visit in October to Beijing by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, signing a broad range of agreements including a $30 billion currency swap pact, amid rising trade tensions with Washington. During Abe’s visit Chinese President Xi Jinping said bilateral ties had returned to the right track and China would ensure that the positive momentum continues, state media reported."

Toyota will own 51 percent of the joint venture, and Panasonic the rest, the two companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday, confirming previous reports. The joint venture, which builds on an initial lithium-ion battery partnership struck between the two companies in late 2017, reflects the aim of the Japanese companies to become a bigger global player in the battery industry, which is vital for the development of affordable EVs. The two companies will pool part of existing battery-related equipment and engineers to the joint venture. Panasonic will also transfer its manufacturing capabilities in Japan and China for its thin, rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries. The two companies will transfer a total of 3,500 employees. Batteries produced by the joint venture will be sold to various automakers. The capital size of the venture has not been decided yet, the two companies said. While Panasonic is one of the world’s biggest EV battery suppliers, it is facing rising competition from South Korean makers Samsung SDI Co and LG Chem, and CATL of China. Panasonic is currently Tesla Inc’s exclusive battery cell supplier, but Reuters reported that the U.S. EV maker has been in discussions with other companies including China’s Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai car factory. Toyota and Panasonic already operate a joint venture called Prime Earth EV Energy, which manufactures batteries mainly used in gasoline hybrid vehicles. The new joint venture also shows that Toyota is expanding further into development and production of EV batteries just as many rivals have been stepping away from their development due to the heavy costs involved."

However, the Japanese automaker, which commands about a third of the Thai vehicle market, predicts its own sales in the Southeast Asian country to rise 4.7 percent from last year to 330,000 cars, Toyota Motor Thailand’s President Michinobu Sugata told a news conference on Tuesday. In 2018, Toyota’s Thai auto sales jumped 31 percent to 315,113 cars. This year’s sales will be helped by the launch of new models and plans to drive domestic sales, Sugata said. Known as the “Detroit of Southeast Asia”, Thailand is a regional production and export hub for some of the world’s top carmakers, including Toyota and Honda Motor. “We expect that the Thai automotive industry will maintain the 1 million unit level as long as the current favourable conditions continue in Thailand, such as government spending to stimulate investment from the private sector and the introduction of new models by various car makers,” Sugata said. The sector accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s GDP and employs a tenth of its workforce in manufacturing. Last week, Mazda Motor’s Thai unit said it was targeting a 5-10 percent rise in its sales this year, after surging 37 percent last year. The anticipated slower domestic sales come at a time when car exports are also falling due to weaker demand from the Middle East, America, and Australia and Oceania. Thailand’s auto sector, which reported strong sales over the past two years, has been a bright spot in an economy hurt by falling electronics exports amid U.S.-China trade tensions and fewer Chinese visitors since a tourist boat accident last year. However, the country’s elevated household debt and its first interest rate hike in more than seven years point to fewer car sales this year. Some analysts think the central bank may raise its policy rate further this year, which would hurt consumption at a time of slowing economic growth. The central bank expects Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy to grow 4 percent this year after an estimated 4.2 percent for 2018. Still, automakers may use Thailand to manufacture cars for export, as they plan production cuts in China due to declining demand in the world’s biggest car market. However, Toyota has made no decision on this matter, Sugata said."

Automakers are adding about 10 million vehicle inflators in the United States to what was already the largest-ever recall campaign in history. Last week, Ford Motor Co said it was recalling 953,000 vehicles worldwide for Takata inflators. Previously, 37 million U.S. vehicles with 50 million inflators were recalled and 16.7 million inflators remain to be replaced. At least 23 deaths worldwide have been linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators, including 15 in the United States. Toyota’s new recall relates to vehicles from the 2010 through 2015 model years, and includes 1.3 million vehicles in the United States. More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that could explode, spraying metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In total, 19 automakers are recalling more than 100 million potentially faulty inflators worldwide. To date, 21 deaths have been reported in Honda Motor Co 7267.T vehicles and two in Ford vehicles. Both automakers have urged some drivers of older vehicles not to drive them until the inflators are replaced. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017. In April, auto components maker Key Safety Systems completed a $1.6 billion deal to acquire Takata. The merged company, known as Joyson Safety Systems, is a subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp 600699.SS.

Overall sales for December fell to 114,289 units, according to a report here by Global Automakers Canada (GAC). Auto sales in Canada has been on the decline as buyers continue to feel the pinch from rising interest rates. However, the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged in December last year, after raising interest rate five times since July 2017 to tackle inflation. “Given all of the political and economic turbulence – combined with interest rate increases – it is difficult to classify the 2018 as disappointing from a sales perspective,” said David Adams, President of Global Automakers of Canada in a statement. Separately, research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants said passenger car sales and light truck sales in Canada declined by 12.1 percent and 6.5 percent respectively. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reported a 32 percent drop in total December auto sales in Canada. Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp reported a 8.9 percent jump in the same period with 14,153 units sold, according to the GAC report. The country’s biggest carmaker General Motors Co reported total sales of 13,855 vehicles, including 10,691 retail and 3,164 fleet deliveries, in December. Earlier in the day, top U.S. automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor Co reported a dip in auto sales for the month of December, however remained bullish on pickups in 2019 sales.

2.9511829741251496," Toyota optimistic amid China slowdown as Lexus sales grow TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Tuesday said it sees room to expand in China as growing sales of its luxury brand Lexus help it buck an emerging trend of slowing demand which has hit profit at some of its global rivals. Japan’s biggest automaker also raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 4.3 percent, saying improved marketing pushed up sales in China, Europe and elsewhere, while a weaker yen will have a bigger positive impact. Growing demand for Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand has boosted China sales in the past year. Import tariff cuts from July have also supported Lexus models, which are shipped from Japan - though Toyota is considering producing them locally, Reuters reported last month. That demand has helped the automaker weather the market’s steepest sales drop in nearly seven years in September amid a broader slowdown in economic growth. “Even if there is uncertainty in China, potentially the market will grow in the longer term,” Didier Leroy, Toyota’s chief competitive officer, said at briefing. “Lexus is growing in China but if you compare it with other brands we still have a small brand ... That means that we have a lot of room to improve and Lexus has strong potential in China.” Toyota sold about 1.3 million vehicles in China in 2017 and has a market share of 5 percent, much smaller than General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. Leroy said region-specific marketing and a diverse product offering has helped Toyota sales, which jumped 20 percent in July-September. Toyota now expects full-year profit of 2.4 trillion yen ($21.18 billion) - flat versus the year prior - based on the yen averaging around 110 yen to the U.S. dollar JPY= through March rather than 106 yen in its previous forecast. The upgrade comes after a 1.9 percent rise in global sales in July-September helped operating profit rise 11 percent to mark Toyota’s strongest second-quarter performance since 2015. Higher sales in China helped lift Asia sales by 9.2 percent, while sales rose 4.8 percent in Europe. Sales in North America eased slightly, but less discounting lifted regional operating profit by 12.6 percent. (Click here for an interactive graph on Toyota's quarterly operating profit: tmsnrt.rs/2RF14bW) Toyota and domestic rivals face the possible need to increase investment in North America, as Japan’s auto industry considers ways to raise localised production following an updated trade pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Toyota Motor surged 2.1 percent after the company raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 4.3 percent to 2.4 trillion yen from the previously 2.3 trillion yen and said it would buy back up to 250 billion yen of its own shares. The Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to 22,147.75, recouping much of Monday’s 1.6 percent drop. With potentially market-moving U.S. mid-term elections scheduled later in the day, investors stayed cautious. The Nikkei moved in a narrow 167-point range. “There were more investors going long today than going short as most of them wanted to buy back from recent selling,” said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. “Unless the election result defies market expectations, stocks are expected to rise.” Opinion polls show a strong chance that the Democratic Party could win control of the House of Representatives in the U.S. mid-term elections later in the day, after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington. President Donald Trump’s Republican Party is seen as likely to keep the Senate. Buying was particularly strong in recently beaten-down stocks, with 32 of the Topix’s 33 subsectors in positive territory. Automakers gained ground, with Honda Motor advancing 3.1 percent and Nissan Motor gaining 1.6 percent. SoftBank Group Corp, which booked strong earnings for July-September, pulled back 2.0 percent after soaring as much as 4 percent in early trade. It posted an operating profit of 705.7 billion yen ($6.23 billion), helped by higher valuations on high-tech bets from its Saudi-backed Vision Fund, compared with 395.6 billion yen a year earlier under different accounting standards. However, traders said there was uncertainty about the Vision Fund’s future amid a global outcry over the killing of a prominent journalist by Saudi Arabian security personnel. Apple suppliers were sold after the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday evening that Apple Inc had told its smartphone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR it launched last month. Japan Display Inc dropped 3.7 percent, TDK Corp shed 1.9 percent and Nitto Denko Corp dropped 2.5 percent. The broader Topix gained 1.2 percent to 1,659.35.

7.126338329764447," Toyota, SoftBank in first-ever alliance, target self-driving car services (This October 4 story corrects paragraph 17 to show Toyota has partnership, not investment, in Didi Chuxing.) TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T are teaming up to develop self-driving car services, signaling deepening alliances between top automakers and tech firms as the global race to develop autonomous cars intensifies. Japan’s biggest automaker and its most influential tech firm will jointly develop a platform to operate self-driving vehicles which can be used as mobile shops, hospitals and other services as they envision a future in which fewer people drive their own vehicles. The tie-up shows that even big, well-funded firms want to share costs and expertise in pursuing promising but risky automotive technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance. The joint venture will start small with initial capital of 2 billion yen ($17.5 million). SoftBank will own just over half of the business, which will initially focus on Japan and eventually go global. “SoftBank alone and automakers alone can’t do everything,” said Junichi Miyakawa, chief technology officer at SoftBank Corp who will be CEO of the new company. “We want to work to help people with limited access to transportation.” The partnership will see Toyota and SoftBank work together to develop the automaker’s multi-purpose mobility service based on its “e-Palette” concept announced earlier this year, in which Toyota plans to produce the hardware and software for convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels. The joint company will be called MONET, short for mobility network, and will roll out an autonomous driving service using e-Palette by the second half of the 2020s, the companies said. SoftBank will provide technology to collect and analyze transportation data to ensure cars are efficiently dispatched when and where they’re needed, they said. “Toyota is hoping to increase its revenues by combining its own data with the data and expertise which SoftBank has culled from its mobile phone operations,” said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities. “The new company will enable SoftBank to widen its partner network, and it could be hoping to take a lead in developing platforms (for new transport services).” A slew of automotive technology-related deals and discussions have already resulted in myriad pairings between global automakers, ride-hailing companies and major tech firms. Honda Motor 7267.T said on Wednesday it would invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, in which SoftBank is also an investor. On the same day, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Renault SA RENA.PA said they may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services. The partnership between the two Japanese companies reflects SoftBank’s growing influence in the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, which has been accelerated by its investments via the almost $100 billion Vision Fund. It is also a vote of confidence from SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has been critical of Japan for lagging overseas rivals, in Toyota’s vision for the future of cars. “He has an image of the future,” Son told a media briefing, referring to Toyota President Akio Toyoda. “Automobiles are becoming a cluster of semiconductors, not screws, bolts and nuts.” While both firms have been independently developing technologies for self-driving vehicles and car sharing, and each have investments in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and Grab, this is first time they have come together. SoftBank is also an investor in Didi Chuxing, while Toyota has a partnership with the Chinese ride-sharing company. Toyota Executive Vice-president Shigeki Tomoyama said the partnership came after SoftBank’s widespread presence in the ride-hailing industry became apparent - it holds major stakes in the ride-hailing firms it had invested in and played a consolidating role in that industry. Toyoda joked about rumors that the two companies did not get along, and recalled rejecting a business proposition from Son 20 years ago, when SoftBank had yet to make its name as one of the world’s largest technology investors. “We are trying to take traditional car making into new fields,” he told reporters. “We realized that SoftBank shares the same vision when it comes to the future of cars, so it’s time that we partner together.”"

-1.4567876543209906," Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, long opposed to producing its premium Lexus cars in China because of concerns over quality and profitability, is now considering it to ignite growth and narrow sales gaps with its German rivals, four company insiders told Reuters. The company, which imports Lexus models made in Japan to sell in China, has spent the last two years researching how to produce them locally. Toyota also talked to its Chinese joint-venture partners – Guangzhou Automobile Group Co and FAW Group - last year about Lexus models. It wasn’t clear whether Toyota approached the Chinese companies about a partnership or vice versa. Local production would be a major shift for the world’s largest automaker, encouraged by improved China-Japan ties, as well as new Chinese investment rules that might allow foreign automakers to fully own or majority-control China operations. “We’re torn over this,” said one of the insiders. “But it makes little sense to let this opportunity slip by,” another told Reuters. All four insiders declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. China’s planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms’ access to the world’s second-largest economy. The rule changes - affecting electric carmakers this year and others by 2022 - led Tesla Inc to gain Beijing’s approval for a wholly-owned China manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai. That marked the first time a foreign carmaker established itself in China without a partner. Toyota already produces numerous Toyota-brand models, including the Camry, Highlander, Corolla, Levin and Crown, in China with partners. Last year it sold 1.29 million cars there, including imported Lexuses. Toyota had contemplated moving Lexus production to China before - as far back as 2011-12, according to one of the four insiders. But it had until now considered a potential erosion of quality too much of a risk, and didn’t want to sacrifice the brand’s relatively high margins by sharing profits with a local partner. Two of the Toyota insiders said the automaker had identified specific scenarios for localizing Lexus. “All the preparation has been more or less completed,” one said. “All we’re waiting is a ‘go’ from management.” Toyota’s preferred option is to own all or most of a localized Lexus unit, which it could do immediately by building only electric cars. (Lexus has plans for electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid versions of existing models.) But China might not let another brand in when the market has slowed down significantly, with sales of some foreign vehicles, including Groupe PSA, Ford and Hyundai, all falling in the gutter in recent months. “You’d still need a good political follow-wind to execute this,” one of the sources said, pointing to help from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has a state visit to China planned for this month. Even as other premium brands - such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac - have opened assembly plants in China to gain market share, Toyota has resisted. That reluctance reflects the company’s unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States. Opponents inside Toyota also point to China’s lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses. They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea. A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said “the most important task” for Lexus is to become a distinguished brand in China. “We always weigh the need for localizing production as part of the consideration for the Lexus brand’s future in China,” he said. “But at this point in time, we don’t have any specific plans for producing Lexus cars in China.” Nonetheless, support for localization is growing among Toyota leaders. China has typically been a difficult market for Japanese companies, but there is new optimism, especially after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May. During his visit, Li toured Toyota facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, escorted by the company’s family scion and chief executive, Akio Toyoda. Toyoda has since sought to boost his company’s presence in China, including an effort to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, and share more technologies with Chinese companies. China has also proposed limiting new production capacity for automakers, adding an incentive for Toyota to move quickly if it wants to build Lexus models there. Nissan Motor Co and Toyota have each recently revealed plans to boost capacity, much of which will be used to produce electric cars. Alan Kang, a Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive, thinks localizing production is exactly what Lexus needs to start narrowing the big sales gap with German premium brands. Mercedes-Benz, for example, last year sold about 610,000 vehicles, compared to 130,000 for Lexus during the same year, according to LMC. “If Lexus doesn’t want to remain a niche, it needs to start investing more,” Kang said."

0.40861074730837965," Death toll from Japan quake hits 44, power supply, Toyota output disrupted TOKYO (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake in northern Japan last week rose to 44, with 660 injured, the government said on Monday, as electricity supply remained short and top automaker Toyota suspended work at most of its assembly plants. The pre-dawn, 6.7-magnitude quake on Thursday temporarily paralyzed the island of Hokkaido, cutting off access by air and train and knocking out power to an island the size of Austria. About 2,500 people remain in evacuation centers, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, after landslides buried houses and rain at the weekend loosened soil in a further threat to unstable houses. Yoshihide Suga, the top government spokesman, said a team of about 40,000 Self-Defense Force troops, police, firefighters and others were working on clearing debris and other clean-up operations. There were no more missing residents, he said. Power supply has been restored to nearly all customers in Hokkaido but trade minister Hiroshige Seko called on the island’s businesses and 5.3 million residents to use about 20 percent less energy to prevent further blackouts. “It’s very important now for all residents, businesses, the government, and electricity suppliers to work together towards this goal of 20 percent energy-saving,” Seko told a news conference late on Sunday. The government has no plans for rolling blackouts on Monday and Tuesday despite the continued closure of a fossil fuel-fired power plant that supplies about half the island’s power, he said. With electricity restored, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday its parts factory in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, which builds transmissions and other components, was preparing to resume production during the night shift. However, the fallout has already spread beyond the island, with Toyota suspending production at 16 of its 18 domestic car assembly plants on Monday to assess its parts inventory.

1.3645061758131813," Toyota says in talks with Geely on cooperation in hybrid vehicle tech BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is in talks with Chinese automaker Geely about cooperation in gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle technology, but nothing has been decided on the matter. The move comes as Japan’s biggest automaker has been increasingly embracing new automotive technologies for future growth, and has also embarked on a strategy to ramp up sales in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Toyota said in a statement to Reuters that it and Geely are currently “communicating with each other” about gasoline-electric hybrid technology. It was not immediately clear in what aspects of the hybrid technology Geely and Toyota are discussing cooperating. A person familiar with the matter, however, said that the talks apparently involve a Chinese supplier of electric battery technology both companies have already been associated with but separately. Toyota declined to comment on the specifics of the cooperation. “Toyota has been conducting the business with the open policy which also applies to the area of electrification technologies. The relationship with Geely (Toyota is exploring) is also based on this open policy,” the statement said. Toyota’s response comes after a Chinese media report said Geely was working with Toyota on the conventional hybrid technology. The report said details on the joint effort would be announced soon. A Geely spokesman declined to comment. Toyota, which bet big on gasoline-electric hybrid technology in the late 1990s when it began selling the Prius hybrid, has since localized production of conventional hybrid cars in China and has been selling them here since 2015 under the Corolla and Levin names. The company has said it plans to sell plug-in hybrid versions of the Corolla and the Levin next year."

1.1289125829757376," Toyota plans to recall 1 million hybrid models over wiring issue TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it planned to recall around 1.03 million vehicles, including its gasoline-hybrid Prius model, in Japan, North America, Europe and other regions due to an issue with the engine wire harness which can pose a fire risk. Following a domestic recall announcement by Japan’s transport ministry, Toyota said that in affected vehicles, the wire harness which connects to the hybrid power control unit can come into contact with the covering at the connection point. If dust accumulates on the wire harness or the cover, the insulation on the wires could wear down over time due to vehicle vibrations. This could cause an electrical short circuit, which could generate heat and lead to a risk of fire, Toyota said. The issue affects vehicles produced in Japan between June 2015 and May 2018, and includes the plug-in version of the Prius and the C-HR compact crossover SUV sold in Japan, Europe, Australia and other countries. Roughly half of the recalls would take place in Japan, Toyota spokesman Jean-Yves Jault said. Only the Prius model would be recalled in the United States, where around 192,000 vehicles were affected. he said. Jault added that the issue had led to one incident of a short circuiting in Japan which produced smoke from the vehicle."

-4.471292646580808," Toyota to invest $500 million in Uber for self-driving cars (In this August 27 story corrects Uber’s stated valuation to $76 billion instead of $72 billion in paragraph 5 after official correction from Uber) (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will invest $500 million in Uber Technologies Inc to jointly work on developing self-driving cars, the companies said on Monday, a bid by both to catch up to rivals in the hotly competitive autonomous driving business. Toyota, one of the world’s largest carmakers, and Uber [UBER.UL], the leading ride-hailing service, are widely seen as lagging the competition in developing self-driving cars. Their deal deepens an existing relationship and reflects CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s strategy of Uber developing autonomous vehicles through partnerships, rather than on its own. The deal also breathes new life into Uber’s self-driving business. Since a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March, Uber has removed its robot cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its autonomous testing hub. The investment values Uber at $76 billion, a step up from the $72 billion valuation Uber received in a deal with Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O self-driving unit Waymo this year. Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota’s Guardian technology, which offers automated safety features such as lane-keeping but does not enable a vehicle to drive completely autonomously. The combined technology will be built into Toyota’s Sienna minivans, to be deployed on Uber’s ride-hailing network starting in 2021, Uber said. The companies’ aim is to solve the enormously challenging problem of how to mass produce self-driving cars for shared fleets, including ride-hailing services. Jeff Miller, Uber’s head of business development for strategic initiatives, said the partnership “really paints the picture of how we envision deploying autonomous technology in the long term.” That includes licensing its autonomous technology to carmakers and enlisting a third party to own and maintain the fleet. The third party that will operate the Toyota autonomous fleet has not yet been chosen, Miller said. For the Japanese automaker, the “agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies,” its executive vice president Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement. Toyota has been less aggressive than some rivals on moving toward full-fledged autonomous driving, expressing caution about the technology and focusing on partial autonomous systems like Guardian. But it has invested in research and plans to begin testing self-driving electric cars around 2020. A Toyota official said the company would continue its research into self-driving technology, and that it would not combine its research efforts with Uber. Uber has admitted its technology lags Waymo, and the crash in Arizona was a further setback in development and testing. The Toyota partnership puts pressure on Uber to resume testing on public roads, but the company has run up against regulators and politicians with safety concerns. Miller said Uber plans to have autonomous cars back on public streets by the end of the year. Khosrowshahi, who took over Uber a year ago, has recently explored options that include more partnerships as well as a potential sale of the self-driving business, separate sources have told Reuters. The self-driving unit is a significant contributor to Uber’s losses, which in the second quarter were $891 million. Uber has a deal to buy cars from Volvo, outfit them with Uber’s technology and maintain them, a more labor-intensive project than the Toyota plans. The company also has a partnership with Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, in which the carmaker proposes to put its own self-driving cars in Uber's ride-hailing network. Khosrowshahi’s partnership strategy is a shift. Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick had insisted on developing a proprietary self-driving system and called autonomous cars “existential” to Uber. Previously, Uber and Toyota partnered on an electric mobility project. Two years ago, Toyota invested an undisclosed sum in Uber and the two companies partnered on a car-leasing program for Uber drivers. Uber has since shuttered its U.S. leasing business."

-4.980532162398866," Texas jury finds Toyota negligent in accident, awards $242 million to family (Reuters) - A Texas jury awarded damages of $242 million to a Dallas family after finding that defects in the family’s Lexus sedan caused injuries to their two children during a rear-end collision, the law firm representing the plaintiffs said on Friday. The verdict by the jury in Dallas County District Court includes more than $143.6 million in punitive damages after jurors agreed that the actions of Lexus-maker Toyota Motor Corp and Toyota Motor Sales amounted to gross negligence, the Law Offices of Frank L. Branson said in a statement. The collision involving the family’s 2002 Lexus ES 300 sedan occurred in September 2016. The 3-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter of Benjamin and Kristi Reavis were in the car’s back seat, in child safety seats, the statement said. The jury found that the sedan’s front seats “were unreasonably dangerous and the defendants failed to warn about those dangers,” the statement said. “The automaker made a conscious decision to protect front-seat occupants from crash injuries like whiplash at the expense of rear-seat passengers,” attorney Frank Branson said in the statement. Toyota said it would consider its options going forward. “While we respect the jury’s decision, we remain confident that the injuries sustained were the result of factors specific to this very severe collision, not a defect in the design or manufacturing of the 2002 Lexus ES300,” a Toyota spokesman said in an emailed statement."
-5.126541248592975," Toyota to increase production capacity in China by 20 percent: source BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will build additional capacity at its auto plant in China's Guangzhou, a company source said, in addition to beefing up production at a factory in Tianjin city by 120,000 vehicles a year. A person close to the company said Toyota will build capacity at the production hub in the south China city of Guangzhou to also produce an additional 120,000 vehicles a year, an increase of 24 percent over current capacity. All together, between the eastern port city of Tianjin and Guangzhou, Toyota will boost its overall manufacturing capacity by 240,000 vehicles a year, or by about 20 percent. Toyota’s production capacity in China is 1.16 million vehicles a year. Reuters reported earlier this week that Toyota plans to build additional capacity in Tianjin to produce 10,000 all-electric battery cars and 110,000 plug-in hybrid electric cars a year. China has said it would remove foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018, for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020, and the wider car market by 2022. Beijing also has been pushing automakers to produce and sell more electric vehicles through purchase subsidies and production quotas for such green cars. Toyota’s planned additional capacity in Guangzhou is also for electrified vehicles, said the company source, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the matter. The source did not say how much the additional capacity would cost. The Tianjin expansion is likely to cost $257 million, according to a government website. The planned capacity expansions in Guangzhou and Tianjin are part of a medium-term strategy of the Japanese automaker that aims to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, a jump of over 50 percent, by the early 2020s, according to four company insiders with knowledge of the matter. The plans signal Toyota’s willingness to start adding significant manufacturing capacity in China with the possibility of one or two new assembly plants in the world’s biggest auto market, the sources said. Car imports could also increase, they said. In addition to boosting manufacturing capacity, Toyota also plans to significantly expand its sales networks and focus more on electric car technologies as part of the strategy, the sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media."
-4.724668381807295," Exclusive: In Chinese port city, Japan's Toyota lays foundation to ramp up sales BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is likely to make 120,000 more cars a year in the Chinese port city of Tianjin as part of a medium-term strategy that’s gathering pace as China-Japan ties improve, said four company insiders with knowledge of the matter. The Japanese auto maker’s plan to boost annual production capacity by about a quarter in the port city will lay the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, a jump of over 50 percent, the four sources said. The Tianjin expansion signals Toyota’s willingness to start adding significant manufacturing capacity in China with the possibility of one or two new assembly plants in the world’s biggest auto market, the sources said. Car imports could also increase, they said. The move comes at a time when China’s trade outlook with the United States appears fraught and uncertain. Toyota plans to significantly expand its sales networks and focus more on electric car technologies as part of the strategy, the sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Toyota sold 1.29 million vehicles in China last year and while sales are projected at 1.4 million this year, “capacity constraints” have restricted stronger growth, the sources said. Toyota’s manufacturing hub in Tianjin currently has the capacity to produce 510,000 vehicles a year, while Toyota as a whole, between two joint ventures, has overall capacity to churn out 1.16 million vehicles a year. (GRAPHIC: Auto sales in China: tmsnrt.rs/2vHLtzS) Manufacturing capacity numbers provided by automakers are called straight-time capacity without overtime. With overtime, a given assembly plant can produce 20 to 30 percent more than its capacity. According to two Tianjin government websites last week, Toyota has been given regulatory approval by the municipal government’s Development and Reform Commission to pursue its expansion. The two websites - including the official website for the Tianjin development district where Toyota’s production hub is based - said the Japanese automaker plans to expand its Tianjin base to be able to manufacture 10,000 all-electric battery cars and 110,000 so-called plug-in electric hybrids annually. It wasn’t immediately clear when Toyota will be able to start producing those additional cars. A Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment. The Tianjin facilities, which produces cars such as the Toyota Corolla and Vios cars, are owned and operated by one of Toyota’s joint ventures in China. The venture with FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] in Tianjin plans to invest 1.76 billion yuan ($257 million) for the expansion, according to the two Tianjin websites. China is sometimes a market difficult to operate for Japanese companies because of historical reasons. In 2012, cars sold by Toyota and other Japanese automakers were battered when protests erupted across China after diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. Since then, Toyota has emphasized steady growth rather than taking on risky expansion projects. According to the four sources, Toyota’s attitude toward China began changing markedly after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May. During the visit, Li toured Toyota’s facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, and was escorted by Toyota’s family scion and chief executive Akio Toyoda. Toyoda has since sought to boost his company’s presence in China, a vision that had culminated in an active effort to identify specific ways to do just that, according to the four sources. They said aside from boosting capacity, Toyota is also looking at the possibility to significantly expand its distribution networks for the mainstream Toyota and premium Lexus brands. It wasn’t immediately clear how significant a distribution network expansion Toyota is planning for both brands. Currently, Toyota has more than 1,300 stores for the Toyota brand and nearly 190 for its Lexus luxury cars. The timing for the China expansion couldn’t be better. Earlier this year, Toyota was able to finally launch a couple of much anticipated, potentially high-volume subcompact sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) - two China-market versions of the Toyota C-HR crossover SUV which hit showrooms in the United States last year. The C-HR variants are relatively small crossover SUVs that other manufacturers, most notably Japan’s Honda Motor Co, have leveraged to grow sales rapidly and sell more cars in China than its much bigger rival Toyota. Honda sold 1.44 million vehicles in China last year. Lexus is also deemed likely to benefit from a windfall from growing trade tensions between China and the United States. In retaliation for U.S. trade actions, China raised tariffs on automobiles imported from the United States in early July to 40 percent, which, among other things, has forced Tesla Inc, BMW, as well as Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz to raise prices on certain U.S.-built vehicles, such as the hot-selling BMW X5 and X6 crossover sport-utility vehicles. One likely consequence for those brands is a sales fall, a profit squeeze, or both. By contrast, all Lexus cars Toyota sells in China are brought in from Japan and benefit from a much lower tariff rate of 15 percent levied on non-U.S. produced car imports."

-12.06397839914749," Facing U.S. tariff threat, Toyota warns car costs could rise TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said higher U.S. auto tariffs would ramp up the cost of vehicles produced locally along with those imported to the United States from Japan, which would have a ""big impact"" on its bottom line. Like its global rivals, Toyota is bracing for the possibility of a rise in U.S. auto import tariffs, which could cloud its outlook as it would raise the cost of selling vehicles in the world’s second-biggest vehicle market. Such uncertainty took the shine off strong quarterly results announced on Friday. So far, Japan’s biggest automakers and components suppliers said they have seen limited direct impact from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum implemented in June, but they acknowledge they could take a significant hit if Washington delivers on proposals to hike tariffs on autos and auto parts to 25 percent. “If we see a rise, it would raise the cost of locally produced vehicles by around $1,800 each, and increase costs for (models imported from Japan) by $6,000,” Toyota senior managing director Masayoshi Shirayanagi told reporters at a results briefing, referring to U.S.-made Camry sedans, one of the automaker’s most iconic models. “This would be a big impact.” The United States is a major market for Japan's automakers, where Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T locally produce around half or more of the cars they sell in the country. The remainder are imported from Japan, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere. Based on the roughly 709,000 vehicles Toyota exported to the United States from Japan in 2017, the automaker could take an annual tariff-related hit of $4.25 billion on those vehicles alone. Higher tariffs would deliver a major blow to all global automakers as most, including U.S. ones, rely on imports to source the vehicles and parts contained in them which are sold in the United States. Earlier this week, Denso Corp 6902.T, one of the world's biggest components suppliers, said U.S. auto tariffs, if implemented, could wipe up to $720 million off annual profit. Ford Motor Co F.N last week said tariffs in general could cost it up to $1.6 billion in 2018 in North America. Toyota has been a vocal opponent of tariffs, arguing that 25 percent would increase the cost of its U.S.-made Camry sedan by $1,800 and $2,800 for its Tundra pick-up truck. The automaker operates 10 production plants in the United States, and locally produces just under half of all the cars it sells in the country. Its share of localised production is lower than the 75 percent of Honda and 60 percent of Nissan. Detroit automakers Ford and General Motors Co (GM) GM.N as well as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MI lowered their full-year profit forecasts last week amid worries escalating tariffs would hurt sales and profit margins. Earlier on Friday, Toyota posted a 19 percent jump in April-June operating profit to 683 billion yen ($6 billion), beating estimates and marking its strongest quarterly performance in two-and-a-half years on the back of higher sales and cost reductions in Asia. Its global retail vehicle sales rose 1 percent to 2.6 million units in the quarter, boosted by a lift in Asia, where demand for the recently remodeled Camry helped to increase sales by 5.4 percent in China, the world’s biggest car market, during the first six months of 2018. In North America, Toyota’s biggest regional market, sales rose 3.2 percent due to a rise in demand for its pick-up trucks, including the Tacoma and Tundra. Still, profit in the region fell 29 percent as sales incentives continued to weigh. The automaker maintained its full-year profit forecast at 2.3 trillion yen, a decline of 4.2 percent, though it now expects the domestic currency to average 106 yen to the U.S. dollar, from an earlier forecast of 105 yen. Overall, Toyota still expects a stronger yen to offset the benefits of cost-cutting and record-high global vehicle sales in the year through March. Separately, Toyota and Isuzu Motors Ltd 7202.T on Friday said they would dissolve their capital tie-up given limited progress made in their development partnership focusing on diesel engines. As a result, Toyota said it would sell off its 5.8 percent stake in the Japanese truck maker."
-12.06397839914749," Japan weighs sovereign wealth fund for U.S infrastructure investment: Nikkei TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering creating a sovereign wealth fund to invest in U.S. infrastructure projects and U.S.-Japan joint projects in third countries and will float the idea at two-way trade talks in Washington next week, the Nikkei daily reported on Friday. Tokyo is seeking ways to counter U.S. pressure for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) and head off a rise in tariffs on its auto exports when Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi meets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Aug. 9. Motegi told a news conference on Friday that he wanted to “take some ideas” to the talks, adding Japan would not make concessions that would hurt its national interests. Finance Minister Taro Aso said separately that Japan was in various talks with the United States on infrastructure, but had no specific plan to set up a sovereign wealth fund. “Japan and the United States are holding various discussions in this area, but at the moment there’s no concrete consideration towards establishing a fund,” Aso told reporters at a regular news briefing. The Nikkei said that Japan would raise capital from the private sector through bond issues as early as the business year beginning April 2019 and provide low-cost government and possibly public-private loans, taking advantage of the Bank of Japan’s hyper-easy monetary policy. It added that the size of the fund has yet to be determined. The proposal for the fund also urges converting money raised into foreign currency if the yen strengthens beyond around 100 yen to the dollar, a move that might open Japan to criticism of currency manipulation to keep the yen weak, Nikkei added. A ruling party source with knowledge of U.S.-Japan ties said a sovereign wealth fund for infrastructure has been under consideration since April and would likely come up when Motegi meets Lighthizer. But a Japanese government source said such a plan was not being deliberated and was unlikely to be feasible. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told Reuters on Wednesday that Japanese firms were keen to invest in the robust U.S. market and that the government wants to “firmly support and back that”. He did not elaborate. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told reporters the carmaker had no room to increase local production capacity in response to threatened tariffs. Toyota has already committed in 2017 to spend $10 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next five years. The reported sovereign wealth fund proposal comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week announced a $113 million initiative in technology, energy and infrastructure in Asia and a trilateral push by the United States, Australia and Japan to invest in regional infrastructure projects. It echoes an idea floated last year to buy dollar-denominated “infrastructure bonds” as a way to take part in U.S. President Donald Trump’s upgrade of U.S. infrastructure. Sumitomo Corp 8053.T Chief Financial Officer Koichi Takahata told reporters the trading house was interested in social infrastructure as a growth sector and would consider it if there were a stable supply of funds and a way to hedge against country risk, a concern in some third countries. Trump wants a two-way trade pact as a way to cut America’s trade deficit with Japan but Tokyo is wary because an FTA would boost pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture. Nishimura and other Japanese officials have said Japan is expected to increase its imports of liquefied natural gas from America and buy U.S. military gear needed for its defense, both of which would help reduce the trade imbalance. But he ruled out setting a numerical limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, a tactic taken during trade wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the 1995 launch of the World Trade Organization, which generally bans such steps."

-10.582699590416345," Toyota Philippines expects 17 percent output cut in 2018 on weak sales MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine unit of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp expects a 17-percent decrease in its output this year as higher excise taxes and consumer goods prices weigh on demand, its president said on Wednesday. The Philippines, one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, is Toyota’s ninth largest market worldwide. “The market has slowed down not only because of the impact of the excise tax increase, but also inflation having an impact on car customers,” Toyota Motor Philippines Corp President Satoru Suzuki told reporters. Toyota Philippines will produce around 50,000 units this year, down nearly 17 percent from the record high 60,000 units in 2017, Suzuki said. Toyota Philippines, the country’s top car manufacturer and seller, assembles Vios and Innova models in its facility south of the capital. The Philippines’ car production, the second smallest in Southeast Asia, is less than a tenth of the output of top manufacturers Thailand and Indonesia. Sales of motor vehicles among all automotive companies in the Philippines fell 12.5 percent to 171,590 units in the first half from a year ago, data from the ASEAN Automotive Federation showed. It is the second largest sales decline in the region, next only to Singapore’s 13.3-percent drop. Car distributors attribute flagging sales to new excise taxes on automobiles that started this year and higher consumer prices, including oil. “Our market now, I think, I can say, is very bad,” Suzuki said. But sales and production will likely recover next year as the Philippine economy continues its expansion, he said. Toyota Philippines is a joint venture of Toyota and Philippine conglomerate GT Capital Holdings Inc."
-13.883537231694687," Toyota plans to expand production, shrink cost of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is doubling down on its investment in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, designing lower-cost, mass-market passenger cars and SUVs and pushing the technology into buses and trucks to build economies of scale. As Toyota cranks up improvements for the next generation of its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV), expected in the early 2020s, it is hoping it can prove wrong rival automakers and industry experts who have mostly dismissed such plans as commercially unviable. The maker of the Prius, the world’s first mass-produced “eco-friendly” gasoline-hybrid car in the 1990s, says it can popularize FCVs in part by making them cheaper. “We’re going to shift from limited production to mass production, reduce the amount of expensive materials like platinum used in FCV components, and make the system more compact and powerful,” Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the Mirai, said in an interview with Reuters. It is planning a phased introduction of other FCV models, including a range of SUVs, pick-up trucks, and commercial trucks beginning around 2025, a source with knowledge of the automaker’s plans said. The automaker declined to comment on specific future product plans. But it has developed FCV prototypes of small delivery vehicles and large transport trucks based on models already on the road, as Tesla Inc TSLA.O develops a battery-operated commercial semi-truck from the ground up. “We’re going to use as many parts from existing passenger cars and other models as possible in fuel cell trucks,” said Ikuo Ota, manager of new business planning for fuel cell projects at Toyota. “Otherwise, we won’t see the benefits of mass production.” The company is also betting on improved performance. Toyota wants to push the driving range of the next Mirai to 700-750 kilometers from around 500 kilometers, and to hit 1,000 kilometers by 2025, a separate source said. Driven by the belief that hydrogen will become a key source of clean energy in the next 100 years, Toyota has been developing FCVs since the early 1990s. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and stores more energy than a battery of equivalent weight. The Mirai was the world’s first production FCV when it was launched in 2014. But its high cost, around $60,000 before government incentives, and lack of refueling infrastructure have limited its appeal. Fewer than 6,000 have been sold globally. LMC Automotive forecasts FCVs to make up only 0.2 percent of global passenger car sales in 2027, compared with 11.7 percent for battery EVs. The International Energy Agency predicts fewer FCVs than battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles through 2040. Many automakers, including Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Tesla, see battery-powered cars as a better, zero-emission solution to gasoline engines. Only a handful, including Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, produce FCVs. But people familiar with Toyota’s plans said the automaker thinks demand will perk up as more countries, including China, warm to fuel cell technology. The company also sees FCVs as a hedge against a scarcity of key EV battery materials such as cobalt. For now, Mirais are assembled by hand at a plant in Toyota City, where 13 technicians push partially constructed units into assembly bays for detailed inspections. This process yields just 6.5 cars a day, a sliver of Toyota’s average domestic daily production of about 13,400 vehicles. Strategic Analysis Inc, which has analyzed costs of FCVs including the Mirai, estimates that it costs Toyota about $11,000 to produce each of its fuel cell stacks, by far the vehicles’ most expensive part. Toyota has been building up production capacity to change that, as it expects global FCV sales climb to 30,000 units annually after 2020 from about 3,000. Strategic Analysis estimates that would allow Toyota to reduce costs to about $8,000 per stack. It has already begun to use parts developed for the Mirai in other models, such as the fuel cell stack, which is used in Kenworth freight trucks being tested in California, the Sora FC bus it released in Japan in March and the delivery trucks it will test with Seven-Eleven stores in Japan next year. “It will be difficult for Toyota to lower FCV production costs if it only produces the Mirai,” the first source told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. “By using the FCV system in larger models, it is looking to lower costs by mass-producing and using common parts across vehicle classes,” he added. The Mirai’s high production costs are largely due to expensive materials including platinum, titanium and carbon fiber used in the fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems. Engineers have been reducing that by improving the platinum catalyst, a key component in the 370 layered cells in the fuel cell stack, which facilitates the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that produces electricity. “We’ve been able to decrease the platinum loading by 10 percent to 20 percent and deliver the same performance,” said Eri Ichikawa, a fuel cell engineer at Cataler Corp, a Toyota subsidiary that specializes in catalytic converters. Strategic Analysis says using that much less of the precious metal would save up to $300 per fuel cell stack, based on an estimate that Toyota now uses about 30 grams of platinum per unit. “By consistently focusing on these issues, we will be able to progressively lower the cost of FCVs in the future,” Tanaka said."
-11.761593053996275," Toyota raises overall Thai auto sales estimate to 12 percent from 3 percent BANGKOK (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday forecast overall vehicle sales in Thailand to rise 12 percent this year from last, greater than the 3 percent it estimated in January, saying the auto market has benefited from favorable economic conditions. The Japanese automaker, which commands about one-third of the Thai vehicle market, also raised its local sales growth forecast to 31 percent from 25 percent. “New models and various marketing activities introduced by carmakers have also played a big role in stimulating the Thai auto market,” Toyota Motor Thailand President Michinobu Sugata said a news conference. Thailand’s government expects rising investment, exports and tourism to push economic growth beyond that of 2017, which was the quickest rate in five years. The Southeast Asian country is a regional production and export hub for the world’s biggest automakers, and the auto sector accounts for about 12 percent of gross domestic product. In January-June, overall vehicles sales rose 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, with those of Toyota jumping 26 percent, Sugata said. “Market growth for the first half was beyond our expectation,” he said. “In light of the upward trend in the auto market, we foresee a better market outlook.” Toyota now expects to sell 315,000 vehicles in Thailand this year, out of an overall 980,000. It maintained its export target of 300,000 vehicles, matching last year. Sugata also said import tariffs under consideration in the United States for vehicles and parts should have limited impact on Thai auto exports as under 10 percent go to that country. “But if other countries also introduce protectionist measures, there will definitely be an impact,” Sugata said. In Southeast Asia, Toyota aims to sell 3.5 million vehicles this year, having sold 1.71 million in January-June. In 2017, it sold 3.36 million vehicles across the region, Sugata said."

-7.010492186146165," Exclusive: Toyota, pressed to innovate, is cutting marketing costs to fuel research BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota has begun slashing costs, starting with sales and marketing, and shifting resources into research that will help it keep up with new competitors, four people familiar with the matter said. One of the company’s first moves was to cancel contracts with the China unit of its long-term communication and advertising agency, Dentsu Inc, the sources said. Chief executive Akio Toyoda and chief financial and risk officer Koji Kobayashi want to follow the example of Tesla, Google and Tencent - all of which rely heavily on cheaper, often more innovative non-traditional marketing. They say the savings should be plowed into investment in emerging technology such as autonomous vehicles. “We may be posting record profits, but we don’t think we are keeping up with their pace of investments,” one of the sources, a senior Toyota official, told Reuters. To do that, Kobayashi wants to tap into money once earmarked for automotive marketing and general expenses, which for the year that ended in March totaled 2.72 trillion yen ($24.66 billion). The company reported 2.4 trillion yen ($21.68 billion) in operating income in the same period, making Toyota one of the world’s most profitable automakers. The company’s profit margin is about 9 percent. But companies like Google and Apple - now competing directly with Toyota in automotive technology - boast numbers several times larger. Toyoda and Kobayashi see a sharp contrast between Toyota’s hyper-efficient factory side and its more wasteful sales operation, the sources said. Barring Beijing Dentsu from new business with the automaker next year, and scaling back work already approved, shows the effort to cut spending is serious, the sources said. Although the company may bid for Toyota contracts again in 2020, it will be a hard sell, they said. Beijing Dentsu had been doing about $50 million worth of business for Toyota annually. None of the four wished to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about the issue. Toyota was frustrated with the cost of at least two events Dentsu organized in China: a ride-and-drive for Toyota’s premium Lexus brand in March and the Beijing auto show display stand for Toyota in April. A review by the automaker showed “out-of-control extravagance in how it executed those events - not over-billing,” another one of the sources said. Beijing Dentsu declined to comment. It was not the first time Toyota had clashed with Dentsu; in 2016, the marketing company admitted to billing for services it did not perform. ‘MARUNAGE’ Toyota’s cost-cutting effort takes aim at wholesale outsourcing, known in Japan as “marunage,” according to two of the sources. It can encompass items such as media buys, promotional events, and consumer and market research. The sources added that Toyoda and Kobayashi see marunage as flab weighing on the efficiency of Toyota’s non-factory operations, and hurting the company’s ability to research and produce better vehicles. At Toyota factories, engineers make a point of knowing everything they can about each component and process, all the way down to what each part costs. Even if they outsource production, they would produce it on their own first to understand its cost structure, the sources said. Toyoda and Kobayashi want to instil more discipline in Toyota’s sales and marketing teams, and to move in-house some of the jobs routinely outsourced today, the four sources said. That, the executives hope, will help give the company more financial firepower to keep up with Silicon Valley, which is pouring money into future automotive technology. For instance, a lawsuit Waymo filed against Uber over trade secrets revealed that Google’s parent company, Alphabet, spent $1.1 billion developing self-driving tech from 2009 to 2015. That’s about what Toyota set aside to fund a research institute it launched in 2016. On June 13, Toyota invested $1 billion in the Southeast Asian ride-hailing app Grab, giving it access to trip data that could help it develop next-generation services. Other established automakers are also taking steps to reshape their marketing operations. Ford has tried to “drive greater marketing efficiency” by using new tools and technology rather than investing in traditional methods, the company said in a response to questions. The effort, however, doesn’t include Ford’s China unit or Lincoln brand. Toyota’s current cost-cutting drive began in January, propelled by Kobayashi. Kobayashi and Toyoda focused first on Beijing Dentsu in part because of the outsized Lexus event in March in the southern China city of Shenzhen, which Toyoda attended, the sources said. Both men declined to be interviewed for this story. What infuriated Toyoda and Kobayashi most, according the four sources, was what they described as the unnecessary extravagance of the event. Toyota in late March then began a last-minute cost-cutting effort on the display Dentsu had designed for the Beijing auto show in April. At a visit to the display during the event, it was clear where expenses had been trimmed: some rooms did not have ceilings, and downgraded VIP areas originally outfitted with upscale tables and seating now had steel-pipe chairs and other simple furniture. Generally, a stand such as the one Dentsu assembled would cost one billion yen ($10 million) or more. Toyota was only able to slightly reduce that cost. “Why spend this much money when we use an auto show stand once?” said one of the knowledgeable individuals. “It’s this kind of out-of-control expense we had rein in.”"

The Japanese automaker said it aims to install its TransLog driving recorder devices into Grab’s fleet of lease cars to access the data on driving patterns that will be crucial to its push into the nascent mobility-as-a-service industry. “Only ride-hailing companies have good, extensive data on usage, so automakers want to be connected with that,” said Egil Juliussen, director of research for automotive infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems at IHS Markit. Grab already monitors driving behaviour through its app to increase ride safety, sending emails about speed and braking, for instance, to its drivers, such as Singapore’s Rennu Mahajan. “With this system, it keeps me in check,” said Mahajan, 57. It will get even more vehicle data with Toyota, which has been harvesting data through TransLog since 2016 in sales and trials with taxi firms and car-hailing operators including Grab. The data gives Toyota insight into fleet management as it develops services including futuristic concepts such as pay-per-use mobile restaurants. The latest deal, announced last week, gives Toyota access to a single pool of vehicles which potentially eclipses all others. That will allow it to capture a volume of data that would be difficult to collect from private cars which are only used for under 5 percent of any given day, often on routine commutes. In return, Grab will be able to expand services such as food delivery and digital payments using Toyota’s $1 billion investment - the biggest by a traditional automaker in a ride-sharing app maker. The deal reflects how automakers are clamouring for access to ride-hailing firms’ extensive user bases through a spate of partnerships, as they compete with technology companies to develop autonomous cars and next-generation transport services. Toyota’s vision of such services includes convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels, which the automaker plans to develop and customise for retail customers. “There’s data about the car, and then there’s also data about the service - how many customers drivers have, what’s the average mileage, where the rides are concentrated,” said Juliussen. “Having that picture in all the major (Southeast Asian) cities, that becomes very valuable.” Toyota and Grab will be able to use the data for possible collaboration on data-driven services such as vehicle diagnostics and customised insurance plans based on driver usage. The data will also help Grab maintain efficiency in fleet maintenance as it expands deeper into Southeast Asia where it operates in over 200 cities. It has said it wants build the region’s largest car rental fleet by the fourth quarter of 2018. “Vehicle maintenance costs, insurance costs, these are bread-and-butter issues for ride-hailing drivers,” said Chua Kee Lock, chief executive of Vertex Venture Holdings in Singapore, an early Grab investor. Industry experts said Toyota could expand its data service to more mobility firms such as Didi Chuxing, Uber Technologies Inc and Amazon.com Inc, with which it has separate partnerships. “This partnership with Toyota will keep Grab’s platform ‘sticky’ and give drivers less incentive to switch to competitors,” said Chua. “This is Grab’s edge over the long-run.” (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu and Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

-9.932800090604822," Toyota pumps $1 billion in Grab in auto industry's biggest ride-hailing bet SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to buy a $1 billion stake in Southeast Asia’s Grab in the biggest investment by a carmaker into a ride-hailing firm, at a time when traditional automakers are racing to team up with disruptive tech companies. The value of six-year-old Grab will be just over $10 billion after the investment, said a person familiar with the matter. The deal comes as the auto industry faces a spike in the need for technological prowess with the advent of features such as autonomous driving, while app makers offer passengers the option to forgo car purchases by connecting them with drivers. Some automakers have responded by partnering with makers of ride-hailing apps which dominate the fast-growing field of mobility services, in anticipation of a future of reduced car ownership. General Motors Co has invested in U.S. ride services firm Lyft, whose rival Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] is also backed by Toyota. Meanwhile Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp - also an investor in Grab and Uber - last month said it would invest $2.25 billion in GM’s autonomous vehicle unit Cruise. Toyota’s trading arm invested an undisclosed sum in Grab last year. This time, the automaker is lead investor in a financing round launched after Grab acquired Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, a region of 640 million people. Grab called it the largest-ever investment globally by an automotive manufacturer in the ride-hailing sector. The Singapore-headquartered firm did not disclose how much fresh capital it aims to raise. It raised $2.5 billion in its last round in July, resulting in a reported value of $6 billion. Grab said it logs six million rides a day via apps downloaded onto over 100 million mobile devices. The firm also offers online to offline services, such as food delivery and digital payments, which it aims to expand deeper into the region using funds from its latest financing round. “We will work with partners like Toyota to continue to transform transportation in Southeast Asia,” Grab said in an email. “We want to be the one-stop mobility platform for users.” It also said Toyota will appoint an executive to Grab’s board of directors while a dedicated Toyota team member will be seconded to Grab as an executive officer. Toyota said it aimed to offer financing, insurance and maintenance services to drivers based on data collected through recorder devices already installed in some Grab vehicles. “Going forward, together with Grab, we will develop services that are more attractive, safe and secure for our customers in Southeast Asia,” Toyota executive Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement. The data could also help Toyota develop its own next-generation mobility services, including a self-driving electric vehicle aimed at companies for use in tasks such as ride hailing, package delivery and mobile shops. Other Grab investors include Japan’s Honda Motor Co Ltd, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing. Uber acquired 27.5 percent of Grab in exchange for the U.S. firm’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year.

Toyota said it would consolidate core electronics component operations of within Denso from late next year, adding that Denso would take over mass production of electronic parts used in its vehicles from 2022. Leveraging its “keiretsu” tight-knit relationship with its group supplier, Toyota is shedding some of its in-house parts production as it looks beyond making conventional vehicles to develop new technologies including electric cars, self-driving vehicles, ride-sharing and other mobility services. Friday's announcement is the latest move by Toyota, which sells 10 million vehicles each year, to streamline its operations as it faces fierce competition from rivals including Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and also from technology companies such as Google GOOGL.O which are moving into the automotive space. Toyota said that consolidating development and mass production of components which control electric cars and automated driving functions would eliminate operational overlap, helping it to shift resources to new technologies. “By consolidating mass-production development and production of electronic components of both Toyota and Denso within Denso ... Toyota and Denso aim to establish a speedy and competitive development and production structure,” Toyota said. Denso, which manufacturers components ranging from air conditioning systems to semiconductors, already counts Toyota as its biggest customer, accounting for nearly half of its annual sales. Toyota is Denso’s biggest shareholder, owning a 24 percent stake. “They’re basically pulling in all of the forces they need among the group companies to go electric. It’s reinforcing that they will be working very closely with Denso,” Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities, said. “This move highlights the scope and scale of investment needed to develop all these new technologies.” Toyota and Denso’s relationship goes back to 1949, when Nippondenso was formed as a spin-off of Toyota. After years of supplying Toyota nearly exclusively, Denso has expanded its non-Toyota client base, particularly overseas. The two companies have also been setting up partnerships with other companies as they pool resources to contain the rising costs of developing new technologies. Toyota has teamed up with Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T to develop lower emission cars, while it is developing next-generation batteries for electric cars with Panasonic Corp 6752.T. Denso has formed alliances with electronics makers including Toshiba Corp 6502.T, while also scooping up tech start-ups.

-7.248569808991692," Toyota to ramp up hydrogen fuel cell vehicle sales around 2020 TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Thursday said it plans to set up a facility to mass manufacture hydrogen fuel cell stacks, a key component of fuel cell vehicles, as it seeks to ramp up production of hydrogen-powered cars and expand their usage as a zero-emission alternative to gasoline vehicles. The new unit will come up on the grounds of its Honsha plant in Toyota City near the automaker’s global headquarters, the company said in a statement. It is also constructing a dedicated line at the nearby Shimoyama plant to produce tanks for storing high-pressure hydrogen gas inside vehicles. Toyota declined to give details about their latest investment in this technology, but said mass production of components will begin around 2020, enabling the company to meet its target for global annual fuel cell vehicle sales of more than 30,000 units, including passenger cars and buses. “As a technology, fuel cells are mature and ready to scale up,” Toyota said in a statement. “In order to encourage more widespread use of hydrogen-powered zero-emission vehicles, popularization needs to start by the 2020s.” Toyota already sells the Mirai sedan, the world’s first mass-market fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), in Japan, in the United States and also some European countries. The model starts at about 7.2 million yen ($65,807.51) in the Japan market. Due to its high cost and complexity of building its components, the Mirai is produced in small lots. Only around 5,300 units have been sold since its 2014 launch, a fraction of regular production models. Mass manufacturing of the two components - hydrogen fuel cell stacks and hydrogen tanks - will enable Toyota to lower the price of FCEVs, and expand its fuel cell technology. Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS also manufacture fuel cell vehicles, while other automakers are also developing the technology. However, many automakers, including Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Tesla Inc TSLA.O, are focusing on all-battery electric cars as a solution to reduce vehicle emissions. Toyota, which developed the Prius, the world’s first gasoline hybrid vehicle, sees hydrogen FCEVs as a zero-emission alternative, which requires less time to refuel compared with the time it takes recharge electric vehicle batteries."
-7.248569808991692," Toyota to build fuel cell stack plant, ramp up fuel cell vehicle sales from 2020 TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Thursday said it plans to build a plant to manufacture hydrogen fuel cell stacks, a key component of fuel cell vehicles, as it seeks to mass manufacture hydrogen-powered cars to expand their usage as a zero emissions alternative to gasoline vehicles. The plant will be built on the grounds of its Honsha Plant in Toyota City, near its global headquarters, Toyota said in a statement, adding that it was also building a dedicated line at its nearby Shimoyama plant to produce the tanks which store high-pressure hydrogen gas in vehicles. Toyota also said it planned to increase global annual sales of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), including passenger cars and busses, to at least 30,000 from 3,000 now.

-9.379590309152695," Exclusive: Toyota plans to roll into China's EV market in GAC Motor vehicle BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is taking an unprecedented route to meet China's stringent green car quotas: its showrooms will sell an electric vehicle without the Japanese company's distinctive triple-oval logo. Instead, it will feature the label of GAC Motor 601238.SS, Toyota's Chinese partner, and will be built around GAC's lower-cost technology. The move - a first for Toyota - will give GAC access to the Japanese carmaker’s stringent quality control, prestige and sales channel. For Toyota, it presents a quick way to meet Beijing’s requirements that such vehicles represent 10 percent of an auto manufacturer’s production by 2019. According to two company executives familiar with the matter, Toyota plans to start selling the GAC Toyota ix4 by the end of the year. The car is a battery-powered compact SUV based on GAC’s Trumpchi GS4, and has been in development for two years. Selling a car derived from a Chinese partner’s vehicle would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But the idea gained momentum at Toyota because of the Chinese government’s push to get more electric vehicles on the road, the executives said. The government mandates have spurred other new alliances, such as Ford Motor Co's F.N agreement to develop electric vehicles with Zotye Automobile Co 000980.SZ. Ford is waiting for regulatory approval for its partnership, which calls for designing and manufacturing several jointly developed no-frills EVs and selling them through a new China-only brand. It wasn’t immediately clear which parts of the ix4 Toyota would provide, or which company’s design standards were used. Quality experts say GAC cars rate relatively high. According to Jeff Cai, a Beijing-based senior director at JD Power & Associates, some of GAC’s cars, such as the Trumpchi GS8 crossover SUV, already stack up well head-to-head with vehicles marketed by global automakers. “The GS4 is a good car with acceptable quality,” Cai said. He added that the GS4 ranked No. 1 among Chinese brands and No. 3 among all brands for initial quality in the compact SUV category. One question, however, is GAC cars’ longer-term reliability and dependability, Cai said. Under the new Chinese regulations taking effect next year, carmakers must amass credits for so-called new-energy vehicles equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019. That level rises to 12 percent for 2020. New-energy vehicles are defined as all-electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid cars. Although the ix4 gives Toyota a cheaper and quicker way to meet the quota, it also shows the company’s anxiety about getting a toehold in the Chinese EV market before its own all-battery vehicle is available in 2020, industry officials and experts said. “It’s a creative solution to a critical issue all automakers face in China: how to meet the strict production quotas for electric cars,” said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific head of consultancy IHS Markit. Until recently, Toyota was one of the industry’s major hold-outs against full electrification. The company had planned to more or less skip battery-powered cars and turn instead to hydrogen fuel-cell technology as a mainstream alternative to gasoline-fueled cars. But China’s seemingly inexorable drive toward electric cars changed that attitude. At the Beijing auto show last month, Toyota unveiled plug-in electric hybrid versions of its Corolla and Levin, due to go on sale in 2019. The company is also developing an all-electric battery car of its own, which the company has said should hit the market in 2020. “All this means our partnership has entered a new phase,” the second Toyota executive said. The GAC-Toyota joint venture, established in 2004, has always produced and sold Toyota vehicles modified to sell in China or China-only Toyota cars. To be sure, industry officials and analysts believe GAC Motor cars such as the Trumpchi GS4 have been developed through studying global brands' cars, including those from its partners Toyota and Honda Motor Co 7267.T. Toyota is negotiating to execute a similar EV deal with its second partner, FAW Group [SASACJ.UL], but nothing has been finalised, according to the first Toyota executive. Both executives declined to provide other details, including a target sales volume for the all-electric car or a pricing strategy for it. Toyota will assemble the vehicle at a factory in Guangzhou. The second executive said, however, that Toyota and GAC Motor would have to sell a “fairly sizable number” of ix4s to help the Toyota-GAC joint venture meet Beijing’s quotas.

-9.797321428218641," Toyota, Hyundai, Ford lead 9.6 percent European car sales gain PARIS (Reuters) - European car sales rose 9.6 percent in April, led by Toyota 7203.T, Hyundai 005380.KS and Ford F.N, and boosted by an increase in the number of business days, according to industry data published on Thursday. Registrations in EU and European Free Trade Area countries advanced to 1.349 million cars last month from 1.231 million a year earlier, Brussels-based industry association ACEA said. Thanks to the timing of this year’s Easter holiday, European showrooms were open for business on more days last month than in April 2017, helping the year-on-year progression. Toyota and Hyundai posted sales increases of 20.3 and 15.3 percent respectively, while Ford's registrations were up 14 percent and Volkswagen Group's VOWG_p.DE up 13.1 percent. Renault RENA.PA sales advanced 10 percent, while the Peugeot brand jumped 15.3 percent and PSA Group PEUP.PA stablemate Citroen posted a 6.9 percent increase. However Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI lost ground as its sales edged just 2.3 percent higher, underperforming the market thanks to a 4.5 percent decline at the core Fiat brand."
