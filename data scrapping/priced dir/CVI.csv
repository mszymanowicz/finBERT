3.8378324324324318," CVR Energy says not interested in buying Delek, proposes to replace board nominees (Reuters) - U.S. refiner CVR Energy Inc, majority owned by billionaire-investor Carl Icahn, said on Thursday it was not interested in buying peer Delek US Holdings Inc and proposed to replace three Delek board nominees with its own. CVR, which owns about 15% of Delek and is its largest stockholder, said it would instead focus on devoting capital to internal higher-return projects, according to a regulatory filing, which cited a letter to Delek from CVR Energy Chief Executive Officer David Lamp. (bit.ly/2XG01NR) Lamp cited the dramatic changes in the industry since it started buying shares of Delek as one of the reasons it was not pursuing an acquisition. Responding to CVR’s letter, Delek said it welcomes dialogue with its shareholders and constructive input related to enhancing shareholder value. The company added that its nominating and corporate governance committee will evaluate any nominees from CVR if and when they are received, and make a recommendation in due course. Lamp said CVR continues to believe Delek’s stock is undervalued and the company would benefit by prioritizing free cash flow over growth, and focusing on core refineries while exiting from others. Oil refineries have been facing a wave of closures due to plateauing fuel demand, tightening environmental rules and increased competition. CVR urged Delek to cease refining operations at the Krotz Springs and El Dorado refineries in the U.S. and convert them to terminals, for renewable diesel production or other purposes. “Generally when activists get involved in energy equities, they tend to outperform ... CVI is making it very clear they have no intentions of acquiring DK. So, we expect the positive reaction to be more muted,” Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta wrote in a note. Delek’s shares halved in 2020, while CVR’s stock fell 63%."

60.37567084078712," CVR Energy plans potential renewable diesel project at Coffeyville (Reuters) - CVR Energy Inc CVI.N plans to pursue a renewable diesel project at its 132,000 barrel per day (bpd) Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery if succeeds in producing the fuel at its Wynnewood, Oklahoma, plant, the refiner said Tuesday. CVR said it has excess hydrogen capacity and a high-pressure hydrotreater at Coffeyville that could be repurposed for renewable diesel production, pending approvals. CVR is converting a hydrocracker at Wynnewood to allow for the production of renewable diesel, which could receive feedstock as early as May 2021, and begin processing by the following July, the company said. Crude processing at the plant will decrease from 75,000 bpd to between 55,000 and 59,000 bpd. “If market conditions change materially, then we would have the option to return the unit to hydrocarbon service fairly easily at minimum cost,” CVR Chief Executive David Lamp said on an earnings call with investors. If refining margins remain weak, the refiner plans to install a pretreatment unit at Wynnewood to process lower carbon-intensity feedstocks like inedible corn oil, animal fats and used cooking oil."
27.923627684964185," Wachtell gets quick win in CVR malpractice appeal The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday declined to revive CVR Energy Inc’s lawsuit accusing Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz of malpractice related to the petroleum refiner’s 2012 hostile takeover by billionaire investor Carl Icahn. Just two days after oral arguments, a three-judge panel upheld a Manhattan federal court’s previous decision to toss the case, ruling that Wachtell and its partners Benjamin Roth and Andrew Brownstein weren’t negligent in failing to explain to ex-client CVR that two banks it hired to defend itself from Icahn’s takeover stood to earn more in fees if he succeeded than if he failed.

-10.91189738849277," CVR Energy to explore converting refining units for renewable diesel production (Reuters) - CVR Energy Inc is looking to convert certain units in its refineries to renewable diesel production to reduce its exposure to the cost of renewable fuel credits (RINs), the company said on Thursday. The project, which would involve using excess hydrogen capacity and converting some desulfurization units for renewable diesel production, is still in its early stages, the refiner’s chief executive said on its first quarter earnings call. “The fact of the matter is we have existing assets and excess hydrogen,” said David Lamp, president and CEO of CVR. CVR Energy’s RINs expense in the first quarter of 2020 was $19 million compared with $13 million in the same period last year. The company now estimates that its RINs expense will be approximately $65 million to $75 million in 2020. “We continue to try to mitigate our RIN exposure, which is still way too high,” said Lamp. The refiner reported a net loss of $87 million, or 87 cents per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2020, compared with a net income of $101 million in the prior year period. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refineries must blend billions of gallons of ethanol into their gasoline each year or buy credits from those that do. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January that Environmental Protection Agency exemptions for small refineries can only be used as extensions for refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. Oil refiners HollyFrontier Corp and CVR Energy, both of which had received waivers the court considered inappropriate, had sought a rehearing in the case but were denied in April."
-38.78444648206889," N.Y. judge tosses Wachtell lawsuit against ex-client CVR A state judge in Manhattan has thrown out Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz’s lawsuit against its former client CVR Energy Inc, marking the latest chapter in a long-running legal saga sparked by billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s hostile takeover of the company in 2012. Judge O. Peter Sherwood said in an order filed on Thursday that Wachtell failed to prove its allegations that Sugar Land, Texas-based CVR breached a confidentiality agreement and that it misused subpoenas to obtain information in order to sue the law firm for malpractice.

-9.674908243022807," Refiner CVR Energy says evaluating strategic alternatives including sale (Reuters) - Carl Icahn-backed U.S. oil refiner CVR Energy Inc said on Tuesday it was evaluating potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company, sending its shares up 3.7% after the bell. The company has engaged BofA Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor to assist it in the process. CVR also said it has sold its 1.5 million-barrel oil storage terminal and related assets in Cushing, Oklahoma to Plains All American Pipeline LP for about $36 million. Sugar Land, Texas-based CVR does not have a defined timeline for the exploration of strategic alternatives, the company said in a statement. Carl Icahn took a controlling state in the company in 2012 and Icahn Associates Corp had a near 71% stake as of March 31, according to Refinitiv data."
-14.921101346180746," Icahn, CVR lose malpractice case against Wachtell Lipton law firm NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday dismissed an unusual lawsuit in which billionaire investor Carl Icahn accused the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz of malpractice related to his 2012 hostile takeover of CVR Energy Inc CVI.N. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan said CVR failed to show that Wachtell and two of its partners, Benjamin Roth and Andrew Brownstein, should have disclosed that two banks helping CVR defend against the takeover stood to earn much higher fees if Icahn’s bid succeeded than if it failed. By suing, CVR, and thus Icahn, were essentially claiming they overpaid for the process that left the activist investor with an 82 percent stake in the petroleum refiner and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer. Icahn’s tender offer valued the Sugar Land, Texas-based company at $2.6 billion. Sullivan said CVR's contracts with Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE> entitled the banks to $18 million if CVR stayed independent, but more than $36 million if it were sold, based on a percentage of the sale price. While that looked strange, Sullivan said the contracts were “plain on their face,” and a plaintiff could not allege malpractice when its “sole allegation is that his attorney did not explain an otherwise-unambiguous legal document.” The judge also said CVR could not hold Wachtell liable for having told CVR’s chief financial officer, Frank Pici, it was “OK to sign” the contracts unless it knew he misunderstood them. “Of course, defendants were not required to read Pici’s mind at the risk of a malpractice claim,” Sullivan wrote. Sullivan said CVR could file an amended complaint only as to its claim that Wachtell committed malpractice by describing the fee terms as “customary” in regulatory filings. “Obviously we’re disappointed with the court’s decision,” Icahn’s lawyer, Herbert Beigel, said in a phone interview. “Suffice it to say we don’t intend to abandon any claims that were dismissed. We’ll obviously have to appeal the dismissal.” Icahn is worth $17.5 billion, Forbes magazine said. Neither Wachtell nor its outside law firm immediately responded to requests for comment. Wachtell is still pursuing related litigation against CVR and Icahn in a New York state court in Manhattan. Icahn had pressed the malpractice claim there as well, but dropped it last October, leaving the federal case. The case is CVR Energy Inc v Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-06566."
