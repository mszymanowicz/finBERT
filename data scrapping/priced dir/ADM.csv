25.558974514391974," China bought about 200 million gallons of U.S. ethanol for first-half 2021: ADM CHICAGO/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has bought “roughly 200 million gallons” of U.S. ethanol for the first half of 2021, matching its previous record for annual imports of the corn-based biofuel, Archer Daniels Midland Co Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on Tuesday. The accelerated imports are among several positive signs for the ethanol sector which has been hard hit by years of oversupply and, more recently, a sharp drop in demand as the coronavirus pandemic slashed fuel use. Imports of 200 million gallons would eclipse China’s previous annual record of 198.1 million gallons in 2016, according to U.S. Census Bureau trade data. “China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That’s something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years,” Young said on an earnings-day call with analysts. “We do see, particularly in the area of ethanol, green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here,” he said after the company reported a stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday. China has not traditionally been a large importer of ethanol, but tightening supplies of domestic corn used to make the biofuel coupled with a wide spread versus U.S. prices spurred the need for imports. “Domestic corn prices keep rising and ethanol prices in the (domestic) market remain high,” said a Chinese source with knowledge of the purchases, adding some cargoes had arrived this month. Chinese demand for ethanol has also increased since it can be used as an alcohol in disinfectants, whose consumption has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The supply gap is quite big also due to the epidemic, and can only be supplemented with imports,” the source said. China mainly produces ethanol from corn and it is used to make alcoholic spirits, disinfectant alcohol, and fuel ethanol. China’s corn prices rallied over 30% in 2020 and have climbed further to a record this year. ADM did not disclose if it was among China’s suppliers. Valero Energy Corp is one of the companies that has sold ethanol cargoes to China, two U.S. market participants said. Valero did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sinopec and COFCO were among the buyers of U.S. ethanol cargoes, according to the Chinese source. Both Sinopec and COFCO did not immediately reply to faxes seeking comments. Even as China increases its purchases, about 10% to 15% of U.S. ethanol production capacity remains idled due to poor margins, including two dry corn mills owned by ADM. Those two mills, Young said, could restart in the first half of this year if margins improve. Beijing suspended a nationwide rollout of ethanol in gasoline supplies in 2020 following a sharp decline in corn stocks. However, on Dec. 31, China’s energy regulator urged oil and gas companies to restore supplies of ethanol-blended gasoline following reports that firms had cut sales in parts of the country. U.S. ethanol prices have risen since last year, making it currently unprofitable for Chinese buyers to import as 45% tariffs on U.S. cargoes are still in place, traders said. “The deals should have been done when U.S. ethanol prices were (at) their lowest point,” said a source with an international trading house."

15.751784854075412," UPDATE 3-ADM quarterly profit jumps 36% on strong exports, soy crush margins (Adds quote, share price) Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co reported a 36% jump in fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday on strong soy processing margins and solid exports, particularly to China. The company projected further profit growth in the year ahead, led by its core agricultural services and oilseeds unit amid growing global demand for food and feed as the world emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. “We expect the global demand environment for Ag Services and Oilseeds to remain strong. China should continue to be a significant buyer,” Chief Executive Juan Luciano said. ADM shares, which hit a record high last week, were down about 1.7% at midmorning. ADM’s results offered the latest look into how the pandemic is impacting the world’s largest grain traders. Despite massive shifts in food and fuel demand as people avoided unnecessary travel and made more meals at home, ADM and rival agribusinesses Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus - known as the ABCD quartet of grain trading giants - have weathered the pandemic unexpectedly well. Grain merchants have gained despite rising prices for crops they buy from farmers to store, transport and process. A record U.S. soybean crush, strong soy processing margins and high U.S. crop exports, including record-large corn sales to China, boosted ADM’s core agricultural services and oilseeds unit, its largest in terms of revenue. ADM’s carbohydrate solutions segment gained as pandemic-related consumer demand for hand sanitizer and flour for baking at home offset weak ethanol margins. Net earnings attributable to ADM rose to $687 million, or $1.22 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $504 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, ADM earned $1.21 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.10, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Revenue climbed 10.1% to $17.98 billion, beating expectations for $16.48 billion.

20.574130431595485," Calyxt to sell 2020 gene-edited soybean grains to ADM Dec 14 (Reuters) - Calyxt Inc said on Monday it had agreed to sell all the gene-edited soybean grains it produced in 2020 to agricultural merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co amid a supply shortage in the United States. Rising demand from domestic grain processors and lower global stockpiles due to a months-long dry spell in Argentina, has led to an expectation that U.S. soybean ending stocks for the 2020/21 marketing year would be at their lowest level in seven years. The stocks were seen at 175 million bushels, while analysts were expecting the report to show U.S. soybean stocks of 168 million bushels. The forecast for world soybean stocks was cut to 85.64 million tonnes from 86.52 million tonnes, against expectations for 85.11 million tonnes, based on an average of estimates given in a Reuters poll. The food and agriculture biotech company said the sales of about four million bushels of soybean grains, which have zero trans fat per serving and lower saturated fats, began in the third quarter and will continue through late 2021. Calyxt declined to provide an exact deal value, but said it charged a premium to market prices. Soybean prices were around $11.50 per bushel and the deal would contribute at least $45 million to Calyxt’s revenue, excluding the premium it would charge for the grains, the company said. As part of the deal, Archer Daniels will crush the grain as well as market and sell the resulting oil and meal. Calyxt launched the soybean in 2019 as the first commercially approved gene-edited food in the United States."
16.256529911505876," ADM, InnovaFeed to build world's biggest insect protein plant in Illinois CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grain trader and processor Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N and French biotech company InnovaFeed announced plans on Thursday to build the world's largest insect protein plant in Decatur, Illinois. The announcement comes amid rising global feed grain prices and tightening supplies, and as more companies work toward reducing the carbon footprint of their operations. Insects are seen as a sustainable alternative to fishmeal and other high-protein feeds. The plant will produce 60,000 tonnes of animal feed protein annually from Hermetia Illucens, a highly nutritional type of fly, along with 20,000 tonnes of oils for poultry and swine rations and 400,000 tonnes of fertilizer, the companies said in a release. Construction of the facility is slated to begin next year, pending permits and approvals. The facility will be built adjacent to ADM’s massive corn processing complex and will utilize corn byproducts as feed for the insects, as well as waste heat and steam from the corn processing plant. The collaborative scheme will emit 80% less carbon dioxide than a standalone facility, the companies said. “ADM Decatur’s corn-based co-products will be recycled locally to feed insects through infrastructure connected to the site. This production model will also allow InnovaFeed to use 27MW of residual energy recovered from the ADM process, energy that was not previously recovered,” InnovaFeed said in a statement. InnovaFeed also on Thursday launched an insect protein production site in Nesle, northern France, currently the world’s largest with a capacity of 15,000 tonnes of insect protein. It will ultimately feed the equivalent of 400,000 tonnes of fish, poultry and pigs. The companies did not disclose how much they would invest in the Decatur project."
8.934936462927428," COVID-19 raises governments' food security concerns, demand for U.S. crops: ADM CEO CHICAGO (Reuters) - COVID-19 outbreaks are increasing governments' food-security concerns, and importers need U.S. corn and soybeans for the first time in a long time to meet demand, Archer Daniels Midland ADM.N Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said on Friday. The pandemic has upended supply chains globally, as some consumers hoard food and the virus threatens food-processing operations if workers fall ill. “You see governments more concerned about food security now and the ability to keep supplying food for the world,” Luciano said on a conference call after reporting quarterly results. ADM, a top global grain merchants, can benefit from rising concerns because its traders and exporters connect regions that have excess supplies with those facing deficits, Luciano said. Brazil, the world’s top soybean producer, is among nations importing food staples, including soybeans, due to a rise in domestic prices, President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday. Luciano said Brazil has depleted it soybean stocks and is in an environment of food inflation. Farmers in rival producer Argentina, where the currency is volatile, have little incentive to sell their crops, he said, leaving the United States as a prime supplier. “For the very first time in a long time, the world needs the U.S. supply for both soybeans and corn,” Luciano said. China, the world’s top soybean importer, increased its purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans this summer and autumn. China’s government is discussing permits for millions of tonnes of additional corn imports over the next year, Reuters has reported, amid a surge in animal-feed demand. “The world is tight today,” Luciano said. “There is a big demand from China.” ADM idled ethanol production at two U.S. corn dry mills this year as the pandemic reduced gasoline demand. The mills will stay idle this winter but could be restarted in the first half of 2021, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said. ADM has increased industrial-grade alcohol production at other ethanol plants to make hand sanitizer."

0.904482330703847," UPDATE 2-Grain trader ADM beats profit estimates but revenue disappoints (New throughout, adds details) Oct 29 (Reuters) - Global grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profits on Thursday, helped by strength in its grain milling and nutrition businesses. Still, revenue missed analysts’ expectations and net earnings attributable to the company were 44% lower than a year earlier. Shares were down nearly 3% in extended trade, after setting a two-year high last Friday. ADM said it benefited in the third quarter as North American demand for starches grew from a year ago and earlier in 2020, though food-service demand has suffered. The company and rival grain traders like Bunge have faced headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic as shuttered restaurants and reduced travel disrupted demand for food and fuel. But the merchants have weathered the crisis better than other industries as countries around the world are stocking up on wheat and other staples to ensure supplies. “Reduced food service demand affected sweetener and flour volumes, though retail demand for flour remained solid,” ADM said. Operating profit in ADM’s corn and wheat milling business, a unit known as carbohydrate solutions that includes starches and sweeteners, rose by 35% from a year ago, to $246 million. Profit in the nutrition unit jumped 24.6% to $147 million, while profits in ag services and oilseeds - ADM’s biggest segment - rose 4.6% to $436 million. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 89 cents per share, while analysts on average had estimated 71 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net earnings attributable to ADM fell to $225 million, or 40 cents per share, including a 53-cent per share charge related to early debt retirement. That was down from $407 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $15.13 billion from $16.73 billion, below analysts’ estimates.

Ample U.S. supplies of crops like soybeans, corn and wheat could help propel exports to record levels in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Juan Luciano said during a quarterly call with analysts. After record export volumes from South American facilities helped ADM deliver a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit, Brazilian soy stocks are nearly depleted, Luciano said. The United States will be the prime supplier to the world, he added. “The U.S. export market is setting up ... for very good times on very solid global demand and competitive prices,” Luciano said. “We do expect large programs for corn, soybeans ... as well as wheat and soybean meal for Q4.” Global agribusinesses like ADM and rival Bunge Ltd BG.N are among the companies that have fared better than expected during the pandemic despite food supply chain disruptions and volatile markets. Bunge raised its full-year outlook after reporting a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday following record Brazilian crop exports. Both companies have reported minimal disruptions to operations due to COVID-19. China has recently been actively buying U.S. soybeans and corn, including its largest ever single-day corn purchase reported on Thursday. However, China will need significant buying for the remainder of the year to reach the $36.5 billion in purchases promised in its Phase 1 trade deal signed in January. Luciano said China needs about 25-26 million tonnes of soybeans for the remainder of 2020, about half of which is already booked. The rest will be U.S. beans shipped in the fourth quarter, he said."
17.260396082060467," Bunge raises outlook as robust agribusiness powers profit beat (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd on Wednesday raised its full-year outlook after its second-quarter profit handily beat Wall Street estimates, bolstered by oilseed crushing and robust crop exports to China. Despite a worsening coronavirus pandemic that has rattled global markets, Bunge reported strong soy processing margins in South America, Europe and Asia, record capacity utilization at its plants and the lowest crushing costs in three years. Meanwhile, accelerated crop sales by U.S. and Brazilian farmers provided ample exportable supplies. Top importer China logged record Brazilian soy imports during the quarter. Shares were up about 1.5% early on Wednesday. “These results would be strong in any environment, let alone a pandemic,” Chief Executive Greg Heckman said in a statement. Bunge’s strong second quarter, following a surprise loss in the first, highlighted the disruption the agribusiness industry has faced during the pandemic. Shuttered restaurants and food service companies, both major customers for Bunge’s cooking oils, shifted demand to more at-home dining, while travel restrictions hammered biofuel margins. Rival agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co will release second-quarter results later on Wednesday. Bunge said its facilities worldwide continue to operate at or near-normal levels despite the pandemic, although it confirmed on Tuesday that one positive COVID-19 case suspended operations at an Argentine port facility. Operating earnings in Bunge’s agribusiness segment grew four-fold in the quarter, triggering the improved 2020 outlook. Edible oils, milling and fertilizer units also posted gains, while sugar and bioenergy posted a loss. The oils segment, however, may struggle from uncertain demand due to the pandemic, Bunge said. Net income available to shareholders was $521 million, or $3.47 per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $214 million, or $1.43 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Bunge earned $3.88 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.32, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

32.62799404112924," ADM still optimistic China's U.S. farm products buying will hit Phase 1 target CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N remains optimistic that China will meet its Phase 1 trade deal farm product purchase commitments despite the slow pace of buying so far and recent criticism of China by U.S. President Donald Trump. Lower commodity prices due to the coronavirus pandemic may limit the value of China’s first year U.S. agricultural product purchases, “but it’s a two-year agreement,” ADM CEO Juan Luciano said during the virtual BMO Capital Markets Global Farm to Market Conference on Wednesday. Concerns have been rising that China may not reach the deal’s lofty purchasing targets following a sluggish pace of buying in the initial months of the agreement. A steep drop in commodities prices as the coronavirus pandemic upended global supply chains has fueled further worries that the deal’s targets, measured by value instead of tonnage, would be met. “The Chinese have been delivering on all their commitments to remove non-trade barriers and to improve the ability of both countries to trade,” Luciano said. “I do believe they have the intention to comply.” As part of the Phase 1 deal signed in January, China promised to increase purchases of U.S. farm goods by at least $12.5 billion in 2020 and $19.5 billion in 2021, over the 2017 level of $24 billion. Chinese imports of U.S. agricultural products and related goods totaled just $913 million in February and $952 million in March, the lowest totals for those two months since 2007, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. China has accelerated purchases of U.S. soybeans since late April after actively buying mostly Brazilian soybeans in recent months. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed 532,000 tonnes in U.S. soybean sales to China so far this week. Those sales would be valued at around $500 million at current prices, according to USDA data. China has about 25% of its August soybean needs met and 22% to 25% of its February 2021 needs filled, while purchases for September through January, typically the peak export period for U.S. soy, remain “completely open,” Luciano said. Trump said on Monday he opposed renegotiating the deal signed with Beijing in January after saying last week he was “very torn” about whether to end the deal. The U.S. leader has been highly critical of China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak and has threatened new sanctions on Beijing."

17.933363992628912," U.S. calls ingredients in some ethanol-based hand sanitizers unsafe NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration has tightened restrictions on the use of ethanol in hand sanitizer, citing safety concerns and forcing some suppliers to halt sales at a time of soaring demand, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters. The crackdown is meant to protect consumers from potentially dangerous impurities in hand sanitizer, but could worsen shortages at a time when households, hospitals and nursing homes need sanitizer to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions have dealt a blow to fuel ethanol producers. The industry has invested millions of dollars since last month to ramp up the output of corn-based alcohol sanitizer to offset slumping fuel demand. Fuel ethanol production has fallen to a record low of 537,000 barrels per day and halved from month-ago levels as gasoline demand has slumped. Fuel demand has dropped by roughly 30% worldwide due to stay-at-home orders. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 15 issued limits on certain chemicals permitted in alcohol-based hand sanitizer, updating temporary guidance it adopted last month as the health crisis deepened and more manufacturers registered to produce hand sanitizer. Since then, the FDA has notified several fuel ethanol companies that their product does not meet safety standards, forcing them to halt production and cancel supply agreements, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source requested anonymity to speak candidly about the situation. In one case, the FDA said it had found significant levels of the carcinogen acetaldehyde in ethanol supplied by a company for use in hand sanitizer, according to a recent email exchange seen by Reuters. “FDA has reviewed your ethanol data and determined that it is not acceptable as an ingredient under the Agency’s temporary hand sanitizer policies,” it wrote. The FDA told Reuters it decided to update the guidance after reviewing ingredient data supplied by ethanol companies and fielding multiple questions from companies seeking clarification about its temporary production policies. The agency said in a statement it was committed to “working with manufacturers, compounders, state boards of pharmacy and the public to increase the supply of alcohol-based hand sanitizer available to Americans.” Some companies are still launching efforts toward production of hand sanitizer. Biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland announced on Wednesday it was providing industrial ethyl alcohol to Sazerac Company, a distilled spirits producer, to help increase hand sanitizer production. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for details on the number of ethanol companies it had notified for failing to meet its April 15 guidance. Its move has drawn criticism from suppliers who say it should further ease its safety standards to ensure hand sanitizer is widely available during the coronavirus outbreak. “Where are the pros and cons here? You’ve got nursing homes out of hand sanitizer,” said Allan Delmare, a distiller at Dida’s Distillery in Huntly, Virginia, which had been purchasing ethanol to produce finished hand sanitizer."

19.443945164568284," ADM to temporarily idle ethanol output at 2 facilities on lower gasoline demand April 23 (Reuters) - Grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Thursday it will temporarily idle ethanol production at two of its corn dry mill facilities due to lower gasoline demand. The decision affects the corn dry mill facilities in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Columbus, Nebraska and ADM said it plans to furlough about 90 employees in each facility for four months. “The current market conditions and the low consumer demand for gasoline at this time have greatly impacted the entire ethanol industry,” Chris Cuddy, president of the company’s carbohydrate solutions unit said. Biofuel producers have also been among those hit by the energy industry in crisis, due to plummeting demand for gasoline and jet fuel following severe global travel restrictions to stem the coronavirus spread. “The evaporation of fuel demand due to COVID-19 has been a knock-out blow to biofuel plants across the heartland,” biofuel trade association Growth Energy said.

11.998221380067054," Four workers at ADM Clinton, Iowa, corn facility test positive for coronavirus (Reuters) - Four workers at an Archer Daniels Midland Co corn processing facility in Clinton, Iowa, have tested positive for coronavirus, the company said on Monday. The employees and those they have come in contact with have been quarantined and the facility is being deep cleaned to prevent further spread, the Chicago-based grain trader and processor said. “Right now, we are able to continue operations at the plant with some staffing adjustments. We are continuing to closely monitor the situation and are communicating with employees and local health authorities as things evolve,” ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said in an emailed statement. Outbreaks of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have disrupted food chains around the globe, from shuttering meat processing plants due to sick workers to stalling deliveries of grains and produce amid restrictions on movement. Iowa is one of the few U.S. states remaining that have not imposed official statewide stay-at-home restrictions. ADM’s Clinton corn plant is located on a larger ADM complex along the Mississippi River that also loads grain barges serving export terminals near the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana."
-18.27034466699559," ADM fourth-quarter profit beats estimates on biodiesel, consumer trends CHICAGO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co's ADM.N fourth quarter profit topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, driven by its nutrition business and refined products unit, which includes biodiesel and food oils. ADM released earnings results after the market closed and its stock rose 3.15%, to $45.06 a share, in after-hours trading. The company said it got a boost from the passage by U.S. lawmakers of a retroactive biodiesel tax credit late last year, which allowed for a $1-per-gallon subsidy for fuel made from cooking oil, soybean oil and animal fats. Even absent the tax credit, results were strong due to global demand for those products, the Chicago-based firm said. Its biggest segment in terms of revenue, Ag Services and Oilseeds, performed better but faced numerous challenges, including a delayed corn and soybean harvest in the United States which led to lower export volumes and tighter margins during the peak U.S. export season. ADM’s bioproducts segment posted a $159 million loss in 2019, as its struggling ethanol business continued to face tough industry margins, the company said. ADM is moving some dry ethanol mills into a wholly-owned subsidiary while the company evaluates strategic alternatives. Oilseed crushing margins, too, were lower than the prior year’s near-record levels due to problems with Argentina’s 2018 soybean crop - as many Wall Street analysts had expected. But it was the nearly 65% jump in quarterly revenues in ADM’s nutrition unit - particularly its Wild Flavors & Specialty Ingredients group - that officials highlighted. ADM and its peers, hit by a years-long crop supply glut, have been seeking to shed poor-performing assets and invest in businesses with the potential for higher profit margins, such as specialty food ingredients and flavorings. Earlier this month, ADM unveiled a new corporate logo, and Chief Executive Juan Luciano on Wednesday touted how the 118-year firm was focusing on developing products for fast-growing consumer trends, “from alternative proteins, to foods and beverages that enhance health, to unique products for pets.” ADM, which took a $133 million asset impairment and restructuring charge in the quarter, is one of the so-called ""ABCD"" quartet of grain traders, alongside Louis Dreyfus Co AKIRAU.UL, Bunge Ltd BG.N and Cargill Inc CARG.UL. Net earnings rose 60% to $504 million, or 90 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. On adjusted basis, the company earned 81 cents, beating analyst estimates of 69 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. Total revenue rose 2.4% to $16.33 billion."

7.3421156205843605," Nutrition business helps ADM weather trade war impact, results beat forecasts BANGALORE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, as increased returns in its nutrition business and improved U.S. grain marketing efforts helped cushion the impact of sluggish commodity prices, ethanol industry troubles and trade war woes. Chicago-based ADM and its rivals have been restructuring their businesses after a years-long crop supply glut thinned margins and sapped profits. Adding to the challenges are the U.S.-China trade war and a deadly pig disease that has dampened demand for soymeal in China. Lower demand from China, the world’s biggest hog producer and soybean importer, has led to a tightening of ADM’s oilseed processing margins both in the U.S. and South America, and turned the company’s focus toward other export markets, including Vietnam. African Swine Fever in China killing millions of pigs also has affected what crops some plants are processing, said ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano. While some U.S. customers are planning soymeal production increases, Luciano said, “We’ve seen some of the plants that are dedicated to export in Brazil taking some of that capacity down. We’re seeing some shift in Europe, also, from soybean to rape(seed) just because there is more profitability there.” Excluding special items, ADM earned 77 cents per share in the third quarter, beating average analyst estimates by 8 cents, according to IBES Refinitiv data. ADM shares rose nearly 3% to $41.67. Adjusted earnings from its carbohydrate solutions segment fell 36.8% to $182 million due to lower margins at its ethanol business. The nutrition business was a bright spot for ADM, with a 76% jump in adjusted operating profit, as the company pushes for growth by investing in specialty items such as pea protein and other plant-based, protein-rich ingredients, which supply trendy vegan products. The company also reported a reduction in its stock-based compensation, which helped bolster quarterly results. ADM is one of the so-called ""ABCD"" quartet of grain traders, alongside Louis Dreyfus Co [AKIRAU.UL], Bunge Ltd BG.N and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL]. Smaller rival Bunge also beat estimates for profit on Wednesday. But it warned of a drop in annual profit due to mounting challenges to its grain trading and processing business. Extreme weather in the United States, which caused historic late plantings in much of the Midwest and led to a delayed and wet harvest this fall, has impacted ADM and other grain merchants’ supply chains, company officials said on Thursday. How much those delays could hurt ADM’s bottom line next quarter is unclear. The company does expect to see “some significant drying revenue” in the coming months, as U.S. farmers deliver wet grain that will need to be dried, ADM Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on a call with analysts. The company is still well-positioned for improved results going into the next year, company executives said, pointing to opportunities in both plant-based proteins and improving crush margins. “We are fundamentally believers in the crush environment for 2020 given 3% growth outside China,” Luciano said. ADM’s revenue rose 5.8% to $16.72 billion in the quarter, supported in part by higher sales across segments."

14.36237311860536," Lawsuit alleges ADM manipulated cash ethanol market to profit from derivatives CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grain trader and food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co allegedly manipulated the price of ethanol to profit from a short position it was holding in the derivatives market, according to a lawsuit by a rival firm. AOT Holdings, a Swiss company that owns an energy trading subsidiary, filed the class action complaint late on Wednesday in U.S. District Court’s Central District of Illinois Urbana Division, claiming damages from ADM’s actions of up to $6.33 million. The lawsuit follows reporting by Reuters last year that ADM’s ethanol selling had led traders to complain to S&P Global Platts, which provides benchmark pricing for the physical ethanol contract at different U.S. delivery points including Chicago. According to the lawsuit seen by Reuters, ADM was aggressively selling ethanol on the cash market at the Argo terminal just outside of Chicago. The selling would start 30 minutes ahead of the close of the trading day, it said. “The evidence indicates that ... much of ADM’s behavior was economically irrational and contrary to its self-interest as an ethanol producer -- unless it was intended to manipulate physical ethanol prices at the Argo Terminal,” the lawsuit said. Illinois-based ADM, a major ethanol producer, said in an email that it did not comment on pending litigation. The selling on the physical market began in November 2017 and continues through “today,” the lawsuit said. ADM’s selling came during an upheaval in the domestic ethanol market as U.S. demand flatlined and export markets, including China and Brazil, were cut off due in part to the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s widening trade disputes. Ethanol producers typically hold short positions as a hedging strategy but AOT claimed that ADM’s actions far outstripped those risk management needs. “These huge positions represented a significant departure from ADM’s previous hedging activities and bore no rational relationship to hedging ADM’s exposure to physical ethanol sales, the lawsuit said.” The lawsuit named ADM’s Ray Bradbury and Adam Kuffel, two employees in the ethanol division, as the architects of the plan but said that senior executives also knew of their activities. Bradbury and Kuffel could not be reached for comment. Shares of ADM were up 57 cents at $38.81 on Thursday after hitting a one-month high of $38.90."
4.082530889707625," ADM profit plunges as floods, U.S.-China trade war batter grain handler CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grain trader and food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N on Thursday reported a 41.3% drop in second-quarter adjusted profit and missed Wall Street expectations, after being battered by the U.S.-China trade war and severe U.S. weather this spring that disrupted production and transportation. The Chicago-based company’s performance so far this year represents a sharp reversal of fortunes from last year, when ADM’s profits surged after a drought in Argentina and the U.S.-China trade dispute boosted its trading and oilseed processing businesses. For the second quarter ended June 30, its adjusted net earnings for the quarter fell to $340 million, or 60 cents per share, from $579 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 4.5% to $16.3 billion. ADM had been expected to earn 61 cents per share, according to the mean Refinitiv estimate from 11 analysts. The biggest drop was in the company’s origination business, which reported a 63% fall in adjusted operating profit. ADM blamed this on heavy rains that halted barge traffic on the Mississippi River and shuttered some of its plants. The trade war also caused problems, as corn and other U.S. crops struggled to compete for sales in export markets. ADM executives had been banking on the dispute to have eased by the second quarter and had based a rebound of the company’s operating performance in the second half on broad grain purchases from China this summer. Such big purchases have not materialized. The company remains confident in U.S.-China trade resuming, but Chief Executive Juan Luciano acknowledged on Thursday “the timing is uncertain.” The trade fight is part of why ADM has been expanding into Europe, Brazil and South America, Luciano said on an analysts call on Thursday. Beyond the trade war, heavy rains and flooding battered ADM during the quarter with “unfavorable weather impacts” of about $65 million to its operating profits. Such extreme weather cost ADM $125 million in lost production for the first half of the year, Luciano said. ADM and Bunge Ltd BG.N, as well as peers Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], known as the ABCDs of global grain trading giants, all have wrestled with weather issues this year. But ADM was particularly vulnerable to the flooding, analysts say, because unlike its rivals, the concentration of its assets are in the United States. The company said it faced processing plant downtime and barge shipping delays this spring as historic floods ravaged the central United States. High water conditions were more severe than originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, ADM said in its earning statement, “causing a negative impact of approximately $40 million.” Meanwhile, its oilseeds’ business North American crush volumes dropped and flooding caused production outages at its Quincy, Illinois, facility, “which had a negative impact of approximately $10 million,” the company said. ADM South American crushing and origination margins also were down because of higher soybean prices and lower China demand during the quarter. Severe weather issues affected ADM’s carbohydrate solutions business and reduced segment results by $15 million, in part because of flood-related issues at its Columbus, Nebraska, facility, the company said. The company, which has been pushing to cut its workforce and streamline operations to curb costs, said on Thursday the results also include non-cash early retirement charges and global workforce restructuring charges of $101 million. In April, ADM said it was seeking voluntary early retirements by some North American employees and may eliminate individual jobs as part of a restructuring effort. The company also pointed out that it is starting to spot economic ripple effects from the outbreak of African swine fever, a fatal hog disease that has killed millions of pigs in China. As China has increased its imports of poultry and pork, ADM said it has seen meat companies upgrade their production facilities to prepare for increased demand from China, Luciano said on the analysts. ADM said that it thinks China has lost about 35% of its hog herd and will continue to see a drop in pork production into next year, Luciano said. That will eventually boost demand for soymeal feedstuffs in South America, Europe, the United States and elsewhere, Luciano said. “This will be a large multiyear event for our industry, and we continue to believe it will support incremental demand for the global crush industry outside China,” Luciano said."

-1.1788979188127313," ADM marries grain trading, oilseed units; second revamp in 14 months CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Wednesday it will consolidate five business units into four in the company’s second reorganization in just over a year as adverse weather and a U.S.-China trade dispute threaten profits. ADM will combine its grain trading and oilseeds segments into a new business unit called Ag Services & Oilseeds, effective July 1, in a move that analysts say could better streamline its North American operations and cut costs. The new unit will be led by Greg Morris, former president of ADM’s oilseeds unit. The revamp comes during a particularly challenging period for grain merchants ADM and rivals Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, known as the ABCD quartet that dominates global agricultural commodities trade. The companies have shifted operations and reorganized management teams as profits have been squeezed by a global grains glut, low crop prices and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has stifled global commodities flows. Severe weather in North America has heaped further pressure on the sector, including exceptionally harsh cold this winter and record-breaking spring floods that combined to cut ADM’s first quarter operating profit by $50-$60 million. “They may be getting more aggressive at looking at aspects of the business for cost efficiencies because of those headwinds,” said Bill Densmore, senior director of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings. ADM last restructured its business groups in March 2018. The company said in April that it is seeking voluntary early retirements in North America and may eliminate individual jobs as part of a restructuring of specific areas. Cargill has been overhauling its corporate structure in recent years following a string of disappointing quarterly results. Bunge revamped its operations three weeks ago for the second time in 18 months. ADM said the new Ag Services & Oilseeds division, which will combine ADM’s global trading, transportation and oilseeds-processing businesses, is “a natural evolution.” “This helps us better integrate the supply and value chains to deliver significant simplification and efficiency to the day-to-day business,” CEO Juan Luciano said in a statement. ADM shares were down slightly in early afternoon trading at $38.42 a share, a three-year low."

0.07862654910772066," ADM considers ethanol spinoff as first-quarter profit falls on severe weather CHICAGO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Friday it was considering spinning off its ethanol business after slim biofuel margins and Midwestern floods slammed the U.S. grains merchant’s profit, which tumbled 41% in the first quarter. A major cause was the “bomb cyclone” blizzards that devastated the Midwest and Great Plains this year, causing massive flooding across Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, washing out rail lines and wreaking havoc in the moving and processing of grains. One-sixth of U.S. ethanol production was halted. “The first quarter proved more challenging than initially expected,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Juan Luciano, citing weaker earnings in its starches, sweeteners and bioproducts unit for the quarter ended March 31. In March, ADM warned Wall Street that flooding and severe winter weather in the U.S. Midwest would reduce its first-quarter operating profit by $50 million to $60 million. Ongoing turmoil in the ethanol industry also hurt ADM and “limited margins and opportunities” for the business, said Luciano. ADM has been looking to strengthen its core businesses of trading, processing and transporting corn, soybeans and wheat and other crops as the U.S.-China trade war continues to roil global agriculture. ADM is expecting the trade fight to end before the U.S. harvest this fall, Luciano told analysts on an earnings call Friday. That, in turn, would help strengthen ADM’s performance in the second half of the year, and bolster U.S. grains and livestock producers, Luciano said. The U.S. agricultural sector is expecting to export more ethanol to China to meet growing demand for the biofuel and more protein as African swine fever (ASF) continues to spread. China is struggling to control the ASF epidemic, which some analysts predict could kill up to 200 million pigs or lead to them being culled this year, causing a huge shortage of pork in the world’s top producer. Despite bullish signals for U.S. ethanol demand, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young told analysts “a case for consolidation” remains in the sector, which is in a historic downswing due to the U.S.-China trade war, excess domestic supply and weak margins. Rival producers such as Green Plains Inc and Pacific Ethanol Inc have laid off workers and idled or sold plants to stay afloat during the sustained downturn. ADM is creating an independent ethanol subsidiary which would allow options such as a potential spin-off of the business to existing ADM shareholders, the company said. The unit will include dry mills in Columbus, Nebraska; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Peoria, Illinois. ADM also said it planned to repurpose its corn wet mill in Marshall, Minnesota, to produce higher volumes of food and industrial-grade starches. ADM shares fell 2.2% to $40.79 shortly after midday. Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $233 million, or 41 cents per share, from $393 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $15.30 billion from $15.53 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 46 cents per share, versus analysts’ average estimate of 60 cents according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
0.07862654910772066," ADM's move to spin off ethanol assets speaks to industry's woes NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Biofuels pioneer Archer Daniels Midland took another step toward abandoning its pure-play ethanol assets on Friday, the latest sign of the industry’s struggles with U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade wars, thin margins, and overproduction. U.S. law requires ethanol to be blended into gasoline but domestic demand for the biofuel added to gasoline has flatlined in recent years as consumers have opted for greater fuel-efficiency and electric vehicles. Ethanol producers have been forced to look abroad for demand growth. They had banked on China to buy excess capacity, but punitive tariffs in the last two years have halted buying, exacerbating the industry’s substantial overcapacity. ADM executives acknowledged that problem on Friday when the company reported that profit tumbled 41 percent in the first quarter. ADM said it may spin off three large dry mills, which primarily produce only ethanol, after unsuccessfully searching for a buyer for those mills since 2016. At the time, its move to exit ethanol shocked the industry due to ADM’s status as a leading biofuels producer. ADM Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on an earnings call that the industry must stop the self-inflicted wounds. “Our decision to monetize the dry mills is frankly a strategic decision on our part to basically help the industry consolidate,” Young said. Last week, U.S. ethanol production hit 1.05 million barrels per day, highest in at least five years seasonally, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Inventories climbed to 22.75 million barrels, not far from the record of 24.45 million hit in March. Producers such as Green Plains and Pacific Ethanol have laid off workers and idled or sold plants to stay afloat during the sustained downturn. Ethanol prices are down 42 percent in the last five years, while Green Plains and Pacific Ethanol have seen their shares fall 33 percent and 92 percent, respectively, in that time. “We don’t have a demand problem as much as we have a supply problem. There are just too many inefficient plants out there, and they need to go before we see a rebound,” said one ethanol trader on Friday. “It’s not like we are producing DVDs or CDs that no one wants.” China emerged in 2015 as a significant buyer for the first time, and subsequent plans to use ethanol in gasoline nationwide by 2020 raised hopes that the world’s second largest economy would scoop up excess U.S. supply. But Beijing hiked import taxes on the biofuel in 2017, and then twice in 2018 as the United States and China ratcheted up the stakes in a trade war that has killed demand for U.S. imports. The two countries are still negotiating a trade deal that would end the tariff conflict. Young said margins will improve with resolution of the trade dispute and purchase commitments from China expected to accompany any pact. Still, some say that will be a temporary boost. “Exports may provide some temporary relief,” said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. “(But) without substantial growth from higher ethanol blends you are looking at situation where the U.S. ethanol industry has to shrink” over the next 5-10 years.”"

-2.4915241087186484," U.S. grain trader ADM says to seek early retirements, may cut jobs CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Wednesday it will seek voluntary early retirements by some North American employees and may eliminate individual jobs as part of a restructuring of specific areas. The actions are needed to strengthen ADM’s core business and establish the company as a global leader in nutrition, the company said in a statement. ADM makes money trading, processing and transporting crops, such as corn, soybeans and wheat. It competes against other merchants in the so-called “ABCD” group of traders, which also includes Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co. Such companies have been rattled by the trade war between Washington and Beijing, which has reduced shipments of American farm products to China. In recent years, a global glut of crops also hurt agricultural companies and accelerated consolidation in the sector. The voluntary early retirements are among a range of actions ADM is taking between now and June 30 to improve productivity, growth and service to customers, according to the company. In response to questions from Reuters, company spokeswoman Jackie Anderson declined to say how many employees were being targeted for retirement. “Contrary to rumors, we are not considering a sale of our grain handling business,” she said. ADM expects the number of workers whose jobs are eliminated to be a very small percentage of its global workforce, Anderson said. The company, which had 31,600 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, will try to find other roles for those workers, she said. Chicago-based ADM said it will be realigning its “organization worldwide as we further streamline and standardize processes, implement new technologies and eliminate overlap in roles and responsibilities.” The company has been trying to sell two U.S. dry ethanol mills since 2016. ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano told Reuters in January the company was pursuing growth in its nutrition business through smaller acquisitions and potential joint ventures in agricultural processing and other areas. The company’s nutrition unit manufactures, sells and distributes natural flavor ingredients and other specialty products. The segment posted an operating profit of $339 million last year, compared to $546 million for its origination business, which includes grain handling. ADM last month warned that flooding and severe winter weather in the U.S. Midwest would trim its first-quarter operating profit by $50 million to $60 million.

-3.6657658942991507," DowDupont cuts sales forecast as Midwest floods hit agri division (Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc cut its forecast for first-quarter sales on Thursday, citing the impact of U.S. Midwest floods on its agri business as well as weakness in its packaging and specialty plastics division. Record floods have devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt across Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and several other states, idling ethanol plants, slowing rail shipments of agricultural products and swamping storage bins holding grain from previous harvests. The company said the floods have limited its ability to deliver products to customers, while delaying pre-season applications. Sales from its agri business are expected to be down 4 percent to 6 percent and operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are expected to be down by $125 million to $150 million, DowDupont said. Grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co was also forced to lower its first-quarter profit forecast on Monday due to floods and a severe winter. For the first quarter, DowDupont now expects net sales to be down in the high single-digit percentage range. It had previously forecast sales to fall in the mid single-digit percentage range. DowDupont also forecast a $100 million reduction in its materials science division’s operating EBITDA, compared with previous expectations, due to lower margins in packaging and specialty plastics globally."
3.8232248095573795," ADM fourth-quarter profit misses as U.S.-China trade war stings, shares drop (Reuters) - U.S. grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter 2018 earnings as the U.S.-China trade war roiled global agriculture, sending its shares down more than 6 percent. Three of its four business units reported lower results, including ADM’s grain trading origination business, where adjusted operating profit slumped 30 percent to $183 million despite higher volumes of North American corn and soybean exports to markets outside of China. Profits were also hurt by “significant insurance settlements” among ADM’s businesses tied to sorghum shipments in early 2018. Last April, Reuters reported that several ships carrying cargoes of sorghum, a niche animal feed, from the United States to China changed course after Beijing slapped hefty anti-dumping deposits on U.S. imports. An anti-dumping probe by Beijing, which halted trade between the world’s biggest buyer and seller of the grain early last year, was among the first fights between the United States and China, which are still embroiled in a trade war. ADM’s origination unit, which buys grain from farmers, received an intra-company settlement in the quarter from its captive insurance subsidiary related to sorghum shipments intended for China in the first half of 2018, ADM said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday. One key bright spot was its oilseeds unit, with quarterly operating profit more than doubling. The unit crushes soybeans and exports beans grown in Brazil and elsewhere. Crush volumes for the quarter “were among the highest ever,” with oilseeds’ operating profit up almost 80 percent for full-year 2018 from the year earlier, ADM Chief Financial Officer Ray Young told analysts on a conference call. Crush margins “will not be as spectacular” in 2019, ADM Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said on the call, although margins would be above the average from the last five years. “Despite maybe some modest reduction in crush margins versus the previous year, we expect that we’re well positioned to grow profits in 2019,” Luciano said. ADM’s fourth-quarter woes came amid a bruising U.S.-China trade fight that virtually halted sales of U.S. soybeans to the world’s top importer, swelling supplies and dragging prices to decade lows. But as China turned to Brazil for its soybeans, grain traders including ADM jumped at the chance to ship the oilseeds from South America, and buy them at a discount from U.S. farmers for processing. Luciano acknowledged that “rapidly changing trade, geopolitical and market conditions” had an impact on the company. Profit also declined at ADM’s other two business units. The carbohydrate solutions business was pressured in part by poor margins in corn-based ethanol production, while its nutrition group was hurt by lower sales and margins in Europe and the Middle East, and lower margins in North America. ADM also had some production problems during the quarter, including a dust explosion and fire last November at its massive Decatur, Illinois, processing complex, hurting results. Net earnings attributable to ADM fell to $315 million, or 55 cents per share, from $788 million, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier, when the company recorded $249 million in tax gains. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 88 cents per share, while analysts, on average, estimated 92 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell to $15.95 billion from $16.07 billion. The consensus analyst estimate was $16.81 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The stock was down 6.1 percent to $41.77 in early-afternoon trading."

Gleadell, based in Gainsborough in eastern England, is one of Britain's largest traders of grains, oilseeds and pulses. Competitors include Cargill CARG.UL and Associated British Foods ABF.L joint venture Frontier Agriculture and co-operative Openfield.

Key assets include port storage and ship loading operations along with extensive pulse and agricultural seed processing. “ADM and InVivo are convinced that Gleadell should develop a robust project firmly based on its domestic market. The strategy of InVivo, meanwhile, is more based on sourcing from French cooperatives for exporting outside the EU,” Stephane Bernhard, InVivo’s head of trading, said in an emailed statement.

0.09031471692214695," Exclusive: ADM CEO says wrong time for 'monster' acquisitions CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) has looked at buying rivals including Bunge Ltd. and dozens of other companies but decided the time is not right for “monster” acquisitions, the company’s chief executive told Reuters. ADM’s overture to Bunge last year, reported by Reuters and other media, fueled Wall Street speculation of further consolidation among the world’s major trading houses that sell, store and ship crops. “I cannot run ADM and say Bunge is out there, oh, I never made an analysis of Bunge. Of course we do,” CEO and Chairman Juan Luciano said in a rare interview to discuss M&A strategy. He explained ADM has also analyzed other companies in the past including Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], the other members of the so-called ABCD group of grain traders. Luciano declined to comment on whether ADM had formally made a bid for New York-based Bunge. ADM is pursuing growth in its nutrition business through smaller acquisitions and potential joint ventures in agricultural processing and other areas, he said. “We feel we don’t need that monster transformational transaction,” Luciano said at ADM’S Chicago headquarters. High valuations and M&A competition are also deterrents from large acquisitions, Luciano said. “When credit becomes tighter, we might flex our balance sheet a little bit more, when there’s a little bit less competition,” he said. Acquiring Bunge would be “a nice optimization,” Luciano said. “But I have a lot of the things that Bunge has,” so there is “not a lot of urgency to me.” Bunge shares fell about 2 percent after Luciano’s comments were published. ADM’s shares briefly turned positive and then traded down 0.3 percent. Analysts have said ADM’s conservative trading strategy and diversification into flavors and nutrition helped it weather a deep slump in commodity prices better than some rivals during a global soy and corn surplus and the U.S.-China trade war. Still, it is the only major trading company without crushing capacity in Luciano’s native Argentina, the world’s top exporter of soy meal and oil made by processing soybeans. That has increased investor expectations of ADM striking a deal with Bunge or acquiring an Argentine crushing company such as Molinos Agro. “At the right time, we will go into Argentina,” Luciano said. He said crushing plants in Argentina were running at around 65 percent capacity and would only fall further if ADM built a new plant, limiting profit margins and further flooding the marketplace. ADM announced on Friday the acquisition of flavors and fragrances firm Florida Chemical Company (FCC), a division of Flotek Industries, for $175 million. Luciano said ADM evaluates more than 50 companies each year, and added he was open to more joint ventures with competitors, like the one ADM did with privately held Cargill in Egypt. ADM does not have any JVs with Bunge, which was approached by commodity trader Glencore Plc in 2017. “We don’t have joint ventures with Bunge, candidly, because they were in turmoil during this time,” he said. Bunge was particularly hard hit by a global grains glut and currency issues in South America that crimped its profits before the U.S.-China trade war upended global commodities markets. Bunge spokesman Frank Mantero declined to comment, saying only “we are business as usual at Bunge.” ADM does not have any joint ventures with Louis Dreyfus Co. either. Louis Dreyfus did not respond to a request for comment. Luciano said he meets regularly with U.S. and Chinese officials, and believes the countries will resolve their trade war this year, though he worried about long-term tensions. “I think the longer it lasts, the more it complicates our lives,” he said, explaining Canadian or Russian soymeal could become alternatives to the United States. In an example of shifting trade flows, he said ADM had sold U.S. soybeans to Argentina after prices for U.S. beans plummeted when China virtually stopped buying them. Argentina, the world’s No. 3 soybean grower after Brazil, was the world’s top importer of U.S. soybeans last year. As part of its corporate strategy in recent years, ADM has sold assets like Brazilian sugar and Bolivian oilseed ventures. ADM is “90-something percent” done with its strategic review, he said. The company’s two U.S. dry ethanol mills have been for sale since 2016. Luciano said offers ADM had received were too low. It is holding on to its so-called wet mills, which produce more products than dry mills. “We are a nutrition company, not a fuel company so ethanol is not our main thrust,” he said."
-0.011829473772551544," InVivo looks to pesticide-free food, French bread for future growth PARIS (Reuters) - French agricultural cooperative InVivo said on Tuesday it wants to invest heavily in new farming techniques to support pesticide-free food and is considering making bread as it seeks new growth drivers after the sale of its animal nutrition unit. InVivo, a grouping of around 200 farmer-owned cooperatives, is selling Neovia to U.S. agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland in a deal expected to bring the French group 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to invest in other areas. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of next year and means InVivo will no longer be present in cereal processing. But with grains’ trading less profitable than in the past and cereals still the core of its cooperative network, InVivo would look at ways to develop other cereal products like bread, particularly for Asia, Chief Executive Thierry Blandinieres told reporters on Tuesday. “Asia is going to be the boom region for wine and for bakery goods,” he said, noting InVivo was already testing a French food outlet, ‘So France’, in Singapore. As part of an overhaul since 2014, InVivo has also expanded its retail network, scaled back grain trading and entered wine distribution. Neovia accounted for two-thirds of InVivo’s core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 163 million euros in its 2017/18 year to June 30. EBITDA rose from 133 million euros in 2016/17. Despite the sale of Neovia, InVivo aims to lift EBITDA back above the 2017/18 level within four years, helped by its Bioline farming division and expansion along the food chain, Blandinieres said. Bioline will use digital tools and natural pest control methods to help produce food free of pesticide residues, Blandinieres said. With organic farming set to remain only a small part of farming, the key to meeting demand for sustainable food would be changing practices in mainstream agriculture, he said, noting that InVivo’s pilot farms had recorded a 17 percent drop in pesticide use in the past decade while yields increased. However, he criticized France’s push to phase out common weedkiller glyphosate within three years, when the European Union has extended the product’s license for five years. Bioline, which has a target to triple sales to 1 billion euros by 2025 and reach EBITDA of 100 million euros, is developing a platform approach to bundling digital services for cooperatives along the lines of online retailer Amazon, he said. InVivo’s group sales totaled 5.2 billion euros in 2017/18, down from 5.5 billion the previous year."
-1.2565040879270177," U.S. ethanol producers seek pricing reform as markets plunge, ADM sells NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. ethanol producers stung by collapsing prices are seeking changes to the way benchmark values for the biofuel are established, arguing the current system used by exchanges is vulnerable to manipulation, according to sources. The push comes as the key farm belt industry struggles with weak demand growth, a loss of export markets due to the U.S. trade war with China, and aggressive selling by global commodities giant Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N that have pushed ethanol prices to 13-year lows. ADM is better placed to survive a long stretch of low prices than its ethanol-focused U.S. rivals, many of whom are concerned the company is deliberately pressuring the biofuel market lower to drive them out of business and are keen for a stable hedging tool to defend against further dips. Top U.S. ethanol producer POET LLC has asked the CME Group CME.O to change its pricing method for a key swap contract used by the industry to hedge, and the rival ICE exchange is contemplating offering an alternative to CME's product after discussions with biofuels companies, according to three sources familiar with the moves who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly. CME's Chicago ethanol swap contract CUUc1 is the most widely used derivative instrument the industry uses to protect itself against market fluctuations. But traders have recently been reluctant to use the contract for fear it will expose them to further losses due to the strong selling by ADM. CME currently calculates the swap contract’s value by averaging the monthly daily settlement price in the physical market as provided by commodities pricing company Platts. Several ethanol producers want that method changed. Critics say the Platts price can be easily manipulated because it is based on deals that occur only during a 30 minute window each day, as opposed to during the whole day. In November, ADM represented more than 90 percent of sales in the Chicago Platts window, two traders said. ADM declined to comment for the story and has never publicly defended itself against criticism about its activity in the trading window. ADM CEO Juan Ricardo Luciano blamed overproduction and the loss of sales to China for the industry’s recent woes in the latest earnings call. Platts did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story. The issue has become more urgent as slumping prices force ADM rivals like Green Plains, POET and Valero to shut, idle, or sell off plants. U.S. ethanol prices have dropped below $1.20 a gallon 1ZEc1, the lowest in about 13 years, with inventories swelling to records. POET, the nation’s leading ethanol producer at two billion gallons a year, last month filed a complaint about the issue with CME, which sets the rules for the ethanol swap contract, the company confirmed to Reuters. “POET submitted a complaint to CME outlining our concerns regarding the Chicago Ethanol Swap contract. Our concerns are with the market-influencing impacts of this specific contract,” POET spokesman Matt Merritt said in an email. He declined to provide other details. Two sources who read the letter said the complaint argues the swap contract is based on a flawed pricing method that a single company can manipulate. The letter does not identify ADM, the sources said. CME spokesman Chris Grams declined comment. A rival derivatives exchange, Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, is considering offering an alternative to CME's contract that would incorporate some of the changes sought by ethanol traders, such as using a full-day average physical price to determine the settlement price, the two sources, along with an additional source familiar with the effort, told Reuters. ICE is planning to study the idea until at least the end of the year before making any decision, the sources said. ICE said, “We are constantly evaluating opportunities that could meet customer demand and complement our global energy suite.” Separately, terminal operator Zenith Energy Management is talking to traders about the possibility of a new ethanol storage hub in Joliet, Illinois, to rival Kinder Morgan Inc's KMI.N Argo terminal near Chicago – the main delivery point for Chicago ethanol, the two sources familiar with the efforts said. The terminal, about 30 miles south of Argo, would allow shippers to bypass congested rail lines in Chicago and provide a new outlet to other trading hubs where prices are higher. A spokesperson for Zenith did not respond to a request for comment. It is unclear to what extent other ethanol producers have joined the efforts to make changes to pricing. Ethanol maker Green Plains Inc GPRE.O told investors in a recent earnings call that it was working with other companies to seek alternatives to the current pricing methodology, without elaborating."
-12.829146483114117," Exclusive: Agribusiness giant ADM made buyout approach to Argentina's Molinos – sources BUENOS AIRES/LONDON (Reuters) - Top U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N has approached Argentine soy crusher Molinos Agro MOLA.BA about buying the company's livestock feed and soyoil manufacturing plant, and talks may continue, three sources said. Molinos and other Argentine soy crushers have been pummeled by fallout from the U.S.-China trade policy war which has given U.S. crushers a competitive advantage. The discussions began last year and then stalled over the price that ADM would pay for Molinos, a Buenos Aires-based industry source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. ADM declined to comment. A spokesman for the Perez Companc business group, which controls Molinos Agro, said the company had been approached “several times” by potential buyers. Without mentioning ADM in particular, the spokesman said “the offers were rejected.” It was unclear how much Molinos, controlled by the Perez Companc business group, was valued at during the negotiations. “ADM backed off because of the asking price,” the Buenos Aires-based industry source said. “There were differences in the valuation of the company. But it is logical that ADM could be back knocking on the door of Molinos.” The Argentine company reported 665.9 million pesos ($18.5 million) in net earnings for the April through September period. Company results could be pressured by tensions over global trade policy in the months ahead, the source said. “Next year will be a great year for buying soy crushing companies in Argentina, and a bad year for selling them,” the source added. Argentine crushers are working at about half capacity while U.S. crushers are reaping the benefits of low soy prices after China slapped a 25-percent import tariff on U.S. beans. The Perez Companc group has taken a “conservative” stance toward ADM’s overtures and has shown no eagerness to sell, the source said. Two separate international industry sources with knowledge of the situation said exploratory talks between ADM and Molinos had taken place this year. “Argentina is a key focus for ADM and they need assets there,” one said. “ADM will seek to take advantage of its strong position by taking over a major Argentine crushing operation that is being squeezed by the trade war,” another added. An ADM-Molinos combination would be in line with recent consolidation of the sector which has wrestled with a global oversupply of grains and oilseeds. The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has reordered trade flows across the global grains sector, affecting companies like ADM, Bunge BG.N, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, which together are known as the “ABCDs” and dominate the industry. The trade policy dispute between the world’s two largest economies has driven down U.S. soybean prices, which in turn has helped fuel profits for U.S. soybean processors. ADM reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit this week, cashing in on strong oilseed crushing margins. ADM is the only one of the “ABCDs” that has no crushing capacity in Argentina. The company’s chief financial offer Ray Young said this week the group may look at mergers and acquisitions in general if a deal made sense. ADM earlier this year made a takeover approach for Bunge. Crushing plants that dot the banks of the Parana River, Argentina’s main grains thoroughfare, are seeking to revive their business with a deal that would permit them for the first time to export soymeal livestock feed to China. China generally imports beans to be crushed on the mainland, but with trade tension rising with Washington, Beijing may want to lock in alternative supplies. The U.S.-China conflict, which has shifted global commodity trade routes and distorted prices, is not the only factor ailing Argentine crushers. Earlier this year the sector was hit by a drought on the Pampas farm belt that shriveled soybean supplies. But over the long-term, with demand growing for soymeal feed needed for China’s massive pork sector, soy crushing along the Parana may thrive again. Argentina is the world’s top exporter of soymeal and soyoil, used for cooking and making biodiesel. The nation’s massive soy crushers and grains elevators are sandwiched between the Pampas and the deeply dredged Parana. The set-up offers logistical advantages over main competitors Brazil and the United States, where moving grains involves more costly ground transportation and loading products on and off barges. Molinos was formed in 1902 as a unit of Bunge. It was sold to the Perez Companc group in 1999. The company’s main crushing facility is in San Lorenzo, on the Parana. It has a nominal crushing capacity of 20,000 tonnes of soy per day. (The online version of this story has been refiled to fix headline)"
-10.882185146867885," ADM profit beats estimates on oilseed crushing, corn exports (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the U.S. grain merchant cashed in on strong oilseed crushing margins and export sales of American corn. Export demand for U.S. crops came from countries other than China, ADM said, as an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China curtailed shipments of U.S. farm products, including soybeans and sorghum, to the Asian nation. Sales to other buyers help offset the sting of the trade row, which has reordered the global grains business. China, the world’s top soy importer, has been buying soybeans from Brazil after Beijing imposed a tariff on U.S. imports in July. It may not need to turn back to the United States before South America harvests its next crop, ADM Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said. “Certainly we’re not going to have the China demand pool, but the rest of the world will be coming to us, particularly for corn,” Luciano said on a conference call. China is not a frequent importer of U.S. corn, but droughts in Brazil and Argentina have made buyers more reliant on the United States. ADM is among four companies that dominate the flow of agricultural goods around the world, competing against Bunge Ltd BG.N, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Corp. ADM may look at mergers and acquisitions in general if a deal makes sense, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on the call. ADM and commodity trader Glencore GLEN.L have previously made takeover approaches to Bunge. Young added that global demand for soymeal would remain robust next year, supporting ADM’s crushing margins. Strong margins have generated profits for global processors after a glut of crops hurt results in recent years. Margins improved after drought reduced soymeal exports from Argentina, the world’s top supplier. Operating profits for ADM’s oilseeds business more than tripled to $349 million in the quarter through Sept. 30. The company said it set a new record for crush volumes. “Record U.S. yields along with reduced export demand have kept a lid on CBOT soybean prices while demand for soy meal remains robust,” JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said. Net profit attributable to ADM surged to $536 million, or 94 cents per share, from $192 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 92 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 83 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose to $15.80 billion from $14.83 billion. Shares rose slightly to $48.16."

The companies perform similar functions: buying, selling, transporting and processing crops around the world. However their starkly different second-quarter earnings show how varying strategies can produce drastically different results, providing lessons for other global grain traders. ADM on Tuesday reported a doubling of quarterly profit from a year earlier, as higher volumes and margins for U.S. grain and soy exports put it in a strong position for trade gains through the rest of the year. A day later, Bunge stumbled to a surprise loss it blamed partly on wrong-sided bets that a prompt trade truce would push up soybean futures. Instead, the trade war escalated and prices fell sharply, piling pressure on the company to reverse losing positions. ADM, which is more focused on U.S. operations than Bunge, cashed in as China shifted its soybean purchases to Brazil because of the trade war, prompting other countries to buy more U.S. soy, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on an earnings call. Bunge reported a $125 million mark-to-market loss tied to soybean crush contracts in the April-to-June quarter and confirmed losses from hedges in the soy futures market that could have been profitable with a trade resolution. It also took a $24 million hit from currency hedges in Brazil. Bunge traders are known for taking more risk than those at ADM and they did not pay off this time, said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer for Capital Innovations, a shareholder of both companies. “With Bunge, it was the commodity as well as the currency exposure that showed up and was reflected in their lower earnings,” he said. The company defended its bet, saying it will recover those losses in the second half of the year as it cashes in on the robust soy processing margins locked in during the second quarter. ADM offset some of its mark-to-market losses in soy with gains on canola for an overall net mark-to-market loss of about $40 million. Bunge said it does not encourage traders to take more risks. ADM declined to comment on trading and hedging strategies. Both companies had said the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies was an opportunity to increase returns after a global oversupply of food commodities limited trading opportunities in recent years. “ADM has been able to deliver some of their improved results earlier than we have, and some of that is timing. But, in the case of Bunge, it’s coming,” Bunge Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder said in an interview. As the trade war drags on, Schroder said Bunge will continue with a strategy to lock in profit when it can because trade policies could quickly shift. “You have to be prepared for pretty much anything so our posture has been to lock down as much as we can, to secure as much of the future profitability as we can. That’s an approach that we’ll continue to take,” he told Reuters. Bunge’s prized South American grain handling and processing infrastructure, which has made it a takeover target over the past year, also proved a hindrance last quarter. While Chinese buying of Brazilian soy soared, Bunge’s grain origination business in the country was hurt by a trucker strike. It is under pressure to deliver better results after fending off takeover approaches from ADM and Glencore. “If they don’t deliver on the second half of this year, if I’m a board member I’m certainly more open to hearing talks of a takeover,” said Seth Goldstein, Morningstar analyst in Chicago. Analysts were divided on whether Bunge would be able to fully reverse its losses in the second half. CFRA lowered its price target by $5 to $78 per share but maintained its “buy” rating on Bunge shares, while J.P. Morgan downgraded its Bunge rating to neutral. Bunge has set a “high bar” for a second-half turnaround amid “uncertain trade policy and unresolved freight challenges in Brazil that may drive further earnings volatility in 2018,” said J.P Morgan analyst Ann Duignan."

-1.4316377990433786," ADM earnings double, helped by U.S.-China trade row CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co's ADM.N net profits doubled in the second quarter and beat Wall Street estimates, after a drought in Argentina and the U.S.-China trade spat boosted the U.S. grain merchant's trading and oilseed processing businesses. Shares were up 1 percent at $47.86 after touching a three-year high on the New York Stock Exchange. Operating profits for ADM’s origination business, which includes grain trading, in the April to June period more than tripled from a year ago to $189 million. The company benefited from higher volumes and margins for U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports as the drought reduced harvests in Argentina, a major supplier of the crops, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said. The ongoing trade battle also increased China’s demand for crops from South America, motivating other buyers to make purchases from the United States, he said on a conference call. In oilseeds, operating profits jumped 70 percent to $341 million as processing volumes reached a record high for the quarter, thanks to robust margins and China’s demand for South American soy, according to the company. “ADM is capitalizing on the market dislocations caused by the U.S.-China trade issues by shipping Brazilian beans to China and crushing cheap U.S. beans into soymeal and oil,” Stephens analyst Farha Aslam said. Washington this month imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. In return, China levied taxes on the same value of products from the United States, including soybeans and sorghum. Traders rushed shipments of U.S. soy to China before the tariff took effect on July 6. Commodity trader Cargill Inc's [CARG.UL] latest earnings also benefited from trade tensions. Rival Bunge Ltd BG.N is due to report quarterly results on Wednesday. In May, ADM said it would take a hit of about $30 million in the second quarter due to Beijing’s decision to impose stiff anti-dumping tariffs on sorghum, a livestock feed. However, those losses were slightly smaller than expected and offset by strong performance in other areas, such as ocean freight, according to the company. “I sort of think this tariff is good for you,” Morgan Stanley analyst Vincent Andrews told ADM executives on the call. More global demand for corn and wheat could shift to the United States because of hot, dry weather reducing global grain harvests, ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano said. Crop losses in Europe, the Black Sea region and Argentina represent a turnaround after years of global oversupply depressed grains prices and made it difficult for global grain merchants to make a profit buying and selling food staples such as corn, soy and wheat. Net profit attributable to ADM rose to $566 million, or $1 per share, in the second quarter, from $276 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.02 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 77 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

12.205252961586597," ADM to buy French animal nutrition business Neovia for $1.8 billion PARIS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) ADM.N is in exclusive talks to take over French animal feed business Neovia for 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) as part of the U.S. farm giant's strategy to expand in the fast-growing animal nutrition sector. Neovia is majority owned by French cooperative group InVivo. Investment group Eurazeo EURA.PA also has a 17 percent stake. The acquisition, first reported by Reuters, would make ADM a major player in the global animal feed industry, which the company says has sales of more than $700 billion. ADM and rival grain merchants such as Bunge Ltd BG.N and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] have struggled in recent years as a global oversupply of food commodities has made it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing, and selling corn, soy and wheat. The companies have been diversifying into higher-margin sectors, such as food ingredients and aquaculture feed, to compensate for the poor returns. “We were happy with our animal feed activities but it was too local,” Pierre-Christophe Duprat, ADM’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told Reuters. “If we wanted to expand we needed a more global approach.” The acquisition would be ADM’s second largest to date after it purchased natural food ingredients company Wild Flavors for $3 billion in 2014. Talks about a separate takeover of Bunge stalled this year, according to sources and media reports. ADM shares fell 1.3 percent on Monday to close at $45.23. Bunge shares slipped 0.6 percent to $69.33. Neovia, which had sales of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in 2017, produces and sells a range of products related to pet care, aquaculture, livestock feed and other areas. “If you’re management and your goal is to move away from the grain merchandising operations and the volatility that comes with that, this is the way to do it at a fair price,” said Seth Goldstein, equity analyst for Morningstar in Chicago. Neovia has a limited presence in North America but a large one in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, with 75 percent of its sales coming from outside Western Europe. This complements ADM’s animal nutrition business, which is primarily in the United States and has growing exposure in China, according to Fitch Ratings. ADM is the most U.S.-focused of the major grain companies and has been trying to expand its geographic footprint. The transaction can “serve as a platform for additional potential bolt-on acquisitions to expand the firm’s geographical reach,” Fitch Ratings said. ADM would divert its feed activities into Neovia’s to create a new unit, called ADM-Neovia, with combined sales approaching $3.5 billion, Duprat said. The takeover would lead to a reorganization and a likely reduction in staff in France, he said. ADM said the deal would offer run-rate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) synergies of about 50 million euros by the fourth full year after the transaction closes. The target seems “adequately conservative,” JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said. The deal would be 100 percent cash and is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of the year after a consultation process involving employee representatives and pending supervisory authority approval. Lazard is ADM’s financial adviser and Baker McKenzie its legal adviser. InVivo, France’s largest cooperative group, would use 1 billion euros expected from the sale to step up investment in new farming techniques and support acquisitions in wine, Chief Executive Thierry Blandinieres said in an interview. In another sign ADM is seeking to diversify its portfolio, the company said on Friday it would pay 185 million pounds ($242 million) to buy Probiotics International Limited, better known under its umbrella brand Protexin, a Britain-based maker of probiotic supplements for people and animals.

12.205252961586597," InVivo to use cash from ADM deal to expand in farming, wine PARIS, July 2 (Reuters) - French cooperative group InVivo will use 1 billion euros expected from the sale of its animal nutrition business to Archer Daniels Midland to step up investment in new farming techniques and support acquisitions in wine, its chief executive said. InVivo and ADM announced on Monday exclusive talks over the sale of 100 percent of animal feed business Neovia to the U.S. agricultural giant for 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion). As majority shareholder of Neovia with a 67 percent stake, InVivo, a grouping of French farmer-owned cooperatives, will earn around 1 billion euros from the sale and wants the proceeds to support growth in priority areas of farming techniques, wine distribution and retail, Thierry Blandinieres told Reuters. The group was aiming to speed up growth of its Bioline business, which develops new farming practices such as bio-control alternatives to pesticides, to reach a target of 1 billion euros in sales by 2022 instead of 2025 as previously planned, he said. Bioline currently has annual sales of about 350 million euros. “InVivo is going to pick up 1 billion to invest in French agriculture, that is part of our mission,” he said. The sale of Neovia reflects InVivo’s need to maintain a core French focus, Blandinieres said, noting that faster than expected overseas growth at Neovia meant that 80 percent of its sales were made outside France. InVivo was not interested in keeping a minority share in Neovia as its policy now is to hold majority stakes, and it was reassured by ADM’s commitment to continue partnerships Neovia has in France with InVivo cooperative members, he said. InVivo has already expanded its retail business in France by acquiring gardening chain Jardiland and is looking for overseas acquisitions to boost its wine distribution activity. Like other agricultural groups including bigger rivals such as ADM, it has been overhauling its grain trading business to overcome losses in recent years."
9.445898300251645," UPDATE 1-U.S., China trade fight 'will lead to serious consequences' -Cargill (Adds comments from Cargill, ADM) CHICAGO, June 15 (Reuters) - The current trade conflict between the United States and China “will lead to serious consequences for economic growth and job creation,” global commodities trader Cargill Inc said on Friday. “The impact of trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies will lead to serious consequences for economic growth and job creation and hurt those that are most vulnerable across the globe,” the company said in a statement. On Friday, China said it will impose additional 25 percent tariffs on 659 U.S. goods worth $50 billion - including on U.S. soybean imports, the single most valuable U.S. agricultural export to its Asian rival. Beijing’s move came in response to the U.S. announcement that it will levy tariffs on Chinese imports. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the day imposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports as he demanded better terms of trade from Beijing to close a $335 billion annual deficit. In the past, rival global grain merchants Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd have said they can withstand agricultural trade disruptions arising from U.S.-China tensions and potentially profit from them. But on Friday, ADM said it too hoped the tensions would ease soon. “China continues to be an important export market for American food and agriculture,” ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said in a statement. “We are hopeful that both governments continue to pursue a bilateral dialogue in support of a strong U.S.-China trade relationship.” Bunge declined to comment Friday. Cargill warned that tit-for-tat retaliatory measures will not solve the trade concerns raised by both China and the United States. “It is in the interest of both countries to come to the table around a negotiated solution such as a responsible trade agreement,” Cargill said. “Only through a rules-based system can everyone compete on an even playing field.” (Reporting By P.J.

13.041730629348855," UPDATE 4-China retreats from U.S. sorghum probe amid global market havoc * Move brings relief to Chinese importers, U.S. farmers * Seen as goodwill gesture while China vice premier in Washington * China launched probe in February, imposed duties in April * ADM has warned dispute will hurt trading profits (Adds comments from ADM, Kansas governor and U.S. trade group, and U.S. market reaction) By Hallie Gu and Tom Polansek BEIJING/CHICAGO, May 18 (Reuters) - China dropped its anti-dumping probe into imports of U.S. sorghum on Friday, beating a hasty retreat from a dispute that wreaked havoc across the global grain market and raised concerns about rising costs and financial damage at home. The move was seen as a goodwill concession as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was in Washington for talks aimed at resolving trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The end of the investigation came as a huge relief to U.S. sorghum growers, who saw sales to the top grain buyer come to a halt and prices plummet over the past month. But U.S. farmers and traders said they remained worried that China might still implement restrictions and tariffs on other agricultural products such as soybeans, corn and cotton. Tensions between the nations have climbed. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose up to $150 billion in punitive tariffs to lower trade deficits and combat what he calls Beijing’s misappropriation of American technology. China has threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on some of its largest U.S. imports including aircraft, soybeans and autos. China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement the investigation into sorghum, used in animal feed and liquor, had revealed that anti-dumping and anti-subsidies penalties would inflate living costs for Chinese consumers. China’s investigation, launched in early February, showed its top trading partner how much financial pain it could inflict on U.S. farmers, analysts said. Last month, Beijing imposed hefty anti-dumping deposits on imports of the grain. “China has taught a lesson to the United States and showed how it can hurt U.S. exports,” said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. “Now they are showing goodwill by halting its anti-dumping investigation into sorghum imports, but it is a cheap way of showing goodwill as the U.S. does not have much sorghum left to export. The next U.S. sorghum crop will be harvested in August.” Agricultural products are considered one of the most powerful weapons in Beijing’s arsenal because a strike against farm exports to China would hurt farmers in U.S. Midwestern states that backed Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The United States accounts for more than 90 percent of total sorghum shipments to China, with the American imports worth just over $1 billion last year. Most of Archer Daniels Midland Co’s sorghum shipments to China have already been diverted and resold to other markets, said Jackie Anderson, a spokeswoman for the agricultural trader. The company warned earlier this month it would take a $30 million hit to trading profit due to the dispute. “We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these developments on our business going forward,” Anderson said on Friday. The National Sorghum Producers, a U.S. industry trade group, submitted thousands of pages of information to China’s authorities to show that the United States was not dumping sorghum, the group’s Chairman Don Bloss said. Bloss said he hoped the end of the probe reflects an easing of trade tensions with Beijing. The deposit scheme stopped trade and disrupted supply chains worldwide, with almost two dozen ships carrying U.S. sorghum stranded at sea as merchants and buyers scrambled to sell cargoes at big discounts elsewhere. Frantic Chinese importers lobbied the government to rethink the plan amid worries that higher costs would be passed onto feedmakers and eventually push retail meat prices higher. Corn, soybean and soymeal futures in China fell on the news of the end of the probe as concerns eased that feedmakers would need to find alternative ingredients. In the United States, corn futures jumped as traders said the move signaled that supplies of livestock feed would tighten. U.S. soybean futures rose on hopes that the end of the probe is a step toward a broader trade agreement. Dropping the probe “is an important sign of progress in our efforts to resolve trade tension with China,” Kansas Governor Jeff Colyer said in a statement. China’s Commerce ministry said it would return the deposits on sorghum imports it collected, bringing relief to Chinese buyers who still had cargoes stuck at ports. “This is great news! We are now saved,” said a private sorghum trader who had more than 600 tonnes of U.S. sorghum stranded at a Chinese port. “We will clear our goods immediately today.” The government would not, however, compensate traders for losses linked to reselling or demurrage, said Cherry Zhang, analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd. “The damage has been done, and mainly to the domestic buyer,” Zhang said. The United States shipped 4.76 million tonnes of sorghum to China in 2017, worth around $1.1 billion and making up the bulk of China’s roughly 5 million tonnes of imports of the grain last year, according to Chinese customs data.

13.406751437712936," ADM, Bunge say they can navigate U.S.-China trade tensions CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global grain merchants Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd can withstand agricultural trade disruptions arising from U.S.-China tensions and potentially profit from them, company executives said on Wednesday. Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, and Ray Young, ADM’s chief financial officer, also said at an investor conference in New York that their companies were benefiting from a savage drought in Argentina that has increased soy processing margins and trading prospects. The companies are projecting improved profits in 2018, after massive global harvests increased grain stockpiles and reduced trading opportunities in recent years. The U.S. trade dispute with China may create additional opportunities for ADM, Young said, two weeks after the company warned the conflict could pinch revenue. “When we take a look at the short term, the medium term, as well as some of the trade frictions that are out there, we actually feel very, very confident about our prospects,” Young said. Grain traders such as ADM and Bunge have seized upon the tensions between the world’s two biggest economies to turn around struggling trading units. However, the dispute is also disrupting supply chains worldwide, with ships carrying U.S. sorghum turning around after Beijing raised prices for buyers. Soybean buyers in China have separately shifted purchases to Brazil from the United States, after Beijing threatened tariffs on imports of U.S. products including soybeans. The crop is America’s top agricultural export to China, worth more than $12 billion last year. ADM is confident the countries will “get through” the dispute, and sees an opportunity for China to import additional ethanol, Young said. For Bunge, the dispute provides a chance for the company to make use of its global footprint, which includes oilseed processing facilities in the United States, Europe and South America, Schroder said. Last year it acquired two oilseed crushing plants from rival Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] in the Netherlands and France. “You can arbitrage the soybean sourcing from any origin,” Schroder said. Argentina’s drought has improved global oilseed crushing margins for the merchants, according to the companies. Losses linked to the dryness also have spurred global buyers of soybean meal, used to feed livestock, to make purchases in advance, instead of only when they need it, Young said. “We’re creating a fairly sizable forward meal book, which allows us to trade around the book as well and create additional margin opportunities,” he said. Argentina, the world’s third-biggest soy producer, booked its largest purchase of U.S. soybeans in 20 years last month after the drought cut its harvest, forcing crushers there to turn to imports. ADM may look at expanding corn processing in South America as part of its growth strategy, Young said. Also in South America, Bunge plans to sell part of its stake in its Brazilian sugar and ethanol subsidiary, according to documents filed with Brazil’s securities industry regulator CVM on Tuesday. The company has been looking to sell the sugar assets since 2013. However, no deal has emerged due to a downturn in the sector and the high price at which Bunge scooped up the mills. Raw sugar prices are languishing at multi-year lows as huge global supplies of the sweetener outpace demand. A string of weak results over the past year left Bunge’s management fending off takeover approaches from traders Glencore Plc and ADM. Media reports say the talks with ADM have ended, and neither company has commented on them."

11.895183830560683," Trade tensions crimp U.S. soybean sales to China: Bunge CEO (Reuters) - U.S. soybean sales to China ground to a halt after Beijing threatened tariffs on imports, the CEO of agricultural trader Bunge Ltd said on Wednesday, the latest sign of mounting trade tensions upsetting the global flow of commodities. Countries such as Brazil and Canada are increasing soybean sales to China following Beijing’s threat last month to impose a 25 percent tariff on imports of U.S. soybeans, Chief Executive Soren Schroder said in an interview. U.S. farmers rely on China as the top buyer of soybeans, but at a current price of about $420 per ton, that translates to a potential tax of more than $100 per ton on shipments. “Nobody’s willing to take the risk of committing to U.S. soybeans to China in the current context, knowing that there could be a $100 penalty from one day to the other, and no way of managing that risk,” Schroder said after the company reported a quarterly loss. Soybeans were the United States’ most valuable agricultural export last year to China, which bought $12 billion of the crop. Freshly harvested South American soybeans typically dominate the world trade in the first half of the calendar year, followed by the United States from September onwards. But U.S. soybean sales to China over the last four weeks are down 10 percent from this time a year ago, according to U.S. trade figures - a blow to U.S. farm country, which helped propel U.S. President Donald Trump into office in the 2016 election. Growing trade disputes are disrupting the agricultural supply chain worldwide and causing U.S. farmers and manufacturers to back away from expansion plans due to steel and aluminum tariffs. “The trade stuff has been another layer of uncertainty that nobody really knows how to price yet,” Schroder said. Separately, Beijing slapped hefty anti-dumping deposits on U.S. imports of a livestock feed known as sorghum. Bunge’s rival, Archer Daniels Midland, said on Tuesday it would take a $30-million hit in the second quarter due to the sorghum dispute. ADM is closely monitoring U.S. trade developments regarding China and the North American Free Trade Agreement, CEO Juan Luciano said. Bunge has seen trade flows shift amid NAFTA renegotiations as well. In one example, Bunge milled wheat that had been imported to Mexico from Argentina as a test, Schroder said. Mexican buyers imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year due to concerns that NAFTA renegotiations could disrupt their U.S. supplies. The shift in China’s soybean business is not a net negative for Bunge because it has operations globally, Schroder said. “If there is a problem in one part of the world, we can solve it in another,” he said. Bunge reported a net loss of 20 cents per share in the quarter ended March 31, down from a profit of 31 cents a share a year ago. The loss included a $120 million charge due to forward oilseeds crushing contracts, which Bunge said it would recover. Improved margins for soybean crushing should boost earnings significantly this year, executives said, after a severe drought reduced harvests in Argentina, the world’s top exporter of soy products. The higher margins prompted Bunge to raise its agribusiness unit’s full-year earnings outlook to a range of $800 million to $1 billion from $550 million to $700 million. Shares gained 2.3 percent to $73.29. Bunge’s projection for stronger performance was a turnaround after years of bumper harvests reduced price volatility and margins for the company and its rivals, making it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing and selling corn, soy and wheat. A string of weak results over the past year left Bunge’s management fending off takeover approaches from traders Glencore PLC and ADM."
7.651933304959978," U.S.-China sorghum dispute stings major exporter ADM CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N. said on Tuesday it will take a $30 million hit to its trading profit in the second quarter due to a trade dispute between China and the United States over the feed grain sorghum. It was the first confirmed financial impact among global grain trading companies from Beijing’s move on April 17 to require hefty anti-dumping deposits on U.S. sorghum imports. More than 20 bulk U.S. sorghum shipments were en route to China when the announcement was made, including more than a dozen that were loaded at ADM export terminals in Texas. Several of the cargoes were resold to new buyers including Saudi Arabia, Japan and Spain at drastically reduced prices. ADM, which revealed the expected impact during an earnings-day conference call on Tuesday, is one of the largest sorghum exporters to China. Other global commodities traders may report they were negatively affected by the trade dispute later in the earnings season, analysts said. ADM reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday on record soybean processing and higher margins."
7.651933304959978," ADM profit rises on higher soy processing margins (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N on Tuesday reported a 16 percent increase in quarterly profit, as the U.S. grains merchant highlighted higher margins for and record volumes of soybean processing in North and South America. The Chicago-based company said the spike in soybean processing volumes, which happened as it pushed to lock in stronger profit margins, was not immediately showing up as higher profits because of losses ADM faced on its forward hedges. ADM said that was expected to reverse later in 2018. ADM’s adjusted earnings for the three months ending March 31, which increased to 68 cents per share, up 13 percent from the same period a year earlier, were bolstered by U.S. tax changes and biodiesel tax credits, company officials said. But the company also forecast the trade dispute between the United States and China would impact its business in the coming months. ADM expects a negative impact of about $30 million in the second quarter due to Beijing’s decision to impose stiff anti-dumping tariffs on sorghum, Chief Executive Juan Luciano said on an analysts’ call on Tuesday. ADM, one of the largest exporters of U.S. sorghum to China, has threatened legal action against China after several of its sorghum shipments were caught up in the dispute. The company said it was selling sorghum to ethanol producers. Revenue from ADM’s oilseed business, which makes up 36 percent of its overall revenue, rose 7.8 percent to $5.63 billion in the first quarter. Net profit attributable to ADM rose to $393 million, or 70 cents per share, from $339 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 3.6 percent to $15.53 billion."

5.134156326185673," POET unseats ADM as top global fuel ethanol maker CHICAGO (Reuters) - Privately held U.S.-based POET Llc has overtaken industry pioneer and global grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co to become the top ethanol producer in the world, the companies told Reuters. ADM had been the biggest ethanol maker since the United States began requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline more than a decade ago, under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The shift highlights the differing tacks top biofuel makers are taking to address lackluster profits, a supply glut and the oil lobby’s push against the U.S. biofuels program. ADM is reducing exposure while POET is expanding in an effort to increase profits through efficiency and scale. POET’s annual biofuel capacity has grown to 1.9 billion gallons and will reach 2 billion by 2019; ADM’s has shrunk to about 1.6 billion gallons, according to figures provided by each company. Prior to this year, both had capacities of about 1.8 billion gallons. The U.S. ethanol industry has total output potential of more than 16 billion gallons. ADM, which will report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Tuesday, diverted some of its capacity to beverage and industrial alcohol at its plant in Peoria, Illinois, as part of a strategy to make higher-margin products. The company last year had also put some of its plants up for sale but did not find a buyer. Meanwhile, POET boosted output by adding grain fermenters and other upgrades at several of its 27 ethanol plants and is expanding a facility in Marion, Ohio. POET constantly finds “new ways to increase yield, make gains in efficiency and maximize returns,” Jeff Broin, POET chief executive officer, told Reuters on Friday. Possible acquisitions by POET of other U.S. ethanol plants are also a possibility, Broin said. Both POET and ADM are pushing for increased U.S. ethanol exports and more sales of higher-ethanol blends to draw down abundant supplies of both grain and biofuel. “There are 20 billion bushels of corn, wheat and soybeans stockpiled globally with no end in sight,” Broin said. “This oversupply has led to four straight years of declining farm income, which is why we’re entering into a modern-day (agriculture) crisis.”"
4.173430467732307," ADM to expand production in Bulgaria with new facility SOFIA (Reuters) - Amilum Bulgaria, owned by U.S. agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland Co, on Friday began the construction of a new corn processing facility in the northeastern town of Razgrad, aiming to double its production capacity. The company said it would invest more than 200 million levs ($123.41 million) and create 300 new jobs as the expansion would allow Amilum to process 900,000 tonnes of corn annually. It said that most of the production, including corn starch, glucose, fructose and other products, would be exported to international markets which will have a significant positive result for the Balkan country’s trade balance. Amilum also plans to construct new facilities to produce ethanol, using residual products from the manufacture of sweeteners in an attempt to improve energy efficiency. ($1 = 1.6206 leva)"
