4.549871159761089," Merck in talks with governments, other drugmakers to produce COVID-19 shots (Feb. 10) (In Feb 10 story, corrects paragraph 8 to show Themis is an Austrian drugmaker, not Australian) (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Wednesday it was in talks with governments and companies to potentially help with manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines that have been already authorized. “Beyond our own candidates, we are actively involved in discussions with governments, public health agencies, and other industry colleagues to identify the areas of pandemic response where we can play a role, including potential support for production of authorized vaccines,” a company spokesman said. He, however, didn’t divulge any details of companies or public agencies the company was in touch with. The drugmaker said it also planned to focus on the accelerated scale up of production of its investigational therapeutic candidates, MK-4482 and MK-7110, which it now calls molnupiravir. Merck had halted the development of its two COVID-19 vaccines in January after early trials showed both vaccines generated immune responses that were inferior to those seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19 as well as those reported for other COVID-19 vaccines. It decided to focus on COVID-19 research and manufacturing efforts on therapeutics after its two vaccines failed. The company said last week it expected early data from a trial of the experimental antiviral drug molnupiravir as early as the first quarter. Merck has built out its portfolio of COVID-19 medicines through a series of deals in recent months, including the acquisition of Austrian drugmaker Themis and a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop molnupiravir. Late in December, it said it would supply 60,000-100,000 doses of its experimental COVID-19 treatment to the U.S. government for up to about $356 million."

3.407222876350935," One of the few top U.S. Black CEOs, Merck's Ken Frazier to retire (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Thursday Ken Frazier, one of only a handful of Black executives leading major U.S. companies, will step down as chief executive officer at the end of June and be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will remain with the drugmaker as executive chairman for a transition period. He had been due to retire in 2019, but the company scrapped a policy requiring its CEO to retire at age 65. Frazier was one of only five Black CEOs on last year’s Fortune 500 list of America’s largest companies, released in June 2020. His departure would drop the number to three as TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson, Jr. will also retire in March. But with Rosalind Brewer, Starbucks’ Chief Operating Officer, joining the ranks as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc in March, the number will go to four. Corporate boards are coming under pressure to address the dearth of Black leadership at top American companies with diversity increasingly recognized as a worthy corporate value. Davis will inherit a company with one of the world’s best selling drugs in its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and a tightened focus after it completes the spinoff of its slower growing women’s health, biosimilar drugs and older products later this year. Frazier joined Merck nearly 30 years ago and climbed the ranks, becoming the first Black CEO of a major drug company in 2011. He made his name at Merck as general counsel by steering the company safely through daunting litigation over Vioxx. He also played a significant role in Merck’s 2009 acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough, which then held Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, as a pipeline asset. “That deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were,” he said. “None of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab.” Under Frazier’s leadership, Keytruda has eclipsed Bristol Myers Squibb’s cancer immunotherapies, which hit the market first. Keytruda’s sales topped $14 billion last year. Shares of the company more than doubled over his tenure. Frazier, the grandson of a sharecropper, made headlines in 2017 when he became the first business leader to leave former U.S. President Donald Trump’s manufacturing council following Trump’s comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia. “His shoes won’t be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today,” Davis said on a post-earnings conference call. Frazier’s success at Merck shows that the lack of top Black executives is not reflective of performance but rather of comfort, said Monica Hawkins, a Washington, D.C.-based management consultant. Because many executives’ “social circles don’t give them the social capital to know more than five Ken Fraziers - if they know any - that excellence becomes a question in their mind, because they’ve never seen it before,” Hawkins said. Although Black directors held 8% of board seats in the S&P 500 as of August, just five of those companies, or 1%, had Black CEOs, according to researcher Equilar. They included Frazier. Barry Lawson Williams, a retired corporate director involved in efforts to recruit and place Black business leaders, said the paucity of Black CEOs at top U.S. companies partly reflected competition for that talent from private equity and financial services companies who can pay more.

0.8255421529126339," Merck warns against using anti-parasite drug to treat COVID-19 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc on Thursday said its analysis of available data does not support the safety and efficacy of its anti-parasite drug, ivermectin, for the treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin, which is approved in the United States under the brand name Stromectol, is used mainly to treat roundworms, threadworms and other parasites. Officials in the Bolivian city of Trinidad had launched a campaign in May last year to give out free doses of ivermectin to combat the novel coronavirus, although the South American country's health ministry noted the lack of evidence for it as a treatment for COVID-19. (reut.rs/3oVnHsY) The company said its analysis of existing and emerging studies of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 found no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. (bit.ly/2Mz1NOW) Merck added that there was a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies testing ivermectin to treat COVID-19 and cautioned against the use of the drug beyond its use as an anti-parasitic."
0.8255421529126339," Merck expects interim data on COVID-19 drug in first quarter Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said on Thursday it was expecting early data from a trial of the experimental antiviral drug it was developing with Ridgeback Bio as early as the first quarter. The company has decided to focus on therapeutics after its two COVID-19 vaccines failed to generate desired immune responses, prompting it to abandon the program last week. The antiviral is being currently tested in a Phase 2/3 trial that is set to be completed in May, but initial results could be reported by the first quarter, said Dean Li, head of the company’s research and development division. Li also said the drug still needed to be tested to see if it was effective against the new variants of the novel coronavirus, but predicted that it would work on all types, based on its mechanism of action. The most concerning new variants of the novel coronavirus currently are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian, all of which appear to spread more swiftly than others. Merck expects to make 10 million courses of the antiviral, molnupiravir, by the end of 2021, Li said at a conference call to discuss the company’s quarterly earnings.

-0.8696709426393681," Exclusive: Merck anti-baldness drug Propecia has long trail of suicide reports, records show (Reuters) - Newly unsealed court documents and other records show that Merck & Co and U.S. regulators knew about reports of suicidal behavior in men taking the company’s anti-baldness treatment Propecia when they decided not to warn consumers of those potential risks in a 2011 update of the popular drug’s label. Internal records from Merck were made public in late January, when a federal magistrate in Brooklyn, New York, granted a 2019 Reuters motion to unseal 11 documents filed in years of litigation alleging Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction and other harmful side effects. Since the 2011 decision on the warning, the FDA has received more than 700 reports of suicide and suicidal thoughts among people taking Propecia or generic versions of the drug. Those included at least 100 deaths. Before that, in the first 14 years the drug was on the market, the agency received 34 such reports, including 10 deaths. Annual U.S. prescriptions of finasteride, as the drug is known, for hair loss increased to over 2.4 million in 2020, more than double the number in 2015, according to health data company IQVIA. European and Canadian regulators, citing similar reports among men taking finasteride, require a warning of suicidal thoughts on the label, though they note that research has not proved that the drug causes such thoughts. To this day, the U.S. label contains no mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. As early as 2009, Merck knew of more than 200 reports of depression, including suicidal thoughts, in men taking Propecia, according to an internal “risk management” assessment from that year. The company decided there were too few reports of serious depression and suicidal behavior and not enough specifics about those cases to warrant more than “routine” monitoring of safety data. In 2011, two years after the Merck risk analysis, the FDA was weighing a company request to add “depression” to the drug’s label as a potential risk, with no warnings related to suicide. FDA analysts disagreed about adding a warning related to suicide, according to previously unreported government documents. But the regulator ultimately agreed with Merck’s request on the grounds that the number of suicides was lower than one would expect in this group of patients. Some medical researchers and patient advocates said Merck and the FDA have left American consumers in the dark about potentially life-threatening dangers associated with finasteride. “No family should ever have to learn about this after the fact,” said Kim Witczak, a consumer advocate who serves on an FDA advisory panel for psychiatric drugs. She has called for drug companies and regulators to issue stronger warnings after her husband died from suicide in 2003 five weeks after being prescribed an antidepressant for insomnia. Merck “had an opportunity to put suicide on the label, but they didn’t want to do that because it’s all about sales.” Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist and Harvard Medical School faculty member whose own research has found possible links between finasteride and suicidal behaviors, said Merck’s handling of the risk analysis and the FDA’s inaction keep critical information from the public. Merck “definitely should have provided a more complete picture,” Irwig said. In a statement to Reuters, Merck said that “the scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling” for the drug. “Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia.” Merck has said in past statements that Propecia has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. It also has argued in court that “premature hair loss itself, the very condition for which Propecia is prescribed, is associated with low self-esteem, poor body image, and depression.” In a statement, FDA said it “continues to monitor postmarketing safety data for Propecia.” Overall, the agency noted that the presence of a report in the FDA database “does not mean the drug caused the adverse event” and medical problems may stem from the “underlying disease being treated, caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons.” FDA declined to comment further about its handling of Propecia and reports related to suicide. Merck’s analysis of a potential suicide risk stayed secret in court for over three years -- and only became public after Reuters intervened in the proceeding. The insights in the recently unsealed documents echo findings from Reuters’ 2019 investigation, “Hidden Injustice,” which revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in lawsuits information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one. The Reuters investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products -- including drugs, cars and medical devices -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden. In granting Reuters’ motion to unseal Merck documents, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo last month ruled that the company’s arguments for continued secrecy “are so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.” In addition to the risk management plan, Kuo unsealed other Merck documents including an internal marketing report from prior to the drug’s launch and some communications with regulators regarding sexual dysfunction. Reuters obtained the FDA documents discussing suicide from a separate online repository maintained by the agency. In 2010, while reviewing Merck’s proposal to add potential depression risk to Propecia’s label, an FDA safety evaluator recommended also adding a warning for suicidal thoughts and behavior, noting nine suicides and reports of other suicidal behaviors among patients who took finasteride, the FDA documents reviewed by Reuters show. The reports of suicidal behavior analyzed by Merck and government regulators, known as “adverse event” reports, are filed by consumers, doctors and other members of the public. They are compiled in a public database by U.S. regulators, as well as drug-safety agencies in other countries. In her November 2010 report, FDA safety evaluator Namita Kothary wrote that the nine suicides were difficult to assess due to incomplete information. “However, we cannot exclude that finasteride may have contributed to the events,” she wrote. Kothary did not respond to requests for comment. Two other FDA reviewers disagreed. The two physicians -- Amy Woitach and David Kettl -- said the data supported adding depression to the label. Suicidal ideation, however, should be left off because the number of suicidal thoughts, attempts and deaths was “lower than would be expected in this patient population,” according to their December 2010 report. Kettl and Woitach did not respond to requests for comment. The European Medicines Agency found the relationship between finasteride and depression was hard to assess, but still required a warning about suicidal ideation in 2017, in part because Propecia is not prescribed for a serious condition, according to EMA committee meeting minutes. Doctors and patients generally weigh risks differently for a drug to treat a life-threatening health problem, versus something less severe. When Health Canada required its warning in 2019, it noted 368 international reports of suicidal events reported in patients treated with finasteride through September 2018. Merck did not respond to questions about these regulatory moves. The FDA approved Propecia in 1997, and sales climbed steadily through the 2000s, peaking at $447 million in 2010. Soon after, Merck’s patent expired. Overall sales of finasteride have remained strong as cheaper generic versions have hit the market. The new information regarding a potential suicide risk emerged as a result of longstanding controversy about sexual problems associated with the drugs. From the beginning, Merck’s label said Propecia caused sexual dysfunction in nearly 4% of its clinical study participants. However, the 2009 risk management report also shows that the company was aware of reports that those sexual problems continued for some men after they stopped taking the drug. The FDA in 2012 approved Merck’s request to add a warning of erectile dysfunction that continued after stopping the drug, as well as “libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders.” Even so, Merck at the time said scientific evidence did not establish that Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction. The warning prompted more than 1,100 lawsuits against Merck by men alleging their sexual problems lasted long after they stopped taking Propecia. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of the lawsuits consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court for a combined $4.3 million. Reuters reported in 2019 that prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers had alleged that Merck, when revising the drug’s original label, understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. The allegation was part of a sealed court brief a Reuters reporter was able to read because of a redaction error. The brief cited internal Merck communications, filed under seal. Reuters intervened in the case, seeking to unseal those communications. “IMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISK” The 2009 risk management report unsealed last month shows that while depression did not emerge as a risk in clinical trials, Merck deemed it an “important potential risk” after the company received 218 global reports of depression from 1998 to 2008. Of those, 10 involved serious depression, and an additional nine involved suicidal behavior. Merck noted limitations with both the depression reports and the nine involving suicidal behavior. Four provided “insufficient information to allow a full evaluation.” Three of the men had other medical conditions, and for two, the symptoms developed after they stopped taking the drug. “One fatal report was received from a sheriff’s office and described a male who committed suicide by shooting,” according to the report. “The medical examiner did not think this event was related to Propecia, in addition, the report provided insufficient information to allow for assessment.” The report contained no additional details about the patient’s identity or the medical examiner’s investigation. Merck did not respond to questions about what steps it took to learn more about the case. In its statement to Reuters, Merck said adverse event reports reflect only the opinions of the person who files them. “While consumers and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse events, the reaction may have been related to the underlying disease being treated, or caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons,” the company said. Dr W. Vaughn McCall, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior at the Medical College of Georgia, agreed that relying on adverse event reports to monitor drug safety has its limitations. However, he said one of those limitations is that injuries and deaths are often underreported because people aren’t familiar with the process or don’t have time to examine a specific case. He said there is a plausible biological explanation for a potential link between Propecia and suicidal thoughts. The drug reduces a testosterone-related hormone, which in turn could impact an anti-depressive steroid produced in the body. “There is a reason to be suspicious,” McCall said."

One such post reads: “Vaccine manufacturer Merck scraps COVID vaccine, saying studies show it’s more effective to get the virus and recover than get the vaccine” (here). Another says: “According to Merck, they have determined it's better to just get the virus and develop antibodies than taking a vaccine. They have abandoned vaccine development in favour of alternative therapies” (here). These posts appear to have misinterpreted a recent statement from Merck, which announced on Jan. 25 that it was dropping research on V590 and V591, its two candidate vaccines for COVID-19, to focus on therapeutics instead (here). Citing its reasons for discontinuing development, the American pharmaceutical giant said: “This decision follows Merck’s review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines.” (here) Therefore, Merck was referring to trial data showing its own vaccine candidates having an inferior result compared to a natural immune response to COVID-19. It was not advising against delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines. As it noted in its statement, other candidate vaccines have led to recipients showing a stronger immune response. Misleading. Merck did not say it is better to catch COVID-19 than get vaccinated. The company’s statement about an inferior response compared to a natural immunity referred only to tests on its own two vaccine candidates.

-2.5405784682481136," Judge orders Merck documents on anti-baldness drug Propecia unsealed (Reuters) - A U.S. judge granted a Reuters request to unseal Merck & Co documents produced in lawsuits related to its anti-baldness treatment Propecia, finding that the public’s right to access outweighed the drug maker’s arguments for keeping the information secret. Plaintiffs suing Merck alleged that the company did not fully disclose on Propecia’s label the incidence and duration of sexual dysfunction in men who took the drug in clinical trials. As part of an investigation of the impact of court secrecy on public health and safety, Reuters published an article in 2019 that examined the basis for those allegations, but many internal Merck documents that might have shed further light on the case remained under seal. Sunday night, 16 months after Reuters filed a motion asking that those documents be unsealed, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo in Brooklyn rejected Merck’s position that the public had no right to access its documents filed in court, which the company said contained proprietary information. Merck’s arguments for keeping the documents sealed, Kuo wrote, “are so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.” As of Monday, the documents were still sealed on the court docket, despite Kuo’s decision. In a statement to Reuters, Merck said it “interacted appropriately and transparently with global regulators, including FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and with physicians and consumers about the safety profile of Propecia. None of millions of pages produced by Merck suggest otherwise, including the documents unsealed by the Court.” The company previously told Reuters it “stands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia” and noted that the drug had been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. In its 2019 investigation, titled “Hidden Injustice,” Reuters revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one. The investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products -- drugs, cars, medical devices and other products -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden. In 2012, more than 1,100 Propecia-related lawsuits filed across the U.S. against Merck were consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court in so-called multidistrict litigation. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of them for $4.3 million, to be divided among the plaintiffs. Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug’s original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegations in court, and Cogan allowed many of the Merck documents to remain under seal without conducting any analysis of whether they merited secrecy. After Reuters filed its September 2019 motion to unseal, Merck argued that the material should not be considered “judicial documents” -- which are entitled to a presumed public right of access -- in part because the case had already been settled before the allegations were decided. Kuo, however, ruled that the presumption of public access does not disappear just because a judge never had a chance to rule on a particular motion. “The continuing presumption of access allows the public to see what is going into the sausage factory, even if a particular sausage is never made,” Kuo wrote. The judge ordered that all the documents sought by Reuters be unsealed."
-3.621455254137402," Merck ends COVID vaccine program, cites inferior immune responses (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co said on Monday it would stop development of its two COVID-19 vaccines and focus pandemic research on treatments, with initial data on an experimental oral antiviral expected by the end of March. Merck was late to join the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 2 million people and continues to surge in many parts of the world including the United States. The company will record a pre-tax discontinuation charge in the fourth quarter for vaccine candidate V591, which it acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience, and V590, developed with nonprofit research organization IAVI, Merck said in a statement. In early trials, both vaccines generated immune responses that were inferior to those seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19 as well as those reported for other COVID-19 vaccines, the company said. The announcement is a setback to the fight against the pandemic and comes a month after Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline delayed launch of their shot to late 2021, underscoring the challenges of developing vaccines at record speed. Tens of millions of doses of vaccines from rivals Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech as well as from Moderna Inc have so far been administered globally. Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc and others are also racing to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect against the virus. Merck said it would focus COVID-19 research and manufacturing efforts on two investigational medicines: MK-7110 and MK-4482, which it now calls molnupiravir. Molnupiravir, which is being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Bio, is an oral antiviral being studied in both hospital and outpatient settings. Merck said a Phase 2/3 trial of the drug was set to finish in May, but initial efficacy results were due in the first quarter and would be made public if clinically meaningful. Merck said results from a Phase 3 study of MK-7110, an immune modulator being studied as a treatment for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, were expected in the first quarter. Shares of Merck fell 1% to $80.12 in trading before the bell."

-3.880273944522346," Merck KGaA, GSK suffer lung cancer drug setback FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA’s drug development programme has suffered a setback with its most important experimental drug, cancer treatment bintrafusp alfa, failing early in its lead trial. In a statement on Wednesday, Merck KGaA said independent supervisors of the late-stage study, which was testing the drug against U.S. namesake Merck & Co’s bestseller Keytruda in newly diagnosed cases of a certain type of lung cancer, concluded the drug was unlikely to show the desired effect. The failure also puts a damper on the oncology ambitions of Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, which is co-developing the drug with Merck under a 2019 agreement that could have seen it pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.5 billion) to the German company. Merck KGaA’s shares dropped as much as 7% after the news that the INTR@PID Lung 037 trial was stopped but pared losses to trade 3.1% lower at 1455 GMT. GSK dropped 2.1% while the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index was little changed. Keytruda dominates a class of immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, and is expected to generate $17 billion in revenues this year. Family-controlled Merck KGaA and Merck & Co Inc, known as MSD outside North America, share historic roots but have been under separate ownership since World War One. Earlier stage trials, testing bintrafusp alfa against lung cancer, cervical cancer and biliary tract cancer, will continue. “We need to dig deeper into what the news of today means for lung and the other studies in the bintrafusp programme,” said Merck KGaA finance chief Marcus Kuhnert. Kuhnert said the blow would not sway the strategy of the relatively small pharmaceuticals division. “(This) is not going to change where we go in the future,” he said in an analyst call. Earnings growth in Merck’s diversified business has recently been driven by biotech lab supplies, which have benefited from a scramble to ready treatments and vaccines against the coronavirus, offsetting sluggish drug revenue growth. Merck’s specialty chemicals used in semiconductor production have meanwhile benefited from a rebound in demand by the electronics industry. GSK also said in a written statement that bintrafusp alfa development continues in several additional cancer indications. Merck said it had no indication that GSK intended to exit the collaboration. The bintrafusp alfa drug is a so-called fusion protein, a unique combination of checkpoint inhibition and another immune response booster known as TGF-beta-inhibtion."
-5.827218832964293," U.S. Supreme Court rebuffs Merck appeal in hepatitis C patent fight with Gilead (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Merck & Co Inc’s bid to revive a $2.54 billion jury verdict it won against rival drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc for infringing a patent in a dispute over a blockbuster hepatitis C treatment. The justices declined to take up Merck’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that overturned the massive damages verdict after finding that Merck’s patent was invalid. The case concerns a new generation of highly effective drugs for hepatitis C, a viral infection that can cause serious liver damage, able to cure more than 90% of patients, with few side effects. New Jersey-based Merck’s Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2013 accused California-based Gilead of infringing its patent on a family of compounds with the same basic chemical structure that is effective against the hepatitis C virus. After a federal court trial in 2016, a jury sided with Idenix, awarding $2.54 billion for Gilead’s infringement with its drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court, invalidated the patent in 2019 after determining that its claims on the family of compounds were overly broad, in violation of U.S. patent law. In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Merck said that the Federal Circuit’s ruling undermined biotechnology breakthroughs in which discoveries often begin with a family of compounds that share a particular property. A group of intellectual property scholars backed Merck in a written brief, telling the justices that the Federal Circuit ruling made it “unreasonably difficult for a pharmaceutical company that comes up with an innovative new class of drugs to protect that class against imitation. That result threatens innovation.”"

Young, 75, famed for songs including “Heart Of Gold”, “Rocking In The Free World” and “Devil’s Sidewalk”, has released over 50 studio albums and 20 live albums, of which seven went platinum and three multi-platinum. “I bought my first Neil Young album aged seven,” said Hipgnosis founder Merck Mercuriadis, saying the latest in a series of such rights deals would change his company for ever. “‘Harvest’ was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately. Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend and constant ever since,” he added. The deal is the third that Hipgnosis, listed on the stock market in 2018, has struck this week after agreements with Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on Tuesday and record producer Jimmy Iovine on Monday. It follows the sale last month of Bob Dylan’s entire back catalogue to Universal Music Group. The rise of streaming services means artists such as Dylan and Young are able to reach an ever-expanding audience of fans from a younger generation. Financial details of the Young deal were not disclosed. Mercuriadis, a former music manager, said: “We will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them (the songs) on Neil’s terms.” Last month, Young ended his lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign for playing of two of his songs at campaign rallies without permission."

Merck is paying $425 million for the private company, in addition to extra payments for regulatory milestones and sales. Merck has built out its portfolio of COVID-19 medicines through a series of deals in recent months, including the acquisition of Australian drugmaker Themis and a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP. OncoImmune recently announced positive interim data from a phase 3 trial of its leading therapeutic candidate, CD24F, for patients with severe and critical COVID-19. The data show that the therapy, which is administered as an injection, increased the likelihood of symptom improvement in serious COVID-19 cases and also reduced the risk of respiratory failure and death, said Roger Perlmutter, who heads research at Merck. He added that CD24F could potentially complement dexamethasone, a generic steroid that is the current standard of care for the most serious COVID-19 cases. The steroid was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump for COVID-19 in October. Merck is aiming to develop the manufacturing capacity needed to produce the therapy at scale, which could take weeks to months. CD24F was originally developed to treat graft versus host disease (GVHD) for patients with leukemia who received stem cell transplants. OncoImmune has initiated phase 3 studies for the drug in GVHD.

-0.3992491023465727," Merck says early data from COVID-19 vaccines expected this year (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc on Tuesday said it expects to report results from early-stage studies of two potential COVID-19 vaccines before the end of the year and has advanced an experimental antiviral drug into late-stage testing. Merck was late to join the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the virus, which is again surging in many parts of the world including the United States. Rivals Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc are already deep into late-stage testing. The company began recruiting trial participants in September for an early-stage study of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate V591, which it acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience. Initial data showing whether V591 triggers an immune response in trial participants is expected by the end of the year, Merck research chief Roger Perlmutter said on a conference call. The drugmaker is also collaborating with research non-profit IAVI on a second candidate that uses the same technology as Merck’s Ebola vaccine. It is several weeks behind the V591 program but on a similar development track, Perlmutter said. Merck said it was building facilities to be able to manufacture many millions of doses of the two vaccines. Drugmakers have committed to large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines before gaining approval to speed their eventual availability. In addition to the vaccines, Merck has begun two late-stage studies of an antiviral drug against COVID-19 being developed in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. The company said it has secured resources to produce millions of doses of the drug before the end of 2020. The U.S. drugmaker also reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Merck shares rose more than 1% to $79.68. Merck now expects 2020 adjusted profit of $5.91 to $6.01 per share, up from its prior forecast of $5.63 to $5.78 per share.

-0.3992491023465727," Novartis upbeat as drugmakers see hospitals coping with COVID ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis joined rivals Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Roche in predicting the worst of the pandemic may be over for drugmakers, amid signs healthcare systems have learned how to cope with surging infections without shutting down all services. The Swiss company nudged up its 2020 profit guidance on Tuesday, now expecting operating income growth in a low-to-mid double-digit percentage range, compared with a low double-digit rate forecast previously. Merck also raised its profit outlook on Tuesday, following Johnson & Johnson, while Roche last week stuck to sales forecasts and predicted a rebound from pandemic disruptions would continue. While Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan acknowledged COVID-19 could still derail 2020 goals, he said hospitals, doctors and patients had learned from painful lockdowns earlier this year that delayed treatment and hit drug sales. “There’s a strong desire not to repeat that,” he said, adding U.S. healthcare systems appeared to be “a bit more resilient” in maintaining services than in Europe as the second COVID-19 wave intensifies. Novartis’s third-quarter core net income climbed 8% to $3.47 billion, above analysts’ mean forecast of $3.32 billion. However, sales rose just 1% to $12.3 billion, missing a $12.7 billion forecast. Novartis shares were down 3.5% at 1420 GMT, the biggest fall on the benchmark Swiss Market Index. Other firms echoed Novartis’s view, even as global COVID-19 cases rise by more than 400,000 a day and some countries see intensive care units at capacity within weeks. “Our confidence is further reinforced by the ability of the health care systems around the world to adapt and deliver care,” Merck Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis told investors, adding a pick up in elective surgeries had lifted demand. A week ago, Roche CEO Severin Schwan called a second “healthcare lockdown” unlikely. Still, countries including Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic are either enacting or preparing new restrictions. So Novartis remains on alert. “Of course, if there would be a resurgence of COVID-19 impact on the health care systems and prescribing behavior in our major markets, there is a scenario of lower sales growth,” finance chief Harry Kirsch told investors."

5.8014775227955795," Bristol Myers' Opdivo succeeds in late-stage lung cancer trial (Reuters) - Bristol Myers Squibb Co said on Wednesday its cancer drug Opdivo plus chemotherapy helped more patients with a form of lung cancer become free of the disease versus chemotherapy alone in a late-stage trial. Significantly more non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving Opdivo and chemotherapy before surgery showed no evidence of cancer cells in their resected tissue, the company said. The combination of Britol’s Opdivo and Yervoy is already approved for treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Bristol said the trial is ongoing to assess the other main goal of evaluating the length of time after primary treatment that the patient remains free of complications. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases, making it a lucrative market, which is currently dominated by Merck & Co’s rival drug Keytruda. Opdivo spurs the immune system to fight cancer and is one of Bristol’s top-selling drugs. The company’s shares were up 1% at $58.38 before the bell."
0.616002580478807," Bristol Myers expands heart drug business with $13 billion deal for MyoKardia (Reuters) - Bristol Myers Squibb Co said on Monday it would buy MyoKardia Inc for about $13 billion to bolster its portfolio of heart disease treatments, ahead of the potential loss of sales exclusivity of some of its blockbuster drugs. The deal comes close on the heels of Bristol Myers’ $74 billion acquisition of Celgene last year, which was aimed at creating an oncology giant and shielding itself from fierce competition for its cancer immunotherapy, Opdivo, from Merck & Co’s Keytruda. Shares of MyoKardia, which have nearly doubled in value this year, surged another 57.8% to $220.31, just shy of the offer of $225 per share. The deal will also help Bristol Myers reduce some of its dependence on cancer drugs and give it access to Myokardia’s lead heart drug candidate with blockbuster potential, mavacamten, adding to its existing portfolio of heart drugs that includes blood thinner Eliquis. Eliquis, which made up about 21% of the company’s total sales in the latest reported quarter, faces U.S. market exclusivity loss after 2026. The company’s top-selling cancer drug, Revlimid, will also lose some of its U.S. patent exclusivity in 2022. Bristol Myers said it expects mavacamten to be a “multi-billion dollar asset” and drive significant growth through 2025 and the second half of the decade. “I think it is a typical acquisition premium for our sales expectations for mavacamten as we had estimates in the initial (and lowest risk) indication of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of about $2.5 billion by 2026,” said Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten, referring to the 61% premium offered by Bristol Myers. Mavacamten is being developed to treat obstructive and non-obstructive forms of a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - estimated to affect one in every 500 people globally. MyoKardia expects to submit marketing application to the U.S. health regulator for obstructive HCM in the first quarter of 2021 after the drug met the main goal of a late-stage study. The company said the MyoKardia purchase would add to its earnings beginning in 2023."
0.9892648065064971," U.S. drugmaker Merck's research chief Roger Perlmutter to retire (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s Roger Perlmutter, a force behind the success of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, will retire after seven years at the helm of the company’s research and development division, the U.S. drugmaker said on Friday. The 68-year-old pharma veteran, who steps down on Jan. 1, 2021, is currently president of Merck Research Labs and, under his watch, Keytruda has received approvals to treat newly diagnosed forms of advanced lung cancer, while eclipsing the sales of Bristol Myers Squibb Co’s rival drug, Opdivo. Merck rehired Perlmutter from Amgen in 2013 at a time when its most important experimental drugs were suffering from a series of setbacks. “Since rejoining the company seven years ago, Dr. Roger Perlmutter has had a profound impact on Merck and the patients we exist to serve,” Merck Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said in a statement. “During his tenure as its President, Merck Research Laboratories have made historic breakthroughs in immuno-oncology and other fields of medicine that have both transformed clinical practice and vastly improved patient outcomes.” Merck acquired Keytruda in its 2009 acquisition of Schering Plough, but only after competitor Bristol Myers started to have some success with its own immuno-oncology drugs did the company step-up development. Merck said it had received more than 100 regulatory approvals for its medicines and vaccines globally, since Perlmutter took charge of its highly respected laboratories. Dean Li, who joined Merck’s R&D team in 2017, will take over from Perlmutter. He has co-founded multiple biotech companies based upon research conducted in his laboratory at the university, Merck said."

The phase 1/2 trial, which is based in Belgium, aims to recruit 260 healthy participants to test the experimental vaccine V591, which it gained access to as part of its May deal for Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience. The vaccine is based on a modified measles virus that delivers bits of the new coronavirus into the body to prevent COVID-19. Merck is late to join the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the fast-spreading respiratory illness as rivals Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc are already in late-stage testing. The drugmaker is also collaborating with research non-profit IAVI on a second vaccine candidate that uses the same technology as Merck’s Ebola vaccine, ERVEBO.

Merck this year bought Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience to gain its vaccine project that relies on a measles vector, and is also collaborating with research nonprofit IAVI on a second vaccine hopeful that uses the same technology as Merck’s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO. “Both of those are going forward,” Frazier said during a virtual briefing sponsored by drug industry group International Federation of Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers & Association. “We expect to be able to start larger-scale human trials in the measles-virus vaccine fairly soon, and we expect to be able to start those clinical trials for the (IAVI vaccine) later this year.”"
-5.586975948144021," Merck to move COVID-19 treatment into large trials, sees sales recovering this year (Reuters) - Merck & Co MRK.N on Friday said it plans to advance an antiviral treatment for COVID-19 into large studies in the coming weeks, and it forecast a more limited hit to full-year sales and profit from coronavirus lockdowns than it previously expected. The U.S. drugmaker said two large trials of the oral antiviral being developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics would begin in September. Merck said it can manufacture “many millions of doses” of the drug before year end. Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O intravenous antiviral remdesivir is currently being widely used as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Merck also expects its two experimental coronavirus vaccines to start human trials later this year, lagging some rivals who have begun late-stage studies. The vaccine it picked up through its acquisition of Themis Bioscience should start clinical studies in the current quarter, while another being developed with nonprofit research organization IAVI should begin trials by year end. Effective treatments and vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has killed over 674,000 people worldwide and battered global economies. Merck said it hopes its experimental coronavirus vaccines can be effective with a single dose “In dealing with an aggressive, globally dispersed disease like COVID-19, we believe that it is wise to lower the barrier to vaccination as much as possible, for example, by launching a vaccine that is effective with just a single administration,” Merck research head Roger Perlmutter said on a conference call. Merck said it now expects a 2020 revenue decline of $1.95 billion due to the precipitous drop in medical visits early in the pandemic, from its prior estimate of $2.1 billion. The company said it expects a return to normal levels in the fourth quarter. “Business conditions have clearly improved and ... we believe the healthcare system is better positioned to provide patient access as we move through the balance of the year,” said Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis. The company noted that it still had strong second-quarter sales from blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda. Keytruda sale rose nearly 29% to $3.39 billion, ahead of Wall Street expectations. Total sales fell 7.6% to $10.87 billion due to a $1.6 billion pandemic-related hit in the quarter. That still exceeded analysts’ estimates of $10.39 billion. Merck raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $5.63 to $5.78 per share from a prior range of $5.17 and $5.37."

-0.31966538924965454," Moderna, Merck say they will not limit price of coronavirus vaccines to company cost (Reuters) - Moderna Inc and Merck & Co on Tuesday told a U.S. Congressional panel that they expect to profit from their coronavirus vaccines once approved, amid concerns the vaccines may not be accessible to all. “We will not be selling our vaccine at cost, although it is premature for us as we’re a long way from understanding the cost-basis,” Julie Gerberding, chief patient officer for Merck, told the House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and investigations in a virtual, off-site hearing. Merck’s has yet to begin human studies of its experimental vaccine, lagging the leading candidates. Executives from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc testified that they will price their respective potential vaccines at no profit while the pandemic rages on. Gerberding and a representative from Moderna did not comment on the price they have in mind for their vaccines at the hearing, which focused on efforts to develop a safe, effective and widely accessible vaccine against COVID-19, which has claimed 600,000 lives globally. Pfizer Inc has said the company intends to make a profit from its potential coronavirus vaccine if approved. However, Pfizer Chief Business Officer John Young, testified: “We recognize that these are extraordinary times and our price will reflect that.” Unlike rivals Moderna and AstraZeneca, Pfizer has not received funding from the United States for its vaccine development. Lawmakers questioned whether Pfizer had declined government funding so it could price the vaccine at a profit. “We didn’t access federal funding solely for the reason that we wanted to move the vaccine faster to the clinic,” Young said. AstraZeneca said its vaccine would be provided at no profit under its agreement with the United States for allocation of some 300 million doses. More than 150 coronavirus vaccines using a variety of technologies are in development globally, with some two dozen already in human trials. The aim is to produce vaccines that can end the pandemic by protecting billions of people from infection or severe illness. Whether any will succeed or be available by the U.S. government’s stated goal of having one by late this year remains far from clear. “Speed is important,” Gerberding said of the vaccine development, “but we will not compromise scientific efficacy, quality, and above all, safety, despite the sense of urgency we all feel.”"

The potential vaccines may not have the qualities needed to be rapidly deployed in large numbers of people, Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said in an interview with Tsedal Neeley, a professor at Harvard Business School. “If you’re going to use a vaccine on billions of people, you better know what that vaccine does.” A U.S. official said Monday that drugmakers partnered with the U.S. government are on track to begin actively manufacturing a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the summer, Reuters reported. The Trump administration aims to produce 300 million vaccine doses by the end of 2021 though its Operation Warp Speed Program. Some previous vaccines “not only didn’t confer protection, but actually helped the virus invade the cell, because it was incomplete in terms of its immunogenic properties,” Frazier said. “So we have to be very careful.” Merck announced in May plans to study potential vaccine and therapy candidates for COVID-19 through partnerships and an acquisition of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience. It has not started clinical trials for its vaccine. Frazier, one of only four Black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, said the U.S. pandemic, with a higher death rate among nonwhite people, has highlighted “huge structural elements of racism that have existed in this country for a long time.” American companies must work to dismantle processes and systems that impede Black employees from advancing, he said. “At the end of the day, if you’re complacent with the status quo, you’re complicit in the racism that the status quo hides.” (This story corrects to show interview was published by a Harvard Business School website, not Harvard Business Review)"

4.005222078641091," Merck's bladder cancer late-stage study fails to meet main goals (Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Tuesday its blockbuster therapy Keytruda used along with chemotherapy failed to meet the main goals of a late-stage study testing the combination as a first-line treatment for bladder cancer. The trial did not meet the main goals of overall survival or progression-free survival, compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy alone, the company said in a statement. The company said Keytruda helped improve overall survival and progression-free survival, but failed to achieve statistical significance. Keytruda, which brought in sales of $3.28 billion in the first quarter, has already received three U.S. regulatory approvals for different types of bladder cancers. In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved reut.rs/2MKHASF Keytruda for a hard-to-treat form of bladder cancer, making it the first new treatment for the cancer in more than two decades."

9.224224760821972," UPDATE 1-No preferential access to Themis' potential COVID-19 vaccine -CEO * Potential vaccine to be available globally * Clinical studies to start soon in France, Belgium * Impossible to predict availability of vaccine * Hopes for innovative approval mechanisms * To use Merck’s global manufacturing network for vaccine (Adds detail, background) VIENNA, May 28 (Reuters) - Nobody will get preferential access to a potential COVID-19 drug developed by vaccine maker Themis Bioscience, which is being bought by U.S. pharmaceuticals firm Merck & Co Inc, the Austrian firm’s chief executive said on Thursday. “Merck has already demonstrated in the past ... that it makes vaccines available to anybody who needs them,” Erich Tauber told Reuters on Thursday, adding a potential vaccine would be made available globally. “It is one of the reasons why we have decided to cooperate with Merck.” Merck, which has largely kept to the sidelines of the race for COVID-19 treatments, said on Tuesday it was buying Themis Bioscience, which is developing its vaccine in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris. While not yet proven to be effective against the coronavirus, vaccines are seen by world leaders as the only real way to restart stalled economies. Tauber said he was very confident that a vaccine against COVID-19 can be developed and hoped it could be given as a single-dose vaccination. The strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the new disease, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was a big help in the development process as scientists already knew a lot about these two. Clinical tests for the Themis vaccine, which is based on a genetically modified measles virus that delivers bits of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body to prevent COVID-19, will start soon in France and Belgium, the CEO said. They will be extended quickly to other European countries and America. “We have proven in the past with other vaccine candidates that this measles virus vector system works very well ... we have proven that it is very safe,” he said. Based on this measles vector platform, the privately held company with 38 staff was close to a phase III study for a vaccine against the Chikungunta virus, a tropical disease, before it changed its focus due to the COVID-19 outbreak a few months ago. In clinical tests, healthy people will be vaccinated and their antibody response will be measured, Tauber said. Depending on the spread of COVID-19 in the second half of the year, Themis would also measure if these people get sick. The CEO said it was impossible to predict when the vaccine against the new coronavirus would be available. However, Themis was in close contact with regulators in Europe and the United States. “I expect that there will be swift procedures, that approval authorities will treat (applications) with the highest priority and that there will be innovative approval mechanisms,” Tauber said. Asked about manufacturing capacities, he referred to Merck’s global network, saying this was Themis’ biggest advantage compared to competitors.

11.54374575096209," CORRECTED-BlackRock says voted to split CEO, chairman roles at Exxon Mobil (Corrects spelling of Merck CEO’s surname to Frazier in paragraph 5, ‘addition’ in paragraph 4.) HOUSTON, May 27 (Reuters) - Top fund manager BlackRock Inc on Wednesday said it cast an advisory vote in favor of an independent chairman and against the reelection of two directors at Exxon Mobil Corp over the company’s approach to climate risks. Exxon shareholders on Wednesday rejected all four shareholder resolutions with none getting more than 38% of the votes cast. The independent chairman proposal fell with 32.7% in favor of an appointment when the next chief executive is named. BlackRock, which this year joined the Climate 100+ investor group seeking greenhouse gas emissions curbs, said the current board lacked independent leadership and showed no “sense of urgency” with regard to climate-related risks. “Exxon may benefit from the addition of an individual with more direct industry experience on the board,” the investor said. BlackRock is the second largest institutional owner of Exxon with about 6.7% of Exxon shares outstanding. It voted against Exxon directors Angela Braly, the former CEO of health insurer WellPoint, and Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co, over the Exxon’s “insufficient progress” on climate related financial disclosures and related action, BlackRock said. Both directors were reelected. “We continue to see a gap in the company’s disclosure and action with regard to several components of its climate risk management,” BlackRock wrote of its votes.

11.597146202412164," Merck to buy Austrian vaccine maker as it jumps into COVID-19 race CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N, which has largely kept to the sidelines of the race for COVID-19 treatments, said it was buying Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience and would collaborate with research nonprofit IAVI to develop two separate vaccines. It also announced a partnership with privately held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop an experimental oral antiviral drug against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Merck did not disclose the terms of the acquisition of Themis, a privately held company. Most big pharmaceutical companies have already placed their bets on COVID-19 treatments. But Merck has been waiting for opportunities with proven track records, Chief Executive Ken Frazier said. “We wanted to be in a position where we could choose things that have the right kind of characteristics to make a contribution for a virus that’s likely to be with us for some time,” he told Reuters in an interview. Both vaccines under development are designed to be delivered in a single dose. The Themis vaccine, developed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, is based on a modified measles virus that delivers bits of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body to prevent COVID-19. It was developed in part through funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Merck said it moving quickly with this candidate and expects to start vaccinating volunteers “within weeks.” The IAVI vaccine uses the same technology as Merck’s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO, recently approved by the European Commission and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. That candidate, which Merck is developing jointly with IAVI, is expected to start human trials sometime this year, Frazier said. The U.S. Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is backing the effort. Both vaccines are made using technologies that have resulted in licensed products, unlike some frontrunners, such as the rapidly developed vaccine from Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is expected to start large, late-stage clinical trials in July. More than 100 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are in development, with about 12 in human testing designed mainly to evaluate safety. Last week, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Merck's vaccine, and those from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Sanofi SASY.PA, were a month or two behind Moderna's, but may be added to large efficacy trials this summer as they wrap up early-stage studies. “I think we’ll be in a position to participate,” Frazier said of Merck’s vaccines. Merck intends to shoulder the cost of scaling up production of the vaccines before either has been proven to work, although it has not yet determined where they will be manufactured commercially, he said. Doses of the Themis vaccine are already being made in France for clinical trials. Merck plans to begin early production of the vaccine it is developing with IAVI at its plant in Pennsylvania. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said in a research note she expected Merck to be “an important player in the COVID-19 vaccines and treatments landscape” and called the approach to pursue multiple vaccine strategies “a good means to diversify risk.” Merck shares were up around 1.5% in late trading, as the broader U.S. stock market jumped. Frazier said Merck had not signed any pacts with the U.S. government to deliver doses of either vaccine to Americans first, adding that it was committed to making its vaccines accessible globally and affordably. The drugmaker said it signed a memorandum of understanding with CEPI and Institut Pasteur outlining its commitment to a global vaccine that is distributed based on need. Ridgeback’s antiviral drug, EIDD-2801, is designed to block virus reproduction and has shown promise in animal studies of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in early stage trials. Frazier compared it to Gilead Sciences' GILD.O remdesivir, but it would be a pill, rather than an intravenous infusion. Efficacy trials will start later this year. “If the drug works, we would be able to produce billions of doses,” Frazier added. The United States has recorded more than 1.6 million new coronavirus infections and over 97,000 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.

11.597146202412164," Lilly, Junshi Biosciences plan to start human trials of COVID-19 antibody in second quarter (Reuters) - Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co Ltd said on Tuesday it plans to start clinical studies to test its experimental antibody against COVID-19 in the United States and China in the second quarter of the year, with partner Eli Lilly and Co. Lilly and several other drugmakers such as Gilead Sciences, Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co Inc are racing to develop treatments or vaccines for the fast-spreading respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Junshi said the companies intend to file an application to begin human testing of one of their two antibodies - protective proteins produced in response to infection - tested first in rhesus monkeys. Shanghai Junshi said results from the preclinical studies, published in the science journal Nature, show that both the tested antibodies, called CA1 and CB6, showed substantial neutralization activity against the virus. The company said CB6, which showed a greater reduction in virus levels in the monkeys, will be advanced to human trials. Separately, Merck on Tuesday announced a deal and multiple partnerships to develop vaccines and test an antiviral drug against COVID-19."

11.465600973812169," AstraZeneca-Merck's Lynparza gets U.S. FDA nod for prostate cancer treatment (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AstraZeneca Plc and Merck & Co Inc’s Lynparza as a treatment for a form of prostate cancer, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday. The drug approval by the U.S. regulator is for treating patients with a form of prostate cancer that could not be held back by standard hormone therapy. The approval was based on results from a late-stage study where the drug reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 66% when compared with hormonal anticancer therapies such as enzalutamide or abiraterone. Lynparza leads a class of drugs known as PARP inhibitors, which keep cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy from repairing themselves, and is a key asset for AstraZeneca with approvals in ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers. The latest approval for the blockbuster cancer drug comes just weeks after it won broader approval as a treatment for ovarian caner in the United States. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with more than 191,000 new diagnoses expected in the United States in 2020, according to the American Cancer Society."

5.469520518570589," FDA approves Bristol-Myers combo therapy for lung cancer (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Bristol Myers Squibb Co’s combination therapy for previously untreated patients with a form of lung cancer, a much-needed boost as the company battles the dominance of Merck’s Keytruda. The combination of Bristol’s treatments, Opdivo and Yervoy, is approved for treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the FDA said. Based on a median of nine doses of Opdivo and three of Yervoy, the estimated cost of the therapy is $104,233, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. The cost varies based on factors including indication and treatment duration. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases, making it a lucrative market, which is currently dominated by Keytruda. Opdivo, which spurs the immune system to fight cancer, is one of Bristol’s top-selling drugs, but it has been overtaken by Keytruda as the industry’s immuno-oncology leader. Bristol had previously struggled in its attempts to make the Opdivo and Yervoy combination the “first-line” of treatment in the NSCLC market. In January, it withdrew the application for getting the treatment approved in Europe after regulators there balked at changes to the design of its clinical trials. The company also suffered a blow last year when it reported that Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy failed to extend overall survival more than chemotherapy alone in advanced NSCLC. Opdivo brought in sales of $7.20 billion in 2019, while Keytruda sales came in at $11.08 billion. Yervoy’s label carries a boxed warning, FDA’s harshest, flagging risks of immune-mediated adverse reactions."

-1.055123843068971," Merck sees $2.1 billion coronavirus hit to 2020 sales (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said on Tuesday it expects the coronavirus pandemic to reduce 2020 sales by more than $2 billion, and the U.S. drugmaker lowered its profit forecast as a big drop in doctors' office visits during the outbreak will take a hefty toll, sending its shares down more than 3%. Many of Merck’s top-selling products, including blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, are administered by physicians. Rival drugmakers Pfizer Inc PFE.N on Tuesday stuck to its forecasts, and Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N raised the top end of its 2020 profit outlook last week. But Merck is particularly vulnerable to stay-at-home efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus and people avoiding doctors and hospitals over fear of becoming infected. “Two-thirds of our products are physician administered, and that is probably somewhat unique and is causing the impact,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said on a conference call. Davis said he expected most of the hit to Merck’s business in the second quarter, with a potential for recovery by the end of the year as restrictions imposed due to the pandemic abate. The company, which also suspended its share buyback program, now expects full-year adjusted profit of $5.17 to $5.37 per share, down from its prior view of $5.62 to $5.77. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, whose large medical device business will be hurt by delayed elective surgeries during the pandemic, also lowered its 2020 profit forecast this month. “Strong underlying demand for Merck’s products will lead to a sales rebound in 2021 as the pandemic eventually ebbs,” said Michael Levesque, senior vice president of Moody’s. Merck beat analysts’ first-quarter profit and sales estimates on increased demand for Keytruda, largely before the coronavirus epidemic put most of the country under stay-at-home orders. Keytruda sales jumped 45% to $3.28 billion. Total sales grew 11.5% to $12.06 billion, beating estimates of $11.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Merck said it saw a slight benefit as customers stocked up on some of its products, including animal health drugs and its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cancers associated with the human papillomavirus. Merck said it was working on a coronavirus vaccine, and was in discussions with multiple groups regarding three separate potential viral vaccine platforms. It said it would announce the details of those collaborations once they are finalized. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.50 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 16 cents. Merck shares were down 3.4% at $81.12."

The company now expects its full-year adjusted profit forecast to be in the range of $5.17 to $5.37 per share, down from its prior estimates of between $5.62 and $5.77 per share. Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $3.22 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the quarter, from $2.92 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier.

The drug, Lynparza, met the key secondary goal of overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2 or ATM gene mutations, compared with hormonal anticancer therapies such as enzalutamide or abiraterone, new data here from the study showed. Last August, AstraZeneca said here the study had met its main goal and the latest positive readouts underscore its potential for expanded use. BRCA and ATM genes help produce proteins that repair damaged DNA, but can cause cancer if they mutate. “Overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has remained extremely challenging to achieve,” said José Baselga, executive VP of Oncology R&D at AstraZeneca. The treatment leads a class of drugs known as PARP inhibitors, which keep cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy from repairing themselves, and is a key asset for AstraZeneca with approvals in ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers.

The outbreak could have an impact on the company's manufacturing, supply chain and clinical trial operations, Pfizer said under the risk factors section of a regulatory filing. (bit.ly/2vcZ3yb) “The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence,” the drugmaker added. The outbreak that began in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed over 2,700 in China, with over 78,000 confirmed cases of infection, and has now spread to several other countries. Merck & Co MRK.N on Wednesday said the outbreak has negatively affected some of its clinical trials and has seen a limited effect on its supply chain of drugs into and raw materials out of China. Merck, in its regulatory filing, also warned of a negative impact to its first quarter results, which it expects to not be material. The company added it was currently unable to determine whether the outbreak will have a further impact on its results in 2020."

-8.360188442650724," Merck to slim down with asset spinoff, focus on Keytruda, vaccines (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said on Wednesday it will spin off its women's health, biosimilar drugs and older products into a separate publicly traded company as it tightens its focus on growth drivers like cancer drug Keytruda and vaccines. The new company’s assets currently make up around 15% of Merck’s total sales and around half of its drugs that treat people. Merck will retain its animal health business, as well as drugs used for acute care in hospitals such as Bridion, which reverses the effects of anesthesia. Merck shares fell 3.7% to $85.12 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported quarterly Keytruda sales below Wall Street’s lofty estimates. The spinoff is a culmination of the drugmaker’s strategy of concentrating on a few key areas, particularly oncology, where Merck has turned the immunotherapy Keytruda into one of the world’s top selling drugs, Merck Chief Executive Ken Frazier said in an interview. “The whole key to this is that it allows Merck to be much more focused on its greatest growth opportunities,” he said. That starts with Keytruda, now a mainstay of many cancer regimens including for newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer, the biggest commercial opportunity in oncology. Its sales jumped nearly 45% to $3.11 billion, below analysts’ estimates of $3.24 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Sales of the assets that will make up the new company were expected to fall or be flat through 2024, but it can achieve growth through management attention, said Kevin Ali, a Merck veteran who will head the new company. Merck, which expects to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021, said the new company will send it $8 billion to $9 billion through a special tax-free dividend. The new entity is expected to have $8.5 to $9.5 billion in debt. Merck forecast cost savings of over $1.5 billion by 2024 after the spinoff. Announcement of the spinoff without more color on management succession could cause some concern for investors said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen. Merck in 2018 scrapped a policy requiring CEOs step down at age 65, ensuring that Frazier, who turned 65 last year, can remain at the helm. However, the spinoff was not related to succession, Frazier told Reuters. “Our board has a process in place for succession. This is really again taking actions today that will assure the longer term growth.” Merck also reported an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.16 per share, beating analysts’ estimates by a penny.

-7.117069837689993," Merck's Keytruda wins U.S. FDA approval for bladder cancer (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday it approved Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda for a hard-to-treat form of bladder cancer, making it the first new treatment for the cancer in more than two decades. The therapy was approved for patients with a high-risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer who have undergone prior treatment and are ineligible for or have opted out of surgical removal of the bladder. The approval was based on results from a mid-stage study in which nearly 41% of patients on Keytruda showed a complete response, with about half of them having a complete response for at least a year. “This is the first time that we’re recognizing that systemic immune activation can lead to durable remission of cancer,” said Dr. Arjun Balar of NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center, the study’s lead investigator. “That is probably the path forward in terms of helping our patients preserve their bladder with bladder cancer.” Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is commonly treated with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. However, patients who do not respond to the vaccine have limited treatment options other than surgery, which comes with substantial risk of complications, hospitalizations, and even death. Merck had estimated that more than 80,000 Americans were newly diagnosed with bladder cancer over the last year, of which more than three fourths of patients were expected to have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating a number of cancers including melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma."

-11.639611577002455," Merck's Keytruda shows mixed results in phase 3 trial for small cell lung cancer (Reuters) - Merck & Co said a phase 3 trial of cancer drug Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy showed an increase in the amount of time patients lived with small cell lung cancer without it getting worse, but did not extend overall survival. While the blockbuster drug showed improvement in overall survival for patients treated with Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy, it did not meet statistical significance, the company said on Monday. Keytruda has been approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for around 85% of lung cancer cases, and currently holds a dominant position in that market. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 10% to 15% of all cases of lung cancer, Merck said. It said the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with any stage of SCLC is estimated to be 6%.

The vaccine, Ervebo, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, a month after Europe gave its nod to the vaccine, a move that has been hailed by the World Health Organization. “We have made a commitment to making the vaccine available to GAVI-eligible countries at the lowest possible access price,” Merck spokesman Skip Irvine said. “We have made that commitment but we have not yet established the price for the vaccine.” Stockpile of 500,00 doses of Ebola vaccine is being established for emergency use in outbreaks of the deadly fever by the GAVI global vaccine alliance, Reuters reported earlier this month. The stockpiling will start with Merck’s Ervebo vaccine. GAVI, a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank and UNICEF, arranges bulk buys to reduce vaccine costs for poor countries. “We are partnering with both GAVI and WHO to put that stockpile in place as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement, adding that the stockpile of vaccines will be governed and executed by the owner of the stockpile and not by Merck. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects. There have been more than 3,000 cases of Ebola, including 2,199 deaths, in the outbreak that was declared in August 2018. The WHO declared it an international emergency in July 2019.

Wall Street is focused on Dec. 15, when the next round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports is scheduled to take effect. China said on Monday that it hoped to make a trade deal with the United States as soon as possible. Investor hopes of at least an initial U.S.-China agreement has helped pushed major stock indexes to record highs, with the benchmark S&P 500 hovering about 0.5% below its all-time high. “It’s not uncommon for stocks to pause, given where they are, in advance of some news,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “We get the chance to see whether or not the rally we have had in U.S. stocks is warranted from a fundamental perspective and whether or not we are still moving in the right direction,” Delwiche said. Aside from U.S.-China trade developments, investors will focus this week on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, an election in the United Kingdom, and potential agreement related to a North American trade pact. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.53 points, or 0.3%, to 27,931.53, the S&P 500 lost 7.06 points, or 0.22%, to 3,138.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.37 points, or 0.26%, to 8,634.16. Most of the S&P 500 sectors were lower, with healthcare and tech weighing the most on the index.

-10.390648810234348," Merck pushes deeper into targeted cancer therapy with $2.7 billion ArQule deal (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said on Monday it would buy ArQule Inc ARQL.O for $2.7 billion, as it looks to tap into the drug developer's experimental blood cancer therapy that targets genetic mutations. Big drugmakers have been spending heavily to scoop up targeted cancer therapies, seen as a potential alternative to chemotherapy that has many adverse side effects. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N paid $8 billion for Loxo Oncology, and Pfizer Inc PFE.N agreed to a $10.6 billion deal for Array Biopharma. Merck’s offer of $20 per share was more than double ArQule’s closing price on Friday, placing a high premium on its lead drug ARQ 531. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen called the deal smart and strategic. ArQule’s pipeline will bolster Merck’s oncology franchise at a time when Wall Street is very interested in its acquisition strategy and plans after its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda loses market exclusivity in 2028, she said. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted ArQule’s focus on precision medicine has yielded multiple oral kinase inhibitors, drugs that work by inhibiting cancer-causing proteins, that have “novel and important properties”. Kinase inhibitors have driven over $97 billion in acquisitions since 2010 - about 37% of the total value of cancer drug-focused deals - according to an analysis from brokerage SVB Leerink in August. ArQule on Monday also reported positive data from an early-stage study testing ARQ 531 at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Florida.. The company’s shares rose to $19.69. “We see this acquisition as unlocking value for investors as it places ARQ 531 in the hands of a larger player who can develop this asset more broadly and aggressively,” SVB Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang said. The deal is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2020. ARQ 531 sales are expected to grow to $508 million in 2028, according to brokerage H.C. Wainwright. At present, Keytruda, which treats numerous types of cancer, is Merck’s most important growth driver. Although sales of Keytruda have surged ahead of Opdivo, a rival medicine from Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY.N, to top $3 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, analysts have warned Merck may be relying too heavily on it. Merck in May announced a deal for Peloton Therapeutics Inc for $1.05 billion in cash and said it would buy Tilos Therapeutics for up to $773 million a month later."

J&J said it submitted two marketing authorization applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its vaccine regimen targeting the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, which most commonly causes outbreaks of the deadly disease. The company's vaccine requires two injections administered about eight weeks apart, the first developed using J&J's technology and the second from Denmark-based biotech Bavarian Nordic A/S BAVA.CO. Johnson & Johnson’s applications are supported by data from over 10 studies that have tested the regimen in adults and children, the company said. The drugmaker added it was discussing with the Food and Drug Administration the dataset that would be required for U.S. approval. Since it first started in August 2018, the Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people, second only to the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The EMA’s recommendation for approval in October of Merck’s Ebola vaccine, taken as a single shot, was hailed by the World Health Organization as a “triumph for public health” that could save many lives. This month, health authorities in Democratic Republic of Congo are introducing Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine to counter the current outbreak in the country’s eastern provinces, where Merck’s vaccine is already in use. J&J’s unit Janssen is also working in collaboration with the World Health Organization to enable registration of the Ebola vaccine regimen in African countries, the company said."

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a determination by a federal judge in Delaware that the Merck patent at issue in the case, which relates to hepatitis C treatment, was invalid. Merck said in a statement it was disappointed with the decision and reviewing its options for an appeal, while Gilead said it was pleased with the ruling and confident it would be upheld if appealed further. In 2016, a jury returned a verdict that Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed the patent, which Merck acquired when it bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals. Jurors determined that Gilead should pay $2.54 billion in damages, which was the largest verdict ever in a U.S. patent case. But a federal judge in Delaware tossed the verdict in 2018, saying the Merck patent should not have been granted in the first place because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation. In Wednesday’s split decision, the appeals court said it agreed with that determination."

3.217640831010793," Merck sees ongoing Keytruda strength as its sales top $3 billion in quarter (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N on Tuesday said it expected immunotherapy Keytruda to continue its market dominance as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer as sales of the drug topped $3 billion in a quarter for the first time, beating lofty Wall Street estimates. Merck shares rose more than 2% to $84 in early trading. Keytruda has become the go to treatment for newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer, with eight out of 10 eligible U.S. patients now receiving the therapy. “We still think we are in the early innings of growth for this product,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said in an interview. “In addition to new indications across different tumor types, you also see us moving into earlier lines of therapy.” Rivals AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N have been testing combinations of their cancer drugs in a bid to catch up in first-line advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market. “While we know it’ll be eventually competitive,” Merck Chief Commercial Officer Franklin Clyburn said, “we feel very confident in our position.” “What we’re hearing ... in the physician community is that they really believe Keytruda now has established itself as a standard of care in lung,” Clyburn added on a call with analysts and investors. Keytruda sales in the third quarter surged 62.5% to $3.07 billion, easily topping analysts’ estimates of $2.88 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Higher demand in China, along with higher prices in the United States, boosted third-quarter sales of Gardasil, the company’s vaccine to prevent cancer caused by human papillomavirus. Gardasil sales rose 26% to $1.32 billion, topping d beat estimates of $994.3 million. The company noted that sales growth for Gardasil would be constrained in 2020 as demand for the vaccine outpaces supply. It said it intends to significantly ramp up production by 2023 to meet demand outside the United States. Merck said it is increasing production from existing plants and commissioned construction of two new facilities for the vaccines. Sales of medicines in China grew by 90%, excluding the impact of a stronger dollar, helping overall revenue grow nearly 15% to $12.40 billion. Analysts had expected sales of $11.64 billion. Merck raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to between $5.12 and $5.17 per share from a prior range of $4.84 to $4.94. Analysts were expecting $4.92 per share.

8.164593974801983," WHO hails 'triumph' as Merck's Ebola vaccine gets European green light LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first Ebola vaccine was recommended for approval by European drugs regulators on Friday in a move hailed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a “triumph for public health” that would save many lives. The vaccine, developed by U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co, is already being used under emergency guidelines to try to protect people against the spread of a deadly Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo. It protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus - the one that most commonly causes outbreaks. The shot is also being reviewed under a fast-track system by regulators in the United States, with a decision expected in the first quarter of next year. “This vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulators will help it to eventually save many more,” the WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. The Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year. It is the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing license from the European Commission in a few weeks. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the company’s priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine “can be used to support global public health preparedness”. Merck’s vaccine is being used in Congo in a so-called “ring vaccination” approach, in which people who may have been in contact with someone newly infected with Ebola are traced and offered the shot to protect them. Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust global heath charity said the Merck shot had already saved “countless lives” in the country. “Having this vaccine available under research conditions has been key in preventing the ongoing outbreak in the DRC spiraling into a repeat of the 2014-16 epidemic, where 11,000 people died,” she told Reuters. Health authorities in Kinshasa said last week they planned to introduce an experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, in the country’s eastern provinces in November. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects. There are currently no licensed treatments for the deadly infection, but scientists said in August they were a step closer to being able to cure it after two experimental drugs showed survival rates of as much as 90% in a clinical trial in Congo."

8.228612847425202," Reuters asks judge to release secret Propecia documents SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Reuters asked a U.S. judge on Thursday to unseal documents filed in court regarding potential risks associated with Propecia, Merck & Co's MRK.N popular baldness drug. The motion was filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, after a Reuters article on Wednesday revealed accusations that Merck did not fully disclose on Propecia’s label the incidence and duration of sexual dysfunction in men who took Propecia in clinical trials. Those allegations are contained in court filings that had been intended to be filed under seal. Federal District Judge Brian Cogan has allowed Merck to keep secret internal company documents in litigation brought by Propecia users against the company. A faulty redaction allowed Reuters to view some of the details in a plaintiff’s brief, but the underlying Merck documents cited in that brief are still sealed. Those are the documents the Reuters motion seeks to make public. “This is a case of tremendous importance that has been sealed without on-the-record findings explaining that sealing,” Reuters argued in its motion to intervene in the case. “The First Amendment precludes such an outcome.” Merck did not respond to a request for comment. The company previously told Reuters it “stands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia” and noted that the drug has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. A June 25 Reuters investigation revealed how judges have allowed the makers of dozens of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one. The investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured over the past couple of decades by allegedly defective products -- drugs, cars, medical devices and other products -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained under seal. More than 1,100 Propecia-related lawsuits filed across the U.S. against Merck were consolidated before Judge Cogan in so-called multidistrict litigation (MDL). Merck agreed to settle most of them last year for $4.3 million, to be divided among the plaintiffs. Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug’s original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials, and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegation in court. Under U.S. law, court filings are presumed to be public, and the bar for secrecy is particularly high for the Propecia documents Reuters seeks to unseal, the motion states, because they are essential to plaintiffs’ claim that the drug causes persistent sexual side effects. “These documents should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons,” Reuters argued.

-0.6481733069187454," GSK ends development of Ebola vaccine, hands work to U.S. institute LONDON (Reuters) - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L is giving up its work on developing three potential vaccines against the deadly Ebola and Marburg viruses, despite an ongoing Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo. While Ebola is a deadly and contagious disease, it is also still relatively rare, making the potential market for a vaccine sporadic and very likely unprofitable. This poses a dilemma for drug companies: With no real prospect of a financial return, can they justify the investment in expensive development and trials. GSK’s vaccine candidates - two designed to protect against Ebola and one against the Marburg virus - will be transferred to the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C., the British drugmaker said in a statement. There is no financial element to the agreement, a spokesman said. The transfer agreement will see Sabin continue to develop the candidate vaccines, one of which - a potential Ebola shot known as ChAd3 - has been through mid-stage, Phase II, trials in Africa and could possibly be used to halt or limit future Ebola epidemics. “Enabling Sabin to build on the scientific progress GSK has delivered up to Phase II increases the likelihood these candidate vaccines may help prevent potential future outbreaks,” Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines, said in a statement. GSK had put its Ebola vaccine work on hold after it was unable to progress the product through final stage, or Phase III, clinical trials toward the end of the 2014-16 epidemic, due to a dwindling number of Ebola cases. U.S. drugmakers Merck MRK.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N are also developing potential vaccines against Ebola, and have made more progress with them than GSK had in clinical trials. The Merck shot, known as VSV EBOV, is currently being used in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, which was last month declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease has killed more than 1,800 people in the Congo outbreak which began a year ago and has become the second-worst on record. GSK said Sabin had agreed a collaboration deal with the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to further develop the vaccine candidates. The ChAd3 shot was originally developed by NIAID in collaboration with the Swiss-based firm Okairos, which was bought by GSK in 2013. All three experimental vaccines have shown promise in safety trials after being administered to more than 5,000 adults and 600 children, GSK said."
4.230808352499202," Cancer drug Keytruda, vaccines propel Merck to quarterly profit beat (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Tuesday and raised its full-year earnings forecast on strong demand for its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and vaccines. Merck shares rose 1.3% to $83.56 in afternoon trading. Sales of Keytruda surged 58% to $2.63 billion in the quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates for about $2.5 billion. A run of positive clinical data for Keytruda and setbacks for its biggest rival - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's BMY.N Opdivo - has led to a dominant position for Merck's drug as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market. Keytruda, Merck’s most important growth driver, has racked up U.S. approvals to treat numerous cancer types since it was first approved for advanced melanoma in 2014. “We right now have built a wall of data that we feel very comfortable with,” Chief Commercial Officer Franklin Clyburn said on a conference call with analysts. Some investors have raised concerns about Merck over-reliance on Keytruda and have looked for a large deal to lessen that dependence, along the lines of AbbVie's ABBV.N $63 billion deal for Allergan Plc AGN.N. But analysts have forecast continued strong Keytruda growth for several years. Merck Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier reiterated that Merck would focus on bolt-on deals “across the spectrum in terms of size” rather than a large, transformative acquisition. Sales of Merck’s Gardasil vaccine to prevent cancers associated with the human papillomavirus jumped 45.7% to $886 million, helped by both demand and a U.S. price increase. Overall vaccine sales rose 33% to $2 billion, also boosted by the company’s measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot amid the worst U.S. measles outbreak since 1992. Sales of Merck’s MMR and chicken pox vaccines rose 58% to $675 million in the quarter. Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said he expects that business to grow, a forecast that is not based on the assumption of additional outbreaks. The U.S. drugmaker increased its forecast for 2019 adjusted earnings, raising the midpoint by 16 cents. Merck now expects to earn between $4.84 and $4.94 per share, up from its prior view of $4.67 to $4.79. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.30 per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate by 14 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2.9747683730306," Merck's treatment for urinary, abdominal infections gets FDA approval (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck & Co Inc’s combination treatment for complicated forms of urinary tract and abdominal infections, the drugmaker said on Wednesday. Recarbrio, approved for patients over 18 years of age, is a combination of a previously approved antibiotic imipenem-cilastatin and Merck’s relebactam. Patients with urinary tract infections can develop complications if appropriate doses of the right antibiotics are not administered. At least 20% of complications are caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria that severely limit treatment options. Health agencies around the world have been pushing for newer versions of antibiotics to address the growing threat of antimicrobial-resistant infections. ""It is important that the use of Recarbrio be reserved for situations when there are limited or no alternative antibacterial drugs for treating a patient's infection,"" the FDA said in a statement. (reut.rs/2JKTXfD) The approvals were based on limited clinical safety and efficacy data for Recarbrio, the company noted. Relebactam is expected to bring in revenue of $50 million in 2020 and $150 million in 2024, Cowen & Co analyst Steve Scala said ahead of the approval. The relebactam combination had been granted FDA’s ‘fast track’ status, which allows the agency to expedite the review process for certain drugs meant for serious conditions with unmet medical need. Merck, which expects to make Recarbrio available later this year, already has an approved treatment, Zerbaxa, for complicated urinary tract infections and intra-abdominal infections.

-0.14207573634107662," U.S. judge strikes down Trump administration rule requiring drug prices in TV ads (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday dealt a blow to the Trump administration by striking down a new rule that would have forced pharmaceutical companies to include the wholesale prices of their drugs in television advertising. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington sided with drugmakers Merck & Co Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and Amgen Inc by halting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule from taking effect on Tuesday as planned. Mehta in his ruling set aside the entire rule as invalid, saying HHS lacked authority from the U.S. Congress to compel drug manufacturers to disclose list prices. “It is outrageous that an Obama appointed judge sided with big PhRMA to keep high drug prices secret from the American people, leaving patients and families as the real victims,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is the largest industry lobbying group. HHS Secretary Alex Azar had announced the rule on May 8, saying that forcing drugmakers to disclose their prices in direct-to-consumer TV advertising could help drive down skyrocketing prescription drug costs if the companies were embarrassed by them or afraid they would scare away customers. HHS in a statement on Tuesday said it was disappointed in the court’s decision, adding that it would work with the Department of Justice on next steps in the litigation. “President Trump and Secretary Azar remain focused on lowering drug prices and empowering patients through more transparency in healthcare costs,” the agency said. The rule was originally suggested in May 2018 as part of Trump’s “blueprint” to lower prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers. The judge said such disclosures could well be an effective tool in halting the rising cost of prescription drugs. “But no matter how vexing the problem of spiraling drug costs may be, HHS cannot do more than what Congress has authorized,” Mehta concluded. Under the rule, the wholesale, or list, price would be included if it was $35 or more for a month’s supply or the usual course of therapy. HHS said the 10 most commonly advertised drugs had list prices of $488 to $16,938 per month or for a usual course of therapy. PhRMA said the list prices could be confusing for patients and discourage them from seeking medical care. Merck, Eli Lilly and Amgen filed their lawsuit alongside the Association Of National Advertisers trade group on June 14, arguing the rule would confuse consumers by forcing them to disclose a price irrelevant to patients with health insurance. Drugmakers have long argued that list prices do not reflect out-of-pocket costs for most U.S. consumers or take into account the actual prices paid after discounts and rebates negotiated with health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to ensure patient access to the medicines. The lawsuit alleged that HHS lacked authority to issue the rule and that it violated drugmakers’ free-speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Justice Department defended the rule in court, saying it met a standard the U.S. Supreme Court set in 1985, when it held the government could force advertisers to disclose factual, non-controversial information."
1.3668446724961043," Merck CEO sees legal challenge if U.S. adopts drug pricing based on other countries NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Chief Executive Ken Frazier said on Thursday a rule to base the price the U.S. government pays for some prescription drugs in it Medicare program on lower prices in other countries would face legal challenges if adopted. U.S. President Donald Trump said last year that one way his administration would seek to lower drug costs to consumers could be through an international pricing index (IPI) that would determine what Medicare pays for certain medicines based on the prices set in a handful of other countries. A proposed version of the rule is expected in August. Other developed nations with single payer systems typically pay far less for drugs than the United States, which Trump called “global freeloading.” “I think there will be challenges to the rule,” Frazier told reporters following the drugmaker’s investor day in New York. “A lot of people have objections to that rule. It’s not just pharmaceutical companies.” Frazier, a lawyer by trade, did not say whether Merck would launch its own legal challenge to the proposed rule. The company was one of three U.S. drugmakers that sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week over a new government regulation requiring them to disclose the list price of prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer television advertisements. Of the Trump administration proposals to lower drug costs, the IPI option is the one Frazier said most concerns him, due to the effect importing price controls from other countries might have on innovation and patient access in the United States. “We tell incomplete stories about those markets,” Frazier said, noting that some countries ration treatments available to patients. He pointed to lower survival rates for lung cancer in Britain, which has an agency that can bar the use of approved new medicines based on their cost. Earlier on Thursday, Merck executives touted the company’s pipeline of experimental drugs beyond its blockbuster cancer treatment Keytruda. The investor event was also an opportunity for Merck to showcase executives other than Frazier, who turns 65 in December. Last year, the company scrapped its mandatory retirement age of 65 for its CEO, saying it gave the board flexibility around finding his successor. “I’m extremely pleased by the breadth of the leadership talent at the company,” Frazier said in response to a question about succession. “I know that the board feels the same way. And they will continue to look at when the right opportunity is ... to make a selection.”"

0.5950742755349847," Merck's Keytruda wins FDA approval to treat head and neck cancer (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a type of head and neck cancer. The drug was approved for use as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with a common chemotherapy regimen, to treat previously untreated patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Merck said. The approval is based on results from a late-stage trial, where Keytruda showed a significant improvement in overall survival in cancer patients, Merck said. Keytruda, a type of immunotherapy called a PD-1 inhibitor, is already an approved treatment for several forms of cancer, including lung and skin cancers. Head and neck cancer includes tumors in the mouth, tongue, nose, sinuses, throat and lymph nodes in the neck. Merck estimates that there will be more than 65,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed in 2019 in the United States. Keytruda works by increasing the ability of patients’ immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. The drug has been amassing approvals as a standalone therapy and in combination with other drugs to treat several forms of cancer. It is the leading immunotherapy for treating lung cancer, ahead of rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca. Keytruda, first approved for advanced melanoma in 2014, is Merck’s most important growth driver. It has overtaken Bristol’s Opdivo as the industry’s immuno-oncology leader with sales expected to top $10 billion this year and $20 billion in 2024, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Keytruda brought in revenue of $7.17 billion for Merck in 2018, while Bristol’s Opdivo earned $6.74 billion."

8.682659727838454," Merck wins U.S. FDA approval for expanded use of antibiotic (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said here on Monday it approved expanded use of Merck & Co Inc's antibiotic to treat hospital-acquired pneumonia in patients 18 years and older. The approval is based on the treatment’s late-stage trial results, which showed that Merck’s drug, Zerbaxa, was as effective as another antibacterial drug. Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs in patients at least two to three days after being admitted or in those who are on mechanical breathing machines and have life-threatening lung infections with high mortality rates. These infections are typically treated using antibiotics, but the growing problem of antibiotic resistance has rendered some of the most commonly prescribed treatments ineffective. While the U.S. FDA has been pushing for newer versions of antibiotics, drugmakers have shied away from developing the treatments, as combating antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, popularly known as superbugs, becomes increasingly challenging. At least 2 million people in the United States develop serious infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resulting in nearly 23,000 deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Zerbaxa, which was previously approved for treating complicated urinary tract infections and intra-abdominal infections, was added to Merck's drug portfolio through its buyout here of antibiotics maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals. Merck’s shares were up 1.2% at $80.17 in late afternoon trading."

10.050866557791633," Merck buys Peloton to expand its kidney cancer treatment portfolio (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc on Tuesday agreed to buy Peloton Therapeutics Inc for $1.05 billion in cash, gaining access to the privately held company’s lead kidney cancer drug candidate. The acquisition can strengthen Merck’s presence in the field of renal cell carcinoma and bolster its cancer drug portfolio. Merck’s blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda was approved last month in the United States for treating renal cell cancer. “This is a classic bolt-on deal. Peloton has a drug that looks promising in renal cell carcinoma, and there’s actually been a lot of success in the field in recent years,” said Brad Loncar, who runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. Peloton expects to start studying its lead drug, a kidney cancer treatment code named as “PT2977”, in a late-stage trial in the second half of this year. In an older mid-stage trial testing patients whose cancer had spread even after treatment with at least one therapy, 24% of patients treated with Peloton’s drug showed an at least 30% shrinkage of targeted lesions. Confident of its pipeline, Peloton was earlier looking to go public and had given a pricing range of $15 to $17 per share for its initial public offering last week. At the upper limit of that range, the company would have been valued at $903.6 million, including underwriters’ option and other outstanding shares. With the Merck deal now in place, Peloton shareholders would be eligible to receive a further $1.15 billion on achieving certain sales and regulatory milestones. “The deal announced today should also underscore the opportunity for other small and mid cap biotech names in the cancer biology space,” said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen.

9.307873160612896," Supreme Court gives Merck another shot to avoid Fosamax lawsuits WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave Merck & Co a new opportunity to avoid lawsuits accusing the company of failing to properly warn patients of debilitating thigh-bone fractures from taking its osteoporosis drug Fosamax, throwing out a lower court decision that had revived the litigation. The nine justices unanimously directed the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision to let the lawsuits proceed even though the Food and Drug Administration had rebuffed Merck when the company sought to add a warning to Fosamax’s label about fracture risk. Monday’s ruling added clarity to a powerful defense employed by drug makers that product liability claims brought under state law are preempted by the actions of a federal agency, because federal law generally trumps state law under the U.S. Constitution. Merck argued that it cannot be penalized for failing to issue a warning that the FDA had blocked. Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA denied its warning label proposal. After a task force further studied the issue, the FDA in 2010 ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning, which Merck did. The plaintiffs contend that the FDA rejected only Merck’s proposed language for the warning that focused on relatively minor stress fractures rather than the more serious fractures they suffered. In a decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court said a drug manufacturer must show it “fully informed” the FDA of the need for a warning before it was rebuffed and that judges, not juries, must decide whether such lawsuits are preempted, as Merck has claimed. Lower courts now must revisit the case reflecting the Supreme Court’s guidance. Merck’s shares were flat on Monday. Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. But it may increase the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint, often requiring surgical intervention. ‘FULLY COMMITTED’ In a statement, Merck said it was pleased with the decision and “remains fully committed to defending these cases going forward and will continue to present evidence that it acted appropriately at all times in regard to the potential risk of atypical femur fractures.” David Frederick, an attorney for the Fosamax users who sued Merck, said Monday’s decision reaffirms patients’ ability to hold drug companies accountable. “This opinion protects access to justice for injured patients,” Frederick said. Sales of Fosamax, also available as a generic drug, totaled $209 million in 2018, according to New Jersey-based Merck. Fosamax users sued Merck, alleging the drug caused them to sustain serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000. A federal trial court in New Jersey threw out the cases, but in 2017 the 3rd Circuit allowed the claims to proceed to trial, ruling that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck’s phrasing of the proposed warning label. On Monday, three justices - John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh - agreed with the outcome of the case but did not join Breyer’s decision. In a separate opinion, Alito signaled sympathy for Merck, noting the FDA had long been aware of the issue and was communicating with drug manufacturers, and noted that President Donald Trump’s administration also backs Merck’s position."

7.023569280931043," Merck steps up U.S. measles vaccine production with increased demand NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Wednesday it has increased production of the measles vaccine to meet an uptick in demand in the United States in the midst of the country’s biggest outbreak in 25 years. Merck, the sole U.S. supplier of measles vaccines, said the increased demand was noticeable, but did not amount to a surge, and has not required a significant increase in distribution across the country. “Despite what we’ve seen as a huge uptick in the number of cases ... the demand side of the equation hasn’t been outstripping our underlying capacity,” Merck Chief Marketing Officer Mike Nally, who also runs the firms Global Human Health business, said in an interview. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 704 cases of measles as of April 26, a 1.3 percent increase since the 695 reported last week. The vast majority of cases have occurred in children who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and public health officials are working to ensure immunization. The measles virus is highly contagious and can cause blindness, deafness, brain damage or death. It is currently spreading in outbreaks in many parts of the world. U.S. officials deemed the disease eliminated in 2000, yet outbreaks still happen as infected travelers expose vulnerable populations to the virus, particularly in communities with many vaccine skeptics. Adults in the United States who were vaccinated against measles decades ago may also need a new dose of the vaccine depending on when they received the shot and whether they live in an outbreak zone or plan to travel to one, according to public health experts battling the outbreak. Merck said on Tuesday that U.S. sales of MMR and chickenpox vaccines rose around 10 percent to $343 million in the first quarter. Nally said much of the increase came from sales to private clinics, which pay more than the government for the vaccines, rather than an increase in volume. He said there are pockets of demand for the vaccine around areas where there have been cases of measles. The current outbreak has been concentrated in New York City, where officials said more than 390 cases have been recorded since October, mostly among children in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn. But Merck has not see a significant uptick of purchases from the CDC, which is a large supplier of the pediatric population through its Vaccines for Children program. Merck’s Nally said the company believes it will be able to meet that new demand. “As measles outbreaks have occurred in different parts of the world over the last few decades, we’ve always been able to surge capacity, and we feel confident about our ability to do so in the U.S,” he said."
6.499988430525562," Merck raises full-year forecasts as vaccines power profit beat (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc reported higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday on increased demand for vaccines and cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, and the U.S. drugmaker raised its 2019 earnings and revenue forecasts. Gardasil, a vaccine for preventing cancers associated with human papillomavirus, powered much of the earnings beat, helped by higher vaccination rates in Europe, while other vaccines, such as the company’s measles shot, also helped results. Sales of Keytruda surged 55 percent to $2.27 billion. While shy of lofty Wall Street estimates of $2.33 billion, they topped Bristol-Myers Squibb’s rival drug Opdivo, which brought in $1.8 billion, for the fourth consecutive quarter. Lung cancer accounted for 65 percent of Keytruda’s U.S. sales. But it has piled up approvals to treat several other types of cancer, including a recent U.S. approval in combination with a Pfizer drug for advanced kidney cancer. “We are feeling very excited about the opportunities outside of lung,” Chief Commercial Officer Frank Clyburn said on a call with analysts and investors. The company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $4.67 to $4.79 per share, up from its prior forecast of $4.57 to $4.72. It raised its 2019 revenue forecast to $43.9 billion to $45.1 billion from $43.2 billion to $44.7 billion. Merck shares rose 1.3 percent to $77.80. Gardasil sales rose 27 percent to $828 million, beating analyst expectations by about $25 million. Sales of the company’s measles-mumps-rubella and chickenpox vaccines rose 27 percent to $496 million, helped by government tenders in Latin America and higher European and U.S. demand. Measles cases in the United States have hit their highest level since the virus was declared eradicated in 2000, with a total of at least 705 confirmed cases so far. Merck is the sole provider of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The company said it plans a restructuring program to optimize its manufacturing and supply network and cut its real estate footprint, and expects to take related charges of $500 million in 2019. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.22 per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate by 16 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tecentriq plus chemotherapy for untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), after a study showed patients getting the drug cocktail lived a median 12.3 months, compared to 10.3 months for those getting chemotherapy alone, Genentech said in a statement. About 10 to 15 percent of lung cancers are small cell, or oat cell cancer, where tumours tend to spread very early. Advances in SCLC treatment have been slow in coming, and Roche has hailed Tecentriq as the first potential new first-line option in two decades. The FDA’s decision on Monday follows approval of Tecentriq combinations in recent weeks for triple negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Tecentriq’s 2018 revenue were 772 million Swiss francs ($766 million), compared with $7.2 billion for Merck’s Keytruda immunotherapy and $6.7 billion for Bristol’s Opdivo. The two rival drugs that harness the body’s own immune system to fight disease had a roughly two-year head start on Roche’s drug, which along with mounting data underscoring their effectiveness for some patients with different cancers has helped them gain a big lead in sales. Opdivo is already approved in small cell lung cancer in cases where patients fail at least two other treatments, while Keytruda is now under priority FDA review, also for third-line treatment of SCLC.

0.08006587905755005," AstraZeneca's Lynparza meets main goal in late-stage pancreatic cancer study (Reuters) - British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc said on Tuesday its cancer drug being jointly developed with U.S.-based Merck & Co met the primary goal in a late-stage study for a rare type of pancreatic cancer. The study showed that Lynparza was successful as a first-line maintenance treatment for adults with a form of genetically-mutated pancreatic cancer called germline BRCA -mutated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Lynparza, which is currently being used as a treatment for ovarian and breast cancers, showed it was better at delaying the rare pancreatic cancer from getting worse in patients when compared to a placebo. Maintenance therapy means prolonged use and likely higher sales for AstraZeneca, whose new cancer drugs led by Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Lynparza helped it turnaround its drug sales. Lynparza was abandoned at one time by AstraZeneca, but was revived by Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot when he took over in 2012. The drug became the first PARP drug to reach the market when it won U.S. approval for ovarian cancer at the end of 2014. PARP inhibitors work by blocking enzymes involved in repairing damaged DNA of cancer cells, thereby helping to kill them.

0.22118072199487226," Merck's Keytruda fails late-stage study in liver cancer patients (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s cancer drug Keytruda failed a late-stage trial’s main goals of slowing disease progression and extending the life of patients with a common type of liver cancer, the company said on Tuesday. The results could hamper prospects for the drug, which had received an accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November as a treatment for patients with advanced liver cancer who had been previously treated with Bayer AG’s Nexavar. Keytruda, which is approved to treat several forms of cancer including skin and lung cancer, is Merck’s biggest drug and brought in revenue of $7.17 billion last year. The late-stage Keynote-240 study was testing the blockbuster cancer drug in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were previously treated with systemic therapy. The drug’s continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon the results of confirmatory trials, Merck said. While patients on the drug did see some improvement in overall survival and disease progression compared to those in the placebo group, the results were not statistically significant. Even though disappointing, the results are generally consistent with findings from the mid-stage study which led to Keytruda’s accelerated approval, Merck said in a statement. The drugmaker, whose shares fell about 1 percent in after-market trading, said it is testing Keytruda in 10 clinical trials as a treatment for HCC."

-0.17920947927505415," Merck, Pfizer drug combo extends kidney cancer survival: study (Reuters) - A combination of Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda and Pfizer Inc’s Inlyta helped patients with advanced kidney cancer live longer than those receiving and older Pfizer standalone therapy, according to data from a late-stage study presented on Saturday. Nearly 90 percent of patients who received the combination therapy were still alive after 12 months compared with about 78 percent of patients who were alive after a year when treated with the older drug Sutent, data showed. Merck on Monday released interim data from the trial, saying the combination reduced the risk of death by 47 percent compared with Sutent. The findings add to an arsenal of positive clinical data for Keytruda, which is approved to treat several types of cancer, making it by far Merck’s most important growth driver. Patients who received the Keytruda/Inlyta combination also went longer before their disease started to worsen, a measure known as progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 15.1 months for the combination versus 11.1 months for those treated with Sutent. Results from the trial of 861 previously untreated patients were presented at a cancer meeting in San Francisco and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Keytruda/Inlyta combination, if approved, could provide serious competition for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s immunotherapy combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. That therapy, currently considered a gold standard for previously untreated advanced kidney cancer patients, has shown a 67 percent survival rate after two years. A similar kidney cancer trial pitting Sutent against a combination of Inlyta and the immunotherapy Bavencio, sold by Pfizer and Germany’s Merck KGaA, was also presented at the meeting on Saturday. The Bavencio combination led to a median PFS of 13.8 months compared with 8.4 months for Sutent. While full overall survival data was not yet available, at the end of 11.6 months, 37 of 442 patients in the Bavencio arm of the study had died, while 44 of 444 patients in the Sutent group had died after 10.7 months, researchers said. “Both combinations are expected to become new standards of care and to be incorporated into future (treatment) guidelines,” Bernard Escudier from France’s Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus said in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine. Immunotherapies help the immune system to recognize and attack cancer. Inlyta is a newer chemotherapy than Sutent that is also approved to treat advanced kidney cancer. In the Keytruda trial, four patients died from what were deemed to be treatment-related side effects versus seven in the Sutent group."

The interim findings of the trial testing Keytruda in combination with other cancer drugs such as Lynparza, which it jointly develops and sells with AstraZeneca, and chemotherapy docetaxel showed anti-tumor activity, Merck said. “These promising data .. coupled with the significant unmet medical need in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, propelled us to initiate three new Phase 3 trials to further evaluate these Keytruda combination regimens,” said Roy Baynes, chief medical officer at Merck Research Laboratories.

-1.0523844318569109," Merck, Pfizer combo treatment boosts kidney cancer survival NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said on Monday that the combination of its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda with Pfizer Inc’s Inlyta cut the risk of death nearly in half for patients with the most common form of kidney cancer when compared with treatment with chemotherapy drug Sutent. Merck said the treatments when used as the initial treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) reduced the risk of death by about 47 percent in its late-stage trial. The drugs also improved progression-free survival and had a higher response rate in patients than treatment with chemotherapy. The drugmaker said it will present full results from the trial at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco later this week. Keytruda has been Merck’s most important growth driver with its domination of the lucrative lung cancer space, and shows no sign of slowing as it produces positive clinical data and adds approvals for different types of cancer. Approval of the combination to treat patients with RCC would put Merck again in competition with rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Opdivo, which is already being used in combination with another Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat kidney cancer. Bristol-Myers was a pioneer in pushing treatments that help the immune system attack tumors and Opdivo looked poised to be a top immuno-oncology treatment. But Keytruda’s sales have surged past Opdivo’s, with Merck expected to sell nearly $10 billion of the drug this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
3.7191701033108844," Merck CEO Frazier to testify at Senate drug pricing hearing NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday that its Chief Executive Ken Frazier plans to testify at a Senate hearing later this month examining rising prescription drug prices. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, ranking member of the committee, on Monday invited executives from seven pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, to testify. The others are AbbVie Inc, AstraZeneca Plc , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc and Sanofi SA. A spokesman from Senator Grassley’s office said on Monday that two of the CEOs have agreed to testify so far, but did not specify from which companies. A Sanofi spokeswoman said the French drugmaker was reviewing Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt’s scheduling to determine if he can attend the hearing. Britain-based AstraZeneca said it was reviewing the request and will respond to the committee. Pfizer, Bristol-Myers, and J&J did not immediately have a statement on the invitation to testify, while AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment. The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world’s most lucrative market for manufacturers. Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January. Last week, the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Finance Committee brought in patient advocates and health policy experts to discuss the burden of high drug costs on consumers. Senators and congressmen have also written to insulin manufacturers requesting information on why its cost has skyrocketed in recent years and how much the companies profit from the life-sustaining diabetes treatment. Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign. Drugmakers have slowed and limited U.S. price increases as scrutiny on their practices has intensified over the past few years. They nonetheless increased prices on hundreds of drugs in January, including a 6.2 percent increase on the world’s top-selling drug - AbbVie’s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira - and hikes on insulin prices by Sanofi and Novo Nordisk."
3.7191701033108844," WHO and vaccine group back 'critical' cervical cancer shots (This Feb. 4 story corrects seventh para to say Merck’s Gardasil vaccine targets nine (not four) strains of HPV) LONDON - A vaccine given to girls to protect them against a virus that causes cervical cancer is a “critical” health tool and access to it should be scaled up as swiftly as possible, especially in poorer countries, cancer experts said on Monday. Figures from the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) showed an estimated 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed worldwide in 2018, making it the fourth most common cancer in women globally. Each year, more than 310,000 women die from cervical cancer, and the vast majority of deaths are in poorer countries where immunization rates against the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes it are low. In wealthy countries, some anti-vaccine campaigners are also persuading parents to refuse the shot for their children, leaving them at risk, IARC said. “Unfounded rumors about HPV vaccines continue to unnecessarily delay or impede the scaling up of vaccination,” IARC’s director Elisabete Weiderpass said in a statement. She said IARC was committed to fighting cervical cancer and “unequivocally confirms the efficacy and safety” of HPV shots. Britain’s GSK makes an HPV vaccine called Cervarix, which targets two strains of the virus, while Merck makes a rival shot, Gardasil, which targets nine strains. In a separate statement addressed to the WHO last week, the GAVI vaccines alliance also urged greater support for HPV shots, saying it aimed to immunize 40 million girls in poorer countries against HPV by 2020. This would avert an estimated 900,000 deaths, GAVI said. IARC said reducing the cost of vaccines in poorer countries would play a vital role in increasing access to them. It said it was working with the generic drugmaker Serum Institute of India to develop an HPV shot that “could provide a high-quality alternative at a lower cost”."

3.7191701033108844," GSK pays up to $4.2 billion for Merck KGaA cancer immunotherapy FRANKFURT (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline bolstered its cancer drug development pipeline on Tuesday, agreeing to pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to Germany’s Merck KGaA for the rights to a next-generation immunotherapy. Merck will receive an upfront payment of 300 million euros for the drug - known as M7824, or bintrafusp alfa - and is eligible for potential payments of up to 500 million euros depending on development milestones in lung cancer, the two companies said in statements on Tuesday. Merck could also get up to a further 2.9 billion euros, depending on commercial milestones, for a total deal value of as much as 3.7 billion euros. Merck will book any future U.S. sales from the product, while GSK will account for sales from other parts of the world. GSK in December moved to bolster its cancer medicines cabinet with the $5.1 billion purchase of Tesaro. Later that month, it unveiled plans to separate its prescription drugs and vaccines business from its over-the-counter products unit under a joint venture deal with Pfizer’s consumer health division. “For GSK, this alliance is a further step in the company’s priority to strengthen its pharmaceuticals pipeline,” it said. The M7824 drug, a fusion protein that triggers two immune responses to cancer cells, is being tested on 10 tumour types and was recently shown to delay the progression of a certain type of lung cancer for at least 9.5 months in half of the trial participants. Merck has already started a mid-stage phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer, comparing M7824 directly with U.S. rival Merck & Co’s Keytruda, currently seen as the most promising cancer immunotherapy on the market with $7.2 billion in 2018 sales. Keytruda is part of a class of immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, which are expected to generate well over $20 billion in combined annual revenues over the next few years. Merck KGaA, which has no ownership ties with Merck & Co, is competing in that class with a drug called Bavencio, jointly developed with Pfizer, but analysts expect the drug to play only a minor commercial role. For M7824, Merck combined Bavencio’s mode of action with another immune response booster known as TGF-beta-inhibtion. “This combination in a single molecule is unique. We don’t know of any other at this time,” said Belen Garijo, the head of Merck’s healthcare division. Deutsche Bank analysts said the trial against Keytruda was the main study to watch. “We expect investors to see the deal as a bold move to build GSK’s late stage oncology pipeline, bringing in an asset with very large potential but with substantial risk,” they wrote in a note. Merck’s shares traded 2.1 percent higher at 1420 GMT, while GSK was up 1.7 percent, both outperforming the 0.7 percent gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index. ($1 = 0.8758 euros)"
3.6680024083095515," Merck's Keytruda tops $2 billion in quarterly sales, shares rise (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s cancer immumotherapy Keytruda compiled sales that topped $2 billion in a quarter for the first time, exceeding Wall Street’s lofty estimates and sending shares up more that 3 percent on Friday. Keytruda has been Merck’s most important growth driver with its domination of the lucrative lung cancer space, and shows no sign of slowing as it produces positive clinical data and adds approvals for different types of cancer. “The key to the Merck story remains continued strong commercial uptake of Keytruda and the release of additional positive clinical data,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. The company also reported slightly higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as Keytruda sales jumped 66 percent to $2.15 billion, compared with analysts’ estimate of $2.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Keytruda has become the drug of choice as an initial, or first-line, treatment of advanced lung cancer, helping it to widen the gap with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s rival drug Opdivo, which had been the early leader among treatments that help the immune system attack tumors. Opdivo had fourth-quarter sales of $1.8 billion. Merck’s Gardasil vaccine to prevent certain types of cancer also had a good quarter with sales up 32 percent to $835 million. The company issued a 2019 earnings forecast with a midpoint a bit below Wall Street estimates, following a trend seen this month among other large drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc, Bristol-Myers and Amgen Inc. But with a focus squarely on Keytruda sales, that did little to dampen investor enthusiasm. Merck shares were up 3.5 percent at $77.05. The New Jersey-based drugmaker forecast 2019 adjusted earnings of $4.57 to $4.72 per share versus analysts’ estimate of $4.68. It forecast full-year revenue of $43.2 billion to $44.7 billion, compared with analysts’ estimate of $44.53 billion. Merck’s Zostavax vaccine to prevent shingles continued to lose significant ground to GSK’s rival Shingrix, with sales falling by more than half to $54 million. Sales of the related diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet dipped 4 percent amid increasing competition to $1.47 billion. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.04 per share, beating analysts’ average expectations by a penny. Merck said it was not in the market for “mega-mergers” such as Bristol’s planned $74 billion purchase of Celgene Corp. “We want to focus on the kind of deals that we can add with a minimum of disruption to our ongoing scientific efforts,” Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said."

8.046325504468975," U.S. Supreme Court could side with Merck over Fosamax lawsuits WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared sympathetic to Merck & Co in its bid to fend off hundreds of lawsuits accusing the company of failing to adequately warn patients of the risks of thigh bone fractures associated with its osteoporosis drug Fosamax. The justices heard arguments in Merck’s appeal of a lower court ruling that revived the lawsuits filed in federal court by patients who said they suffered debilitating bone breaks after taking the drug. Some conservative justices as well as liberal Justice Stephen Breyer emphasized that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had been uncertain about the fracture risk and rejected Merck’s proposal to add a warning label to the medication. The nine-justice court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, must decide whether a pharmaceutical company can be held liable under such circumstances. A ruling for Merck, which is backed by President Donald Trump’s administration in the case, would be a relief for drug companies as it would preserve one of their most powerful defenses against product liability claims by contending they are preempted by the actions of a federal agency under both federal law and the U.S. Constitution. Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. It may increase in the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint, often requiring surgical intervention. Sales of Fosamax, which is also available as a generic drug, totaled $241 million in 2017, according to Merck. Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA denied its proposal to add a warning label to the medication. After a task force further studied the issue, the agency in October 2010 ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning, which Merck did. The plaintiffs said that the FDA rejected only Merck’s proposed language for the warning that focused on stress fractures rather than the more serious fractures they suffered. Breyer, along with conservative justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the plaintiffs’ arguments and stressed the need to be cautious about warnings on drugs. Over-warning, Breyer suggested, can hurt the majority of patients “who can benefit from this medicine.” Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said Merck had a duty to present proper data and relevant warning labels to the FDA instead of letting the agency figure out what to do. “Seems to be sort of turning responsibility on its head,” Sotomayor said. Fosamax users sued New Jersey-based Merck in federal courts alleging the drug caused them to suffer serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000. A federal trial court in New Jersey threw out the cases, but in 2017 the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the claims to proceed to trial, saying that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck’s phrasing of the proposed warning label. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not participate in the oral argument as she continues to recuperate after lung cancer surgery, but will take part in the ruling."

8.046325504468975," Merck loses bid to revive $200 million Gilead verdict at U.S. high court WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a defeat to Merck & Co MRK.N by refusing to hear its appeal of a ruling that it had dishonestly obtained patent rights and could not collect a $200 million verdict against rival drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O in a dispute involving blockbuster hepatitis C drugs. A jury awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Gilead’s Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents, but a judge later ruled the patents unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers. Merck had urged the Supreme Court to place limits on the doctrine of “unclean hands” that can prevent plaintiffs from winning lawsuits if they acted in bad faith. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Injection drug use is among the causes of the infection. Direct-acting anti-viral medications like Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni have revolutionized treatment of hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. Merck holds patents that it has said cover a compound that is the foundation for all major antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C. A federal court jury in San Jose, California awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents. A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling that in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011. The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel. Merck’s litigation against Gilead has included several reversals of fortune. In 2016, a jury in Delaware said Gilead infringed a related patent and ordered it to pay Merck $2.54 billion in royalties, the largest verdict ever in a patent case. But a judge threw out the verdict in February 2018, ruling that Merck’s patent was invalid because it was not sufficiently detailed in its wording."

11.787803746476662," AstraZeneca's ovarian cancer drug gets FDA nod as maintenance treatment Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AstraZeneca Plc’s cancer drug developed along with Merck & Co as a first-line maintenance treatment for adults with a form of ovarian cancer, the companies said on Wednesday. The approval was based on positive results from a late-stage study in which the drug, Lynparza, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 70 percent in patients who have responded to chemotherapy compared to placebo. The FDA decision is shot in the arm for AstraZeneca, which has lost several patents on its older drugs since 2012, wiping out more than half of its sales. Maintenance therapy means prolonged use and likely higher sales for British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which generated $297 million in Lynparza sales last year. The drug, approved in 2014 for later use in patients with BRCA mutations and for a certain type of breast cancer, was the first so-called PARP inhibitor to reach the U.S. market. [nL8N1WV68W Lynparza and other drugs belong to the class of pharmacological inhibitors that are designed to block the DNA repair mechanism of cancer cells so that BRCA-mutated cells fail to replicate and the tumor can no longer sustain itself."
7.273783072502871," Merck bolsters animal health unit with $2.4 billion Antelliq purchase (Reuters) - Merck and Co MRK.N said on Friday it will buy privately held French company Antelliq Group, which makes digital identification products for livestock, for about 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion) to bolster its fast-growing animal health business. The move affirms the drugmaker's commitment to the business, which Wall Street analysts have long seen value in separating just as rival drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N and Pfizer Inc PFE.N did. Pfizer's Zoetis ZTS.N raised $2.2 billion in a 2013 IPO, while Elanco ELAN.N, the former animal health business at Lilly, raised $1.51 billion from an IPO in September. Merck’s Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier had said in October that the company was a “good owner” of its animal health unit. “We believe that we run this business very well inside the company compared to our competitors,” he had said. Merck’s unit has been a big player in the animal health segment, bringing in sales of $3.88 billion in 2017. Zoetis recorded $5.31 billion in revenue, while Elanco brought Lilly $3.09 billion in sales the same year. Merck said Antelliq will be a wholly owned and separately operated subsidiary within its animal health division. Antelliq’s products, which brought in 360 million euros ($406.51 million) in sales in the year ended Sept. 30, provide veterinarians, farmers and pet owners with digital technology that monitors animals and predicts disease in them. These products allow access to real-time, actionable information to help improve livestock management and health outcomes, Merck said in a statement.

5.9948728867031456," Merck raised prices five drugs including Keytruda in November NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Wednesday it raised U.S. prices on five of its drugs earlier in November by between 1.5 percent and 6 percent, including its top-selling cancer treatment Keytruda. The list price increases are the first that the U.S. drugmaker has made since pledging in July that it would not raise the average net price of all of its medicines by more than the inflation rate. Merck raised the price of cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, which is forecast to bring in more than $7 billion in sales this year, by around 1.5 percent. That follows a similar price increase for Keytruda earlier in the year, according to data from Rx Savings Solutions, which collects pricing data to help its customers save money on drugs. It also raised the price of its human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil, which protects against cancers related to the virus, by around 6 percent. Analysts expect Gardasil will generate around $3 billion in sales for Merck this year. It also raised the list price on three other vaccines. “Merck remains committed to responsibly pricing our medicines,” Merck spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said in a statement. “We will continue to evaluate our portfolio of products to look for opportunities to further reduce costs for patients and the health care system.” Eisele said the average net price of Merck’s drugs, including rebates and discounts, fell 1.9 percent in the United States in 2017. The latest increases earlier this month predate a Nov. 16 announcement by rival Pfizer Inc that it would raise prices on 41 of its medicines in January. Many drugmakers, including Pfizer, Roche and Novartis, in July pledged not to raise prices for the remainder of 2018. Pfizer, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, reversed course at the time and decided not to take previously announced price increases on some prescription medicines. Merck in July announced the lowering of list prices of a handful of medicines, including a hepatitis C treatment with a very small market share and six other older drugs with minuscule sales."

7.292997798991937," Merck drug Keytruda succeeds in late-stage esophageal cancer trial (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s blockbuster drug Keytruda met the main goal of a late-stage trial testing the treatment in patients with cancers of the digestive tract, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday. Keytruda, among a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors, is Merck’s top selling drug and has already been approved to treat several forms of cancer including skin and lung cancer. PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors work by blocking a mechanism of tumors that allows them to evade detection by cancer-fighting cells. Keytruda, when compared to chemotherapy, enabled certain patients with esophageal cancer to live longer, helping the drug meet the main goal of the late-stage study, Merck said. “This marks the sixth tumor type where Keytruda has demonstrated a survival benefit, and represents the first time an anti-PD-1 therapy has achieved overall survival for this patient population,” said Roy Baynes, chief medical officer of Merck Research Laboratories. Esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, the company said. Merck said trial results would be presented at an upcoming medical meeting."

5.004814671690472," Merck, Bristol-Myers profits rise on cancer drug sales (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N posted better-than-expected third quarter profit and raised their 2018 earnings forecasts on Thursday due to strong demand for their rival cancer immuno-oncology treatments. But shares of both U.S. drugmakers fell as investors worry about a plan the Trump administration is expected to unveil on Thursday aimed at lowering prices the government’s Medicare healthcare program pays for specialty drugs like cancer treatments. Bristol-Myers pioneered cancer immunotherapy with Yervoy and later its blockbuster drug Opdivo. But Merck & Co's MRK.N rival treatment Keytruda has seized a dominant position in lung cancer - the most lucrative oncology market - and Bristol-Myers' shares have suffered. Keytruda sales exceeded those for Opdivo for the second straight quarter. It has been amassing approvals as a standalone therapy and in combination with other drugs to treat several forms of cancers, and has become the leader in both new patient starts and total patient volume. Keytruda sales rose more than 80 percent to $1.89 billion for the quarter, slightly beating analyst estimates. Bristol’s Opdivo had sales of $1.79 billion, beating analyst estimates by around $100 million. Yervoy also performed better than expected with sales of $382 million in the quarter. Bristol-Myers shares were down 2.4 percent at $47.68 in early trading, while Merck shares fell 2.5 percent to $68.80. Bristol-Myers’ shares had been down 20 percent so far this year, while Merck’s shares were up 25 percent, as each new clinical success for Keytruda weighed on Bristol shares. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said the expected announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump “is a direct shot against the immuno-oncology players.” Merck reported adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 5 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose 4.5 percent to $10.79 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations of $10.88 billion. The company also announced a $10 billion share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent. “Expectations were high coming into the quarter, but we think these results should still be well received and allow for continued confidence,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note. Merck said it plans to spend $16 billion on capital projects through 2022, up from its previous projection of $12 billion, to increase manufacturing capacity in oncology, vaccines and animal health. “We are confident in our future growth prospects,” said Merck Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier, who will remain in the role beyond 2019 after the company scrapped its mandatory retirement age. Merck also saw strong growth from Gardasil, its vaccine to prevent HPV-related cancers. Gardasil sales grew 55 percent to $1.05 billion, helped by increased demand in China and Australia, and its growth should be helped by recently expanded U.S. approval to treat people up to age 45. Bristol-Myers’ said it earned $1.09 a share, excluding special items, topping analysts’ average expectations by 18 cents. Revenue rose 8 percent to $5.69 billion, just shy of Wall Street estimates of $5.72 billion. Sales of blood clot preventer Eliquis, which Bristol shares with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, rose 28 percent from last year to $1.58 billion, but fell short of analyst expectations of $1.67 billion. Bristol-Myers’ effective tax rate was 11.8 percent in the quarter. It now expects a full-year adjusted tax rate of 17 percent, at the bottom end of its previous forecast."

5.004814671690472," Cancer drug Keytruda powers Merck's profit beat, forecast raise (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said on Thursday sales of its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda nearly doubled in the third quarter, helping the drugmaker beat profit estimates and lift its adjusted earnings forecast for the year. The company also announced a $10 billion share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent, pushing its shares up about 1 percent. Keytruda has been amassing approvals as a standalone therapy and in combination with other drugs to treat several forms of cancers. It is the leading immunotherapy for treating lung cancer, ahead of rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY.N, Roche ROG.S and AstraZeneca AZN.L. Sales of Keytruda, which helps the immune system fight cancer, rose 80.4 percent to $1.89 billion from a year earlier and topped estimates of $1.87 billion, according to six analysts polled by Refinitiv. Keytruda sales exceeded those of rival Bristol-Myers Squibb’s drug Opdivo for the second straight quarter. Opdivo brought in sales of $1.79 billion for Bristol in the third quarter. “Expectations were high coming into the quarter but we think these results should still be well received and allow for continued confidence in the story and upside in the stock as we move into fourth quarter,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range $4.30 to $4.36 per share, from its prior view of $4.22 to $4.30. The forecast was largely above analysts’ estimates, according to Refinitiv data. However, Merck narrowed its full-year revenue forecast to between $42.1 billion and $42.7 billion from its previous forecast range of $42 billion to $42.8 billion, to account for a hit from a stronger dollar. Merck reported net income of $1.95 billion, compared with a loss of $56 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. The company had taken a $2.35 billion charge in connection with the formation of a collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L in 2017. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.19 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.14, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose 4.5 percent to $10.79 billion, but missed Wall Street expectation of $10.88 billion.

5.805090024347587," Merck, Pfizer combo treatment meets main goals of kidney cancer trial (Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Thursday a combination treatment of its cancer drug Keytruda and Pfizer Inc’s Inlyta met the main goals of a late-stage study in patients with the most common form of kidney cancer. The combination resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival of the patients and helped patients survive without the cancer worsening, when compared to Pfizer’s kidney cancer drug, Sutent. Keytruda is a blockbuster medicine that targets a blockade of proteins known as PD-1 and is approved for a range of other cancers, including lung cancer. Pfizer’s Inlyta is already approved to treat advanced renal cell cancer in patients who have faced failure of one prior systemic therapy. “This marks the first time that combination treatment with an anti-PD-1 therapy has achieved the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival as first-line therapy (in renal cell cancer patients),” Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories said."

5.955826204724741," Merck's Frazier to remain CEO of the U.S. drugmaker beyond 2019 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier will remain in the role beyond 2019, the drugmaker said on Wednesday, after it scrapped a policy requiring its CEOs to retire at the age of 65. Frazier, who will turn 65 in December 2019, took the helm of the U.S. pharmaceutical company in 2011. On his watch, the company’s stock price has doubled and its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda has raked in blockbuster sales, becoming one of the leading products in a new generation of oncology treatments. “CEO succession has been our top priority, and removing the mandatory retirement policy enables the board to make the best decision concerning the timing of that transition,” Merck’s lead director Leslie Brun said in a statement. A source familiar with the company said the decision to end the policy was initiated by the board, not by Frazier, and gives the company flexibility to run a succession program without a deadline. The source stressed the company’s strong bench of potential in-house CEO successors, including President of Global Human Health Adam Schechter, Chief Financial Officer Rob Davis and others. Frazier made headlines last year when he became the first business leader to leave U.S. President Donald Trump’s now disbanded manufacturing council following Trump’s comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia. The grandson of a sharecropper, and son of a janitor, Frazier’s appointment to CEO in 2011 made him the only black person leading one of the major U.S. or European drugmakers. Frazier made his name at Merck as the company’s general counsel, steering the company through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks. Merck eventually paid nearly $5 billion to settle some 27,000 lawsuits brought by those who claimed to have been harmed by the popular arthritis treatment. As chief executive, Frazier has focused the company around the development Keytruda, which has racked up approvals to treat numerous types of cancer, including lung cancer. Analysts expect annual Keytruda sales to reach nearly $11 billion by 2020 and keep climbing from there, according to Thomson Reuters data. Merck also announced price cuts for some of its medicines in July, after Trump criticized drugmakers for failing to help reduce healthcare costs for consumers. Merck’s shares fell 31 cents to $70.34 on Wednesday."

12.058994855173411," Merck's Keytruda clocks up new win as EU approves chemo cocktail LONDON (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s key cancer drug Keytruda has been approved for use in Europe in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients, marking a further advance for the product after uncertainty about its EU prospects a year ago. Keytruda is the first such immunotherapy medicine to be approved in Europe for first-line use with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market with first-line approval providing access to the most patients. Merck said on Monday that the green light from the European Commission allowed marketing of the combination in all 28 European Union (EU) member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The Keytruda/chemo combination is already approved in the United States. But last October the U.S. drugmaker withdrew an application for European approval, casting doubt over its prospects in the region. Since then, however, the company has produced further clinical data showing the benefits of the combination. Keytruda has taken a leading position among immunotherapies for the treatment of lung cancer, ahead of rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca."

The drugs have been approved to treat adults with the most common strain of the virus, HIV-1, and target patients who have received no prior antiretroviral treatment, Merck said. Delstrigo, a once-a-day combination tablet, has been approved with a boxed warning, the agency’s strictest, to flag risk of worsening hepatitis B infection. Pifeltro, the second drug, is an oral medicine to be administered in combination with other antiretrovirals, Merck said. Merck said it expects to stock both the treatments through wholesalers within a month. More than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million have died since the beginning of the epidemic, according to the World Health Organization. There is no vaccine to prevent HIV/AIDS with current treatments only helping patients to manage the disease. However, the fast-mutating virus has proved a challenge to the medical community as it often develops resistance to existing medicines. Gilead Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline have dominated the market for HIV/AIDS treatments and sell therapies that generate billions of dollars."

The 12-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the bempedoic acid-ezetimibe combination pill compared with bempedoic acid, ezetimibe or placebo in 382 high-risk patients. It showed a 35 percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or bad cholesterol, for the combination pill compared to a 3 percent for placebo, 24 percent for Zetia or ezetimibe, and 20 percent for bempedoic acid. “This combo pill fills a market need that is there ... results are really compelling,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Mayleben said in a conference call. Esperion said the combo therapy could be the first-ever treatment capable of reducing LDL-C levels as well as the risk of cardiovascular disease. The company plans to submit U.S. marketing application for the treatment by the first quarter of 2019. The combo pill also met secondary goals, including lowering of total cholesterol compared with placebo, ezetimibe and bempedoic acid taken separately. In March, the company said patients taking bempedoic acid in addition to Amgen’s Repatha saw a reduction in LDL-C levels by 30 percent in another study. Repatha belongs to a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors, which block a protein that stops low-density lipoprotein from being removed from the blood. Esperion’s once-daily combo oral pill will “resonate better” with high-risk patients than PCSK9s as the company’s therapy is expected to be cheaper, Chief Commercial Officer Mark Glickman said in a conference call.

The drug was approved as the first therapy in over a decade in the United States to treat previously untreated patients with an advanced or intermediate stage of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). “The price at which the recommended starting dose of Lenvima for unresectable HCC will be sold to wholesalers, excluding discounts, is $16,970 for a 30-day supply,” Eisai told Reuters. The price will be “in parity” with the prices of available doses, Chief Operating Officer Shaji Procida said. The health regulator’s decision also marks the first U.S. approval born of Eisai’s drug development collaboration with Merck & Co Inc. Under a deal here signed in March, the companies agreed to split profits from global sales of Lenvima, even for already-approved uses in thyroid cancer and in combination with another drug for kidney cancer. Lenvima is expected to bring in revenue of $3.46 billion by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data. The latest approval here by the FDA also bodes well for Merck as investors remain concerned about its increasing reliance on blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda.

Much before Lilly LLY.N moved to take its animal health business public, bigger rival Pfizer Inc PFE.N had done the same with Zoetis Inc ZTS.N five years ago and since then its market value has tripled. “Many investors had hoped that Lilly’s recent announcement would have been the final tipping point to cause Merck to do the same,” Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF, said.

16.531216790687402," Merck lowers prices of some drugs after Trump calls out industry (Reuters) - Merck & Co on Thursday announced price cuts to some of its medicines, including a 60 percent reduction to a hepatitis C treatment, after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized drugmakers for failing to help reduce healthcare costs for consumers. Amid heightened political scrutiny over the high cost of prescription medicines and promises by Trump that drug price reductions were coming, New Jersey-based Merck became the first major drugmaker to announce voluntary price decreases. In addition to slashing the price of Zepatier, which owns a very small share of the hepatitis market, Merck said it would lower the list price by 10 percent of six other older drugs with minuscule sales. It also said it would not increase the average net price of other medicines in its portfolio of products by more than the inflation rate annually. While that sounds like a substantial commitment, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat noted that it does not amount to a significant change and “technically leaves the room open for increases where it would like to.” “If we look back at Merck’s ‘net price increase’ across portfolio in 2017, it was already meeting the criteria that Merck outlined today.” he said. Zepatier had total U.S. sales of $771 million in 2017. Merck’s overall annual sales exceed $40 billion. Its most important product, the cancer drug Keytruda, lists for about $150,000 a year. Trump, who has vowed to help reduce the cost of prescription drugs to consumers, expressed anger at drugmakers over planned price hikes. In a tweet on July 9, he said they “should be ashamed” and that his administration would respond. Under direct pressure from Trump, Pfizer Inc, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said it would delay July 1 price increases until the end of the year or until the president’s blueprint for lowering drug costs goes into effect. Swiss drugmaker Novartis followed this week, saying it would not raise prices in the United States for the rest of the year. Although Pfizer and Novartis only promised delays to price hikes, Trump said they decided to not increase prices. He has not yet commented on Merck’s announcement. “This decision (by Merck) is a response to President Trump’s blueprint and reflects the industry’s understanding that the President is serious about bringing change to our drug markets,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. Trump made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue. In May, he unveiled a “blueprint” to lower drug prices that appeared to largely spare drugmakers and instead took aim at “middlemen,” such as health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers, which demand hefty rebates in exchange for broad access to patients. Pharmaceutical company stocks rose after the blueprint was announced. The cost of healthcare is expected to be a major campaign issue ahead of November midterm elections, with control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, both currently controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, potentially up for grabs."

18.447799032573617," U.S. Supreme Court to hear Merck appeal over Fosamax suits WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear Merck & Co’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that revived hundreds of lawsuits accusing the company of failing to adequately warn patients of the risks of thigh bone fractures associated with its osteoporosis drug Fosamax. At issue in the case is whether a pharmaceutical company can be held liable for failing to warn about a health risk associated with its drug when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the company’s proposal to add a warning label to the medication about the risk. Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. Conversely, it may increase the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint. Sales of Fosamax, which is also available as a generic drug, totaled $241 million in 2017, according to Merck. Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA rejected its proposal to add a warning label to the medication, according to court papers. After further study of the issue, the agency ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning in October 2010, which Merck did the following January. Hundreds of Fosamax users sued New Jersey-based Merck alleging the drug caused them to suffer serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000. Merck tried to have the cases thrown out, arguing that the FDA’s rejection of its proposed warning label should preempt the lawsuits. A federal trial court in New Jersey sided with Merck, but in March 2017, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the claims to proceed to trial, saying that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck’s phrasing of the proposed warning label and might have approved “a properly worded warning” about Fosamax. Backed by President Donald Trump’s administration, Merck asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, saying the appeals court ruling puts drug companies in an impossible position. “Even if they cooperate with the FDA, share their safety data, and follow the agency’s direction to ‘hold off’ on adding label warnings, they still cannot escape costly, burdensome tort litigation complaining about those labels,” Merck said. (Corrects paragraph 8 to show lower court ruling was in March 2017, instead of March 2018)"

18.908701607997745," AstraZeneca, Merck eye $1 billion boost from cancer drug success LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca's AZN.L oncology business received a boost on Wednesday as results of a clinical trial showed its drug Lynparza helped women with ovarian cancer live longer without their disease worsening when given as a first-line treatment. The result should pave the way for expanded use of the medicine, which is being developed and marketed with Merck & Co MRK.N under a deal struck last year. Analysts said first-line use could boost Lynparza sales by more than $1 billion a year, although experts will first want to see the scale of the clinical benefit when full results are presented at a medical meeting. The two companies did not say where they planned to present the data but one obvious venue would be the ESMO cancer congress in Munich in October. Lynparza is already approved for later use in patients with so-called BRCA genetic mutations. Its latest success could expand the number of women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer who are suitable for the drug by 30-50 percent, AstraZeneca believes. Lynparza - abandoned at one stage by AstraZeneca but revived by CEO Pascal Soriot when he took over in 2012 - became the first drug in a class known as PARP inhibitors to reach the market when it won U.S. approval at the end of 2014. It now faces competition from rival products made by Tesaro TSRO.O and Clovis Oncology CLVS.O. Based on the strong results seen in the latest Phase III study, known as SOLO-1, AstraZeneca and Merck said they would talk to regulators about approving the earlier use of the medicine in women with BRCA mutations, which can drive tumor growth. “It is the first time that we see a significant and clinically impactful improvement in progression-free survival in the first-line maintenance setting for women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer treated with a PARP inhibitor,” said Sean Bohen, chief medical officer at AstraZeneca. Deutsche Bank analysts said this could represent around a $1 billion incremental sales opportunity for the drug, on top of its existing approved second- and third-line use, while Jefferies put it at $1.6 billion. A spokeswoman said AstraZeneca viewed competitors as 18 months behind in generating similar clinical data. The closest rival is Tesaro, which is expected to report first-line ovarian cancer results next year."

17.007371625729416," Novo's pioneering diabetes pill beats Victoza, Januvia in tests COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk’s experimental diabetes pill, which it hopes will transform the diabetes market, has proved superior to both Merck & Co’s Januvia and its own best-selling injectable treatment Victoza in tests. The positive results in the latest of a series of pivotal clinical trials boost analysts’ expectations that Novo’s oral semaglutide medicine could become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. Novo shares jumped more than 4 percent in early trade on Thursday. The trial against Victoza, a once-daily injection, met the primary endpoint of similar blood sugar reduction but was also superior on weight loss, Novo said in a statement late on Wednesday. “This data is important, as it positions oral-sema as at least as good as the market leading injectable GLP-1,” said Deutsche Bank analysts. The once-daily pill belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production, the first of which were derived from the venomous bite of North America’s Gila monster lizard. So far, all have been injections. Deutsche believes oral semaglutide could eventually sell more than $5 billion a year and allow Novo to grow sales in the high-margin GLP-1 diabetes segment for years to come, with the new product potentially priced closer to expensive injections than cheaper diabetes pills. Analysts from Bernstein also said the outcome was stronger than anticipated. The outcome of the trial against Merck’s Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin, showed Novo’s new drug was superior in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight, Novo said. The success of oral semaglutide in the Phase III trials is a fillip for a medicine seen as important for ensuring the group’s long-term growth in a highly competitive diabetes market. It follows earlier results from other Phase III studies that have also been positive."
10.408134256984177," Merck's Keytruda shows promise in treating advanced melanoma (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Monday long-term data from its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda showed promise in treating advanced melanoma patients, a day after announcing positive lung cancer data from the same treatment. The drug stopped the progression of advanced melanoma in nearly 90 percent of patients who had taken it for two years, Merck said, adding that the findings were from a new analysis of four-year data of a late-stage study. The data also showed that 41.7 percent of patients survived for four years, compared with a survival rate of 36.4 percent in patients taking Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy, Merck said. On Sunday, Merck released data that showed Keytruda improved survival as a stand-alone treatment for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and with chemotherapy for hard-to-treat squamous cell lung cancer, further cementing the company’s lead in the most lucrative oncology market. Keytruda already has U.S. approval for treatment of certain types of lung cancer, gastric cancer and other forms of the disease and competes with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo. The data is being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago."
10.408134256984177," Merck's Keytruda extends lung cancer survival in two trials CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda improved survival as a stand-alone treatment for newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients and with chemotherapy for hard-to-treat squamous cell lung cancer, new data released on Sunday showed, further cementing the company’s lead in the most lucrative oncology market. Keytruda is competing with drugs from Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and others that also unleash the body’s immune system to attack tumors for dominance in lung cancer. They have racked up approvals for a variety of cancers, but newly-diagnosed lung cancer is seen as the biggest commercial opportunity. The new results, presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, add to the view that Keytruda has “set the floor against which other therapies will need to be compared,” Roy Baynes, head of clinical development at Merck, told Reuters. One trial studied 1,274 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who tested positive for the PDL1 protein targeted by Keytruda to see if they could avoid chemotherapy. Overall, Keytruda patients lived for a median of 16.7 months, compared with 12.1 months for patients on chemotherapy. But patient outcomes were linked to the biomarker. Keytruda patients with PDL1 levels above 50 percent lived for a median of 20 months, compared with 12.2 months for chemotherapy. “This is a true milestone for the field,” said Dr. John Heymach, an ASCO expert from Houston’s MD Anderson Cancer Center who was not involved in the trial. “The era in which chemotherapy is the only option for non-small cell lung cancer patients is drawing to a close.” Keytruda already has U.S. approval for use in combination with chemotherapy as an initial treatment for non-squamous NSCLC. It is also approved as a stand-alone treatment for lung cancer patients whose tumors have high PDL1 levels. Merck said it is not yet clear whether Keytruda combined with chemotherapy is better than Keytruda alone in patients who express PDL1. Since much of the benefit in the latest trial was seen in patients with high PDL1 levels, the opportunity for Keytruda alone for lung cancer “may be of less significance commercially,” Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said in a research note. Severe side effects, including lung inflammation, occurred in 18 percent of Keytruda patients, compared with 41 percent of chemotherapy patients. “Not only are patients living longer ... but they are also receiving a treatment that has substantially less toxicity,” Dr. Heymach said. For more ASCO coverage see: here. Researchers also presented results from a separate trial of Keytruda in patients with late-stage squamous cell NSCLC, which accounts for about 30 percent of lung cancer and is considered particularly difficult to treat. The 559-patient trial found patients given Keytruda plus chemotherapy lived for a median of 15.9 months, compared with 11.3 months for chemotherapy alone. Merck said Keytruda trial patients lived for a median of 6.4 months before their disease worsened, compared with 4.8 months for the chemotherapy-alone group. In a trial presented at the meeting on Saturday, Roche’s rival immune therapy, Tecentriq, combined with chemotherapy delayed progression of squamous NSCLC by 6.3 months compared with 5.6 months for a standard chemotherapy combination. Survival results for the Roche trial were not yet available. In its squamous lung cancer trial, Merck said serious side effects, including anemia and nausea, were seen in 69.8 percent on patients on Keytruda versus 68.2 percent for chemotherapy alone."

18.73590522712268," Roche, chasing Merck, notches another lung cancer win ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s bid to keep Merck’s cancer blockbuster Keytruda within striking distance got a lift on Tuesday when the Swiss drugmaker said its immunotherapy Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapy boosted lung cancer patients’ survival. Its phase III IMpower130 study, one of eight trials it has going against lung cancer that rely on Tecentriq, met goals of boosting overall survival and progression-free survival in the initial treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to chemotherapy alone, Roche said. This is the third late-stage study of Tecentriq alone or in a cocktail to show an overall survival benefit for people with NSCLC, Roche said. Roche’s third-to-market drug after Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo has just a fraction of their sales. Roche is under pressure to see as many trials succeed as possible because Tecentriq is central to its strategy to replace falling revenue from older, off-patent medicines. “The results of the IMpower130 study add to the growing evidence showing the clinical benefit of Tecentriq-based combinations in the treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,” Roche Chief Medical Officer Sandra Horning said. Analysts remain sceptical about Tecentriq’s prospects of displacing Keytruda. [nL3N1SU48D] “Merck’s Keytruda has shown similar success and now has four pivotal trial wins in this disease, and has established a clear lead,” said Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell, who sees peak annual Tecentriq sales of $4 billion. Detailed IMpower 130 results are not due until later this year, possibly in September at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer conference in Toronto or October’s European Society for Medical Oncology in Munich. Given that, it “is still very difficult to interpret how Tecentriq stacks up against competitors”, said Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race. Race sees $4.7 billion in Tecentriq sales by 2022 but has a “hold” rating on Roche shares for fear biosimilar copies of Roche’s older cancer medicines will limit the company’s growth. Rituxan is already being hammered by copies in Europe. The patent clock is also ticking on Herceptin and Avastin, putting $21 billion in annual revenue at risk by 2020. In the first quarter, Tecentriq posted revenue of 139 million Swiss francs ($138.9 million), a tenth of Keytruda and Opdivo revenue. [nL8N1S30TG] It is already approved to treat bladder cancer and lung cancer where other treatments have failed. Still, Roche remains optimistic Tecentriq trials will carve out a place for the drug as an essential part of lung cancer treatment. It is holding out hope to beat rivals to market in first-line treatment of small cell and squamous cell lung cancer. [nL8N1SE0KT] Roche stock fell 0.3 percent by 1100 GMT, just less than the Stoxx Europe healthcare index’s decline."
17.463267782234198," Merck's cancer drug Keytruda notches another trial success (Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Wednesday its drug Keytruda helped patients with a certain type of lung cancer live longer and prevented the disease from spreading, helping to solidify its position in the lucrative cancer market. Keytruda, already approved for other types of cancer, is being studied in a late-stage trial as a first-line treatment, in combination with chemotherapy, for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sNSCLC) patients. Merck said the combination therapy met its main trial goals when compared to patients who were on chemotherapy alone, according to an interim analysis. The company’s shares were up 1 percent at $59.04 in midday trading. Earlier this month, Merck reported data from an interim analysis of the trial that met a secondary goal of overall response rate, or the portion of patients with a reduction in tumor size. Merck had submitted a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the sNSCLC indication recently. “We doubted that Merck would submit the study for FDA approval based on overall response rate if it did not have confidence in the primary endpoints,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei. Analysts were looking for the latest data to support the company’s application for an expanded approval. Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse said, “We already knew Keytruda showed a benefit on overall response rate, but prolonging survival is obviously what matters.” Credit Suisse estimates that the areas in which Keytruda has now shown positive data represent a market opportunity of $6.6 billion in first-line non-small cell lung cancer in the United States. Keytruda is the only immunotherapy approved in the United States to treat lung cancer patients who have not received prior treatment. Merck has been expanding its position into the lung cancer market through Keytruda. Also jockeying for a piece of the lucrative market are drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca, which are advancing their rival immunotherapies. Merck said the new data will be shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of its push to expand the drug’s label, and would be presented at an upcoming medical conference, the company said."

16.12066157870417," Merck's Keytruda boosts response in hard-to-treat lung cancer (Reuters) - The combination of Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda and chemotherapy boosted response rates in patients with advanced hard-to-treat squamous cell lung cancer, the company said on Wednesday. An early look at results of a 204-patient trial showed an overall response rate of 58.4 percent for newly-diagnosed patients given Keytruda plus carboplatin and paclitaxel or Celgene Corp’s Abraxane. That compared to 35 percent for chemotherapy alone. The interim results will be discussed in greater detail next month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), where data from several Keytruda trials and other therapies that help the immune system fight cancer will be presented. Data on a rival Roche drug from a similar squamous cell lung cancer trial will be featured at the meeting. The duration of response was more than six months in 65.8 percent of patients given the Keytruda regimen compared with 45.6 percent of those who received chemotherapy alone, Merck said. Serious side effects were seen in 64.4 percent of Keytruda patients and 74.5 percent of patients given just chemotherapy. Keytruda is the only immunotherapy approved in the United States to treat lung cancer patients who have not received prior treatment. That approval is for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease. Squamous cell, a type of NSCLC, accounts for about 30 percent of all lung cancers, according to the American Cancer Society.

15.486726907188237," Merck KGaA family says unreservedly behind the pharma unit DARMSTADT, Germany (Reuters) - The family behind Germany’s Merck KGaA said it was fully committed to the diversified group’s pharmaceuticals unit, even if cancer immunotherapy hopeful avelumab does not achieve blockbuster sales. “Pharma is one of our three pillars and we absolutely stand behind it. If avelumab doesn’t become a blockbuster there are enough highly interesting products in our pipeline,” said family representative Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, speaking at an event marking the group’s 350-year anniversary at its Darmstadt, Germany headquarters. Blockbuster is the industry term for a drug with more than $1 billion in annual sales, but analysts on average do not expect avelumab, branded as Bavencio, to reach that status. Trial results have been mixed and it faces tough competition in a class of drugs dominated by Merck & Co’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo. Merck, which is developing avelumab in an alliance with Pfizer, is in intense negotiations with prospective partners for other promising experimental drugs in its pipeline. The Merck family, which holds 70 percent of the shares, have pursued a diversified approach, with the group’s activities ranging from liquid crystals for flat screens and pearlescent pigments to fertility drugs and lab equipment. At 7 billion euros ($8.4 billion) in 2017 healthcare revenues - including allergy treatments and a consumer care unit it is selling - Merck does not make the top 20 list of global pharma majors. Stangenberg-Haverkamp is one of two leading representatives of the roughly 150 family members that have voting rights in the family holding. ($1 = 0.8342 euros)"

13.825661666237913," Keytruda sales power Merck to quarterly beat (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co MRK.N reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by a more than 150 percent rise in sales of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda. Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $57.22, however, on investor concerns that the company is becoming increasingly reliant on the drug, which is positioned to become the leading player in a new generation of oncology treatments. Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the company said it does not plan to spin off its animal health business or do a large, transformational deal. “While Keytruda continues to do fantastically well, investors are still clamoring for something else besides Keytruda to focus on – thus the push by investors to spin out animal health, and the continual probing about M&A,” Jefferies analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The surge in Keytruda sales more than offset steep declines in sales for its shingles vaccine Zostavax and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda had sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of $1.40 billion estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Keytruda's sales have nearly pulled even with Bristol-Myers Squibb's BMY.N rival drug Opdivo, which also harnesses the body's immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells. Industry experts give Merck's drug the edge after results from trials for both treatments last month, and Merck said on Tuesday the drug could be its largest seller ever. Revenue from the drug accounted for nearly 15 percent of Merck’s sales. Merck CEO Ken Frazier said on the company’s conference call that while the company did not expect to do transformational deals, it was looking for opportunities to enhance its drug pipeline. “We have a strong balance sheet. We have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage, and we’re going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth,” he said. Merck raised its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to $4.16 to $4.28 per share from its previous forecast of $4.08 to $4.23 per share. Net income fell 52.5 percent to $736 million, or 27 cents per share, hurt by a $1.4-billion charge related to a collaboration with Eisai Co Ltd, the company said. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.05 per share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1 per share. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $10.04 billion but missed estimates of $10.11 billion."

8.986058140975306," U.S. court upholds dismissal of $200 million Merck verdict against Gilead (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday affirmed a ruling that pharmaceutical company Merck & Co dishonestly obtained patent rights and was not entitled to collect a $200 million infringement verdict it won against rival Gilead Sciences Inc. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers. A Gilead spokesman said the company was very pleased with the ruling and believe it was “justified and well supported by the record.” A Merck spokeswoman said in a statement that the ruling “does not reflect the facts of the case” and that the company was reviewing its next steps. Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment of Hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure. A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents. A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company’s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011. The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel. Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no “deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.” But the appeals court said in Wednesday’s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were “tainted” by misconduct and should not be enforceable. In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs. The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck’s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation."

7.542569232439231," Survival data boosts Merck's Keytruda lead in lung cancer NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in newly-diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a closely-watched study, cementing its lead position over Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and others in the most lucrative oncology market. The survival data sent Merck shares up 2.2 percent to $58.47, while shares of Bristol-Myers plunged 8.4 percent to $53.68 despite positive lung cancer data for its immunotherapy combination in a subset of patients with a high degree of tumor mutations. The magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, but Keytruda plus chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy alone, according to data presented at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Chicago on Monday. “The Merck data is pretty much a home run,” said Dr. Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study. “The whole idea (of immunotherapy) would be to avoid chemotherapy. But it works. It’s amazing that we’re going to be bringing these drugs to the majority of patients with lung cancer in the first-line setting,” Herbst added. “Why would you wait and not give someone immunotherapy up front?” Bristol-Myers’s combination therapy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB), a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. But overall survival is considered the gold standard by doctors and investors, giving Keytruda a clear leg up. The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced NSCLC patients based on earlier data from a small study. But many clinicians wanted to see validation of a survival benefit in a large trial. “We were all waiting to see a definitive Phase III study that showed very clear cut results,” said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study’s primary investigator and director of thoracic medical oncology at NYU Langone in New York. Keytruda and Opdivo have piled up approvals for advanced cancers, such as for melanoma and bladder cancer. But those drugs and rival immunotherapies from Roche and AstraZeneca are jockeying for pieces of the largest lung cancer market, especially the coveted newly-diagnosed setting. There are more than 200,000 new cases of NSCLC each year in the United States alone, with about half at advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis. In the Merck-sponsored trial of more than 600 patients called Keynote-189, median overall survival was 11.3 months for chemotherapy, about what was expected. After 12 months, 69.2 percent of patients in the Keytruda group were alive compared with 49.4 percent for chemotherapy, researchers reported. “We don’t know how long their survival is going to be and we’re excited about that,” said Gandhi. The differences would likely have been more pronounced, but many patients in the chemotherapy group were given Keytruda or a similar drug once their disease progressed. Keytruda, with a list price of about $13,500 a month before discounts or rebates, was given every three weeks with a standard chemotherapy regimen. It can be given for up to 24 months for those without disease progression, Merck said. Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, called both trials “incredibly important studies.” “I worry about cost. A lot of people won’t be able to afford these drugs,” Brawley said. There was a small increase in acute kidney injury in the Keytruda group compared with chemotherapy alone. There were also three treatment-related deaths from pneumonitis among Keytruda patients. In the study called CheckMate-227, 43 percent of patients with high TMB who received Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy experienced no disease progression after one year versus 13 percent in the chemotherapy group. There was preliminary evidence of a likely survival benefit but it was too early to determine that, researchers said. The overall response rate - those with significant tumor shrinkage - was 45 percent for the immunotherapies versus 27 percent for chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, and others said it was a validation of the TMB biomarker. “Maybe we can look at the TMB and it can further personalize therapy,” said Herbst. In both studies, positive results were not dependent on cancer cell’s levels of PD-L1, a marker of inflammation that has been commonly used with drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo to help predict patient responses, with higher PD-L1 levels believed to lead to greater efficacy. “This is great that there’s new options and improved outcomes” for patients with lung cancer, Hellman said."

While magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, the Keytruda combination cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy and significantly delayed disease worsening, according to data presented on Monday. “This study showed a clear difference in long-term outcomes,” said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study’s primary investigator, who called the results “practice changing.” In another closely-watched study, a combination of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients whose tumors had a high number of genetic mutations. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy.

Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, said it was a validation of TMB as a biomarker and that Opdivo with Yervoy should be an important chemotherapy-sparing regimen in first-line lung cancer. “This is great that there’s new options and improved outcomes,” Hellman said of the two studies. “That’s tremendous progress for patients with lung cancer.” (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Diane Craft)"
