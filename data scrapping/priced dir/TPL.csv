Three additional members will also join the committee and it will complete the task by the end of 2019 , the company said. Texas Pacific had earlier filed a lawsuit against the investor group’s trustee candidate, Eric Oliver, alleging that he “made material misstatements and failed to disclose material information relevant to shareholders.”"
