15.616278206178544," Elliott, Fidelity pump $1.4 billion into utility CenterPoint Energy BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - CenterPoint Energy on Thursday secured $1.4 billion of new backing from investors including hedge fund Elliott Management and mutual fund Fidelity Management, putting the embattled energy delivery company on a path to cutting its debt and considering a possible sale. The investment in the Houston-based utility operator is made up of $725 million of mandatory convertible preferred shares, financed by Elliott and Bluescape Energy Partners, with an additional $675 million in common shares bought by Fidelity and other long-term investors. They are MFS Investment Management and Capital Group, a source familiar with the matter said. The financing will allow CenterPoint Energy to pay back debt and strengthen its credit profile as well as eliminate the need to raise new equity by 2022, the company and the firms said in a statement. CenterPoint’s stock jumped more than 12% on the news by midday, giving it a market value of $9 billion. The company had long-term debt of $13.8 billion as of Mar. 31. It has been a turbulent period for CenterPoint. Chief Executive Scott Prochazka departed his role in February, weeks after the company’s request to increase rates was rejected by the Public Utility Commission of Texas which imposed a smaller uplift. The suboptimal rate case decision was seen as a surprise by analysts at the time. Chief Financial Officer Xia Liu left the company in April. Alongside the cash, the deal with the investors sees two new directors added to CenterPoint’s board who have deep roots in the energy and public utilities businesses and vast connections in Texas: former Halliburton Chief Executive David Lesar and Barry Smitherman, a former chairman of regulatory bodies the Texas Railroad Commission and the PUCT. The two will also sit on a new committee that will review strategic alternatives for CenterPoint, alongside interim CEO John Somerhalder and two other directors. The body, due to report back to the CenterPoint board by October, will look at scenarios including the sale of parts of CenterPoint’s business or the entire company, the source added. Should sale activity follow, it wouldn’t be the first time that Elliott has entered a utility’s stock and that has been the outcome: Midwestern utility Evergy Inc said in March it would explore options including a merger as part of an agreement struck with Elliott. The U.S. utility space has also seen regulated companies offload unregulated parts of their businesses to focus on their core operations, which have more stable revenue streams. Earlier this year, CenterPoint announced it would sell two of its services units for $850 million. While the company is running a process to identify a full-time CEO, the new group may also opt to stick with Somerhalder, the interim CEO, for the time, especially if a potential sale is in the offing, the source added. Advisors as disclosed by the company were Moelis, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Law firms Wachtell and Baker Botts worked with CenterPoint, and Ropes & Gray were the legal advisor to Elliott."

-23.112650504110093," CenterPoint Energy sets targets to cut emissions (Reuters) - U.S. power producer CenterPoint Energy Inc said on Monday that it had set a target to cut emissions related to its operations by 70% by 2035 under its new carbon policy. The Houston, Texas-based company also said it would cut its emissions related to natural gas usage in heating, appliances and equipment within the residential and commercial sectors by 20% to 30% by 2040. Energy companies around the globe are announcing carbon emission reduction goals as investor pressure over climate change mount. To achieve its goals, CenterPoint will focus on continuing to develop alternative fuel programs and collaborate with suppliers to lower methane emissions. The company said it was investing in renewable forms of energy and would partner with natural gas suppliers to take steps to lower their methane emissions across the natural gas value chain."
-43.92811573192569," CenterPoint Energy seeks to sell non-utility services units: sources (Reuters) - CenterPoint Energy Inc CNP.N is exploring the sale of two services units that could fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as the U.S. power utility seeks to raise capital and simplify its structure. The divestitures could compensate for a regulator’s refusal to grant CenterPoint its desired rate increase for what it charges to deliver electricity to energy providers in Houston. Last month, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) said CenterPoint would be allowed to earn a 9.25% return on equity, lower than the 10.5% return which the company had requested. The regulator wanted to make sure that consumer bills did not soar and that the utility continued to invest in its network. CenterPoint had been working with advisers on an auction for the services businesses even before the PUCT’s decision, the sources said, cautioning that no deal is certain and asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. CenterPoint, which has a market value of $13 billion and net long-term debt of $14 billion, did not respond to a request for comment. Headquartered in Houston, CenterPoint serves more than 7 million electricity and gas metered customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. In February, it completed the $6 billion acquisition of peer Vectren Corp. CenterPoint is seeking to sell its energy services business, which provides advice to municipalities and companies on how to best source their gas supply, as well as its infrastructure services unit, which helps utilities plan and maintain gas pipes. A number of U.S. utilities have in recent years sold off unregulated parts of their businesses to focus on their regulated operations, which have more stable revenue streams."

7.702522204119208," Utility CenterPoint Energy to buy Vectren in $6 billion deal (Reuters) - U.S. gas and electric utility CenterPoint Energy CNP.N said on Monday it would buy rival Vectren Corp VVC.N for about $6 billion, the latest in a string of mergers in the sector as power consumption in many parts of the country flattens. The deal adds about 1.45 million customers across Indiana and Ohio. CenterPoint already serves customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Consumers, companies and local governments are becoming more energy efficient and adopting conservation measures, resulting in a drop in consumption as well as prices. That has hit margins across the sector, leading a handful of companies to merge to cut costs and streamline operations. Shares of CenterPoint, which is funding the deal using debt and equity, closed 2.8 percent lower at $25.94. Vectren was up 7.3 percent at $70.31, below CenterPoint’s offer price of $72 a share. CenterPoint’s offer represents a premium of nearly 10 percent to Vectren’s Friday close. “There’s a perception out there ... that CenterPoint overpaid for Vectren,” utilities analyst Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Securities said, adding that there was “not a lot of accretion assigned to the deal”. CenterPoint said it would continue to target earnings per share growth of 5-7 percent in 2019 and 2020 following the deal, which is expected to close in the first-quarter next year. The newly formed company is expected to have electric and natural gas delivery operations in eight states with assets totaling $29 billion, the companies said in a statement. CenterPoint Energy will also assume all outstanding Vectren net debt. Reuters reported earlier on Sunday that both companies were nearing a deal."

7.702522204119208," Exclusive: CenterPoint Energy nears deal to acquire Vectren - sources (Reuters) - U.S. regional gas and electric utility CenterPoint Energy Inc is nearing a deal to acquire peer Vectren Corp, three people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The acquisition would expand CenterPoint’s reach beyond the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas to Vectren’s core markets of Indiana and Ohio, diversifying its customer base and giving it more scale. The exact price the companies were negotiating could not be learned, but the deal is expected to be at a premium to Vectren’s market capitalization of $5.4 billion, the sources said. The deal could be announced as early as Monday, although it is always possible that talks fall apart at the last minute, the sources added. CenterPoint and Vectren did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The deal would illustrate how the U.S. power utility sector continues to consolidate, as consumption in many parts of the country flattens. An expanding population and growing economic activity are more than offset by energy efficiency and conservation measures taken by consumers, companies and local governments. Other U.S. utility deals announced in the last 12 months include San Diego-based Sempra Energy’s $9.45 billion acquisition of Oncor of Texas, and Canada’s Hydro One Ltd buying Spokane, Washington-based Avista Corp for C$6.7 billion ($5.3 billion). Headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, Vectren provides gas and electricity to more than 1 million customers in nearly two-thirds of Indiana and about a fifth of Ohio. Based in Houston, CenterPoint serves more than 5 million metered customers, primarily in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. It has a market capitalization of $11.5 billion."
